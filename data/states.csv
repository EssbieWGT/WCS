They left Oct. 26 from their Huong Dao Vipassana Bhavana Center. 
And on Friday — Day 41 of their sojourn —  the monks and their dog, Aloka, crossed the Mississippi River on the Natchez-Vidalia Bridge from Louisiana into Mississippi, where they were greeted by a small group of locals.
“We walk not in protest, but to remind Americans that peace is not a destination. It is a practice. And that peace resides within each of us,” Bhikkhu Pannakara, spiritual leader of the Walk for Peace, said in Natchez.
“The walk is a reminder that unity and kindness begins within each of us and can radiate outward to communities, families and society as a whole,” he said.

How can society police the global spread of online far-right extremism while still protecting free speech? That’s a question policymakers and watchdog organizations confronted as early as the 1980s and ’90s – and it hasn’t gone away.
Decades before artificial intelligence, Telegram and white nationalist Nick Fuentes’ livestreams, far-right extremists embraced the early days of home computing and the internet. These new technologies offered them a bastion of free speech and a global platform. They could share propaganda, spew hatred, incite violence and gain international followers like never before.
Before the digital era, far-right extremists radicalized each other primarily using print propaganda. They wrote their own newsletters and reprinted far-right tracts such as Adolf Hitler’s “Mein Kampf” and American neo-Nazi William Pierce’s “The Turner Diaries,” a dystopian work of fiction describing a race war. Then, they mailed this propaganda to supporters at home and abroad.
I’m a historian who studies neo-Nazis and far-right extremism. As my research shows, most of the neo-Nazi propaganda confiscated in Germany from the 1970s through the 1990s came from the United States. American neo-Nazis exploited their free speech under the First Amendment to bypass German censorship laws. German neo-Nazis then picked up this print propaganda and distributed it throughout the country.
This strategy wasn’t foolproof, however. Print propaganda could get lost in the mail or be confiscated, especially when crossing into Germany. Producing and shipping it was also expensive and time-consuming, and far-right organizations were chronically understaffed and strapped for cash.
 Going digital

Computers, which entered the mass market in 1977, promised to help resolve these problems. In 1981, Matt Koehl, head of the National Socialist White People’s Party in the United States, solicited donations to “Help the Party Enter The Computer Age.” The American neo-Nazi Harold Covington begged for a printer, scanner and “serious PC” that could run WordPerfect word processing software. “Our multifarious enemies already possess this technology,” he noted, referring to Jews and government officials.
Soon, far-right extremists figured out how to connect their computers to one another. They did so by using online bulletin board systems, or BBSes, a precursor to the internet. A BBS was hosted on a personal computer, and other computers could dial in to the BBS using a modem and a terminal software program, allowing users to exchange messages, documents and software.
With BBSes, anyone interested in accessing far-right propaganda could simply turn on their computer and dial in to an organization’s advertised phone number. Once connected, they could read the organization’s public posts, exchange messages and upload and download files.
The first far-right bulletin board system, the Aryan Nations Liberty Net, was established in 1984 by Louis Beam, a high-ranking member of the Ku Klux Klan and Aryan Nations. Beam explained: “Imagine, if you can, a single computer to which all leaders and strategists of the patriotic movement are connected. Imagine further that any patriot in the country is able to tap into this computer at will in order to reap the benefit of all accumulative knowledge and wisdom of the leaders. ‘Someday,’ you may say? How about today?”
Then came violent neo-Nazi computer games. Neo-Nazis in the United States and elsewhere could upload and download these games via bulletin board systems, copy them onto disks and distribute them widely, especially to schoolchildren.
In the German computer game KZ Manager, players role-played as a commandant in a Nazi concentration camp that murdered Jews, Sinti and Roma, and Turkish immigrants. An early 1990s poll revealed that 39% of Austrian high schoolers knew of such games and 22% had seen them.
 Arrival of the web

By the mid-1990s, with the introduction of the more user-friendly World Wide Web, bulletin boards fell out of favor. The first major racial hate website on the internet, Stormfront, was founded in 1995 by the American white supremacist Don Black. The civil rights organization Southern Poverty Law Center found that almost 100 murders were linked to Stormfront.
By 2000, the German government had discovered, and banned, over 300 German websites with right-wing content – a tenfold increase within just four years.
In response, American white supremacists again exploited their free speech rights to bypass German censorship bans. They gave international far-right extremists the opportunity to host their websites safely and anonymously on unregulated American servers – a strategy that continues today.
 Up next: AI

The next frontier for far-right extremists is AI. They are using AI tools to create targeted propaganda, manipulate images, audio and videos, and evade detection. The far-right social network Gab created a Hitler chatbot that users can talk to.
AI chatbots are also adopting the far-right views of social media users. Grok, the chatbot on Elon Musk’s X, recently called itself “MechaHitler,” spewed antisemitic hate speech and denied the Holocaust.
 Countering extremism

Combating online hate is a global imperative. It requires comprehensive international cooperation among governments, nongovernmental organizations, watchdog organizations, communities and tech corporations.
Far-right extremists have long pioneered innovative ways to exploit technological progress and free speech. Efforts to counter this radicalization are challenged to stay one step ahead of the far right’s technological advances.

(Photo illustration by Getty Images)The U.S. Supreme Court on Dec. 5, 2025, agreed to review the long-simmering controversy over birthright citizenship. It will likely hand down a ruling next summer.
In January 2025, President Donald Trump issued an executive order removing the recognition of citizenship for the U.S.-born children of both immigrants here illegally and visitors here only temporarily. The new rule is not retroactive. This change in long-standing U.S. policy sparked a wave of litigation culminating in Trump v. Washington, an appeal by Trump to remove the injunction put in place by federal courts.
When the justices weigh the arguments, they will focus on the meaning of the first sentence of the 14th Amendment, known as the citizenship clause: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.”
Both sides agree that to be granted birthright citizenship under the Constitution, a child must be born inside U.S. borders and the parents must be “subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States. However, each side will give a very different interpretation of what the second requirement means. Who falls under “the jurisdiction” of the United States in this context?
As a close observer of the court, I anticipate a divided outcome grounded in strong arguments from each side.
Arguments for automatic citizenship
Simply put, the argument against the Trump administration is that the 14th Amendment’s expansion of citizenship after the eradication of slavery was meant to be broad rather than narrow, encompassing not only formerly enslaved Black people but all persons who arrived on U.S. soil under the protection of the Constitution.
The Civil War amendments – the 13th, 14th and 15th – established inherent equality as a constitutional value, which embraced all persons born in the nation without reference to race, ethnicity or origin.
One of the strongest arguments that automatic citizenship is the meaning of the Constitution is long-standing practice. Citizenship by birth regardless of parental status – with few exceptions – has been the effective rule since the time of America’s founding.
Advocates also point to precedent: the landmark case of United States v. Wong Kim Ark in 1898. When an American-born descendant of resident noncitizens sued after being refused re-entry to San Francisco under the Chinese Exclusion Act, the court recognized his natural-born citizenship.
If we read the Constitution in a living fashion – emphasizing the evolution of American beliefs and values over time – the constitutional commitment to broad citizenship grounded in equality, regardless of ethnicity or economic status, seems even more clear.
However, advocates must try to convince the court’s originalists – Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett – who read the Constitution based on its meaning when it was adopted.
The originalist argument in favor of birthright citizenship is that the phrase “subject to the jurisdiction” was meant to invoke only a small set of exceptions found in traditional British common law. In the Wong Kim Ark ruling, the court relied on this “customary law of England, brought to America by the colonists.”
One exception to birthright citizenship covered by this line of rulings is the child of a foreign diplomat, whose parents represent the interests of another country. Another exception is the children of invading foreign armies. A third exception discussed explicitly by the framers of the 14th Amendment was Native Americans, who at the time were understood to be under the jurisdiction of their tribal government as a separate sovereign. That category of exclusion faded away after Congress recognized the citizenship of Native Americans in 1924.
The advocates of automatic birthright citizenship conclude that whether the 14th Amendment is interpreted in a living or in an original way, its small set of exceptions do not override its broad message of citizenship grounded in human equality.
Opposition to birthright citizenship
The opposing argument begins with a simple intuition: In a society defined by self-government, as America is, there is no such thing as citizenship without consent. In the same way that an American citizen cannot declare himself a French citizen and vote in French elections without consent from the French government, a foreign national cannot declare himself a U.S. citizen without consent.
This argument emphasizes that citizenship in a democracy means holding equal political power over our collective decisions. That is something only existing citizens hold the right to offer to others, something which must be decided through elections and the lawmaking process.
The court’s ruling in Elk v. Wilkins in 1884 – just 16 years after the ratification of the 14th Amendment – endorses “the principle that no one can become a citizen of a nation without its consent.” By making entry into the United States without approval a federal offense, Congress has effectively denied that consent.
Scholars who support this view argue that the 14th Amendment does not provide this consent. Instead it sets a limitation. To the authors of the 14th Amendment, “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” conveyed a limit to natural citizenship grounded in mutual allegiance. That means if people are free to deny their old national allegiance, and an independent nation is free to decide its own membership, the recognition of a new national identity must be mutual.
Immigrants living in the United States illegally have not accepted the sovereignty of the nation’s laws. On the other side of the coin, the government has not officially accepted them as residents under its protection.
President Donald Trump speaks on recent Supreme Court rulings in the briefing room at the White House on June 27, 2025. The Supreme Court ruled 6-3 that individual judges cannot grant nationwide injunctions to block executive orders, including the injunction on Trump’s effort to eliminate birthright citizenship in the U.S. The justices did not rule on Trump’s order to end birthright citizenship but stopped his order from taking effect for 30 days.

If mutual recognition of allegiance is the meaning of the 14th Amendment, the Trump administration has not violated it.
The opponents of birthright citizenship argue that the Wong Kim Ark ruling has been misrepresented. In that case, the court only considered permanent legal residents like Wong Kim Ark’s parents, but not residents here illegally or temporarily. The focus on British common law in that ruling is simply misguided because the findings of Calvin’s Case or any other precedents dealing with British subjects were voided by the American Revolution.
In this view, the Declaration of Independence replaced subjects with citizens. The power to determine national membership was taken away from kings and placed in the hands of democratic majorities.
For opponents of birthright citizenship, the 14th Amendment does not take that power away from citizens but instead codifies the rule that mutual consent is the touchstone of admission. The requirement to be “subject to the jurisdiction” provides the mechanism of that consent.
Congress can determine who is accepted as a member of the national community under its jurisdiction. In this view, Congress – and the American people – have spoken: Current federal laws make entry into U.S. borders without permission a crime rather than a forced acceptance of political membership.
What might happen
The court will likely announce a ruling in summer 2026 before early July, just in time for the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. The court will ultimately decide whether the Constitution endorses the declaration’s invocation of essential equality or its creation of a sovereign people empowered to determine the boundaries of national membership.
The court’s three Democratic-appointed justices – Ketanji Brown Jackson, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor – will surely side against the Trump administration. The six Republican-appointed justices seem likely to divide, a symptom of disagreements within the originalist camp.
The liberal justices need at least two of the conservatives to join them to form a majority of five to uphold universal birthright citizenship. This will likely be some combination of Chief Justice John Roberts, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.
The Trump administration will prevail only if five out of the six conservatives reject the British common law foundations of the Wong Kim Ark ruling in favor of citizenship by consent alone.
America should know by July Fourth.

(Getty Images)Nothing in Gov. Joe Lombardo’s proclamation calling a legislative special session last month gave “special” attention to the economic pressures and aggravations Nevadans are trying to deal with right now.
Uninspired leadership, perhaps. But it also reflects a default presumption that whatever financial pains are being suffered in Nevada households, there isn’t really much Nevada state government can do about it.
What Lombardo fondly calls the “Nevada way” is laced with surrenderism.
For starters…
In an October poll, Nevada respondents blamed the Las Vegas tourism slump on the destination being too expensive.
That’s a convenient poll result for the Republican governor and many Democrats seeking election to statewide office. If the economy is the industry’s fault, then it’s up to the industry, not state elected officials, to fix it, so neener neener, they’re off the hook.
The industry’s not going to fix the Las Vegas economy for the same reason it’s — at least in part — responsible for breaking it: The Las Vegas casino-hotel industry’s commitment to customers pales in comparison to its commitment to shareholders.
But it’s mistaken to assume dire area economic conditions are unique to Las Vegas or the tourism industry. The marketplace is becoming more aggravating, infuriating, and expensive in nearly every economic sector, not just in Nevada but nationwide.
Nevada’s prosperity and lack thereof is infamous for its dependence on the national economy. That’s another convenience for state-level elected officials. They’re not in charge of the national economy. And Nevada’s state government is deliberately built to to prevent passage of economic policy unless it’s focused on providing assistance to business. So nobody expects state elected officials to do much if anything about daily financial pressures crushing their constituents.
There are of course a lot of state-level policy initiatives and reforms that would improve the financial wherewithal of working households in Nevada: lower the state’s high insurance tax and sales tax rates; provide working families with state-level tax rebates and child tax credits; fund public transit to liberate people from the cost of cars (one of the highest households expenses behind housing); fund child care (one of the other highest household expenses); pay for all those things and other long-neglected Nevada services and programs A) with a billionaire tax, and B) by raising taxes on a gambling industry that currently spends more on stock buybacks to enrich shareholders the world over than it pays in state gaming taxes; cap rent increases (to be fair, state legislative Democrats have taken modest swings at that); enact laws assuring paid leave; raise the pathetically low minimum wage.
Those are just for starters.
It could get worse before it gets better
The most recently reported inflation rate was the same as it was when Trump was inaugurated, 3%, according to the September consumer price index report. (Due to the government shutdown, no CPI report was released for October; the November inflation report is scheduled to be released Dec. 18.)
As painful as continuously rising prices are, Trump’s policies stoked fears that inflation would be even worse than it has been, especially after he launched his global war on trade in April.
Worse could still be in the cards.
The Peterson Institute for International Economics released a paper more than a year ago, before Trump was elected, which attempted to model economic impacts of tariffs, deportation of immigrants, and revoking the Federal Reserve Board’s independence.
Under the models, inflation and unemployment were projected to begin rising significantly — but not until at least about a year after Trump’s policies went into effect.
“None of us expected it to be immediate,” the Peterson Institute’s president, Adam Posen, told a Financial Times podcast this week.
If you were among business executives reacting to tariffs, you “had to make very difficult decisions about your supply chains,” Posen said. “Even if you’re Toyota or Caterpillar or somebody incredibly sophisticated like that, it’s still difficult to decide ‘okay, given the tariffs, what stuff do we bring home, what stuff do we put in Mexico versus China, where are our alternative suppliers, who do we use, what do we invest in the U.S.?’ And if that’s true for these companies, just imagine what it’s like … for all the middle-sized companies.”
“So there were a lot of good reasons to think that the tariffs are going to take a while to take effect,” Posen said.
Though acknowledging his is not a consensus view, Posen said he expects “inflation is going to be significantly higher than the current forecasts by a year from now, probably by the third quarter of 2026.”
The Peterson Institute is considered one of the world’s better think tanks, and especially among those with an economics focus.
That doesn’t mean Posen’s right.
And by his own admission his view isn’t aligned with other mainstream forecasts, which see the inflation rate (but not prices) beginning to decline next year.
But Posen’s forecast appears to be somewhat in sync with the wisdom of crowds. Though improving slightly this month, consumer sentiment remains dramatically down from what it was a year ago, and consumers expect inflation to go higher than it is now, both short-term and long-term.
Direct, indirect, and maybe some day
Those who place an outsized faith in the goodness of market forces — a club to which most Nevada politicians of both parties belong — assume inflation will eventually stop freaking everybody out and the economy will become more hospitable, eventually. Everybody just has to soldier on and wait it out.
In another convenient turn for Nevada politicians, that assumption dovetails with the conventionally held (if rarely publicly articulated) view that Nevada is powerless to do anything of much consequence to improve the day-to-day economic wherewithal of its residents.
Next year is a campaign year. Polling in Nevada, as nationwide, consistently finds the economy is far and away the top concern of voters.
Voters should keep an eye out to see which Nevada candidates outline specific proposals designed to address the financial stability of Nevada households directly, and which candidates trot out the fundamental premise of the “Nevada way,” i.e., help powerful industries and wait patiently for prosperity to ripple out to everyone else.
And voters should also watch to see which candidates, when asked about economic pressures facing households, claim impotence, recite a platitude, and change the subject.

There is also an online chat at 988lifeline.org.
It’s becoming more common for South Dakotans to kill themselves with a gun, according to new data. 
The number of South Dakotans who took their own lives with a firearm rose to 116 last year, and the proportion of South Dakota suicides involving a gun rose to 59%, according to the state Department of Health. The state’s gun-suicide rate rose to 12.6 per 100,000 people. All three numbers are the highest in recent years’ data for the state.
Suicide prevention workers say the numbers underscore the need for real-life connection and safe gun storage in a state where firearm ownership is common and legal gun restrictions are minimal.
Sioux Falls Police Chief John Thum cautioned against attributing the trends to a single cause, because local investigations encounter factors ranging from terminal illness to relationship struggles, chronic depression and substance use. 
But access and lethality also matter.
“There’s a definite sense of finality to a gunshot attempt,” Thum said. “If we look at some of the other suicide attempts that we have — overdose, and some of the other ones — the level of absolutism to a firearm is there.” 
Gun laws and lawmaking in Pierre
According to estimates by the RAND Corporation, a nonprofit policy think tank, more than half of adults in South Dakota live in a household with a firearm. A separate analysis by KFF, a nonprofit health policy research group, shows South Dakota has some of the loosest gun restrictions in the country, and “more than twice as many suicides by firearm occur in states with the fewest gun laws, relative to states with the most laws.”
South Dakota requires no permit or background check for private gun sales, allows for the carrying of concealed pistols without a permit, allows concealed pistols in bars and on public college campuses, allows concealed pistols in the state Capitol with prior approval and notification, does not have a firearm registration system, and lacks a “red flag law,” which in other states allows temporary firearm removals from people in crisis.
Democratic former state lawmaker Linda Duba, of Sioux Falls, unsuccessfully proposed what she described as two “modest firearm safety bills” during the 2024 legislative session. She said one of her goals was to lower firearm suicides in the state.
One bill would have required gun owners to report lost or stolen firearms. The other would have required firearms not in use to be locked away with a gun lock or in a safe. Duba said she had seen research that locked-up firearms were less likely to be used in a suicide. 
Duba said some Republican legislators privately supported the measures, but refused to back them publicly because they feared political retaliation from the National Rifle Association. She said the association makes it impossible to convince Republican legislators to support “even the most reasonable regulations.”
“It’s going to take someone being personally impacted before they wake up,” Duba said.
Rep. Tim Reisch, R-Howard, is a retired sheriff, former state Department of Corrections secretary and a member of the National Guard. He was one of a handful of Republican lawmakers earlier this year to vote against the legislation that now allows for the carrying of concealed pistols on technical college and public university campuses. He said many Republicans in Pierre fear negative campaign postcards from the National Rifle Association showing up in their constituents’ mailboxes.
“Nobody wants a ‘D,’ ‘C,’ or even a ‘B’ grade,” from the NRA, Reisch said. “These scorecards are ridiculous. It’s one person’s opinion. But in the end, come election season, sound bites matter. It’s ‘Reisch is soft on crime.’ And those things weigh heavily in the minds of some legislators who really want to keep getting elected.”  
Gun suicides in US reached record high in 2023

Former state trooper Rep. Jim Halverson, R-Winner, also voted against the bill allowing concealed pistols on campus.
“I’m a Second Amendment lover, I really am,” he said. “I just believe there are places where it’s not a good idea.”
Halverson said college is a place where students may experience their first big failure, first major breakup, and first experiences with drugs and alcohol. All of that, and being away from the support of family at home, makes for an environment where suicides could become more likely, he said. 
Halverson said “unless these people have seen somebody who’s been shot themselves, seen someone who has taken their life, they don’t get it.”
“They haven’t had to go pick up a body,” he said. “Or go to somebody’s house and say, ‘Your son or daughter is not coming home tonight.’”
Retired law enforcement officer Rep. Kevin Van Diepen, R-Huron, voted in favor of the pistols-on-campus bill. He said it was a Second Amendment issue, and it would have been unconstitutional to restrict students’ rights. 
Van Diepen said suicide “is a mental health issue.” 
“If they didn’t have a gun, they would use some other means,” he said. 
Storage, loneliness and stigma
Lost & Found is a Sioux Falls-based suicide prevention nonprofit. Researcher Cody Ingle said suicide is not always linked to mental illness. Sometimes it’s an impulsive decision brought on by stress or crisis. He said things like gun locks can be the difference between people pulling the trigger in the heat of the moment, and just a few more breaths that can save their life. 
“We’ve had individuals come up to us and say, ‘This gun lock saved my life,’” Ingle said. “We’re not saying guns are bad, but creating time and space between someone in a difficult headspace and a firearm can save lives.”
Safe gun storage, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, includes locking up guns in a safe with a trigger lock and keeping ammunition separately stored. Keys and codes should be secured.










They haven’t had to go pick up a body. Or go to somebody’s house and say, ‘Your son or daughter is not coming home tonight.’


– Rep. Jim Halverson, R-Winner


Loneliness and isolation — which the U.S. surgeon general declared a public health crisis in 2023 — is also playing a role in the gun suicide trend, said Carrie Jorgensen, executive director of Lost & Found. 
“People are not connecting like they used to,” she said. “And in the online, virtual space, it’s not the same. You can still feel incredibly lonely, even if you have 10 conversations happening at the same time.” 
She said stigma around mental health remains strong in South Dakota, where cultural norms can discourage seeking help, particularly among men. 
“That idea of ‘pull yourself up by your bootstraps, just grin and bear it,’ continues to exist, especially within that population,” Jorgensen said. 
The male suicide death rate in the U.S. is about four times higher than the female rate, and 57% of male suicides in South Dakota from 2015 to 2024 involved a firearm, according to the state Department of Health. 
Jorgensen advised South Dakotans to take the time to maintain real-life friendships and a sense of community, and not to be too proud to ask for help from friends, family or suicide prevention and mental health professionals.

(Photo courtesy of Emma Yerkey)As farmers face historic headwinds and market hardships, calls to the national Farm Aid hotline and the Iowa Concern hotline — where farmers can get support in times of mental health crisis or need — are increasing.
This fall, the Iowa Concern hotline saw four to five times the number of calls it had in the same months last year, said Tammy Jacobs, the hotline’s manager.
The Farm Aid hotline is also seeing a change in the urgency of calls.
“We’re seeing more established farmers calling in — people who know how to play the game and how to access programs. They’re calling more often now, because even with all that institutional knowledge, they’re still running into issues for the first time that are more complex and difficult to solve,” said Lori Mercer, a Farm Aid hotline operator. “The system that’s in place is simply letting them down. There’s just no further safety net.” 
Research shows farmers die by suicide at least twice as often as people in the general population, so there’s urgency to address the uptick in need. 
“It’s a huge issue. I mean, we’ve known at least three families this year whose loved ones died by suicide,” said Emma Yerkey, who’s part of the Ag Chapter of Gray Matters, a monthly meetup for ag producers around the Quad-Cities to talk about their struggles.
Farmers experience a lot of stressors and uncertainty that they can’t control — isolation, weather changes, and financial pressures — along with low access to mental health care in rural areas and stigma that may make them keep their pain to themselves. Market conditions made worse by a trade war and inflation are adding to the stress. Mental health professionals are thinking outside the box to get producers care. 
Understanding the stress
Yerkey’s family farms corn, soybeans, and hay in Geneseo, Illinois, on land they’ve owned since the Civil War. The farm is filled with memories, especially of her dad, Tim Yerkey.

She played baseball with him in their driveway, the family ate meals together in the home, and, one year, her father helped her raise a ribbon-winning calf. 
“That was a really good memory that I have with him,” Yerkey said.
But the farm could be stressful, too. Tim Yerkey worked the land with his family, but at times had to take outside jobs to make ends meet. In 2011, he’d been struggling for about a year when spring floods left fields underwater. He’d reached out to friends and visited the emergency room seeking help, only to be told there were no beds, Yerkey said. He died by suicide in June 2011. 
“I miss my dad, and I don’t want anybody else — or any other family — to go through that,” Yerkey said.
But many farming families experience similar pain. Between 2003 and 2017, more than 1600 farmers died by suicide, the majority older white men.  
Experts say factors that contribute to stress and higher suicide rates among farmers include isolation, easy access to guns, a cultural expectation of toughness, stigma around seeking mental health care, worries about who will take over the farm, and a lack of recognition for their hard work.
Financial losses and stress are also significant risks for depressive symptoms. And right now, times are tough for farmers. 
Producers have endured high inflation and growing input costs on farms since at least 2020. The spread of COVID and, more recently, policy decisions like President Donald Trump’s tariffs and increases in immigration enforcement have all increased operating costs. At the same time, prices for major commodities are low — lower than the cost to grow them. Corn prices are about $0.85 below the break even point and soybeans are about $2 below. 
This year, many states are expecting a record corn crop, but farmers aren’t celebrating.
“It’s very discouraging for farmers to think that they’ve done all the things right in their fields and have put innovations in place and made good decisions, but yet, even with strong yields, they’re gonna be facing a loss on what they’re producing,” said Aaron Lehman, president of the Iowa Farmers Union.
In 2024, the U.S. exported about 42% of its soybeans, most of it to China. With China not buying in the midst of the trade war, some farmers who usually send their crop abroad have struggled to find new markets. The U.S. in November struck a new deal with China, potentially extending a lifeline to producers still scrambling to move their harvest, but it remains to be seen what China will actually buy.
Some programs that helped connect farmers to domestic markets, like the Local Food Purchase Assistance initiative, have also been cut by the USDA. 
“Since the beginning of the year, the farmers have just been thrown into a different level of uncertainty with policy things like losing access to some markets through tariffs, losing access to staff and programming with the government shutdown, and the funding freezes. A big one we’re hearing about is losing access to labor with the ICE raids, etcetera,” said Mercer, with Farm Aid. “I was just speaking to a farmer the other day who was basically watching his crops rot on the vines because his usual labor support was just too afraid to show up this year.” 
In addition to all of the financial stress, farmers say they feel the work can be thankless. 
“This work is incredibly hard, and nobody understands where their food comes from. Nobody knows that [farmers] work 20 hours a day so that they can have a strawberry,” said Anna Scheyett, a retired professor of social work who studied farmer stress and suicide at the University of Georgia.
Meeting farmers where they are
Despite the many struggles, some families are finding hope and community in turbulent times. To honor her dad, Yerkey joined the new Ag Chapter of Gray Matters, a Quad-Cities nonprofit that provides mental health resources, education, and safe spaces.

Gray Matters hosts monthly Barn Talks, where participants can share what’s weighing on them, whether it’s stress, depression, anxiety, or other struggles, and receive support from others. The organizers hope to build a sense of community and normalize talking about mental health. 
“Feeling comfortable and safe to say that — ‘Hey, I am stressed out, or I am really hurting right now. Maybe I am depressed, maybe I have some anxiety,’ — whatever it might be,” said Heather Gritton, one of the group leaders.
Offering spaces where farmers can meet and take some of that load off their shoulders can help break down the stigma around getting help, said Sara Kohlbeck, assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral medicine at the Medical College of Wisconsin. 
It’s key for those spaces to be easily accessible to farmers. 
“Bringing that support to the farmers — or to the rural communities — rather than expecting those folks to come and get those resources for themselves is really important,” Kohlbeck said. “Otherwise, you know, we’ve got folks that are kind of suffering in silence because they just don’t have the time. Sometimes there’s stigma, and there’s kind of that pride issue.” 
There are also practical barriers. Telehealth isn’t a viable option for many farmers, as cell and internet reception in rural areas are limited. Driving long distances to see a counselor can also be impractical, especially during the busy harvest season. 
Another approach to reaching farmers has been to train people who farmers trust and regularly interact with — such as suppliers, lenders, large animal veterinarians, and spouses — to recognize when someone may be dealing with mental health challenges and teach them how to support them and direct them to resources. 
For example, Scheyett has trained agricultural lenders to recognize warning signs of suicide ideation and taught them how to respond. She’s also trained extension agents to take a few minutes at the beginning of agricultural production meetings to talk about stress and offer resources, something she says can make a real difference for farmers.
In one study, Scheyett and her co-authors found that farmers who were present at meetings where about 10 minutes were dedicated to talking about stress management walked away with new ideas for managing stress and a higher level of commitment to doing it. 
Sometimes, offering practical and logistical solutions to big problems can be a part of mental health services, too. 
“If a farmer has not really looked and done a deep dive into their farm financial system, we have a program that’s called farm financial associates, and they’ll come out to the farm, do a big evaluation over the farming operation to see where the hard points are and is there a way to switch things around, diversify, in order to help offset some of the farming losses and costs,” Jacobs, with the Iowa Concern hotline, said.

Where to call
Farmers can reach out to the 988 Lifeline or 1-800-FARM-AID for help. Help is also available in Spanish.
The Iowa Concern hotline is available 24/7 via chat, email, call, or text at 800-447-1985.

For farmers facing grain storage challenges, Jacobs suggested partnering with other farmers as an alternative to traditional co-op arrangements.
Scheyett suggests everybody can help by thanking farmers the same way we do with the military.
“Every time I see a farmer, I say thank you — thank you for your service, because what you do keeps us healthy, fed, and clothed,” Scheyett said.
It’s all in the hopes of providing care and saving lives.
“Even if you can save one life, I mean, that’s so worth it,” Yerkey said. “I feel very passionate about it.”

As a volunteer for The Vermont Afghan Alliance, I have gotten to know many of the recent Afghan arrivals here in Burlington and Montpelier.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Barbara Benton: Do not judge an entire group of people based on the actions of one individual.","This commentary is by Barbara Benton. She is a licensed clinical mental health counselor in Burlington, as well as a volunteer for the Vermont Afghan Alliance and other local organizations. 
In light of the recent violence in Washington, D.C. and the heightened anti-immigrant sentiment being promoted at the highest levels of this country, I want to reflect to Vermonters some of my experiences with the Afghans I have come to know.
My association with Afghanistan started about 16 years ago when I hosted a 16-year-old Afghan teenager in my home for almost a full year. He had received a scholarship from the U.S. government to study for one academic year in the U.S.
Despite propaganda to the contrary, his family hoped and trusted that he would be treated well in the US. I came to know him as one of the kindest and most thoughtful human beings I have met, and also came to truly understand that he was this way because his family valued those qualities, no less than I and my family did.
How enlightening to me that my family and his shared these values, despite differences in culture, customs and religion. And no surprise to me at all that his family and mine wanted their kids to be safe and cared for. He was eventually able to return to the U.S. on a student visa.
Today he lives in another state and was so proud to become a U.S. citizen. I consider him to be a part of my family and know him to still be the kind and thoughtful person I met half his life ago.
As a volunteer for The Vermont Afghan Alliance, I have gotten to know many of the recent Afghan arrivals here in Burlington and Montpelier. What I see is that they also, while being a diverse group of human beings, care about others and are so appreciative of the opportunity to work and live, and become a part of the social fabric here in the US.
Personal connections with Americans who care about their well-being, even a smile from a stranger, help so much in the process of welcoming newcomers and helping them integrate into our community. 
So please do not be inclined to judge an entire group of people based on the actions of one apparently troubled individual. Remember that we can share values of kindness and inclusion across cultures and diverse lifestyles.
And, were they to be returned to Afghanistan, they would face persecution and death because of their loyalty to the U.S.
Please stand with the Vermont Afghan Alliance, with me and with our Afghan allies as we continue to welcome them as valued members of our community. Let Vermont set the right tone in this time when some would try to tear us apart from each other and from our own humanity.

For some legislative supporters of providing public funds to private schools, the conditions being demanded by those private schools are OK. At least that seems to be the message, based on recent hearings at the Mississippi Capitol in advance of the 2026 legislative session.
“I don’t want to force our Christian schools to teach secular curriculum,” Rep. Jansen Owen, a Pearl River County Republican and co-chair of a House school choice select committee, said after an October meeting with the Mid-South Association of Independent Schools. ”I don’t want the state’s involvement to infringe on that in any way.”
Sure, it is highly likely many Mississippi legislators would support spending public funds on the teaching of “Christian values” and even campaign on that expenditure in their next election.
But what if the school receiving public funds was teaching Muslim values or Hindu values or Wiccan values?
What if the school accepted students only if they would pledge allegiance to the Prophet Muhammad?

Would it be OK with Mississippi politicians if the school taught tolerance and respect for LGBTQ people? What if the school allowed boys and girls to compete against each other in sports?
Would they support public funds going to those private schools?
Mississippi has a law preventing public schools from teaching diversity, equity and inclusion. Private schools are free to teach a DEI curriculum because they are, duh, private. But what if the private school teaching DEI was receiving public funds through vouchers, tax credits or some other scheme?
Many politicians also do not like the teaching of what is known as critical race theory or in general terms instruction on the impact of race on what happened in the past and what is occurring now. What if a private school wanted to construct its curriculum around the teaching of critical race theory? Would that be OK with Mississippi politicians who support providing vouchers to private schools?
Surely it would be.
After all, Mississippi politicians are known for their open mindedness. Look up the phrase open mindedness in Webster’s, and there is a photo of the Mississippi Legislature.
But such is not the case in Florida.
According to an article on the website of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, many Florida school choice supporters are concerned that Muslim schools are receiving public funds.
The article quotes Florida Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson, the former president of the state Senate, explaining that schools “‘that indoctrinate Sharia law should not be a part of our taxpayer-funded school voucher program.’”
Many Mississippi school choice proponents argue that the private schools receiving public funds should not be required to face the same oversight and rules and regulations of public schools.
When state Auditor Shad White, whose job is to provide accountability of the spending of public funds, was asked back in March whether private schools receiving public funds should be subject to governmental oversight, he said, “They are held accountable by the parents who choose to send their kids there.” 
So, if the private schools receiving those public funds want to teach “Sharia law” or the virtues of LGBTQ rights and the parents do not object, is that OK with politicians like Auditor White, House Speaker Jason White and Gov. Tate Reeves who all support passing a school choice bill during the upcoming 2026 legislative session?
If so, they are indeed open minded. We just didn’t know.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/15220206/State-Capitol-2.jpg,,,2025-12-07 07:56:15.927891

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont’s ‘crack climbing mecca’ deep in the Northeast Kingdom gains popularity.","Deep in the Northeast Kingdom lie the Kingdom Heritage Lands, 132,000 acres of former and current timberland conserved for public access since 1998. The remote and undeveloped area is mainly the domain of wildlife, logging trucks, hunters and snowmobilers.
Recently, however, increasing numbers of rock climbers have frequented a stunning band of chiseled granite towers set in the middle of the Kingdom Heritage Lands, at a cliff 30 minutes south of the Canadian border and on the northern edge of the Nulhegan basin.

“As soon as you reach the cliff, your jaw drops,” Mischa Tourin, executive director of the Climbing Resource Access Group of Vermont — or CRAG-VT — said last week. “It all is perfect 90-degree angles, like it was built by rock climbers with rock climbing in mind.”
Climbers first explored the cliff, known as Black Mountain (not to be mistaken for Black Mountain Natural Area in Dummerston), around 2005, but only visited it sporadically until it was added to the second edition of Vermont’s comprehensive outdoor climbing guidebook, “Vermont Rock,” in 2022.
Alongside the subsequent increase in use of the cliff, the nonprofit CRAG-VT has spent the past few years working with landowners and easement-holders to preserve access, including creating a climbing management plan and establishing rock climbing as an “acceptable form of recreation” on the Kingdom Heritage Lands.
As part of that effort, six weeks of trail work on the area’s rugged and steep approach trail have been completed over the last two years by NorthWoods Stewardship Center, with significant funding from the Vermont Department of Forests, Parks and Recreation.
According to Tourin, outdoor rock climbing in Vermont was, for a long time, defined by the schist that runs along the spine of the Green Mountains — a unique rock covered with tiny impressions, used by rock climbers as “holds.” In contrast, Black Mountain is made up of strong granite covered in “perfect” parallel cracks of varying sizes, Tourin said, which geologically has more in common with the White Mountains of New Hampshire or world-class climbing areas like Yosemite.

Those cracks, Tourin said, are very conducive to “traditional” climbing, where participants jam their hands and feet into the crack to move upward and place expansion gear — attached to a rope — in the cracks to catch a fall or help facilitate a descent.
“I think I feel comfortable saying that (Black Mountain) is the best place in the Northeast for crack climbing, as far as the number of crack climbs in one cliff,” the longtime climber and guide said. About 70 different routes have been established at the area, most of them of moderate or advanced difficulty.
However, reaching “Vermont’s premiere crack climbing mecca” can be quite the trek.
Black Mountain is located about a three-hour drive from Burlington, on the edge of Averill (population 21) and Lewis (population 0). Following a GPS will likely lead to a dead end, and a high-clearance vehicle is recommended.
The cliff is even a sizable distance from the Northeast Kingdom towns of St. Johnsbury (one hour and 30 minutes) or Newport (one hour), since users generally drive all the way up to the Canadian border in Norton before traveling 6.2 miles south on a slow, rocky power-line access road to reach Black Mountain’s parking area.
“It’s definitely far away,” Tourin said. “The last few times I’ve been there, it certainly seems like more folks in Canada have noticed that it’s a pretty good climbing resource because it’s only a couple miles south of the border.”
Before CRAG-VT’s involvement, the ordeal to reach the base of the cliff didn’t stop at the parking area. Up until a couple of years ago, visitors had to try and locate the access trail, which was steep, prone to erosion, often muddy and lined with prickly plants that latched onto any nearby pants leg.
As of last month, however, trail workers have fully established a sustainable approach trail that includes a welcome kiosk, 38 stone steps, four wooden ladders and 160 feet of retaining wall, a recent CRAG-VT newsletter explained.

“Next phases will continue base-of-cliff stabilization, assess more complex gully issues, and explore parking improvements,” the newsletter read. “This work moves us closer to a fully sustainable Black Mountain for years to come.”
According to Tourin, CRAG-VT’s work lies not only in securing access to climbing and stewarding cliffs but also in building community. To that end, the group held weekend member meetups titled Kingdom Climbing Weekend this year and last, renting out cottages at Quimby Country resort in Averill.
“We started it off maybe as a one-time thing to celebrate the start of (CRAG-VT’s) corridor manager agreement,” said Tourin, adding that most of those 40 participants wanted to return the next year to what he described as a “magical little family camp” on a lake.
“It’s a pretty great event and a pretty cool way to bring, I think, a little bit of money into the local community there,” he said.
While the remoteness of Black Mountain can be a draw, Tourin said it’s hard to gauge the future of the climbing area due to its location.
“It’s an amazing cliff,” he said. “I don’t know if it will ever be super crowded, just because it’s so far tucked away in the corner of the state, but it’s definitely a resource worth traveling to.”

This story by Liberty Darr was fist published in the Other Paper on Dec. 4, 2025.
Raymond and Elsie Whitney take good care of the lawn outside of their South Burlington home. In the summer months, it is alive with a blossoming display of zinnias and in the winter months, steadily manicured until the first snowfall, but through it all, a giant 50-foot Colorado Blue Spruce has remained a key marker to the home built in 1986.
But now, just a stump remains of what was once that “magnificent specimen.”
The couple, after several years of being pleaded with, decided to donate their tree for display on Church Street in Burlington during the holiday season this year. But for the couple, the donation holds a much greater mission than just greeting Church Street goers with some holiday cheer.
“Elsie has been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease,” Raymond said, looking at his wife sitting next to him in their kitchen. “It seemed like a good time, because we wanted to not only just light up Church Street, we wanted to shine a light on Alzheimer’s disease too.”
The Whitney’s built their house and moved into it on Halloween night in 1986. As Raymond recalls, they were one of the first few settlers in the area that is now a sprawling development with several neighboring homes.
Just a few days later that same year, Raymond made the trek up to South Hero to buy a sapling, which, in just under four decades, would grow into the giant that they came to love. At the time, though, it stood only about five feet tall, Raymond said, pointing to an old photo of their home with the tree out front.
“Every single thing on this property, I put on it, every blade of grass, every plant and I plant this place stuffed with flowers,” Raymond said.
And every year, for at least the past few, the couple has been greeted by the Church Street Marketplace crew, asking if they would be open to donating their tree for the lighting ceremony. But every year, Raymond would quip about the birds having paid their rent for the year.
And in a sense, that sentiment is true. For the years that have followed, the tree has been home to birds and squirrels, which have been quite the pest for the couple in recent years. And as the couple has grown older, maintenance has become more and more tiresome, particularly in ensuring that their roof is free of nests.
Plus, the neighbors don’t look too happily at a 79-year-old man high up on a ladder cleaning out his gutters, Raymond said, letting out a laugh.
Coupled with Elsie’s recent diagnosis, the Whitneys decided now was the time to finally say ‘yes’ once the yearly ask came in.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the number of people living with Alzheimer’s in 2020 was nearly seven million and that number is only set to double come 2060. With the help of the Alzheimer’s Association chapter in Vermont, the couple has launched a fundraiser with a goal of $1,500, where people can donate under Elsie’s name.
Just days before the tree would make its home on Burlington’s most iconic street, a crowd of roughly 40 people gathered outside the Whitney’s home to send it off with some cheers and, of course, a champagne toast.
“It was just a special thing to see everybody with family,” Raymond said. “All the neighbors were out here with their kids. And we toasted our tree and said, ‘See you on Church Street.’”
But the celebrations weren’t just one-sided. The tree also put on a show for the crowd, doing a pirouette dance as it was lifted into the air, a gesture that the Whitney’s took personally.
“It danced for us,” Raymond said, looking fondly at Elsie, who was looking, in the same way, back at him.

Alive
Astrid Longstreth, 16, West Bolton
The stars are reflected in the glimmer of the headlamps’ light on the snow,
and the air is frozen – it feels like the sensation of holding your hand under water so burning-hot that it begins to feel cold,
somehow.
Nothing could be more perfect than feeling air rush in and out of your lungs, feeling alive when all is still.
I am alive.

The quiet math families do when pain meets the price tag.
When I was 20, I broke my ankle. I had insurance. I did everything I was supposed to. Still, I’m paying for it – literally – years later. The surgery cost nearly $50,000. Even with insurance, I owed more than $10,000 out of pocket – payments that stretched on long after my leg healed.
More recently, I hurt my wrist chopping firewood to heat our home. My first thought wasn’t “how bad is it?” it was “can I afford to get this looked at?”
That’s the part people outside this reality don’t understand. It’s not the injury that breaks you, it’s the hesitation. The pause before asking for help because you already know the answer: it depends on your deductible.
Across the Shenandoah Valley where I live, people make this same calculation. Can I afford to get better?
We don’t talk about it much, but the numbers tell the story plain: about four in 10 adults in America carry medical or dental debt, and rural folks are more likely to struggle with it than people living in urban areas. Research shows medical problems and bills are among the leading contributors to personal bankruptcy. And for about seven in 10 adults with health care debt, the bills came from a one-time or short-term medical expense – a single hospital visit, an ER trip, or an unexpected procedure. One broken bone. One bad diagnosis. One stroke of bad luck, and your whole future can tip.
You learn to live smaller after that, to stretch prescriptions, to work through pain, to keep quiet about what hurts. To walk around with the silent fear that your body might betray your budget.
We’ve all become experts at pretending the system is normal, because it’s the only one we’ve ever known. But it’s not normal, it’s a choice.
Other nations – Norway, Canada, Germany, France, Japan, just to name a few – have made different choices about how to care for their people. None of them are perfect, and they’re not all the same. But they’ve each decided on one simple idea: getting sick shouldn’t mean going broke.
These countries pay for it in different ways, some through higher taxes, some through shared insurance systems, but the result is the same: people don’t have to hesitate before calling a doctor when something’s wrong. It’s not socialism. It’s just a society deciding that health care is part of the common good – like roads, schools, or clean water.
When I spoke recently with journalists from Norway and Sweden, they told me what care looks like where they live.
In Norway, a hospital stay doesn’t come with a payment plan. Education is free, prescriptions are affordable, and families don’t go bankrupt because a child gets sick.
People still work hard – farmers, factory workers, teachers – but they do it knowing one injury or illness won’t destroy everything they’ve built.
They pay more in taxes, but what they get in return is peace of mind. They don’t hesitate before calling the doctor. They don’t lie awake wondering if this month’s paycheck will cover both medicine and the electric bill.
It’s not a perfect system, none are, but it’s one built on the idea that care is a shared responsibility, not a luxury.
Here in America, we’ve built something powerful – some of the best hospitals and doctors in the world. But access to them depends on what’s in your wallet.
Unfortunately, we also end up paying more for worse results by almost every measure: lower life expectancy, higher infant mortality, and higher rates of chronic illness than other wealthy nations. In the country with the largest economy in the world, we still treat health care like a privilege to be earned. We’ve built a system where survival comes with fine print, where you can buy a truck on credit more easily than you can see a specialist.
I don’t bring this up as a political argument. This isn’t about right or left, it’s about right or wrong.
It’s about neighbors, parents, co-workers – about the next time you hear someone cough in a quiet room and realize how fragile we all are – how easily health can become debt.
When I think about the future I think about my children and how I want them to inherit something better than this quiet cruelty. I want them to live in a country where care isn’t a privilege you earn but a promise we keep to one another.
Because someday, it won’t just be a headline. It’ll be someone you love sitting in an exam room, staring at a clipboard, doing the math in their head.
Wondering if healing is something they can afford.
We can do better than that.
We have to.
Because in the land of plenty, no one should have to go broke just to stay alive.

Built after the previous one was destroyed by Hurricane Ida, residents can now go there for free therapy, paid for with funds from the parish’s cut of Louisiana’s opioid settlement money.
“We really wanted to make sure that when people wanted the help they had someone they could call,” says Nicole Bourgeois, a Lafourche Parish native who filled different mental health related roles for the parish until the new funding enabled them to pay her as a full-time counselor.
The free counseling program is a rare example of opioid money directly reaching people in Louisiana who need help. Three years into the process of paying out funds from landmark settlements reached between states and major opioid producers and distributors, it’s hard to see what Louisiana has done to combat addiction with the roughly $100 million disbursed across the state.
Meanwhile, the opioid crisis continues to claim hundreds of lives every year in the state alone.

The devastation had led municipalities across the country to sue companies like Johnson & Johnson, Purdue Pharma and Walgreens. Together they secured billions in settlements from the industry and created a system where each state drew up its own rules for spending the money.
While there are national guidelines that feature in each state’s approach, the resulting programs vary widely state-by-state, primarily in the way funds are distributed and spending is overseen.
Louisiana took a decentralized approach, dispersing money to local jurisdictions who operate with little oversight from a task force and supporting state-run nonprofit established by then-Attorney General Jeff Landry.
No other state gives as much of its power to fund opioid abatement directly to local law enforcement. Louisiana is also the only state with no state-level program, apart from operating costs for the nonprofit and task force, while directing 20% of the funds to local sheriffs.

Spending some of the funding on law enforcement and the criminal justice system at large is sensible, says Jason Stoltman founder and director of the Opioid Policy Institute, which he founded in 2020 to bridge the gap between knowledge and action about opioid addiction. Recently, the institute co-created a website where suspected waste, fraud and abuse can be reported.
In Louisiana, reports include a complaint about the 20% allocation to sheriffs and a $250,000 full-body X-ray purchased by the Tangipahoa Parish Sheriff’s Office for the local jail.
“I have no problem with even a good chunk of money going to law enforcement,” he notes. “I do want them to find the people who are making pressed fentanyl pills that are killing people. If it goes to investigations, if it goes to the correctional system to help people with opioid use disorder in the correctional system — great, whatever,” he adds. “But it can’t be all.”
The money allocated to law enforcement doesn’t end with the $20.2 million distributed to Louisiana sheriffs so far. Most parishes have allocated a majority of their funding to local courts and district attorney’s offices. Police departments, too, are vying for the funds. All of Terrebonne Parish’s expenditures reported as of this year, close to $1 million, went to the Houma Police Department.

Funds allocated to courts or DA’s offices primarily go toward drug-court related expenses, according to reports obtained by The Current, although it’s unclear to what extent they fund additional positions or reduce associated costs for participants in drug court or pre-trial diversion programs.
“We’ve always tried to do what we can,” says Beauregard Parish District Attorney Brian Lestage, referring to his staff’s commitment to exploring alternative options for those facing criminal charges and living with addiction. His office receives $2,200 per month from the local police jury, paid out of the parish’s opioid funds. “It allows accountability and focus that you’re going to spend those hours,” he asserts.
In many cases that spending is labeled as “treatment,” including in Beauregard, despite none of the funds going directly toward treating people suffering from opioid addiction. “It’s hard to drill down and be like: Did it actually go to real treatment that helps people?” Stoltman says. Over the first two years of reported spending, $1.6 million worth have been labeled as treatment-related expenses, despite a significant portion of those funds going to DA’s offices.
“We would expect any community organization to get this money, to show what the impact is,” he points out. “I expect that of law enforcement.”

Toothless
Transparency on how funding is spent, however, is severely lacking in Louisiana.
Sheriffs aren’t required to publicly report their spending, leaving it up to state auditors, who otherwise have little involvement with opioid abatement, to find evidence of misuse. Parishes are supposed to report their spending to the Louisiana Opioid Abatement Task Force.
To date, only 35 parishes have filed reports for the first two years worth of funds, with only 23 reporting any funds spent.
The Louisiana Opioid Abatement Administration Corp., the nonprofit created to receive and administer settlement funds, and support the task force in carrying out its responsibilities, says it’s still analyzing the latest reports covering the third year of funding, which were due in March of this year. It is unclear how many of those reports have been filed by parishes so far. Administrators haven’t furnished the reports in response to several records requests by The Current.
Meanwhile, the task force’s primary role is to advise parishes on spending priorities and review their spending by way of reports. But it’s functionally toothless. The memorandum of understanding establishing the task force doesn’t equip it with any enforcement tools.
“They don’t have the authority to intercept funds,” says Vic Franckiewicz, the task force’s outside legal counsel.
Still, administrators say they’re working with parishes that haven’t yet filed their reports to identify and clear any issues they might face. They also say they’re putting together a report on the task force’s activities, the first since its board first met three years ago.
This leaves a power vacuum that creates no meaningful oversight, a May report by the Louisiana Legislative Auditor pointed out. “No entity has been specifically tasked with enforcing the terms of the opioid settlement agreements in Louisiana,” auditors concluded.
“I think the task force has the ability to do this,” says Otha “Curtis” Nelson, the corporation’s executive counsel. “We’re just into year five of this entire process.”
Even in states where funding is allocated directly to local governments, it’s possible to create a transparent system that allows for public oversight and offers opportunities for a wide variety of groups to apply.

‘People’s money’
In November 2022, the same month that Louisiana’s task force first met, in neighboring Arkansas, cities and counties banded together to create the Arkansas Opioid Recovery Partnership to administer their share of the money.
The partnership reviews and then approves or denies projects proposed across the state, publishing every decision, along with project descriptions, on a dedicated website.
“Being that you’re dealing with people’s money, we wanted to be very transparent,” says Kirk Lane, the partnership’s director and a former chief of police of Benton, Arkansas. “We didn’t want anything slipping through the cracks.”
As of October, the partnership has received 513 applications requesting a total of $424 million, of which 208 projects at a cost of $32 million were approved, funding purchases of the overdose-reversing drug Naloxone, hundreds of sober living beds and peer recovery specialists, among a plethora of other prevention, treatment and recovery projects.
Every county in the state currently has at least one project funded through the partnership’s portion of Arkansas’ opioid abatement funds. Where the state was investing heavily in for-profit treatment providers, Lane says the partnership decided to focus on the nonprofit space and recovery programming, especially in rural and underserved areas.
“Because we’re trying to build new arrows in that quiver that could really help the population that was there,” he explains the partnership’s approach. “They don’t have to travel across three or four counties or parishes to get help. They could actually go right there where they live.”
Louisiana has a pot of money that could fund a similar program but has been slow to spend that too.
As of Oct. 2024, Louisiana had set aside $3.7 million (the equivalent of 3% of total settlement funds) for administrative costs, less than half a million of which had been spent, according to the Louisiana Legislative Auditor’s report.
For comparison, in Arkansas, the cost of operating several websites, an app that provides training on how to use Naloxone, and the partnership’s four-person staff has come in at just under $1.5 million so far, representing less than 2% of the state’s settlement funds.
Meanwhile, local recipients in Louisiana say they could use the help.
Long hours, inconsistent schedules and weeks spent away from home working on oil rigs and tugboats are a common fact of life for many of Louisiana’s coastal residents, putting a strain on mental health and family structures that can contribute to addiction. (Photo by Alena Maschke/The Current)
In need of guidance
Parishes and sheriff’s offices say they could use some help too. Several that have not spent funds said they are looking to the state’s task force for direction, according to a legislative auditor’s survey.
Whether the current task force is equipped to provide that guidance is doubtful.
Unlike Lane in Arkansas, none of Louisiana’s task force members appointed to represent local governments have a track record of working specifically on the issue of drugs or opioids. There are two physicians. One of which had to recently clarify to a task force member that fentanyl is an opioid, as the group weighed creating an “opioid czar.”
Outside of the two physicians, the remaining task force members are appointed by the Louisiana Municipal Association, the Louisiana Sheriffs’ Association and the Police Jury Association of Louisiana. Administrative support is provided by the Louisiana District Attorney’s Association.
If left unused, any funds set aside for administrative expenses would eventually also be distributed to the parishes and sheriffs, the auditor’s report notes.
The slow pace at which Louisiana and other states have moved in spending their funds is frustrating to experts like Stoltman. “It’s an active crisis,” he says. “Nobody’s acting with the speed that’s needed.”
Since the Louisiana Opioid Abatement Administration Corp. recorded its first deposit of opioid settlement funds at the end of 2022, over 2,000 Louisianans have died from opioid-related overdoses.
Seeing the opioid settlement funds simply as positions in a budget and an administrative task to tackle risks its potential to save lives and keep families whole, Lane notes. “Early on we called it blood money,” he says. “You got to look at it as hope.”

Erin Stewart is betting it is.,"Erin Stewart is chronically unfiltered, casually profane and rarely off the record. Over coffee at Cafe Busy Bean, a brisk one-minute walk from her recently vacated office in New Britain’s City Hall, Stewart inquired about the recording app on a reporter’s iPhone. She wanted to make sure it was on.
For the past dozen years, Stewart has been viewed in political circles as occupying a space between curiosity and bona fide phenomenon — a young, white Republican woman elected mayor at age 26 in a Democratic city of 74,000, where 63% of the population are people of color.
Now 38, she is one of two declared candidates for the Republican gubernatorial nomination, hell-bent on testing the notion that the Grand Old Party is ready to be led by a firefighter’s salty daughter, a blue-collar product of New Britain’s public schools and its Central Connecticut State University.
She is a digital native who began posting an edgy series of YouTube videos 11 months ago titled, “Erin It Out.” In the debut, she described a drunken alderman questioning her legitimacy as mayor, bullying her with vulgarities that Stewart quoted in full. Another off-color episode was titled, “WTF?”
Her campaign video announcement posted on Nov. 18, a week after exiting City Hall with an undefeated record in six mayoral elections. It was devoid of f-bombs but opened with a 10-second parody mocking typical campaign promises and pieties, followed by a pivot to a candidate promising something different.

“When we were talking about what we wanted to do, I said, ‘I don’t want to do some cookie-cutter bullshit.’ I just want to be me,” Stewart said. “If you think that anybody’s gonna not let me be me, I got a problem, and I’m out. I can’t. I don’t want to do that. I don’t want to pretend to be somebody that I’m not.”
In her first public campaign event, a rally two days later in the chilly concourse of the New Britain ballpark abandoned in 2015 by the Colorado Rockies Double-A affiliate for flashier new digs in Hartford, she told supporters that the rationale for her campaign was simple.
“You are going to hear this a lot,” Stewart said. “Because it’s time for something different.”
Something different. 
Much is packed into those two words. 
“Oh, God, so much,” Stewart said. “I mean, just first off, look at me, right? My age, my background as a 12-year mayor of a very Democrat city in Connecticut. I mean, I’m a mom of two, working mom of two young kids — or maybe not so working anymore.”

Laughing, she corrected herself. Since noon on Nov. 12, she’s been jobless: “An unemployed mom of two young kids, and I gonna have to lean into that, right?”
Stewart says she already has been asked in a radio interview how she will manage as a candidate and mother, a question she rarely hears posed to men. (John G. Rowland was 33 and the father of three young children when he won the GOP nomination in 1990.)
She is married to Domenic Mutone, a city employee whom she met rom-com-cute on a ride-along with a snow-plow driver during her first big snowstorm as mayor. Their engagement picture was taken on the plow. Through what she called non-mayoral promotions, he became a general foreman and then a superintendent in the city’s public works department. They are parents of a boy and girl, ages 2 and 5.
Something different also is a gibe at the two rich businessmen who led Republicans to defeat in Connecticut’s past four gubernatorial elections: Tom Foley losing to Dannel P. Malloy in 2010 and 2014, and Bob Stefanowski losing to Ned Lamont in 2018 and 2022. They also are a dig at Lamont, 71, a beneficiary of both generational and entrepreneurial wealth whose home is Greenwich. 
Neither Foley nor Stefanowski had previously sought elective office, but both brought a willingness to spend their own funds, as did Lamont. Stewart intends to the use the state’s public financing program.
Her rival for the GOP nomination is a younger son of Greenwich, state Sen. Ryan Fazio. He is a 35-year-old investment advisor and graduate of Greenwich High School and Northwestern University. In his third term, he has been endorsed by the leaders of the legislature’s Republican minorities, Sen. Stephen Harding of Brookfield and Rep. Vincent J. Candelora of North Branford.
And Stefanowski, who considered Stewart as a running mate in 2022, extended an informal endorsement of Fazio on Lee Elci’s radio show, a popular venue for Republicans. Stefanowski is a foil in one of the stories Stewart tells about her being different, someone who might expand the GOP base.

“My God, I have to tell this story,” Stewart said. “It’s, like, embarrassing, but I have to tell it.”
And she does.
Stewart described Stefanowski and his wife, Amy, accepting her invitation to her inaugural ball in 2021, a fundraiser for charity.
“This was when I was being rumored as running as his lieutenant governor. I was going through a whole other thing with that,” Stewart said. “And he looks to me, and he comes up to me with someone else, and they go, ‘There’s so many people of color in the room, Erin.’ And I looked at them, and I just kind of I took a deep breath, and I go, ‘That’s what winning looks like.’”
Stefanowski had no comment.
Stewart’s appeal to a demographic atypical of Republican candidates was undeniable during her six runs for mayor, but is it scalable? Or reflective of an instinctive retail politician’s ability to engage in a smallish city where everyone seems to know everyone else?
She said she believes both can be true, while readily acknowledging that social circles in New Britain can be surprisingly small. Her Democratic successor, Bobby Sanchez, is the uncle of Stewart’s old boyfriend, Manny Sanchez, now a Democratic state representative.

Her father, Timothy Stewart, a retired firefighter, is a former mayor who left office in 2011. Only two years — and a one-term Democrat she unseated — separate her tenure from his. Her great uncle was Dominic J. Badolato, an AFSCME leader who represented New Britain in the General Assembly for two decades, winning collective bargaining for state and municipal employees.
“One of the things about growing up in a community like New Britain, which I think that people who live in urban centers can relate to, is that you learn how to shift and adapt pretty quickly to your environment to make it by,” Stewart said. “You can put me in the middle of Greenwich or Darien, and I’ll be OK. Certainly not going to be using terminology that I would use here. There would be a refined version of what you see. But, not, you know, not too much.”
Her opening message included an appeal to urban voters, at least on the issue of school choice, less so on the prospect of nudging suburbs to be more open to affordable housing. At the ballpark, she spoke of Connecticut as a rich state with a deficit of opportunities.
“The opportunity to live here and retire here without getting shackled by taxes and the highest cost of living in the country. Or to pay electric bills without having to win the damn lottery. The opportunity for a mother in Bridgeport to send her kid to school knowing that they’re getting a great education, and if she can’t, then the opportunity for that mom to send her kids to a school who can,” Stewart said. “How about the opportunity to live in a town where zoning decisions aren’t being made by Ned Lamont and the Hartford clowns?”

What does she mean about giving that Bridgeport mom a choice? Does that mean the right to send her child to a school in neighboring Fairfield if there is room? Does it mean more charter schools?
“It could mean any of that,” Stewart said. 
Stewart pronounces herself a fan of  “Waiting for Superman,” a 2010 documentary that follows five children vying for entrance into competitive urban charter schools seen as a ticket out of failing public schools. It was made by Davis Guggenheim, the documentarian who won the 2007 Oscar for “An Inconvenient Truth.”
As one of Connecticut’s 10 lowest-performing school districts, New Britain is deemed an Opportunity District by the state, eligible for extra funding intended to promote innovation.  Stewart complained that success can mean a punishing loss of funds. In her view, Connecticut’s system for funding education, primarily through an Education Cost Sharing formula that largely dictates where state education aid goes, is “completely broken.”
Two weeks into her campaign, Stewart is not ready to propose changes, nor disclose who is advising her. 
“You won’t see it yet. OK, we have been meeting extensively about details of the platform, that’s for sure,” Stewart said, adding that her goal is “restructuring the formula of how school districts are given their state education money.”
The run for governor is her second. She briefly was a candidate for the nomination in 2018, abandoned to compete in a three-way primary for lieutenant governor. She finished second.
Her campaign announcement last month came at a dark time for Republicans, hard on the heels of a blue wave in municipal contests that were the first general elections since Donald Trump returned to the White House. A similar result in 2017, the president’s first year office, was followed by a Democratic sweep the next year in Connecticut.
“All I can control is my message,” she said.

That message includes sharing that she voted for Trump in all three of his presidential elections while insisting she should not be defined by him. She said she views his efforts to control border security as a success but questions the depth and breadth of the crackdown on undocumented immigrants.
“Pulling people out of Home Depot to … fill a quota? I could do without that,” she said.
Stewart said she shares Trump’s skepticism about wind power, mainly because she sees it as too expensive. But she disagreed with his administration issuing a stop-work order on Revolution Wind, an off-shore project that was 80% complete.
“To be that far along in the process and then just pull a plug on something just to prove a point was pretty, pretty foolish. And then what happens to the workers there?” Stewart said.
“I’m OK with talking about those things, because I don’t believe that feeling like that makes me any less Republican than anyone else,” Stewart said. “However, there are others that are like, I’m supposed to be like Braveheart in the front lines,  carrying the banner.”
In Trump’s first term, Stewart was invited to the White House as an urban mayor happy to applaud his “opportunity zone” policy providing tax incentives in distressed communities. She said they have been a factor in drawing new housing and other developments to New Britain, as have state grants obtained working with the administrations of Lamont and Malloy.
In April, she attended the signing of an executive order “Reinvigorating America’s Beautiful Clean Coal Industry.” It was an opportunity to meet the interior secretary, Doug Burgum, and talk about policies that might bring down the cost of electricity in Connecticut.

She used the visit to make a dig at Fazio, the ranking member of the legislature’s Energy and Technology Committee. Stewart said he declined her invitation to join her, fearful of being seen at a Trump administration event.
“And I was like, ‘Are you kidding me?’” she said.
Fazio, who did not become a candidate until four months later, recalls the conversation with Stewart differently: there was a discussion about energy issues, not an invitation. Like Stewart, he says he, too, voted three times for Trump.
Lamont has no plan to question either candidate’s fealty to the president.

(Photo from University of Denver)When the attack came, Black Kettle believed it must have been a mistake. The old chief gathered a 33-star United States flag that had been given to him a few years before as a sign of friendship with the federal government and, along with a white flag, hoisted them above his tipi.
But the dawn attack on the Cheyenne and Arapaho encampment at Big Sandy Creek on the cold and snowy high plains of eastern Colorado was no mistake, as would be testified to later at an Army inquiry and a Congressional investigation. The intent of Col. John M. Chivington, commanding more than 700 Union troops that day, was slaughter.
“I long to be wading in gore,” Chivington had declared just days before.
We know what happened next that day from the Army’s perspective largely because of one man, a 26-year-old captain named Silas Soule who refused an unlawful order and stood down his cavalry company while the rest engaged in carnage and worse.
The question of resisting illegal orders becomes a flash point in American politics every generation or so — just think of the My Lai Massacre of 1968 — and it comes today because of revelations about the Trump administration’s boat strikes in international waters. As first reported by The Washington Post, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth’s spoken order directing the first boat attack was “kill them all.” When two survivors were seen clinging to burning wreckage, missiles were launched to kill them, too.
It is a war crime to kill shipwrecked combatants under the international laws of war, as understood by the U.S. military. The situation is further compounded because no war has been declared in the action that has killed more than 80 individuals alleged to have been drug traffickers, without any evidence given to Congress or the public.
In addition, six Democratic lawmakers, all with prior service, are under investigation by Trump’s FBI for recording a video reminding service members they have a duty to refuse unlawful orders. The video doesn’t mention the boat strikes, but it doesn’t have to.
What is sickening about the threads that runs through Sand Creek, My Lai, and the supposed drug boat strikes, is the inherent racism and coordinated cruelty. In each case, the U.S. military targeted non-white groups of civilians. After annihilating them with superior firepower, their villages were burned to the ground or their boats turned into flotsam, all without trial. But in the cases of Sand Creek and My Lai, there were service members who resisted.
At Sand Creek, it was Silas Soule.
On March 16, 1968, it was 25-year-old helicopter pilot Hugh Thompson Jr. who flew over My Lai and noted the bodies of women and children in an irrigation ditch. He landed and asked Lt. William Calley what was going on.
“Just following orders,” Calley replied.
“Orders? Whose orders?”
“Just following …”
“But these are human beings,” Thompson argued, “unarmed civilians, sir.”
Thompson and his crew got back into their chopper. Those still alive in the ditch were being executed and some of the women raped. At the edge of the village, he spotted soldiers going after about 10 villagers who were running for a bomb shelter. Realizing he was about to witness murder, Thompson landed his helicopter between the soldiers and the villagers. His intervention ended the massacre.
Thompson reported the atrocities to superiors, but his complaints were ignored until news of the massacre broke in the American press. There is no official count of the dead at My Lai, but estimates place the number between 300 and 500. Calley was eventually tried in 1970 and convicted of 22 murders. Calley was one of 25 charged in the case, but the only one convicted.

The Sand Creek Massacre of Nov. 29, 1864, is among the darkest chapters in American history, in which hundreds of Indigenous people — mostly women and children — were slaughtered as retribution for the murder of a family of white settlers at their cabin on Box Elder Creek, more than 100 miles to the northwest. It was assumed they had been killed by an Arapaho raiding party. The mutilated bodies of the four Hungates had been exhumed and put on display in downtown Denver, whipping the city into hysteria. But there was no conclusive evidence that linked the attack to the Arapahos or any other first nation.
In winter 1864, the Civil War was winding down in the states — Colorado was still a frontier territory — and what would come to be known as the Plains Indian Wars was just getting started. Territorial Gov. John Evans had placed Chivington in command of an Indian-fighting regiment, one mostly composed of soldiers who had enlisted for just 100 days and others who were in volunteer companies who had fought the confederates at Glorietta Pass in New Mexico Territory and elsewhere.
Silas Soule was born in Maine and was a radical abolitionist, like his parents. The family came to Lawrence in Kansas Territory in October 1855, settling into a cabin along Coal Creek. Silas became a friend of John Brown and was among the “Immortal Ten” who freed an operator of the Underground Railroad from a Missouri jail.
Silas had sought his fortune during the Pikes Peak gold rush, but at the start of the Civil War he enlisted in a Colorado infantry company. He saw action in New Mexico Territory against the Confederates, including the 1862 battle at Glorieta Pass. By 1864, Soule was captain of a cavalry company assigned to Fort Lyon on the Santa Fe Trail. With his commanding officer, Maj. Edward Wynkoop, he attended several significant peace talks with Cheyenne and Arapaho leaders, including one at Camp Weld at Denver with Black Kettle.
Black Kettle was a leading advocate for peace for his people.
“All we ask is that we have peace with the white,” he said during the Camp Weld Conference, according to the National Park Service page about his life. “We want to hold you by the hand.”
The Cheyenne and other nations were feeling the pressure from white settlement, were buffeted by the volatility of the Civil War, and faced a scarcity of food on the barren lands to which they were increasingly confined. The new reserve at Big Sandy Creek offered a meager bounty. Some of the First Peoples had turned to cattle theft to keep from starving, while others engaged in a shooting war and sometimes took white hostages. There were scores of dead on both sides.
In late November 1864, Chivington — who wanted a victory against the Indians to launch a political career — decided to attack the encampment at Big Sandy Creek. Black Kettle thought the camp was safe from attack because he had reported to Fort Lyon and had been told to return to his camp to await an official delegation.
Chivington, the “fighting parson,” had been a Methodist missionary in Kansas and Nebraska but allowed his men to drink heavily the night before the attack. Along the way, he had posted guards at farms and outposts to prevent anyone from warning Black Kettle. He also had a heated argument with Soule, who said he thought the encampment of Cheyenne and Arapaho were not preparing for war.
“Any man that would take part in the murders, knowing the circumstances as we do, is a low-lived cowardly son of a bitch,” Soule said.
Chivington accused Soule of inciting mutiny and threatened to have him hanged. During the attack, Soule refused to take part and led his company of about 100 men a distance away, across the creek.
Barking dogs alerted the village of Chivington’s approach.
Chivington’s troops circled the village and separated the inhabitants from their pony herds. He then fired withering volleys of grape shot from his quartet of 12-pounder mountain howitzers. Then for the next eight hours — using artillery, rifles, pistols, hatchets and knives — his troops slaughtered hundreds of men, women and children.
Soule may not have interfered because his company was outnumbered by Chivington’s men 6 to 1.
There is no definitive count of the dead, but estimates range from 150 to 600. The National Park Service places the number at 230. Some warriors resisted the onslaught, but most of those in the encampment ran for their lives, seeking refuge in crevices along the banks of the Big Sandy or farther out on the plains. Others fled down the creek and dug sand pits for protection. They were blasted with more cannon fire.
Some of Chivington’s men raped the village women, killed babies, and mutilated bodies. Chivington had illegally ordered his men to take scalps, but a few also hacked genitalia from their female victims as trophies and later displayed them in Denver.
“When the Indians found there was no hope for them they went for the Creek and got under the banks and some of the (men) got their bows and a few rifles and defended themselves as well as they could,” Soule would later write his friend, Wynkoop. “By this time there was no organization among our troops. They were a perfect mob — every man on his own hook. My (company) was the only one that kept their formation, and we did not fire a shot.”
He described some of the atrocities that followed.
“I tell you, Ned, it was hard to see little children on their knees have their brains beat out by men professing to be civilized,” he wrote. “One (woman) was wounded a fellow took a hatchet to finish her, and he cut one arm off, and held the other with one hand and dashed the hatchet through her brain. One squaw with her two children, were on their knees, begging for the lives … the (mother) took a knife and cut the throats of both children and then killed herself.”
Although the killings were initially reported as a victory in Denver, reports of a massacre began to circulate. Investigations were launched, and Soule was the star witness. Chivington claimed the village was hostile and that the sand pits were actually pre-dug rifle pits, but the evidence was overwhelmingly against him. Although Chivington was condemned by a military justice panel, no charges were brought — against him or anyone else.
Black Kettle survived the massacre, as did his wife Medicine Woman Later, who was wounded nine times. Both were shot to death four years later by Custer’s Seventh Cavalry at the Battle of the Washita River near present-day Cheyenne, Oklahoma. It should be noted that the Cheyenne and Arapaho have their own histories of Sand Creek, which differ in significant ways from the predominantly white military narrative. I referred to some of these accounts in a chapter in my 2018 University Press of Kansas book, “Elevations.”
Soule lived only a few months after Sand Creek. He was killed by an assassin outside his Denver home on April 23, 1865.
Soule and Thompson have been called heroes, but the term falls short. They had courage, either to stand down or to stand up, but to describe their actions as heroic fails the element of basic human decency behind their decisions. They did what a rational person, familiar with American law and military custom, should do in similar circumstances. They were citizens, sworn to the U.S. Constitution, and beholden to an ideal instead of a commander. War is an awful business, fraught with moral ambiguity, but atrocities like Sand Creek and My Lai present a bright clear line of duty and conscience.
Seldom has that line been so apparent, and crossed so fragrantly as in the current boat attacks.
Assuming the boats were transporting drugs — and again, there has been no evidence presented to support that claim — the military should not be used as an execution force at the whim of politicians. We are not engaged in a war with drug traffickers. Annihilating a boat in the Caribbean is not the same as sending Seal Team 6 to kill Osama bin Laden, who personally directed the hijackers responsible the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.
The continuing drug boat executions is contrary to the ideals of American democracy, military code and international law. But this time the atrocities are coming not from commanders on the ground but from the very top, the secretary of defense. In doing so, Hegseth displays a chilling embrace of killing civilians for political capital. His disproportionate use of power is the point.
A recent closed-door viewing by lawmakers of video from the Sept. 2 “double tap” strike that killed the shipwrecked survivors raised new questions, according to reporting by The New York Times. The men were monitored for up to an hour before the second attack, clinging to the bow of their capsized boat and trying in vain to right it. They were also seen in the video waving, although it wasn’t clear whether they were trying to summon help or ward off another attack.
Adm. Mitch Bradley, the operation’s commander, reportedly told lawmakers in the closed session that Hegseth hadn’t issued a “no quarter” order when it came to survivors. Trump administration explanations for the second strike have ranged from sinking the boat so it wouldn’t be a navigation hazard to stopping the men from recovering floating bales of drugs and continuing their mission.
But eliminating witnesses to the murders of other civilians might be the real motive. Somebody, somewhere, should have had the guts to try to stop this atrocity.
What allowed Soule and Thompson and others unknown to make the difficult choice to place themselves in physical and political jeopardy was a belief in the limits of force. These men were not pacifists. But they understood the civic sin of indiscriminate killing and wanton slaughter. In this, they separated themselves — and us — from those whose only excuse was that they were just following orders.

Maybe you missed this news, perhaps disturbed (yet unsurprised) by our President’s daily tirades… attacking Somalis as “garbage” one day, pardoning a convicted drug smuggler the next or his continued threats of invading Venezuela.  How easily we miss the closer-to-home news by getting distracted by these “bright, shiny objects.”
We all know that Connecticut drivers must cope with some of the highest gas prices, longest commutes, and oldest highways in the Northeast.  Now Washington has decided to dramatically weaken fuel-economy standards for new cars, cutting the 2031 target from roughly 50 mpg to about 34.  This threatens to make things worse for everyone, especially current and future electric-vehicle owners.
On the surface, the rollback is pitched by the White House as a win for “affordable cars,” claiming that these relaxed miles-per-gallon rules will shave maybe $900 off the cost of a new gas-powered SUV.  But for Connecticut commuters who routinely log 12,000–15,000 miles a year, those savings will evaporate quickly:  cars that burn more fuel cost more to operate, and in a pricey state like ours, the pump always gets paid.
But the bigger, less obvious impact of the mileage rules will be on electric-vehicle drivers– the very people who bought into the promise of lower operating costs, cleaner air, and a modernized transportation system.
According to the Connecticut Division of Motor Vehicles, there are 2.7 million cars and trucks in our small state.  But only about 60,000 of them are EVs.
For those current EV owners, the MPG rollback creates more uncertainty… beyond just finding a charging station.  EV resale values depend on strong future demand.  So when Washington signals that gasoline-powered cars will stay dominant longer, that EV market may sputter.  Fewer people will shop for EVs, fewer choose them, and used EV prices will likely soften.  
Federal tax incentives (up to $7,500) for new EV buyers already expired this fall but some Connecticut rebates continue… for now.
Then there’s the EV charging network — or, more accurately, the charging network we were promised. Federal programs launched with great fanfare in 2021 pledged 500,000 publicly available chargers nationwide. But fewer than 400 federally funded chargers have actually been built under the $7.5 billion program.
In Connecticut, fast-charging deserts for thirsty EVs persist across Litchfield County, the Quiet Corner, and shoreline towns east of New Haven. Even Fairfield County’s charging stations, while more plentiful, are frequently congested or out of service.
For future EV buyers, the rollback removes one of the biggest forces pushing automakers to build affordable electric models.  Without strict fuel-economy rules, carmakers can meet federal requirements by selling profitable gas-powered SUVs rather than investing in lower-cost EVs that would appeal to everyday drivers. The result? Slower arrival of mid-priced EVs, the very models that would make ‘going electric’ a realistic choice for middle-class families in these tight times.
Remember four years ago when Elon Musk promised us a Tesla for $25,000? In fact the new entry-level models now cost about $37,000 or more.
Here in Connecticut, where we import every gallon of fuel we burn, a slowdown in EV adoption is more than an environmental setback. It’s an economic one. More money will leave the state for out-of-region fuel suppliers. And an unreliable, underbuilt charging network threatens to stall our transportation future.
The real bottom line? You may find new gas-powered cars will be cheaper, but the cost of driving them will go up in (exhaust) smoke.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tesla-charging.jpg,,,2025-12-07 04:57:43.984782

The report by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) examines Gulf Correctional Institution near Wewahitchka, which houses approximately 1,600 men. Certain staff members contributed, the report says, to what the SPLC labels “the culture of violence” through overly harsh punishments and degradation of people under their supervision.
The specifics include:

Property restriction, stripping inmates in solitary confinement down to their underwear, taking all their property, and leaving them to sleep on a cold, steel bunk for up to three days.
Denying meals for innocuous misconduct and delivering “air trays” to people in solitary confinement; for the benefit of the prison cameras, officers deliver a meal tray covered by a lid, with no food under that lid.
“Standing on the grate,” a practice of forcing people to stand over the storm drains in the yard for hours, sometimes stripped to their underwear or with their arms and legs in uncomfortable positions.
“Catfishing,” a practice in which officers order barbers to shave off all of someone’s hair and eyebrows.
Administering chemical agents like pepper spray to various parts of the body, including the mouth, ears, groin, and buttocks.
Verbal abuse and harassment, including racial slurs and threats of physical and sexual violence.

The SPLC team identified at least 200 incarcerated victims or witnesses and interviewed 95 of them, the report says. They requested and reviewed more than 20,000 pages of prison, health care, and Office of Inspector General reports covering at least 1,100 incidents over the past decade.
The authors added that the FDC resisted their efforts to gather information.
“In response to public records requests, FDC demanded payment of exorbitant fees — often thousands of dollars — before production. After payment, FDC took months to produce records, only then revealing that it had frequently forced the SPLC to pay for duplicates, records that SPLC did not actually request, and unjustified redactions.”
The report adds that, despite those barriers, “for the 27 victims and witnesses at Gulf who had corroborating prison records and were willing to come forward, the team documented their stories in declarations sworn under penalty of perjury.”
Those first-person accounts are included in an appendix to the report.
“Officers respond to small and big provocations with vicious beatings — punching people all over their bodies,” said Kelly Knapp, a senior staff attorney for the SPLC, in a video interview provided in the online summary. “Hitting them with their walkie-talkies. Choking people. Spraying them at close range with pepper spray in their eyes and their mouth and their ears. Sometimes pulling down their pants and spraying pepper spray between their buttocks.”
“I think if one-tenth of that is true, it highlights the fact that we have a department of chaos, and that these institutions that are anemically understaffed are the worst actors, and the places where the state has failed its citizens the most,” former Republican state Sen. Jeff Brandes told the Phoenix after reading the report.
Knapp said that with a vacancy rate for officers at around 50%, correction officers at Gulf are “overtaxed and overburdened.”
Staffing shortages
Florida prisons have faced significant staffing shortages throughout the years. They house more than 89,000 inmates, a population that has increased by more than 10,000 since 2021. That is expected to rise by another 4,100 over the next three years.
“We are managing today with relatively the same number of staff we had 10,000 inmates ago, so you can imagine what that’s doing to the staff and inmate ratios,” FCD Secretary Ricky Dixon told lawmakers in October.
The report says that as of September 2023, the operational staff vacancy rate at Gulf Correctional was 58%, tied for third highest in the state, according to consultants hired by FDC.
“The burden of overcrowding and understaffing often results in dangerous consequences for people incarcerated at Gulf,” the report says.
“Without adequate officer and investigator staffing, prison gangs thrive and perpetrate violence at the facility. Nearly every person interviewed reported that gangs essentially run the institution, with some officers afraid to intervene in attacks, indifferent to the violence, or complicit in their actions. For example, interviewees reported that certain officers frequently allowed people to enter through locked doors into dorms or cells without authorization to assault others at the facility or transfer contraband.”
Marc Caruso worked as a Florida corrections officer from 2010 to 2020.
“They need a whole new leadership from the top down,” he says in a video interview provided in the online summary of the report.
“The officers are tired. They’re burnt out. They know that we need new leadership. It’s the only way to make change in the department. You have to start at the top. You have to have a secretary that’s willing to take a bold stance on getting rid of the corruption in the department. And he has to have the backing of the governor. That’s the only way to do it.”
Since leaving the Legislature in 2022, Brandes founded and heads the Florida Policy Project, a think tank that focuses on statewide issues including criminal justice reform. He said the report “highlights how desperate the Department of Corrections is to address staffing and how, frankly, the Legislature has failed to adequately fund both the staffing and the oversight of these chronically understaffed facilities. “
“They’re setting themselves up for massive litigation over inmates being harmed because of the lack of staffing,” he adds. “At some juncture, it becomes unreasonable, and I think the courts would find that as well.”
The report lists three reforms that could reduce the level of violence in Florida prisons:

Reducing the prison population to “ensure a safe and management staff-to-prisoner ratio;
Investment in greater oversight of facilities and staff.
Improved working conditions and training for correctional staff.

The Phoenix reached out to both the governor’s office and the Department of Corrections for comment but did not receive any response.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-5.45.27 PM-1024x467.png,,,2025-12-07 00:56:30.593814

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)IOWA CITY — Academics, higher education leaders and Iowa lawmakers called the Center for Intellectual Freedom at the University of Iowa a good first step in bringing back traditional values of education, intellectual freedom and debate, but they said it must be protected and tightly controlled if it’s going to last.
The center’s two-day inaugural event continued Saturday with discussions of past and current efforts to build similar centers elsewhere in the United States. Discussion also included and updates on how the center at the UI — required by law passed last legislative session and governed by the Iowa Board of Regents rather than the university — came to be and where it’s headed in the future.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Panelists said the fact that the center is on the UI campus and yet outside of the institution’s control is a unique, and positive, aspect of its structure as it shields the center somewhat from hostile acts taken by those within the university.
“If you’re strictly inside, you tend to be taken over by the same forces that have pushed everything else in a certain direction and have been a threat to intellectual freedom,” said Daniel Bonevac, a philosophy professor at the University of Texas at Austin. “If you’re on the outside, then you can largely do what you want, you have almost no impact on the campus.”
Evidence from past efforts inform the new center
Bonevac said the new center has already avoided many “potholes” in how it was set up, but there are others that those who handle the center need to see coming.
Expanding on the theory expressed by Friday panelist Joshua Katz about university faculties and leadership being mostly made up of “sheep” and “crazies,” Bonevac said there also are “fellow travelers” who don’t personally ascribe to radical ideas but who take those voices very seriously. He also described “careers” who will offer their true opinions behind closed doors but not stand up for their thoughts in public.
“Radicals” who want to disrupt programs they are against “find something to complain about,” he said, and often connect it with a specific person who they say needs to go. “Fellow travelers” become concerned not with the program, which they have no problem with, but with the fact that not everyone is happy with what is going on. “Fellow travelers” then talk to “sheep,” who follow their lead, and higher-ups end up getting rid of that person and finding someone who won’t make “waves.”
“In short, you accommodate and you end up looking like you’re controlled by a cabal of the enemies of your original mission,” Bonevac said.

Panel affected by fear of retribution, center head says
The first panel of the day was initially supposed to include three academics, center interim director Luciano de Castro said, but one of the panelists dropped out due to fear of retribution from his university. The sessions held Friday and Saturday morning were originally supposed to be closed from the public, he said, but due to Iowa’s open meetings laws and the fact that enough center advisory council members were attending to make a quorum necessitated opening them to the public.
De Castro said he wasn’t considering this situation as “good” or “bad,” but used it as an example of a “trade-off” that ended with losing someone’s perspective. Aiming to ensure all of what is discussed at the event is available for people to peruse, de Castro said panelists will write articles based on what they presented and have them combined into a book that will be available next year.


He’s seen this happen time and time again at his own university, Bonevac said, with different programs that offered alternative curriculum becoming more “radical” at different paces. He said this was due to original leadership being forced out or leaving for their own reasons and being replaced with those unwilling to defend their mission and letting the program turn into something it was never supposed to be.
One example he provided was of a program he and others tried to create in 2001 called “Western civilization and American institutions,” which garnered donor interest and support from “our people” but opposition from faculty in the history, American studies and English departments. Bonevac said “they made the faculty council not approve this at all” and accused the leader of the initiative of “financial improprieties,” which he called absurd.
The leader was replaced with someone else and, while the program was created, it does not hold its original name and wasn’t what they imagined.
“It’s a good program, but it’s not at all what we had in mind,” he said, “and in terms of the overall effect on the campus, it’s been minimal.”
The best leaders for centers like the one at the UI need to be fully committed to the center’s mission and willing to speak up in its defense, including when that makes people angry. They also need to have a vision of excellence that encompasses the moral and the intellectual, Bonevac said, and be ready to set up a successor before they leave.
Admissions must also be controlled to ensure students “are on board with the mission” of the center, he said.
Chris Clemens, former University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill provost, posed four questions to those in the audience directly involved with the center — how will they hire, how will they reach people who aren’t already sympathetic to their goals, what will the center bring to campus and “what adjacent efforts can serve the reformers whose objectives and passions don’t fit to get to this particular focus.”
Rubrics for hiring should be made now and visibly, he said, and those leading the center should be prepared for the day when someone says something “disbelieving.” A communication plan and fallbacks for situations where things go wrong are also necessary to ensure the center stands strong in who is populating it.
Clemens said a common vision must be established for the center, and one of the things that went wrong at UNC was that the “philosophical and methodological differences” of those involved in initiatives were not figured out at the start.
“A center for intellectual freedom that has hiring preference and ideological filters is not a center for intellectual freedom,” Clemens said. “It lives with a contradiction in its soul that will kill it if you don’t resolve it now.”
Current efforts lend confidence to enduring strength
State and federal officials also took the panel stage Saturday to discuss the center’s inception and how they hope to help it succeed.
Regent Christine Hensley said “all the stars have aligned for this to come together,” with former regent and current Trump administration Assistant Secretary for Postsecondary Education David Barker and herself having both come onto the board with the idea for a center like the one now created and working together to make it a reality.
Barker, also a panelist with Hensley, state Rep. Taylor Collins and state Sen. Kerry Gruenhagen, said there wasn’t much interest when he brought the idea forward after joining the board six years ago, due to both money concerns and the lack of awareness of “how bad things had gotten at a lot of universities.”
Collins also drove the creation of the center by discussing legislation to remove diversity, equity and inclusion programs at universities that led to directives to do just that from the board of regents, Barker said, as well as explore the possibility of opening centers “like this.” While the University of Northern Iowa and Iowa State University both developed initiatives as a result of this directive, Collins said there wasn’t much action from the UI.
Hensley said she’s heard from students, their families and “seven-figure donors” who aren’t happy with the political balance of the UI and the “direction of the university.” Multiple panelists said many at the UI are not happy with the center’s creation, and Hensley pointed out there were no UI administrators in attendance. There have been “challenges” in working with the university, she said, in terms of logistics and competing information.
Neither UI nor board of regents spokespeople could say whether anyone from the UI was invited to the event.
With an advisory committee and bylaws set for the center, Hensley said next steps include launching the national search for a permanent director and conducting a marketing study to learn more about what classes and other resources should be offered through the center.
“I am extremely confident that we’re going to be very, very successful,” Hensley said.
What gives Barker confidence in the center is the quality of its advisory board, he said, and he hopes the center will develop surveys similar to free speech surveys already taken by Iowa university students to see whether students and faculty feel comfortable sharing what they feel in the classroom.
A question directed at Hensley asked why, if UI officials aren’t cooperating, can’t the board of regents just remove those leaders, to which she responded that leadership on the board of regents has recently changed and she is “hopeful” that this can be dealt with.
“I think that we have past leadership that just were not willing to deal with those issues, and the change in the leadership will begin to address those,” she said.
University of Iowa graduate student Clara Reynen asked panelists how the idea of universities getting worse as older faculty bring in new people with the same ideas and beliefs, which was expressed in Friday’s panels, can coexist with the fact that advisory committee members were chosen by de Castro and Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds and approved by the board rather than through an application process or other means.
De Castro said there were discussions in the creation of the center about its director having too much power, and the advisory council was created to be “out of reach” of the director and made up of people who will not go along with the majority decision and disagree when necessary.
“I want to emphasize this — this center is not about politics, it’s not about ideology, it’s about truth,” de Castro said. “It’s about academic excellence, and this we’re going to strive for.”

Danville residents voted overwhelmingly on Saturday against shuttering high school grades at the Danville School.
Well over 500 residents cast paper ballot votes during a townwide referendum at Danville School, with 480 votes against a measure to close high school grades versus 75 in favor, according to Danville’s moderator Toby Balivet.
“I’m proud of the town for turning out, I’m ecstatic for the turnout,” Danville school board Chair Clayton Cargill said after the results were announced.
The results sent a loud and clear message to the Caledonia Central Supervisory Union and Danville school board officials to keep high school grades open. After the results were announced, Cargill said it’s “pretty obvious that this town wants to be a town that operates a high school.”
“The town is proud of the high school,” he said, adding that the school board would “take that advice to heart.”
The referendum was first spurred by a citizen’s petition to close high school grades by June 30 and instead pay tuition for those high school students to attend other public or private schools.
Peter Mantius, a Danville resident and St. Johnsbury Academy teacher, submitted the petition, signed by more than 100 residents, in October.

The effort was partly motivated by anxiety around the future of school choice. State Sen. Scott Beck, R-Caledonia — a St. Johnsbury teacher — cautioned Cargill that legislation this upcoming session could limit school choice options in the future, and suggested the district should consider whether to shutter high school grades to maintain school-choice options in the future.
Cargill has since filed an ethics complaint against Beck, alleging he pushed for grade closures that would benefit the private school where he works.
School employees and officials, the community and students feared that closure would otherwise leave the region a public high school desert.
But the vote was complicated this week, when attorneys contracted by the district said the petition could not compel the Danville school board to move forward with closure — making Saturday’s referendum nonbinding.
School board officials previously said they would decide whether to go forward with closure based on the results of the referendum.

,CommonWealth Beacon,2025-12-06 23:21:59+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,"Efficient electric equipment, powered by clean sources, is the answer to the energy affordability crunch",Vick Mohanka,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/opinion/efficient-electric-equipment-powered-by-clean-sources-is-the-answer-to-the-energy-affordability-crunch/,Better equipment and cheaper energy sources are critical to achieving an affordable energy future.,"IN THE WAKE of last month’s elections, one thing is clear: affordability is on the ballot. A poll released days later by the University of Massachusetts Amherst affirmed as much, with one in five respondents rating their own economic situation as “poor” and housing emerging as the most important issue facing Massachusetts.  
Yet while Massachusetts families struggle to make ends meet, Eversource’s CEO is boasting record quarterly earnings, driven by revenue collected from recent rate hikes. As we head into winter and heating bills climb, our leaders on Beacon Hill should stop quibbling about distant 2030 climate goals and instead focus on the root causes of rising energy costs today: runaway utility infrastructure spending, corporate greed, and an over-reliance on methane gas.  
Across the country, elected leaders are tackling affordability head-on.  
In New York City, Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani built his campaign around lowering the cost of living, from the lunch rush to the cost of rent. In New Jersey, where residents struggle with similar energy dilemmas as those facing Massachusetts, Governor-elect Mikie Sherrill won handily by pledging to declare a state of emergency and freeze utility bills. In Georgia, the data center capital of the country, fed-up voters elected two pro-renewables candidates to the statewide Public Service Commission.  
Meanwhile, here in Massachusetts, Gov. Healey has put forward an energy affordability agenda, with her proposed legislation promising to result in $10 billion in savings. Legislators have similarly offered bills that will help bring energy costs down further by helping municipalities quickly deploy low-cost solar, ensuring new buildings use the latest energy efficiency standards, expanding the use of geothermal energy to heat our homes and buildings, and banning utilities from charging ratepayers for corporate travel, political activity, and advertising expenses.  
These solutions point to the reality we’re facing today: Better equipment and cheaper energy sources are critical to achieving that affordable energy future. And in 2025, as the index for natural gas is rising at nearly four times the rate of inflation, highly efficient electric alternatives like heat pumps powered by clean energy are how we bring down energy bills across Massachusetts. 
Knee-jerk reactions to double down on methane gas will set up Massachusetts families for more, not less, economic hardship. Not only has the price of methane gas risen to be the main source behind recent rate hike requests from Eversource and National Grid, but years of unchecked infrastructure spending has caused delivery charges to rise 20 percent each year since 2014.  
This isn’t just happening in Massachusetts: in 2024, two-thirds of the average gas bill nationwide went to delivery charges, and accelerated gas pipeline replacement spending is the main culprit. According to the American Gas Association, gas pipeline spending hit $49.1 billion in 2023, up 50 percent from the year prior.  
All this spending has sent utility corporate profits into the stratosphere, with Eversource’s electric side alone posting a $367 million profit for third quarter earnings. Eversource’s CEO, Joe Nolan, in 2023 took in almost $19 million from our bills and ranks among the highest paid utility executives in the country.  
Massachusetts has the tools to turn this around. Just as the Fair Share Amendment created free lunch in public schools and closed the MBTA’s operating budget gap by putting a tax on millionaires, Massachusetts can tap into excess corporate profits to create long-term solutions to bring down the cost of energy for working families.  
Our leaders should invest in solutions that ensure our low-income households don’t pay more than they deserve to get the latest, most efficient electric equipment, and landlords should be required to make their properties more affordable for renters by investing in energy efficiency and highly efficient heat pumps.  
There are already bright spots. All-electric building codes are spurring an affordable housing boom in Lexington. Boston’s decades-old steam loop is transitioning to highly efficient heat pumps powered by thermal energy from the Charles River, allowing hundreds of buildings to access cheap, clean heat. Thanks to the Department of Public Utilities, heat pump owners can expect to see more than $500 in savings this winter, and solar, wind, and batteries are driving down energy prices. And late last month, the DPU pushed back on Eversource’s 17 percent rate hike request, resulting in $45 million in savings for 303,000 customers.  
Our climate commitments are starting to crack down on utility overspending as well. This past spring, the DPU made an initial ruling to rein in gas utility pipeline spending, a move that is expected to cut the gas system enhancement plan, or GSEP, surcharge on utility bills by 17 percent. The department also proposed ending line extension allowances, an outdated practice that has allowed gas utilities to pass on the cost of adding new customers to its system to existing customers, a fee that costs ratepayers up to $160 million each year. 
As we head into colder weather and people grapple with higher and higher energy bills, the biggest tool our elected officials can use to help build a more affordable Massachusetts is efficient electric equipment powered by clean energy. It’s time they use it.

On Wednesday, a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers sent a letter to House leadership seeking urgent reauthorization of the “Secure Rural Schools and Self-Determination Program,” which provided 32 Montana counties with $16 million from the U.S. Forest Service in 2023. 
All four members of Montana’s federal delegation signed on to the letter seeking the funding as a standalone measure or attached to broad, year-end funding legislation. 
But that funding expired in 2023, and was not reauthorized during budget negotiations last year. 
And despite a bill co-sponsored by Montana Sens. Steve Daines and Time Sheehy, passing the Senate in  June, the House has yet to take up a vote. 
The SRS program helps counties with large swaths of public, tax-exempt forest land that previously received revenue from timber sales. The federal government has a funding formula to share 25% of revenue generated on federal land based on economic activity, timber harvest levels and other considerations that vary by county, with payments going toward rural schools, road maintenance and other programs that serve the counties. 
“Rural counties, parishes, and boroughs across the country are already facing the impact of the program’s expiration,” the letter states. “The SRS program underscores the vital partnership between federal land management and local government services, supporting everything from wildfire mitigation and forest health to the maintenance of roads and support of public schools. With longstanding and strong bipartisan support behind SRS, Congress must reaffirm its commitment to these rural counties.”
In Montana, Northwest counties, the heart of the once dominant timber industry, receive the most money.

,Mississippi Today,2025-12-06 19:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Pediatricians in Mississippi to still recommend Hep B vaccine for newborns despite CDC advisers’ vote,Sophia Paffenroth,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/12/06/pediatricians-hep-b-vaccine/,Pediatricians in Mississippi are already witnessing a shift among parents  in how some choose to protect their children against infectious disease was underway even before a group of advisers for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention withdrew their recommendation for hepatitis B vaccines at birth this week.,"Dr. Patricia Tibbs said her pediatric practice in Laurel has gotten “so many rejections” for newborn hepatitis B vaccines in the last year, and she suspects some of those infants may end up with debilitating conditions as a result. 
“The problem with that is that if you are in the process of turning positive for hepatitis B and you did not know you were exposed, and if we don’t give the baby the vaccine at birth, then your baby has acquired it,” said Tibbs, president of the Mississippi chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, told Mississippi Today. “You can’t stop the process once it’s acquired.”
This shift among how parents choose to protect their children against infectious disease was underway even before a group of advisers convened for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention this week. Universal hepatitis B vaccines for infants are no longer recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, a panel that advises the federal government on vaccination policy, as a result of a controversial vote Friday. 
The 8-3 vote brought an end to a longstanding recommendation to vaccinate all healthy newborns against hepatitis B, regardless of whether the mother tests positive for the virus. The current committee was hand-picked by U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. after he fired 17 former members. In June, Kennedy called his move a “clean sweep” that represents a broader movement to prioritize parental autonomy. Committee members also discussed the childhood immunization schedule but only voted on the recommendation for hepatitis B. 
Several national health associations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Infectious Diseases Society of America, have come out with statements reiterating the importance of continued recommendation of universal birth doses of the vaccine. On Friday, the American Medical Association called the panel’s decision “reckless.” 
Hepatitis B can spread through sexual contact and drug use, but it can also be transmitted from mothers to infants during childbirth. In infancy, the disease can be transmitted through contact with an infected person’s body fluids, such as their blood. The committee now recommends the vaccine only for babies whose mothers test positive for the virus. For other babies, it will be up to parents and doctors to decide whether a birth dose is appropriate. 
The virus attacks the liver, is often asymptomatic for years, and can present in adulthood as liver cancer, cirrhosis and death. The risks of these outcomes are much higher for people who get infected as infants. There is no cure.
Babies born to mothers who are negative at the time of birth are very unlikely to get the virus. However, if a mother tests negative before birth, she could still contract the virus between the time of testing and birth. Testing at birth is a mostly-effective alternative to immediate vaccination in large hospitals that do speedy in-house testing, but not in smaller, rural hospitals where tests can take days to come back, Tibbs said, adding that there is always a chance of a false negative or infection from someone other than the mother. The newborn vaccine is most effective when administered within 12 hours of birth, experts say. 
The recommendation changes will likely have a greater impact in rural areas. There, mothers are more likely to get tested for the first time at birth, the results may take a while to come back, and infants can miss the 12-hour window, Tibbs said.
“This particular decision is going to impact Mississippi especially a lot,” Tibbs said. “Because we already have issues with adequate prenatal care and places where people travel for hours to get good care.”

Panelists say the vaccine has come up now because the committee is required to periodically review vaccine safety. They say they deemed the hepatitis B vaccine the most important to examine since it is the earliest vaccine given to infants and contains aluminum adjuvants – salts that make some vaccines more effective by stimulating an immune response. 
“We have to be cognizant of the fact that the past several decades have seen an explosion in chronic disease, especially the highest rate in our children,” said ACIP member Dr. Evelyn Griffin, an obstetrician and gynecologist in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Thursday. “Something is happening, and we have to address that … I’m not saying it is vaccines that is causing this, but vaccines is what we are tasked to explore, so we have to investigate these topics.” 
The new recommendations will not affect access or availability of the vaccine currently available, Andrew Johnson of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said during the meeting. The vaccine will continue to be covered by insurance at no out-of-pocket cost for all beneficiaries. 
“This vote to weaken the hepatitis B dose recommendation will be the first time in my 21 years of experience as a liaison to ACIP that ACIP is voting on a policy that based on all of the available and credible evidence regarding benefits versus harm, it actually put children in this country at higher risk rather than lower risk of disease and death,” said Dr. Amy Middleman, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Oklahoma’s College of Medicine, during the hearing.
Why this, why now?
In 1991, the U.S. pioneered its recommendation that all infants receive a dose of the hepatitis B vaccine on the day of birth. Between 1990 and 2019, reported cases of acute hepatitis B among children declined by 99%. 
Most parents today choose a birth dose of the hepatitis B vaccine, with only 9% choosing to forego or delay it, according to the KFF/Washington Post Survey of Parents conducted last summer. 
About 30 vaccines, excluding flu and Covid shots, are recommended in the U.S. for children. The debate on childhood vaccination has become increasingly contentious as the country becomes more divided. Liberals are more inclined toward vaccination, seeing it as a matter of public health, and conservatives are less inclined toward vaccination, seeing it as a matter of individual freedom. Seventy-four percent of Democrats or those who lean Democrat feel confident that vaccines have been tested enough for safety, while only 35% of Republicans or those who lean Republican believe the same, according to an Oct. 20-26  survey conducted by the Pew Research Center.
Some of the people Kennedy replaced former committee members with are considered controversial for being vaccine skeptical. During this week’s meeting, members pushed back against decades-long practices in disease prevention.
“My personal bias is to err on the side of enabling individual decision making and individual rights over the rights of the collective,” said the committee’s vice president, Dr. Robert Malone, who has said he is not anti-vaccination and has worked in mRNA technology for years, during Friday’s deliberations over when to administer the hepatitis B vaccine. “This is not a trivial thing, and it reflects fundamental, frankly philosophical, disagreements about the role of public health and medical practice.”

“Your role is population health, not the individual,” shot back Dr. Jason Goldman, who has served as a liaison to the committee for the American College of Physicians for almost a decade. “We are looking at what are the population risks and how do we make those recommendations.”
In the two-day session, committee members called for more long-term vaccination studies, including placebo-controlled trials to look at causation with conditions such as asthma, allergies, ADHD and autoimmune disorders. Virologists have long considered it unethical once a vaccine is authorized for use to perform additional studies that withhold the vaccine from placebo patients. 
“Many vaccines have been in existence for decades. When the newer, next-generation vaccine comes along, we are obligated to use the standard of care as the control – not a placebo,” Dr. Wilbur Chen, an infectious disease physician-scientist at the University of Maryland Medical Center, told Mississippi Today. Chen was one of the 17 former committee members dismissed in June. 
Before Friday’s vote, the hepatitis B vaccine was recommended for all newborns but not mandated. However, in schools and some pediatricians’ offices, the vaccine is required. More than half of pediatricians’ offices in the U.S. included in a study published in the medical journal JAMA reported having a dismissal policy for families who do not vaccinate their children according to the immunization schedule. 
“I was trained in bioethics that these are things that are not acceptable,” said Malone. “The absence of coercion, compulsion and enticement is the essence of informed consent.”
Mississippi recently added religious exemption, allowing children who do not comply with the recommended immunization schedule to attend school. Before 2023, Mississippi was one of six states that did not allow religious exemption for childhood vaccines. 
Since the exemptions became allowed two years ago, Mississippi went from first in the nation for its rate of childhood immunization to third. 
“Historically, parents all got vaccines,” said Tibbs. “It’s not in my memory for people to reject vaccines until recently.”
The way forward
Two-thirds of Americans don’t trust the health care system today, according to a study from Johns Hopkins University study. That’s up 10 percentage points from 2021, the height of the Covid pandemic. 
Panelists who voted to pass the new hepatitis B recommendations said that increased parental autonomy is necessary to rebuild public trust in the medical industry. They also said that it has never been socially acceptable to talk about adverse effects of vaccines, leading to parents and individuals feeling gaslit and silenced. 
MaryJo Perry, co-director of Mississippi Parents for Vaccine Rights, called the new recommendations a win after she tried to bring these changes to Mississippi in 2017 through a bill authored by Rep. Becky Currie, a Republican from Brookhaven. The bill would have prohibited the state’s Health Department from requiring the hepatitis B vaccine for all infants at the time of birth. 
“I think it’s a shift in the integrity behind the government and the way they represent vaccine science,” said Perry, whose group now has 14,000 followers on Facebook. Perry said most of the families she works with report feeling that their concerns are not taken seriously and are judged or penalized for exercising their right to choose. 
“They get shamed, they get bullied, they are fear-mongered and coerced,” Perry said. “When you have a brand-new baby, it’s supposed to be a wonderful time. And parents just are tired of that, and today’s young mamas are not putting up with it.”
Some doctors who spoke during the hearings expressed concerns that public distrust might grow, since there is now a rift between what ACIP now recommends and what various medical and pediatric associations recommend. They also described the hearings as chaotic and overly anecdotal. 
“These decisions really affect a lot of people’s lives, and we really are obligated to our countrymen to make sure that we do this in an organized process,” said Middleman, the ACIP liaison. “We can’t just dump a pile of unfolded laundry on the floor and then try to determine from that whether or not we need more T-shirts or more pants.”
Pediatricians also expressed their own confusion over how the new recommendations will change practice, if at all, considering the decision has always been up to parents. 
“Is it not going to change anything because people have always been able to opt out?” asked Tibbs, of the Mississippi chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics. “I won’t stick your baby if you don’t want the hepatitis B vaccine, right? So, is nothing changing?”
As of now, the hepatitis B vaccine will continue to be covered by insurance for all families who choose to receive a birth dose. But Tibbs worries about the possibility insurance companies will stop covering the vaccine down the road. 
“We as pediatricians will continue to follow the American Academy of Pediatrics recommendation,” said Dr. Anita Henderson, past president of the group’s Mississippi chapter. “… We are not planning to make any changes to our recommendations, any changes to our policies. We will continue to recommend the vaccine.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/05173441/AP25253623716598.jpg,,,2025-12-06 14:56:52.316018

Sign up for their newsletter here.
Sales of new electric vehicles have plunged since federal tax credits ended on Sept. 30.
In November, EVs accounted for 5.3 percent of U.S. new-car and light-truck sales, a share that was less than half the record high in September, according to an estimate published last week by S&P Global Mobility.
The numbers were especially ugly on Tuesday when several automakers released their November figures. Ford said that unit sales of its Mustang Mach-E were down 49 percent compared to the same month in 2024. Hyundai’s Ioniq 5 was down 59 percent. I could go on.
But most industry analysts are not sounding an alarm. This is because the decline in sales was expected the moment in July that President Donald Trump signed the legislation that canceled the credit, which was up to $7,500 per vehicle. The law led to months of chaos, during which many consumers accelerated their purchasing decisions to qualify for the credit, contributing to the collapse that followed.
One of the main questions going forward is how long it will take for the market to return to some kind of normalcy. The most common answer I’m seeing is that the current shakeout will likely last well into 2026.
After that, we’ll get to the more important question: What happens next? To help figure this out, I spoke with Peter Slowik, U.S. passenger vehicles lead for the International Council on Clean Transportation, or ICCT, a research nonprofit with offices around the globe.


“We think it’ll probably take a few quarters for the market to stabilize, but the long-term outlook, the fundamentals, the decline in costs and the increasing cost reductions that we’re seeing, all those fundamentals remain solid,” he said.
He is looking ahead to the time when a customer can buy an EV at the same price, or less, compared to a gasoline vehicle with similar features. His organization thinks that will happen across most vehicle segments by 2028 or 2029.
But there will be some milestones before then. Among them is when the total cost of ownership of an EV is the same as or lower than that of a gasoline vehicle, reflecting that an EV has lower fuel and maintenance costs. He anticipates that this will happen several years before purchase-price parity—which is right about now.


Researchers use different methods to calculate the total cost of ownership, making this a challenging metric to agree on. (Car and Driver published an overview this summer of the factors to watch.)
But there is little debate that the costs of EVs will continue to decrease, even with cuts to subsidies.
Automakers, who think in decade-plus time horizons, can see the way things are going. Each company is making strategic choices about how much to maintain gasoline and hybrid vehicle lineups, even as they know electric drivetrains will dominate the long-term future.
“We think this transition is inevitable, and the automakers that can [best navigate] this transition are the ones that are likely to win the race,” Slowik said. “They stand to win big, both at home, in terms of their domestic manufacturing volumes, and their sales shares relative to other automakers, but then also abroad.”
ICCT is a useful resource for understanding this moment. For starters, check out a Nov. 17 blog post that offers data-backed commentary on U.S. policy.
Any attempt to make predictions carries risk. If you’d asked me a year ago, I would not have guessed that Trump would be able to pass a repeal of the EV tax credits.
The credits largely benefited U.S.-based companies such as Tesla, Ford and General Motors, helping them gain a competitive edge over models assembled in other countries that were not eligible.
It didn’t make sense to remove the tax credits—and do so with such suddenness—except for the odd political reality of this year and the way the debate in Congress was dominated by fiscal hardliners.
But the push and pull of adding or subtracting subsidies will ultimately matter less than larger factors, such as the long-term decline in battery costs and the increase in battery efficiency.
In the meantime, the rough sales numbers are going to continue. Let’s reconvene next year at this time and we’ll have a better sense of what the recovery looks like.

Other stories about the energy transition to take note of this week:
Farewell NREL. Hello NLR? Longtime readers of this newsletter know that I often rely on data and expertise from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Now I’m going to need to get used to calling it the National Laboratory of the Rockies, following a name change instituted by the Trump administration that I wrote about for ICN. If the name change turns out to be indicative of a shift in mission for this institution, that’s bad news for the United States and the world, according to the people I interviewed.
Low-Income Families in Illinois Are Going Electric for Free: Hundreds of families have benefited from an Illinois program that pays for home electrification, as Kari Lydersen reports for Canary Media. The initiative is part of a 2021 state energy law, and it’s run by electricity utilities. While the program is small in scale, it gives a sense of what will be needed to allow for a shift away from fossil fuels for the current housing stock.
Murdoch-Owned News Outlets Wrongly Blamed Renewable Energy for New Jersey Rate Hikes: The watchdog organization Media Matters analyzed how news outlets owned by Rupert Murdoch went to great lengths to blame renewable energy for high electricity prices in New Jersey ahead of that state’s gubernatorial election. This scapegoating of renewables overlooks several larger factors, including rising electricity demand from data centers, as my colleague Rambo Talabong reports for ICN.
China Leads on Renewables and EVs: We’ve gotten used to the idea that China has become the world leader in renewable energy and electric vehicles, but the scale of that lead is so large that it’s shocking to see. Data from McKinsey shows China’s growth in market share, including 63 percent of the world’s EV sales, as Amy Harder reports for Axios.

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)Maybe there are lessons to be learned from the federal government shutdown. One of those lessons might be the way the sudden lack of federal funding shines a light on the hidden problems of society that we don’t think about or don’t want to think about. One of those problems is hunger.
As the shutdown progressed, the deadline approached for funding to run out for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. The federal SNAP program offers food assistance to 42 million low-income Americans. In South Dakota, it provides food assistance to 75,000 citizens.
That 75,000 number may be hard to quantify. Think of it this way: The combined populations of three of South Dakota’s largest communities totals about 75,000. If you live in Brookings, Aberdeen or Watertown, take a look around at your family, your neighbors, your co-workers. Now imagine them all hungry as the federal SNAP funds dry up. It’s hard to believe so many people in South Dakota are dependent on the federal government for food.
South Dakota won’t tap reserve funds to fill federal food assistance gap, governor says

Another lesson that emerged from the shutdown is the way that state government reacts to a problem. In the case of the SNAP fund, it was met with a shrug, excuses and an admonishment to be generous.
A cynic would say that politics played a role here. With President Donald Trump working overtime to make sure that SNAP funds were withheld from the people who need them, there was no sign that the state’s Republican leadership was going to make waves. There’s no telling that Trump is even aware that there’s a Republican gubernatorial primary brewing for June of next year in South Dakota. Still, the safest precaution for candidates hoping for his endorsement is to follow the big man’s lead for fear of incurring his wrath.
Gov. Larry Rhoden wrote a column about the impending SNAP crisis, blaming Democrats for the shutdown and asking South Dakotans to make donations to local food banks. He also repeated the oft-debunked claim that Democrats were holding government funding hostage in hopes of securing medical benefits for illegal immigrants.
SNAP benefits in South Dakota total $15 million a month, Rhoden explained, bemoaning the logistics of finding a way to replace the federal funds. In an interview with South Dakota Searchlight, the governor said that any money the state invested in replacing SNAP funds wouldn’t be reimbursed by the federal government.
The precedent for investing in an emergency without any hope of reimbursement was set by Rhoden’s predecessor. The National Guard deployments that Kristi Noem ordered to the southern border were made with the full knowledge that Texas wasn’t going to reimburse the state for costs that exceeded $1 million.
Since the state’s hands were tied, Rhoden used his column to encourage South Dakotans to be generous, dig deeper and give to their local food pantries. That’s big talk from someone sitting on $413 million in reserve funds.
The reserves are often referred to as money that the state has set aside for a rainy day. Yet with a veritable monsoon of hunger bearing down on 75,000 South Dakotans, the state’s umbrellas and slickers remained safely tucked away.

The uncertainty of a federal government shutdown touches all citizens. Imagine how much better the state’s SNAP recipients would have felt if they knew that their government was doing something, anything, to recognize their plight.
No one would expect the state to reinvent the federal SNAP infrastructure that puts funds on payment cards that recipients can use to buy food. However, it wouldn’t take that much effort to pull together a loose coalition of state, local and tribal officials along with grocers and the people who run food pantries.
No one would expect the state to drop $15 million a month to replace the federal funds. However, someone in the coalition may have a million-dollar idea that makes it easier for grocers to give extra food to their local food banks. With the prospect of the state investing some money, it may be easier for food banks to ease their restrictions on how often someone can go to them for food.
Fortunately, the shutdown ended and federal funds flowed to SNAP accounts once again. However, as so many South Dakotans faced an uncertain future about how they were going to feed their families, it would have been comforting to know that their state government was doing something more substantial than just asking them to rely on the kindness of strangers.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_9985-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-06 08:56:27.257343

(Courtesy of the Washington Legislature)Washington lawmakers are warming up for a sprint.
They’ve been pre-filing bills and holding press conferences this week, knowing they’ll have just 60 days to drive their policy ideas through the legislative process once next year’s session starts Jan. 12.
Being proactive, they hope, will get them on the radar of committee and caucus leaders who hold great sway on what legislation will be considered. Competition will be tough. Hundreds of bills introduced but not enacted in the last session are already well-positioned for early votes in the House or Senate.
Here’s a look at a few new bills now in the hopper.
Tax the protest
Not a single Republican legislator voted this year for a new law imposing the retail sales tax on more services, such as temporary staffing, certain digital advertising, and security services.
Now that this tax law is in effect, a Republican state senator wasted little time in pursuing a change to make sure it covers the profession of protesting.

With Senate Bill 5819, Sen. Leonard Christian, R-Spokane Valley, proposes to expand the definition of temporary staffing services to include “providing workers as paid protestors to any person, business, or other entity for limited periods of time to supplement or support a public protest.”
Coverage of protests at the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Portland sparked Christian’s interest. “You see some people over and over on the protest lines,” he said.
If it’s happening here, or if a group is paying Washington residents to protest in Oregon, it probably should be subject to the tax, he said.
“This idea came from the other side of the aisle, saying there’s no such thing as a paid protester,” Christian said. “If the state thinks it can get some money, well, any money is better than nothing with the budget situation.”
Embracing nuclear power
Washington has doggedly pursued ways to slash greenhouse gas emissions and curb the state’s appetite for fossil fuels.
It means securing greater supplies of clean energy to power homes, cars and businesses. Solar, wind and hydropower are cornerstones of the state’s strategy. Some heavyweight lawmakers from opposite sides of the aisle think nuclear energy should be one as well.
Identical bills pre-filed in the House and the Senate push the state to more aggressively embrace nuclear energy. They direct the state Department of Commerce to publish a “nuclear power strategic framework” identifying opportunities and obstacles to encouraging, enticing and permitting development of new fission nuclear power generation facilities.
Rep. Stephanie Barnard, R-Pasco, and House Majority Leader Joe Fitzgibbon, D-West Seattle, teamed up in the House while Senate Minority Leader John Braun, R-Centralia and Sen. Sharon Shewmake, D-Bellingham, are the lead sponsors in the Senate.
There is a catch. Commerce will not get any state dollars. It must secure enough private funds to do the work, or it won’t get done.
Other tax matters
This week brought proposals to impose a new tax on businesses, restore a tax break on bullion and hike a fee used to help new car buyers.
Rep. Jeremie Dufault, R-Selah, wants to reinstate a tax exemption on the sale of precious metals and bullion. It is one of a handful of tax breaks Democrats eliminated last session with Senate Bill 5794. If the tax break comes back, the state would lose out on $129 million over the course of this budget and the next one.
Rep. Shaun Scott, D-Seattle, is forging ahead with his proposed new tax targeting large employers with high-paid workers. Under his bill, companies with more than 20 employees and $5 million in gross receipts would pay a tax on payroll expenses for those workers earning more than $125,000 a year. He held a press conference Tuesday to tout it.
Two Democratic senators filed the first fee increase proposed for the next session.  It comes at the request of the Attorney General Nick Brown. The bill from Sens. Marcus Riccelli of Spokane and Derek Stanford of Bothell would increase the fee auto buyers pay for the new motor vehicle arbitration account to $6. It is now $3. 
It would be the first update in over three decades to the fee, according to the attorney general’s office. Money is used to help new vehicle owners who have problems with warranty repairs. The account is projected to run into a deficit this fiscal year and an increase would ensure it remains financially solvent.
Tuition break
Washington’s higher education institutions are reeling from lawmakers’ handiwork last session that led to budget cuts, tuition hikes and a crimping of the state’s generous financial aid programs.
Enter Rep. Julia Reed, D-Seattle, with an attempt to reset the scales. 
Her legislation titled “Adjusting higher education funding” would cut tuition by 10% a year for three school years starting in the fall of 2027 and expand eligibility for the Washington College Grant program.
To pay for the changes, she proposes to erase the cap on annual payments of the state’s “advanced computing surcharge.” This may be a sticking point.
This tax is paid by firms with global revenue above $25 billion — think Microsoft and Amazon — and is spent to expand student access to higher education through efforts like the Washington College Grant. Under a law passed last session, the annual cap on payments, now $9 million, will rise to $75 million per taxpayer on Jan. 1.
The notion of erasing it completely came up last session. It may be too soon to revisit.
Political hate crimes
Sen. Phil Fortunato, R-Auburn, is once again proposing to make it a hate crime to assault or threaten a person, or damage their property because of their “political affiliation.”
This isn’t his first attempt. Earlier this year, when the state Senate debated and approved an expansion of the state’s hate crime law, Fortunato offered an amendment to add political affiliation to the law’s roster of characteristics, such as race, religion, gender, and sexual orientation
At the time, Fortunato cited an incident at Washington State University in which a student, described as a Republican and member of Turning Point USA, was reportedly attacked by two university employees while wearing a “Trump 2024: Take America Back” hat.
“If we’re going to protect people from violence based on who they are or what they believe, then that must include political views,” Fortunato said at the time. “Otherwise, the law is just a political tool for the majority party.”
In Washington, hate crime offenses are a class C felony that carries a potential penalty of up to 5 years behind bars, a fine of up to $10,000, or both.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/hopper.jpg,,,2025-12-06 07:57:03.136111

Kennedy Jr. appears before the Senate Finance Committee at the Dirksen Senate Office Building on Sept. 4, 2025 in Washington, D.C. (Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)The United States is poised to lose its measles-free status next year. If that happens, the country will enter an era in which outbreaks are common again.
More children would be hospitalized because of this preventable disease. Some would lose their hearing. Some would die. Measles is also expensive. A new study — not yet published in a scientific journal — estimates that the public health response to outbreaks with only a couple of cases costs about $244,000. When a patient requires hospital care, costs average $58,600 per case. The study’s estimates suggest that an outbreak the size of the one in West Texas earlier this year, with 762 cases and 99 hospitalizations, costs about $12.6 million.
America’s status hinges on whether the country’s main outbreaks this year stemmed from the big one in West Texas that officially began Jan. 20. If these outbreaks are linked, and go on through Jan. 20 of next year, the U.S. will no longer be among nations that have banished the disease.
“A lot of people worked very hard for a very long time to achieve elimination — years of figuring out how to make vaccines available, get good vaccine coverage, and have a rapid response to outbreaks to limit their spread,” said Paul Rota, a microbiologist who recently retired from a nearly 40-year career at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Instead of acting fast to prevent a measles comeback, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a lawyer who founded an anti-vaccine organization before taking the helm at the Department of Health and Human Services, has undermined the ability of public health officials to prevent and contain outbreaks by eroding trust in vaccines. The measles vaccine is safe and effective: Only 4% of nearly 1,800 confirmed U.S. cases of measles this year have been in people who had received two doses.
Kennedy has fired experts on the vaccine advisory committee to the CDC and has said, without evidence, that vaccines may cause autism, brain swelling, and death. On Nov. 19, scientific information on a CDC webpage about vaccines and autism was replaced with false claims. Kennedy told The New York Times that he ordered the change.
“Do we want to go back into a prevaccine era where 500 kids die of measles each year?” asked Demetre Daskalakis, a former director of the CDC’s national immunization center, who resigned in protest of Kennedy’s actions in August. He and other scientists said the Trump administration appears to be occupied more with downplaying the resurgence of measles than with curbing the disease.
HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said in a statement that vaccination remains the most effective tool for preventing measles and that the “CDC and state and local health agencies continue to work together to assess transmission patterns and ensure an effective public health response.”
Looking for Links
CDC scientists are indeed tracking measles, alongside researchers at health departments and universities. To learn whether outbreaks are linked, they’re looking at the genomes of measles viruses, which contain all their genetic information. Genomic analyses could help reveal the origin of outbreaks and their true size, and alert officials to undetected spread.
Scientists have conducted genomic analyses of HIV, the flu, and covid for years, but it’s new for measles because the virus hasn’t been much of a problem in the U.S. for decades, said Samuel Scarpino, a public health specialist at Northeastern University in Boston. “It’s important to get a surveillance network into place so that we could scale up rapidly if and when we need it,” he said.
“We are working with the CDC and other states to determine whether what we’re seeing is one large outbreak with continued spread from state to state,” said Kelly Oakeson, a genomics researcher at the Utah Department of Health and Human Services.
At first glance, the ongoing outbreak in Utah and Arizona, with 258 cases as of Dec. 1, seems linked to the one in Texas because they’re caused by the same strain of measles, D8-9171. But this strain is also spreading throughout Canada and Mexico, which means the outbreaks could have been sparked separately from people infected abroad. If that happened, this technicality could spare the U.S. from losing its status, Rota said. Being measles-free means the virus isn’t circulating in a country continuously year-round.
Canada lost its measles-elimination status in November because authorities couldn’t prove that various outbreaks from the D8-9171 strain were unrelated, said Daniel Salas, executive manager of the comprehensive immunization program at the Pan American Health Organization. The group, which works with the World Health Organization, includes health officials from countries in North, South, and Central America, and the Caribbean. It makes a call on measles elimination based on reports from scientists in the countries it represents.
Early next year, PAHO will hear from U.S. scientists. If their analyses suggest that measles has spread continuously for a year within the U.S., the organization’s director may revoke the country’s status as measles-free.
“We expect countries to be transparent about the information they have,” Salas said. “We will ask questions, like, ‘How did you determine your findings, and did you consider other angles?’”
In anticipation of PAHO’s assessment, Oakeson and other researchers are studying how closely the D8-9171 strains in Utah match others. Instead of looking at only a short snippet of genes that mark the strain, they’re analyzing the entire genome of the measles virus, about 16,000 genetic letters long. Genetic mutations occur naturally over time, and the accumulation of small changes can act like a clock, revealing how much time has ticked by between outbreaks. “This tells us the evolutionary history of samples,” Oakeson said.
For example, if one child directly infects another, the kids will have matching measles viruses. But measles viruses infecting people at the start of a large outbreak would be slightly different than those infecting people months later.
Although the Texas and Utah outbreaks are caused by the same strain, Oakeson said, “more fine-grained details are leading us to believe they aren’t super closely related.” To learn just how different they are from each other, scientists are comparing them with measles virus genomes from other states and countries.
Ideally scientists could pair genetic studies with shoe-leather investigations into how each outbreak started. However, many investigations have come up dry because the first people infected haven’t sought care or contacted health departments. As in West Texas, the outbreak in Utah and Arizona is concentrated in close-knit, undervaccinated communities that are leery of government authorities and mainstream medicine.
Researchers are also trying to learn how many measles cases have gone undetected. “Confirmed cases require testing, and in some communities, there’s a cost to going to the hospital to get tested: a tank of gas, finding a babysitter, missing work,” Andrew Pavia, an infectious disease doctor at the University of Utah, said. “If your kid has a measles rash but isn’t very sick, why would you bother?”
Subtle Surveillance
Pavia is part of a nationwide outbreak surveillance network led by the CDC. A straightforward way to figure out how large an outbreak is would be through surveys, but that’s complicated when communities don’t trust public health workers.
“In a collaborative setting, we could administer questionnaires asking if anyone in a household had a rash and other measles symptoms,” Pavia said, “but the same issues that make it difficult to get people to quarantine and vaccinate make this hard.”
Instead, Pavia and other researchers are analyzing genomes. A lot of variation suggests an outbreak spread for weeks or months before it was detected, infecting many more people than known.
A less intrusive mode of surveillance is through wastewater. This year, the CDC and state health departments have launched efforts to test sewage from households and buildings for measles viruses that infected people shed. A study in Texas found that this could function as an early warning system, alerting public health authorities to an outbreak before people show up in hospitals.
The quiet research of CDC scientists stands in stark contrast to its dearth of public-facing actions. The CDC hasn’t held a single press briefing on measles since President Donald Trump took office, and its last publication on measles in the agency’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report was in April.
Rather than act fast to limit the size of the Texas outbreak, the Trump administration impeded the CDC’s ability to communicate quickly with Texas officials and slowed the release of federal emergency funds, according to investigations by KFF Health News. Meanwhile Kennedy broadcast mixed messages on vaccines and touted unproven treatments.
Daskalakis said that as the outbreak in Texas worsened, his CDC team was met by silence when they asked to brief Kennedy and other HHS officials.
“Objectively they weren’t helping with the Texas outbreak, so if we lose elimination, maybe they’ll say, ‘Who cares,’” Daskalakis said.
Nixon, the HHS spokesperson, said Kennedy responded strongly to the Texas outbreak by directing the CDC to help provide measles vaccines and medications to communities, expediting measles testing, and advising doctors and health officials. The U.S. retains its elimination status because there’s no evidence of continuous transmission for 12 months, he added.
“Preliminary genomic analysis suggests the Utah and Arizona cases are not directly linked to Texas,” the CDC’s acting director, Deputy HHS Secretary Jim O’Neill, wrote on the social platform X.
Given Kennedy’s distortions of data on vitamin A, Tylenol, and autism, Daskalakis said the Trump administration may insist that outbreaks aren’t linked or that PAHO is wrong.
“It will be quite a stain on the Kennedy regime if he is the health secretary in the year we lose elimination status,” he said. “I think they will do everything they can to cast doubt on the scientific findings, even if it means throwing scientists under the bus.”

This is Stories From The States. I’m Chris Fitzsimon. Here at States Newsroom, we know there’s a lot going on around the country every week, in every state. This week, we’re talking wind turbines, specifically the ones you’d see over big bodies of water to help generate power. The Trump administration isn’t a big fan, apparently, of the renewable energy resource. They’ve canceled millions in federal funding to support wind infrastructure, but states like Connecticut and Rhode Island are still investing in renewable energy. One of their major collaborative projects called Revolution Wind was 80% completed, and developers thought they were in the clear, but the Trump administration abruptly paused the project in August, which was met, as you’d imagine, with a mix of emotions.
Nick Reynolds  
Just so uncertain. It’s not a great feeling when we rely on these jobs and these projects to feed ourselves.
Chris Fitzsimon 
Today, we’re heading over to the New England coast to chat with a tradesman who worked on the Revolution Wind project, but first we’ll talk to a Rhode Island reporter covering the situation.
Chris Fitzsimon  
The Revolution Wind project was already 80% finished, but was abruptly paused by the federal government. In response, the developers of the project filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration. Now, construction is back on after a DC judge issued a preliminary injunction. To give us a rundown about what’s going on along the New England coastline is Nancy Lavin, she’s a senior reporter at the Rhode Island Current. Nancy, thanks for being here. 
Nancy Lavin
Thank you for having me. 
Chris Fitzsimon  
Well, Nancy, give us some background. Let’s try to understand what’s actually happening. Tell us about this Revolution Wind project.
Nancy Lavin
Yeah, so like many of the offshore wind projects that are, we’re seeing under construction or under development up and down the coast, this has been in the works for years. It is a joint project from Orsted, which is a big Danish renewable energy company and another consortium of overseas development companies under the sort of umbrella of Skyborn Renewables. 65 turbines. It’s about 15 miles south of Rhode Island, somewhat close to the Block Island Wind Farm, which everyone in Rhode Island will be the first to tell you, was the first in the country, offshore wind farm. That’s only five. However, this is 65 and once it’s up and running, at its peak, it would generate enough electricity to power 350,000 homes. Rhode Island and Connecticut are the two states that have already, since 2019 been under contract to buy power from this when it is completed. The federal review process, it takes many years. There’s a lease, then there’s scrutiny about environment, construction, impact on fisheries, impact on vessels traveling, marine safety. Rhode Island is also unique in that we have our own coastal Regulatory Council that also gets to weigh in on any offshore wind projects within 30 miles of our state coastline, even though this process is largely governed by the federal government. So all of that was done. They got their final approval in November 2023. 1000 labor workers under unions in Rhode Island have been working on the projects. There’s been a lot of investment in ports in Rhode Island and Connecticut to sort of create the equipment that will lift these massive, you know, skyscraper turbines into the air and the water. There’s all this workforce training that’s been going on to train these specialty technicians and how to construct and maintain and operate these turbines. And then all of a sudden, August, Friday afternoon ruined my weekend. 
Chris Fitzsimon 
Well, it probably ruined a lot of people’s weekend. 
Nancy Lavin
Yeah, seriously, the Trump administration comes out with the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, which is the agency that really oversees offshore wind permits, sends a letter to the developer of the project, saying, ‘Stop, halt national security’ and not a lot more detail.
Chris Fitzsimon
OK, to help us understand this project was what roughly 80, more than 80% finished already when it was stopped?
Nancy Lavin
Yeah, so they had 45 of the 65 turbines built the two sort of underseas cables that connect the wind turbines to the substations on land where they, you know, connect to the electrical grid were also almost complete, as well as these two pair of substations where the cables sort of all connect. The exact completion date. It was supposed to be up and running about a year from now, but the actual construction was, you know, almost done. There were about a dozen workers actually out at sea and stuck there, just kind of like milling around for two weeks and then before they eventually went back and docked in Connecticut, because they were like, what do we do?
Chris Fitzsimon
What was the reaction when this unexpected work stoppage happened at this point?
Nancy Lavin
Distress, outrage, uncertainty, a mix of reactions, and I think it sort of varied depending. And I will say there was also some celebration, because even though Rhode Island is well known as a Democratic stronghold, we also have a very strong commercial fishing industry. And I have seen covering offshore wind development, particularly at the state level, through the state coastal regulatory process over the last five years, many of the commercial fishermen are strongly opposed to these wind projects. They worry about their safety. They worry about the loss of species. And to be fair, they are recording fewer landings. They are less able to catch the species that they are trying to catch, which is, you know, squid, Atlantic cod. A lot of the things that Rhode Island is known for in the area, however, sort of what the federal government and what most scientists and researchers have said in their very extensive environmental reviews is that’s not necessarily isolated to offshore wind. That’s because of climate change and migration patterns and other disruptions and commercial activity in the water. So those the fishermen, were celebrating. Everyone else, labor leaders, environmental advocates, state officials, our congressional delegation. Not happy.
Chris Fitzsimon 
Just to be clear, folks who had reservations about this or who were opposed, I assume, had chance to speak in this. This was you mentioned. This was a long process. It’s been several years. It went through a lot of hoops. So all sides that seems like would have had a chance to have been heard before now.
Nancy Lavin
Now, yes, although they would argue that the process, you know, has been kind of flawed and rigged from the start. So the interesting thing is, there’s a big overlap in Rhode Island, and I think in other coastal states, between sort of the fishing opposition and right wing backed anti renewable energy groups. So there’s actually this group in Rhode Island called Green Oceans, which, by its name and by its branding on its website, you think is an environmental group. It’s not. It was started by a group of residents in one of the coastal towns in Rhode Island opposed to offshore wind. They are funded by a lot of national right wing conservative groups, and are now actually involved in these federal court cases, which is interesting that they’ve been granted permission to sort of intervene in federal cases in Rhode Island and DC, but perpetuating a lot of misinformation, and really disinformation about offshore wind, killing whales. It certainly didn’t help that another wind project in Massachusetts, Vineyard Wind, over the summer, one of the turbine blades fell off into the water, which was determined to be a manufacturing error. But, you know, certainly solidified all every fear and every concern about the safety of these projects overall, in the mind of detractors. 
Chris Fitzsimon  
What was the reaction to unions, labor officials and folks who are worried about jobs?
Nancy Lavin
Yeah, they were not happy. So you know, our in Rhode Island, like many states, big labor state, the labor organizations, have a lot of influence also in state politics, and labor leaders and state officials have really worked over the last four years to kind of create this quote, unquote, blue economy in Rhode Island, which is not just about the actual projects being built next to Rhode Island that we’re buying power from, but even projects, you know, in New York and New Jersey, that our ports now have this specialty equipment to, like, lay the turbines upright and ship them out to sea, and we have all of these specialized workers who know how to operate them, and who know how to maintain them, and who are taking these specialty apprenticeship programs that have been created in Rhode Island. There was about 1200 union jobs that have already worked on this particular project. And you know, there were rotations going out to sea every two weeks in the wake of the stop work order, some of those laborers, depending on which trades they were in, have actually since taken other jobs because they were like, we can’t just sit here and sit by the phone waiting to see what the federal administration is going to do. So a lot on the line. 
Chris Fitzsimon
I just want to go back to something you said earlier this just to show how massive a project this is. 350,000 homes will eventually be able to be powered by this project?
Nancy Lavin
Yes, and both Rhode Island and Connecticut have not just goals but mandates around decarbonization. So in Rhode Island, we, under state law that was passed a few years ago, have to create or buy credits to offset 100% of our electricity use by 2033 this project was already baked into all of the calculations about our ability to reach that because everyone assumed it was a done deal. And this is, you know, our only major off scale wind project. Things like solar, things like geothermal, are like starting to become more popular, but really do not sort of make the impact that a massive offshore wind farm does. Rhode Island also has a mandate by 2050 to hit zero net carbon emissions. And starting, I believe by 2030 people in the state can sue if we don’t meet these incremental benchmarks of reducing our carbon emissions X percent below the baseline, which is a 1990 level baseline. And again, Revolution Wind was already baked into all of our assumptions about whether we’re going to be able to hit these incremental mandates.
Chris Fitzsimon
You mentioned that one of the points of opposition from the Trump administration was national security, which seems odd. Do we know what that means? What’s the national security risk in this project?
Nancy Lavin
So the initial letter really gave very little detail. It referred back to this memo that this executive order that Trump signed on his first day in office, which made pretty clear, we’re pausing reviews of all wind projects that are not yet fully permanent, because we want to review them against national security and environmental and energy concerns. No one thought revolution wind was really at risk because it had already been permitted and was like mostly built, and then eight months later, the developers get this letter saying, hey, national security, remember this executive order from eight months ago? This is why the letter was two pages, offered very little detail. However, the developers and then the attorneys general for Rhode Island and Connecticut have since sued the Trump administration and in the developers lawsuit, which is was filed in DC and has been sort of playing out the process a little bit faster. Filings from the Justice Department on behalf of the Trump administration offer a little bit more explanation into how they’re justifying this, which is essentially their argument. And the testimony from federal environmental regulators suggest that even though this project got final approval in November 2023 it wasn’t totally final, because according to these federal regulators, they gave the developers a little leeway on some of these additional pieces that were needed, including some details about how building and operation of the wind project would interfere with Department of Defense, or War Department, as it is now being called, at least in these legal documents and by the administration, with Department of Defense boats and with the electromagnetic waves from and frequencies From the turbines underwater, how that would interfere with defense signals. The other piece that they claim was sort of still under review was this detail about how the project would interact with NOAA’s ability to do research into fisheries in the areas. And they say these things weren’t turned in. ‘We asked for them. We asked for them, and then finally we issued a stop work order’. The developers, in response, filed their own, you know, set of responses, which say we’ve been meeting with you guys every two weeks since the Trump administration took office. They say they met with the various agencies two days before the stop work order was issued. None of this was ever said, According to the developers in their testimony.
Chris Fitzsimon
Just to be clear, from the timeline that you gave us, this project sort of had the go ahead or wasn’t, at least wasn’t objected to the first time President Trump was in office, so the Trump administration at some point signed off on it, or at least didn’t stop this project.
Nancy Lavin
Yes, it was actually under the first Trump administration that the Pentagon gave some preliminary sign off on the defense piece of it, ironically.
Chris Fitzsimon  
What do we think changed their mind about this project?
Nancy Lavin
It’s really not super clear, still. You know, they’re offering this additional detail, but the they actually include in the exhibits in the court case, copy of the agreement between the developers and the Department of Defense, and the agreement never says there are these outstanding like written documentations that you need to turn in. It just says you agree, and we agree. You’re going to let us know if anything comes up, and if you change the configuration of the turbines, or the number of the turbines, or anything like that.
Chris Fitzsimon 
Okay, with all that background, where are we? What happens now?
Nancy Lavin
Work has resumed. Our governor and the Connecticut governor had a big sort of parade, if you will, in New London, Connecticut, which is where some of the vessels have been docked, sort of celebrating. Work is back. We’re back on however, if the administration’s record on all of these other state lawsuits on everything from research funding to vaccines to immigration policy, or any indication there will be a challenge to a higher court, and this was actually only in one of the cases that this judge in DC ruled that the work can continue. So still pending, although it obviously would likely to concur with this ruling, is the case in Rhode Island by the attorneys general, which is also arguing that the work should be able to resume.
Chris Fitzsimon 
Well, Nancy, thanks for being with us and helping us understand what’s at stake here. We appreciate your time. 
Nancy Lavin
Thank you for having me.
Chris Fitzsimon 
As of this recording, construction on the revolution wind project is still in progress. However, Rhode Island’s second attempt to build more wind turbines along their coast has not been as successful, according to reporting from the Rhode Island Current a contract between Rhode Island Energy and South Coast Wind fell through. That project would have provided enough electricity to power 125,000 homes. A spokesperson for Rhode Island Energy mentioned the federal uncertainty around the offshore wind industry was a reason why contract negotiations were cut. The project is getting the attention of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management that recently won a case to let them reconsider South Coast Winds federal permits, which were already approved by the Biden administration just last year. Now it’s uncertain if or when the South Coast wind project will happen. A tradesman working on wind infrastructure is worried that might be what the future of all these projects could be. In a moment, we’ll chat with Nick Reynolds, he worked on the Revolution Wind project. We’ll be right back.

Chris Fitzsimon
Imagine this. You go through extensive training to be part of the construction of an offshore wind project, and then it abruptly stops, as we heard Rhode Island current reporter Nancy Lavin say it caused a lot of distress, outrage and uncertainty for many folks working on the Revolution Wind project, including Nick Reynolds. He’s a member of Local 195, of District Council 11, a local painters union, and he joins us now, Nick, thanks for being here. Tell us a little bit about your work. First, what is your work like? 
Nick Reynolds
Yeah, so the trade is industrial painting. So I prep and paint steel, anything, steel, bridges, tanks, wind turbines, wastewater treatment plants, infrastructure.
Chris Fitzsimon 
What is a typical day like? How do you paint a wind turbine? It must not be easy. 
Nick Reynolds
Yeah. So most of the work that I’ve done has been out of band lifts. Those are the machines that you see when you see like new construction of buildings. Those, a lot of times they’re like big orange machines, four wheels with a basket that range anywhere from 40 feet to 160 feet.
Chris Fitzsimon 
So you go up and you go up in the basket? 
Nick Reynolds
Yeah, so our trade performs, like a lot of related work, like it’s not just painting, like we do rigging. So like a lot of times to access repairs on a bridge, for example, we will build scaffolding. One of the types of scaffolding is called Quick deck. It hangs down from chains on the bridge, and then you basically build steel squares that are held together with pins. And it’s modular, so you put up one square, you load the material, and build out until the entire bottom of the bridge is covered, and that’s the access for the repairs.
Chris Fitzsimon
What? What are you thinking when you’re up, when you’re up in that basket?
Nick Reynolds
I remember what I thought when I first started was, ‘I don’t know if I can do this’, 
Chris Fitzsimon
I bet. 
Nick Reynolds
But I think everyone’s scared to fall. But I think over time, you gain confidence on the tools and with the equipment, and it’s just second nature to me at this point. It’s just another day. 
Chris Fitzsimon 
Yeah how long have you been on the Revolution Wind project?
Nick Reynolds
Between all the wind projects, I’ve been working on and off since 2022 so I worked on Revolution, right now I’m working on Sunrise Wind but they’re both in the same facility in the port of Providence, in the hub that, or said, built to help facilitate this work.
Chris Fitzsimon
What was the feeling, or what did you think when you first heard that the Trump administration at some point had paused a revolution wind project?
Nick Reynolds
Initial thoughts were, oh, my God. You know, hopefully there will be, there will be work for me on Monday, because that was all up in the air. There’s no question that those actions have affected, you know, union work hours for not only me and other painters, but all the trades and all the industries that are supporting these projects as well.
Chris Fitzsimon 
Were your co workers feeling the same way? Did you guys talk about it?
Nick Reynolds
Yeah, I mean, there’s, there was so much uncertainty. I remember, like, everyone kind of calling around, and there was like murmuring about work on Monday and then in the future, just so uncertain. It’s not a great feeling when we we rely on these jobs and these projects to feed ourselves.
Chris Fitzsimon
Yeah, and it must, must have been odd. It seems like you would have thought this would have, would have been a job that they would have seen finished. And then all of a sudden to have it screeched to a halt, at least temporarily, it must have been a shock.
Nick Reynolds
Yeah. I mean, I think that we were all under the impression that once all the permitting was done and and it was funded, that there was no legal way to stop the work. So we were a little shocked. And I believe it was cited as like a national security threat was, I just think is absolutely ridiculous. I don’t understand why the Republicans are doing this.
Chris Fitzsimon
Yeah. 
Nick Reynolds
I don’t 
Chris Fitzsimon
What about when it sort of restarted? What was the feeling in your trades or your union about the fact that people were able to go back to work?
Nick Reynolds
I mean, I speak for myself, I was grateful to go back to work, but I think that we all know the reality now is that the people that have invested in these projects aren’t likely to come back and spend money here again. It wouldn’t make sense, would it? I don’t know, like we have done a lot of training, specialized training, in order to just get on these jobs. So it’s takes the wind out of your sails when you put so much effort towards something like a new industry that’s promising for the future, and then something like that happens, it’s just demotivating to say the least.
Chris Fitzsimon
Yeah, I’ll bet. What kind of training did you have, or specialized training? What did you have to learn to do this job or work on these projects.
Nick Reynolds 
Yeah, so obviously, there’s a maritime aspect offshore work. So there was a grant that was issued by the state and Orsted, also funded it partially for additional first aid training, water rescue training, helicopter training and rope access training.
Chris Fitzsimon
That seems fairly complicated.
Nick Reynolds
Complicated and a huge commitment of time. Yeah.
Chris Fitzsimon
How long have you been in this kind of work?
Nick Reynolds
I’ve been working in construction for about 10 years, and in this particular industry for eight. 
Chris Fitzsimon
What are your thoughts about the future of the industry?
Nick Reynolds
The industry isn’t going anywhere because it’s infrastructure, like my work will be needed in the future, but like wind as a whole, I just, I just can’t imagine people wanting to make an investment in something that someone can just make a decision one day and shut down on a whim.
Chris Fitzsimon 
What would you want people to know? Who you know, they probably just saw the headlines. They might even if they live in, you know, maybe an adjacent state or whatever, and they’ve read about this from the workers perspective, what would you want somebody to know about, what’s happening there, what you guys have gone through and what you’re worried about,
Nick Reynolds  
I think, like maybe a lot of people who have quote, unquote regular jobs or nine to fives, don’t understand that construction work is trying to build the career out of, like many, many temporary projects. So you know, we’re never done. You’re never done looking so to be on a project that has years of work hours that are well funded, and to take that away is is a huge blow to like the working class of Rhode Island and construction workers in general. That’s how we pay for food. That’s how we pay for doctor’s visits, dental visits, glasses, gas car insurance, life. You know, money is the feel for choices, and if we’re not working, we’re pretty limited, to say the least. 
Chris Fitzsimon
What would you do if you weren’t doing this? Do you think? 
Nick Reynolds
If I weren’t doing construction or this? 
Chris Fitzsimon 
Yeah, yeah, 
Nick Reynolds
Starve. I think I’ve tried many things. I might, I might bartend been successful at that in the past, but you know, those jobs don’t really come with health insurance, do they?
Chris Fitzsimon
Yeah, and they’re not usually union jobs, I’m guessing. 
Nick Reynolds
No, they’re not. They never are. 
Chris Fitzsimon
Well, Nick, we really appreciate what you’re doing up there and and that you took some time to talk to us. Thank you very much.
Nick Reynolds 
I appreciate that you’re interested, it’s a big deal to me.
Chris Fitzsimon
Coming up shortly, Evening Wrap newsletter writer Danielle Gaines will join us with the top stories she’s looking out for, and with one last thing, we’ll be right back.
Nelle Dunlap
Hi, it’s Nelle Dunlap, product and engineering director at state’s newsroom. At State’s Newsroom, we believe journalism should be fair, fearless and free, with reporters working on the ground in all 50 states and Washington DC, we provide non partisan coverage of the state issues that matter most to you. You can subscribe to our work by going to states newsroom.com/subscribe.
Chris Fitzsimon
Well, now it comes to my favorite time of every week, talking to Danielle Gaines, the author of the State’s Newsroom Evening Wrap newsletter. Danielle, how are you? 
Danielle Gaines
Hello, I’m good. How are you good? 
Chris Fitzsimon
Tell us something that caught your eye this week?
Danielle Gaines
Yeah, we had a couple of stories, kind of both centering on resident responses to immigration enforcement across the country. And so we had this story out of Oregon, where there’s now widespread opposition to possible federal government plans to build a detention center at an airport hangar in this like relatively small Central Coast town, residents and officials actually pieced it all together. So their Coast Guard rescue helicopter was moved 70 miles away. A defense contractor looked into leasing land next to the airport. Private companies began putting out ads for detention correctional officers. And so since they put it all together, there have now been, like multiple lawsuits, and state and local and federal lawmakers have all mobilized kind of against this plan. So I found that very interesting. And then in Tennessee, where the Memphis Safe Task Force is operating in a similar vein, there is this rapid response group that was set up V 901, and they report on immigration activities. They started during the first Trump administration. They say they now receive more than 100 calls a day, and our story included vivid details from just one example. So an alert went out about a woman hiding in a closet with her twin toddlers. She didn’t know what to do as agents were surrounding her home, a volunteer rushed to the scene and found a tow truck blocking the street, blaring the song, “Bad Boys”. 
Chris Fitzsimon
Oh my god. 
Danielle Gaines
Agents had thrown chemical agents into the house, and the family was forced out and through volunteers, they’re at least covering these stories and spreading information.
Chris Fitzsimon
Yeah, it’s really interesting. It feels like it’s happening more and more communities are responding and learning from what happened in the previous communities.
Danielle Gaines
Yeah, and that’s really how people are learning how to move around safely in some cases.
Chris Fitzsimon
All right, give us something that’s coming up. What are you looking to see?
Danielle Gaines
You know, I’m looking out. Our friends at Stateline this week had a story about the Justice Department suing six more states for detailed information about their voter rolls. That means that the Justice Department has now sued a dozen states for this information. The first round of lawsuits was filed in September. They are all aimed at democratic or purple states that won’t turn over unredacted copies of the lists, so they’re looking for driver’s license numbers, partial social security numbers. The Trump administration says this is for election integrity efforts, and democratic officials are concerned about privacy issues and that this will be part of an immigration verification tool.
Chris Fitzsimon 
It feels like, feels like half the news these days is some version of responding to the new immigration crackdown.
Danielle Gaines
Yeah, and so they’re the six states were sued this week, but then also this week, Colorado, which is facing off with the Trump administration on a lot of different fronts, refused to turn over their information once again. So they also acknowledged they may be part of another future lawsuit.
Chris Fitzsimon
OK, Danielle, now that I think the moment we’ve all been waiting for, what is one last thing for this week?
Danielle Gaines
Yeah, it’s always hard to pick, and I love just having a little bit of a light spot when we’re reading all the news. So in South Dakota, near Nebraska, there is a new display going up. It’s called firehenge, and it is right off of I-90. So firehenge is a ring of 10 ton fire trucks on their like back end raised up to the sky, leaning against each other, resembling Stonehenge from England. And it is actually a promotion for a firehouse, but it is still something to behold. Looks very interesting. And if you don’t know, this is very near to carhenge, which is already a thing in Nebraska. And actually the city of Alliance, Nebraska manages it. They said that they’re not really threatened by firehenge coming up nearby. And so it was just kind of a fun story from the Nebraska Examiner looking at, like, kind of the competition between these two states for these two, like quirky roadside attractions.
Chris Fitzsimon
That is fascinating, carhenge and firehenge,
Danielle Gaines
Yes, and they are far from the only henges, by the way. So as part of firehenge, there is doghenge, which is a bunch of fire hydrants. And then there’s a foamhenge in Virginia, truckhenge, which is vintage farm trucks in Topeka, Kansas, phonehenge in South Carolina, which is phone booths. And if you go and read our story, we also have like henges of the past, things that just didn’t quite have staying power.
Chris Fitzsimon
Well, we now are up to date on henges. Thank you.
Danielle Gaines
Yes, very interesting. And we’ve got photos too, so you should go look at them.
Chris Fitzsimon
Yeah, definitely check that out. Thank you very much, Danielle. 
Danielle Gaines

,Mississippi Today,2025-12-06 12:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,What civil rights action looks like 70 years after the Montgomery Bus Boycott,"Kim Chandler and Jaylen Green, Associated Press",,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/12/06/70-years-after-montgomery-bus-boycott/,"Black residents' boycott of city buses in Montgomery, Alabama, started 70 years ago and lasted more than one year. It was widely considered the beginning of the modern Civil Rights Movement.","MONTGOMERY, Ala. — Doris Crenshaw was 12 years old on Dec. 5, 1955, when she and her sister eagerly rushed door to door in their neighborhood, distributing flyers prepared by activists planning a boycott of city buses in Montgomery, Alabama.
“Don’t ride the bus to work, to town, to school or any place on Monday,” the flyers read, urging people to attend a mass meeting that evening.
There was a sense of urgency. Days earlier, Rosa Parks, the secretary of the local NAACP chapter, had been the latest Black person arrested for refusing to give up a bus seat to a white passenger on the segregated buses. For 381 days, an estimated 40,000 Black residents stayed off city buses — opting to walk, ride in car pools or take Black-owned cabs — until a legal challenge struck down bus-segregation laws.

“In this city there was a groundswell of a need to do something about what was going on in the buses, because a lot of people were arrested,” recalled Crenshaw, now 82.
Friday marked the 70th anniversary of the beginning of the Montgomery Bus Boycott, and many of the boycott organizers’ descendants, including those of late civil rights icons the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and the Rev. Ralph D. Abernathy Sr., planned to reunite in the Alabama city where it all started. Widely considered the beginning of the modern Civil Rights Movement, the bus boycott demonstrated the power of sustained nonviolent protest and economic pressure that continues to provide a model for the activism today.
A group of national organizers encouraged people to avoid the temptation of Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals, aiming the action at corporations like Target and Amazon over their stance of diversity initiatives and financial backing of the Trump administration.
“Any time there can be a strategic and organized response to corporate behavior or exclusionary policy, communities should be free to identify the best approach to address the harm that’s being created,” NAACP President Derrick Johnson said in a phone interview Thursday.
“Boycotting is one tool in the toolbox. At the NAACP, we call it selective buying campaigns,” said Johnson, who lives in Jackson, Mississippi.
Boycott history
Parks’ Dec. 1, 1955, arrest was the final catalyst for the boycott that had been quietly discussed by some activists in Alabama’s capital city. The seats at the front of the city buses were reserved for white people. Black passengers were forced to sit in the back and were expected to give up their seats if the white section became full.
Contrary to the story that is often told, Parks, who died in 2005, wrote that she was not particularly tired from work that day when she took a stand by keeping her seat.
“No, the only tired I was, was tired of giving in,” Parks wrote in her autobiography.
Parks was a beloved figure in the town, Crenshaw recalled. She led the NAACP Youth Council and Crenshaw and other members would meet at the Parks’ apartment each week.

Pulling off the boycott for more than a year took an extreme amount of dedication and discipline, Crenshaw recalled.
“We walked, and we kept walking,” said Crenshaw, who walked across town to school each day. “We never got back on those buses.”
Crenshaw went on to a lifetime of civil rights activism. She organized National Council of Negro Women chapters as a southern field representative and was a member of President Jimmy Carter’s domestic policy staff, focused on small and minority business issues. She founded The Southern Youth Leadership Development Institute, mentoring young people as Parks once did for her.
“Everywhere you go, people say they are inspired by Mrs. Parks and by what happened with the Montgomery Bus Boycott,” Crenshaw said.
Boycotting in the spirit of Montgomery
While the specific methods have changed, the underlying goal of leveraging the economic power of the community to drive social and policy change remains the same, said Deborah Scott, the CEO of Georgia Stand-Up. The organization is focused on economic and social justice issues and emphasizes engaging and developing the next generation of activists and leaders.
Scott said she was a teenager when she arrived in Atlanta more than 30 years ago to begin organizing with the Southern Christian Leadership Conference around the anti-apartheid movement. She worked to free South African anti-apartheid activist Nelson Mandela and to establish a holiday honoring King.

She learned from the Rev. James Orange, the late prominent civil rights activist and King assistant, who taught her the value of preparing young people to work for however long it takes to enact change.
She remembers some of the important questions he posed: “What are you going to do after you tweeted, after you put the word out to show up? What are you going to say when you get to the microphone? What are you going to do and how will you conduct yourself in these situations?”
Just like the original Montgomery boycott, which sought access to affordable, non-discriminatory transportation by bringing large groups of people together to drive change, the success of boycotts after it required an unshakeable sense of unity.
“Everything is about relationships, but relationship organizing is the thing that is the same,” she said.
With widespread use of social media platforms, today’s boycotts look different. Scott said the biggest change in boycotting with the newer generation is the focus on using consumer purchasing power to pressure companies to change their policies or practices.
“We’re encouraging people to really dig deep about where they want to spend their dollars,” Scott said.
Next generation takes action
Madison Pugh, at 13, is about the same age that Crenshaw was when she became involved in the Montgomery Bus Boycott. The eighth grader decided with her grandmother not to shop at Target after the retailing giant announced it was phasing out its diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.
She said the retailer’s decision felt like a betrayal and a step backward.
Living in Montgomery, Pugh is growing up surrounded by the history of the civil rights movement that transpired decades before she was born. The stories from Crenshaw and others are more than just inspiring, she said.

“It’s saddening to the heart to know that a whole group of people weren’t allowed to go somewhere and have an education or be treated as humans because they were a different skin color,” Pugh said. “It definitely lets me know that the job will never be finished and you have to keep pushing.”
Scott said one of her goals is to help people see the connection between the activism of the past and today.

Trump in 2025 to his Truth Social Media platform in which he several accusations, including that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz is ""seriously retarded."" (Screenshot)Our president just used an ableist slur, again. This time, he said a former political opponent (Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota) of his was “seriously r*******.” 
He used the same word about a year ago, and again before that. I know a lot of you will be more offended at me for simply pointing that out than you are at what he said. You will claim I am trying to be the PC police and stop people from saying what they want. But I want to be clear: I’m not policing anyone’s speech here. He can use the R-word all he wants and no one, especially little-ol’-me,  is going to stop that. You should also feel free to use the R-word all you want; I certainly use it as often as I want and feel you should have that same right. 
The amount I like using the R-word is never. Did I use it when I was a kid? Absolutely, but I’m a middle-aged, Gen-X guy, and almost nothing about my childhood should be considered relevant anymore except perhaps as source material for streaming shows and fashion.  But today, and for the last 30 or so years, I haven’t used the word because it’s hateful and using the word does not reflect what I am or want to become. 
Political appeals to ableism,  whether explicit or in more subtle dog-whistles,  perpetuate stereotypes about people with disabilities being unfit to contribute to public discourse, run for office, and occupy leadership positions in our society. To be clear, President Donald Trump is not the only politician to do this, he just is the most recent. Lest you think this is a leftist hit job; I find Former President Obama’s jab at President Trump last year, suggesting he wears diapers, repulsive and irrelevant to whether anyone should vote for him. The choice of any politician to use words that hurt people with disabilities devalues disabled people as humans and as voters. 
Today, and historically, labeling a political opponent as disabled is only ever done to say that person is bad or unqualified. Disability is never used to describe a candidate’s strengths and deep knowledge of the experiences of the 29% of Montanans with disabilities and the 31% with mental illness. People only use the R-word, joke about incontinence, or label their opponent as “demented,” “insane,” or “crazy” to devalue them, and they only do that because in their hearts they feel no common humanity with people who have those disabilities and thus see no value in the lives of people with disabilities. That may sound harsh, you may feel a twinge of defensiveness if you’ve used words like this recently, but I will tell you that every time disability is used as a weapon against a specific person, it is simultaneously used as a weapon to hurt members of the disability community at large and those of us with disabilities see it and feel it.  
So you can disagree all you want, but know you won’t change what it feels like for me and other people with disabilities when we hear these attacks on our existence.  For decades, individuals with disabilities and disability groups made efforts to stop the use of ableist language. And they have made real progress.  Professional groups started abandoning ableist language and even pop culture looked to start respecting people with disabilities more. The culmination of rejecting ableist language came in 2010 with the passage of Rosa’s Law which requires “intellectual disability” replace the R-word in federal law. But ever since, I have felt the pendulum swing back. 
Disability Rights Montana asks all of Montana to consider how they use language. We use language both in the sending and receiving of words, so it starts with the words you say but it also includes the way we hear the words used by others. Does suggesting or hinting that a political opponent is “mentally unfit,” or is incontinent excite you to think worse of that opponent and be more supportive of your team? 
Go one step deeper. 
Is it that you really think the person has that disability and it truly prevents rational decision making on their part, or do you just really dislike the decisions that person makes and it feels like an emotionally satisfying way to minimize them for pursuing a path you find repugnant? Do you think incontinence has anything to do with foreign or domestic policy decision making? Or do you think it makes the target of the attack look weak and generally incompetent? 
I have dyslexia, a heart condition and mental illness and I’m an incredibly effective advocate and leader. I know strong, highly competent people at the peak of their fields who cannot control their bladders or bowels. I know incredibly insightful, smart, caring, and powerful leaders who have intellectual disabilities. I know cruel, flippant, disrespectful geniuses who would make horrible leaders. Don’t use me and my community as your lazy way of saying something is poorly thought out or doesn’t conform to your moral view of the world. Find better words like bad, ridiculous, thoughtless, mean-spirited, unsupported, reckless, etc.
I would love to see a day when candidates for office can talk about their disabilities with pride and connect as peers with the 29% of Montanans with disabilities and 31% with mental illness, ready to offer their lived experiences as credentials for public service. This would be no different than the person running for office as a small business owner saying they understand what we need to make our communities work better for entrepreneurs, or a teacher running on their experience in the classroom as a strength in building education policy in the legislature. 
Until we have open, proud disabled political leaders, this is my reminder to you that ableist name calling doesn’t just hurt the candidate it is hurled at, it hurts the person slinging those slurs in the eyes of many disabled Montanans, and it hurts the disability community directly because it reminds us and further reinforces in others that we continue to live in a world that does not value disabled people’s contributions to our communities.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Trump-tweet-Truth-541x1024.jpg,,,2025-12-06 06:57:04.086916

Russ Fulcher, R-Idaho, speaks with Republican supporters at the Idaho GOP election night watch party at the Grove Hotel in Boise, Idaho, on Nov. 8, 2022. (Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)Idaho Republican Congressman Russ Fulcher is hoping to expand the use of private, short-term health insurance.
Fulcher on Thursday announced the introduction of the Removing Insurance Gaps for Health Treatment (RIGHT) Act of 2025, which would extend the maximum allowance for short-term health plans from four months to up to three years. 
Short-term, limited-duration insurance, known as STLDI, are private insurance plans designed to cover temporary gaps in health coverage. The plans are sometimes less expensive than plans offered through state health insurance marketplace plans, but do not always cover as many services and are not subject to the same consumer protection regulations as those compliant with the Affordable Care Act. 
“Four months is far too short a limit, posing undue stress and uncertainty on Americans who would otherwise be left without coverage,” Fulcher said in a press release. “My bill, the RIGHT Act, expands STLDI plans to a full year, with the option to renew for up to three years. This is a practical, no-cost approach that offers families more choice, control, and flexibility to select the healthcare options that work best for them.”

Insurers offering short term plans can deny coverage for people with pre-existing conditions or exclude coverage for those conditions, such as cancer or pregnancy, according to a 2025 analysis by the health policy organization KFF. The analysis also found that “the lowest-cost short-term plan premium for a 40-year-old woman ranges from 6% to 19% higher than the lowest-cost premium for a man.” Regulations under the federal Affordable Care Act, or ACA, prohibit these practices for other types of insurance.  
Short-term plans are sold in 36 states, including Idaho, according to KFF. Plans may be available for three months, with the ability to renew for a total of four months of coverage. 
Federal regulations require short-term insurers to conspicuously notify consumers that the plans are not “comprehensive coverage.” These regulations were crafted in response to misleading marketing and deceptive sales tactics, KFF said. 
The Idaho Department of Insurance in 2019 issued two notices regarding short-term health plans: one warned Idahoans of robocall scams that come “from telemarketing centers and give incomplete information, trying to pass off very limited coverage as comprehensive health insurance,” and the other was a cease and desist letter to a short-term health care insurer soliciting in Idaho that was not licensed to do so. 
The KFF analysis found that the lowest cost short-term plans could cost two-thirds or less than the lowest-cost, unsubsidized Bronze plans sold on the ACA marketplace in the same area. However, the analysis found that the federal premium tax credits, which subsidize marketplace health insurance premium costs, resulted in similarly priced or some cheaper marketplace plans. 
Fulcher introduced the health care bill the same month the enhanced premium tax credits are set to expire, which may cause significant increases in health insurance costs for some.  
In Idaho, the enhanced credits reduced average monthly premiums by more than $400, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. 
The enhanced credits are set to expire at the end of December without congressional action.

(Courtesy of City of Omaha Parks and Recreation)OMAHA — Mayor John Ewing Jr. sees only public good coming from a proposed arrangement to put a major North Omaha city park under the management of a local philanthropic group that already has invested in Miller Park.
Former State Sen. Justin Wayne, however, took to social media to characterize the move as a “quid pro quo” that would be bad for North Omahans.
“So we’re really doing this? A $40 million check gets you your own ‘public park’ in a private trust?” wrote Wayne, a lawyer who is also running for Douglas County District Court clerk.

He continued, “Before Omaha starts auctioning off the commons, let’s talk about what actually happens when cities privatize parks — because the track record is trash.”
The back and forth sets the stage for a proposed arrangement, yet to be approved by the Omaha City Council, between the City of Omaha and Miller Park Trust. Behind the trust is the Lozier Foundation, which has been identified as the buyer of $40 million in housing bonds from the city to accelerate affordable housing development.
Ewing said he had not talked directly to Wayne as of Friday afternoon, but he pushed back on any notion that residents or taxpayers would lose. He said the city would maintain ownership of the 80-acre park and landmark three-story pavilion. 
 ‘No strings attached’

He expects access and community engagement to improve under the nonprofit trust, which would pay for maintenance and programming and allow a stretched city parks department to tend to other duties.
Officials said the City of Omaha under the proposal still would manage the golf course and swimming pool.

“There are no strings attached,” Ewing told the Nebraska Examiner. “They want to be a partner with the city and help us be able to maintain our parks. It will still be a public park available for people to use. It’s not turned over to Lozier or anybody else.”
The trust arrangement, he said, is part of city efforts to improve public spaces and to retain families in the state’s most populous city.
While he wants Miller Park to be the first of more such trust arrangements under his watch, Ewing noted that a similar situation has existed for about five or so years at Lake Cunningham park, led by the Walter Scott Foundation. 
The Lozier Foundation is the family foundation of Allan and Dianne Lozier, which operates independently of the longtime North Omaha-based Lozier manufacturing corporation. Allan was a graduate of Omaha Technical High School and helped grow the Lozier company.
Tre Brashear, chief operating officer, said the trust would be an extension of foundation efforts in North Omaha, which include development of tuition-free Nelson Mandela Elementary and a neighboring early childhood learning center.
Brashear said Lozier Foundation likely would hire experts from the Cunningham trust to provide initial guidance and transition to a free-standing organization with a staff.
“They get to be good partners with the City of Omaha and help us as we look at being a great city for the people of Omaha — that simple,” said Ewing, a North Omaha native.
 Park purpose rewritten?

Wayne, known in the Legislature as a watchdog for his district, said he sees a different scenario brewing. He contended that “the same ugly pattern” turns up where such a model has been tried.
“Public access disappears. The park may still look public, but suddenly the rules change. Hours change. People get nudged out — especially the people who used it the most,” he wrote. 
He told Facebook followers that maintenance drops overtime in such stewardship arrangements. 
“The purpose of the park gets rewritten. It stops serving the community and starts serving development interests, investors or political branding. The neighborhood loses a civic space and gets a marketing asset instead,” he wrote.
Wayne expects “wealthy donors” to gain influence and, eventually, families to be displaced.

Jacqueline Morrison, Omaha’s senior director of economic development, expects the trust to respond more efficiently to community concerns including park lighting, bathroom and other maintenance.
She said the trust would be responsible for mowing, snow removal, picking up trash and activating the pavilion and park by organizing concerts, youth programming, yoga or other events.
Morrison characterized feedback at a “stakeholder” meeting Thursday for park users as positive. Another is scheduled for 10 a.m. Dec. 13 at Nelson Mandela Elementary, 6313 N. 30th St. Park users are asked to provide feedback via a community survey.
Morrison pointed to the The Riverfront park system as a successful public-private partnership, as well as the Cunningham Lake park, which the mayor said has seen millions of dollars in improvements under its trust arrangement.
 ‘Crown jewel’ 

Wayne, in a follow-up interview, said Lozier has been a “great partner” for the community, but he sees the trust arrangement as putting too much control in a private entity. 
He believed Lozier could provide additional funds to improve maintenance and programming without “taking over the park.”
Brashear said the trust’s separate staff, schedule and pay scale would allow it to provide intense focus on Miller Park.
He said the Lozier Foundation, in partnership with the City Parks Department and other donors, has previously helped update Miller Park with amenities such as a new fountain, splash pad, soccer wall and rebuilt pavilion.
“It is a wonderful crown jewel park … and we wanted it to be reflective of that,” he said.
Brashear sees “no economic return” to the foundation and called the trust a well-intended move to ensure park vibrancy and “more robust” programming. “We’re not getting anything back from this.” 
He said that the foundation purchased bonds from the city to help boost affordable housing efforts. The bonds pay the foundation 1% interest, Brasher said, “so we didn’t do it because it was a moneymaker.”
The trust contract would be 10 years, with an option to renew, Brashear said.
“We’re doing this because it’s good for the community and neighborhood,” he said. “We’re getting the satisfaction of trying to make the place we live better.”

(Photo by Jan Sonnenmair/Getty Images)The United States is poised to lose its measles-free status next year. If that happens, the country will enter an era in which outbreaks are common again.
More children would be hospitalized because of this preventable disease. Some would lose their hearing. Some would die.
Measles is also expensive. A new study — not yet published in a scientific journal — estimates that the public health response to outbreaks with only a couple of cases costs about $244,000. When a patient requires hospital care, costs average $58,600 per case. The study’s estimates suggest that an outbreak the size of the one in West Texas earlier this year, with 762 cases and 99 hospitalizations, costs about $12.6 million.
America’s status hinges on whether the country’s main outbreaks this year stemmed from the big one in West Texas that officially began Jan. 20. If these outbreaks are linked, and go on through Jan. 20 of next year, the U.S. will no longer be among nations that have banished the disease.
“A lot of people worked very hard for a very long time to achieve elimination — years of figuring out how to make vaccines available, get good vaccine coverage, and have a rapid response to outbreaks to limit their spread,” said Paul Rota, a microbiologist who recently retired from a nearly 40-year career at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Instead of acting fast to prevent a measles comeback, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a lawyer who founded an anti-vaccine organization before taking the helm at the Department of Health and Human Services, has undermined the ability of public health officials to prevent and contain outbreaks by eroding trust in vaccines. The measles vaccine is safe and effective: Only 4% of more than 1,800 confirmed U.S. cases of measles this year have been in people who had received two doses.
Kennedy has fired experts on the vaccine advisory committee to the CDC and has said, without evidence, that vaccines may cause autism, brain swelling, and death. On Nov. 19, scientific information on a CDC webpage about vaccines and autism was replaced with false claims. Kennedy told The New York Times that he ordered the change.
“Do we want to go back into a prevaccine era where 500 kids die of measles each year?” asked Demetre Daskalakis, a former director of the CDC’s national immunization center, who resigned in protest of Kennedy’s actions in August. He and other scientists said the Trump administration appears to be occupied more with downplaying the resurgence of measles than with curbing the disease.
HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said in a statement that vaccination remains the most effective tool for preventing measles and that the “CDC and state and local health agencies continue to work together to assess transmission patterns and ensure an effective public health response.”

Looking for links
CDC scientists are indeed tracking measles, alongside researchers at health departments and universities. To learn whether outbreaks are linked, they’re looking at the genomes of measles viruses, which contain all their genetic information. Genomic analyses could help reveal the origin of outbreaks and their true size, and alert officials to undetected spread.
Scientists have conducted genomic analyses of HIV, the flu, and covid for years, but it’s new for measles because the virus hasn’t been much of a problem in the U.S. for decades, said Samuel Scarpino, a public health specialist at Northeastern University in Boston. “It’s important to get a surveillance network into place so that we could scale up rapidly if and when we need it,” he said.
“We are working with the CDC and other states to determine whether what we’re seeing is one large outbreak with continued spread from state to state,” said Kelly Oakeson, a genomics researcher at the Utah Department of Health and Human Services.
At first glance, the ongoing outbreak in Utah and Arizona, with 258 cases as of Dec. 1, seems linked to the one in Texas because they’re caused by the same strain of measles, D8-9171. But this strain is also spreading throughout Canada and Mexico, which means the outbreaks could have been sparked separately from people infected abroad. If that happened, this technicality could spare the U.S. from losing its status, Rota said. Being measles-free means the virus isn’t circulating in a country continuously year-round.

Canada lost its measles-elimination status in November because authorities couldn’t prove that various outbreaks from the D8-9171 strain were unrelated, said Daniel Salas, executive manager of the comprehensive immunization program at the Pan American Health Organization. The group, which works with the World Health Organization, includes health officials from countries in North, South, and Central America, and the Caribbean. It makes a call on measles elimination based on reports from scientists in the countries it represents.
Early next year, PAHO will hear from U.S. scientists. If their analyses suggest that measles has spread continuously for a year within the U.S., the organization’s director may revoke the country’s status as measles-free.
“We expect countries to be transparent about the information they have,” Salas said. “We will ask questions, like, ‘How did you determine your findings, and did you consider other angles?’”
In anticipation of PAHO’s assessment, Oakeson and other researchers are studying how closely the D8-9171 strains in Utah match others. Instead of looking at only a short snippet of genes that mark the strain, they’re analyzing the entire genome of the measles virus, about 16,000 genetic letters long. Genetic mutations occur naturally over time, and the accumulation of small changes can act like a clock, revealing how much time has ticked by between outbreaks. “This tells us the evolutionary history of samples,” Oakeson said.
For example, if one child directly infects another, the kids will have matching measles viruses. But measles viruses infecting people at the start of a large outbreak would be slightly different than those infecting people months later.
Although the Texas and Utah outbreaks are caused by the same strain, Oakeson said, “more fine-grained details are leading us to believe they aren’t super closely related.” To learn just how different they are from each other, scientists are comparing them with measles virus genomes from other states and countries.
Ideally scientists could pair genetic studies with shoe-leather investigations into how each outbreak started. However, many investigations have come up dry because the first people infected haven’t sought care or contacted health departments. As in West Texas, the outbreak in Utah and Arizona is concentrated in close-knit, undervaccinated communities that are leery of government authorities and mainstream medicine.
Researchers are also trying to learn how many measles cases have gone undetected. “Confirmed cases require testing, and in some communities, there’s a cost to going to the hospital to get tested: a tank of gas, finding a babysitter, missing work,” Andrew Pavia, an infectious disease doctor at the University of Utah, said. “If your kid has a measles rash but isn’t very sick, why would you bother?”
Subtle surveillance
Pavia is part of a nationwide outbreak surveillance network led by the CDC. A straightforward way to figure out how large an outbreak is would be through surveys, but that’s complicated when communities don’t trust public health workers.
“In a collaborative setting, we could administer questionnaires asking if anyone in a household had a rash and other measles symptoms,” Pavia said, “but the same issues that make it difficult to get people to quarantine and vaccinate make this hard.”
Instead, Pavia and other researchers are analyzing genomes. A lot of variation suggests an outbreak spread for weeks or months before it was detected, infecting many more people than known.
A less intrusive mode of surveillance is through wastewater. This year, the CDC and state health departments have launched efforts to test sewage from households and buildings for measles viruses that infected people shed. A study in Texas found that this could function as an early warning system, alerting public health authorities to an outbreak before people show up in hospitals.
The quiet research of CDC scientists stands in stark contrast to its dearth of public-facing actions. The CDC hasn’t held a single press briefing on measles since President Donald Trump took office, and its last publication on measles in the agency’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report was in April.
Rather than act fast to limit the size of the Texas outbreak, the Trump administration impeded the CDC’s ability to communicate quickly with Texas officials and slowed the release of federal emergency funds, according to investigations by KFF Health News. Meanwhile, Kennedy broadcast mixed messages on vaccines and touted unproven treatments.
Daskalakis said that as the outbreak in Texas worsened, his CDC team was met by silence when they asked to brief Kennedy and other HHS officials.
“Objectively they weren’t helping with the Texas outbreak, so if we lose elimination, maybe they’ll say, ‘Who cares,’” Daskalakis said.
Nixon, the HHS spokesperson, said Kennedy responded strongly to the Texas outbreak by directing the CDC to help provide measles vaccines and medications to communities, expediting measles testing, and advising doctors and health officials. The U.S. retains its elimination status because there’s no evidence of continuous transmission for 12 months, he added.
“Preliminary genomic analysis suggests the Utah and Arizona cases are not directly linked to Texas,” the CDC’s acting director, Deputy HHS Secretary Jim O’Neill, wrote on the social platform X.
Given Kennedy’s distortions of data on vitamin A, Tylenol, and autism, Daskalakis said the Trump administration may insist that outbreaks aren’t linked or that PAHO is wrong.
“It will be quite a stain on the Kennedy regime if he is the health secretary in the year we lose elimination status,” he said. “I think they will do everything they can to cast doubt on the scientific findings, even if it means throwing scientists under the bus.”

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)A federal court last week rejected a joint attempt by Maine and the U.S. Department of Justice to weaken a previous agreement that required the state to improve services so that children with disabilities no longer had to be separated from their families.
In a statement Friday, a coalition of rights organizations said the ruling “preserves essential protections that ensure children with behavioral-health needs will receive integrated, community-based services rather than face unnecessary institutionalization.”
The settlement agreement stemmed from a September 2024 lawsuit filed by the Department of Justice that alleged the state was failing to meet the needs of students that require behavioral health services and violating the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) by separating them from their homes and communities by institutionalizing them or sending them to juvenile detention centers. 
Two months later, the lawsuit was dismissed after the state agreed to implement a robust accountability system with reporting requirements, community outreach and the establishment of an independent watchdog, who would oversee data on state services. Under that initial agreement, the state committed to increasing the availability of community-based behavioral health services through the Maine Department of Health and Human Services so that children would no longer have to be separated from their families. 
Fast forward to this past September when the state and Justice Department — now under the Trump administration — jointly filed a motion to change the agreement, weakening some of those requirements, including removing the independent reviewer position. The parties argued that the changes were minor and thus acceptable since both the plaintiff and defendant were agreeing to the new terms. 
Maine settles with U.S. DOJ over children’s behavioral health services concerns

In response, the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine, GLAD Law and Disability Rights Maine intervened, asking the court through an amicus brief to reject the amended agreement.
Judge Stacey Neumann with the U.S. District Court for the District of Maine ruled on Nov. 24 that the state and federal governments had not justified the proposed changes. The requirements were “intrinsic to the case,” she wrote, and essential to protecting the rights of children with disabilities as required by the ADA.
“Indeed, there is no evidence that reducing the frequency of reporting, trainings, and community outreach and removing the Independent Reviewer will do anything to facilitate the State’s compliance with the agreement,” she wrote. “And may in actuality make it harder to ascertain whether compliance is being achieved.”
As of Friday, the Maine Department of Health and Human Services website displayed the modified agreement — not the approved settlement — that makes no mention of the independent reviewer. The department’s implementation plan, released last month, also makes no mention of the stricter requirements that the court determined the state must meet. 
Atlee Reilly, managing attorney at Disability Rights Maine, said it’s clear the department was “operating under the assumption that this was kind of pro forma and that they were just going to push ahead, as if the agreement had already been changed.”
Now that the court declined to approve it, Reilly said he doesn’t know “what that’s going to mean going forward.”

(Photo by Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star) Over the last few days, President Trump launched a vicious, brazen, and hate-filled attack on Somali immigrants — and by extension, on a fundamental ideal of America itself. In a White House Cabinet meeting, he repeatedly referred to Somalis as “garbage” and demanded they be expelled.
“Ilhan Omar is garbage. She’s garbage. Her friends are garbage,” he said. “These are people who do nothing but complain…When they come from hell and they complain and do nothing but bitch, we don’t want them in our country. Let ’em go back to where they came from and fix it.”
Then: “Their country is no good for a reason. Their country stinks, and we don’t want them in our country.”
He doubled down later: “We could go one way or the other — and we’re going to go the wrong way if we keep taking in garbage into our country.”
These aren’t misremembered paraphrases. These are disregarded human beings, stripped of dignity, reduced to “garbage” in front of the world.
Why this attack is not about policy — but about hate
Trump’s tirade is not a reasoned critique of immigration policy. It is a naked display of bigotry, racism, and dehumanization. By singling out an entire ethnic and religious group — immigrants from Somalia, including a U.S. citizen elected to Congress, Ilhan Omar — he broadcasts a dangerous message: that people of certain backgrounds are disposable, undeserving of the rights and dignity that define America.
It aligns with his broader ideological agenda — white-nativism, exclusion, and an effort to mobilize his political base through fear, hatred, and division. This isn’t about integration or assimilation; it’s about erecting walls — physical, social, and moral — around whiteness and Christian-majority America, while casting people of color, Muslims, and immigrants as threats to the nation’s identity.
It’s no coincidence that such contempt comes amid aggressive crackdowns: reports suggest his administration is preparing Immigration and Customs Enforcement “strike teams” for mass deportations targeting Somali communities in Minnesota.
By dehumanizing Somalis, Trump lays ideological and rhetorical groundwork for systematic repression, erasing the line between “immigration law enforcement” and ethnic cleansing of whole communities.
A cruel irony: Trump’s own family’s immigrant roots
It’s an ugly hypocrisy that the man leading this crusade against immigrants descends himself — through marriage, naturalization, and private business — from immigrants. His wives, too, were not part of some ancient American founding class. Yet here he stands, calling other immigrants “garbage.”
That bitter irony exposes the argument for what it really is: not about law or national security, but about ideology — white nativist ideology, which sees immigrants of color as inferior, unwelcome, un-American.
Maine’s Somali community: real people, real contributions
The state I call home, Maine, is itself home to a growing Somali community, centered in cities like Portland and Lewiston, Maine. According to the most recent census data, there are roughly 3,000  Somali-born residents in Maine, many of them living in Portland or Lewiston.
In these cities, Somali immigrants and their families have worked tirelessly to build lives, businesses, and communities. They established community centers, helped one another navigate social services, found jobs, paid taxes — and despite hateful myths and scapegoating, they have contributed concretely to the state’s social and economic life.
Take Safiya Khalid, who came to America as a seven-year-old refugee from Somalia, grew up in Lewiston, and in 2019 became the first Somali American elected to the Lewiston City Council — and the youngest ever.
Or consider Deqa Dhalac, born in Mogadishu, Somalia, she immigrated in the early 1990s, moved to Maine, worked as an interpreter and community organizer, and eventually became the first Somali-American mayor in U.S. history when she was elected mayor of South Portland in 2021. Today she serves in the Maine House of Representatives.
These are not political tokens. They are mothers, workers, organizers, people whose lives reflect the best of what America can be: a home for refugees, an opportunity for immigrants, a chance to rebuild, contribute, and belong.
Yet Trump’s words treat them like trash.
Why this scorched public rebuke matters
Because when a leader of a nation mocks entire communities as “garbage,” it emboldens racists, bigots, and xenophobes to act. His words are not benign, they are poisonous.
Because the president’s rhetoric attempts to strip Somali Americans, and all immigrants of color, of their identity, agency, and humanity, reducing them to stereotypes for political gain.
Because Maine’s Somali community — and communities like them across the country — deserve to be honored for their resilience, their contributions, and their humanity.
Because America was built on immigration. On hope. On the idea that people seeking refuge, safety, dignity should be welcomed, not vilified.
If Trump does not immediately retract his words, if the administration proceeds with raids, deportations, or policies targeting entire communities, it will be complicit in a moral atrocity.
We cannot stay silent. We cannot treat this as “just politics.” This is a moral crisis. And we — citizens, neighbors, voters — must speak out, demand accountability, and insist: immigrants are not garbage.

(Photo by Fajrul Islam/Moment via Getty Images)When people use hand gestures that visually represent what they’re saying, listeners see them as more clear, competent and persuasive. That’s the key finding from my new research published in the Journal of Marketing Research, where I analyzed thousands of TED Talks and ran controlled experiments to examine how gestures shape communication.
 
Talking with your hands
Whether you’re giving a presentation, pitching an idea or leading a meeting, you probably spend most of your prep time thinking about what you’ll say. But what about the ways you’ll move your hands?
I grew up in Italy, where gesturing is practically a second language. Now that I live in the United States, I’ve become acutely aware of how cultures differ in how, and how much, people move their hands when they talk. Still, across contexts and cultures, one thing is constant: People do talk with their hands.
As someone who studies communication, I’d noticed how some speakers seemed instantly clearer when they gestured. This made me wonder: Do gestures actually make communicators more effective?
The short answer is yes, but only when the gestures visually represent the idea you’re talking about. Researchers call these movements “illustrators.” For example:

When talking about distance, you might spread your hands apart while saying something is “farther away.”
When explaining how two concepts relate, you might bring your hands together while saying “these ideas fit together.”
When describing how the market demand “is going up and down,” you could visually depict a wave shape with your hands.

To study gestures at scale, my team and I analyzed 200,000 video segments from more than 2,000 TED Talks using AI tools that can detect and classify hand gestures frame by frame. We paired this with controlled experiments in which our study participants evaluated entrepreneurs pitching a product.
The same pattern of results appeared in both settings. In the AI-analyzed TED Talk data, illustrative gestures predicted higher audience evaluations, reflected in more than 33 million online “likes” of the videos. And in our experiments, 1,600 participants rated speakers who used illustrative gestures as more clear, competent and persuasive.
 
How hands can help get your point across
What I found is that these gestures give listeners a visual shortcut to your meaning. They make abstract ideas feel more concrete, helping listeners build a mental picture of what you’re saying. This makes the message feel easier to process — a phenomenon psychologists call “processing fluency.” And we found that when ideas feel easier to grasp, people tend to see the speaker as more competent and persuasive.
But not all gestures help. Movements that don’t match the message — like random waving, fidgeting or pointing to things in the space — offer no such benefit. In some cases, they can even distract.
A practical takeaway: Focus on clarity over choreography. Think about where your hands naturally illustrate what you’re saying — emphasizing size, direction or emotion — and let them move with purpose.
 
What’s next
Your hands aren’t just accessories to your words. They can be a powerful tool to make your ideas resonate.
I’m now investigating whether people can learn to gesture better — almost like developing a nonverbal vocabulary. Early pilot tests are promising: Even a 5-minute training session helps people become clearer and more effective through the use of appropriate hand gestures.
While my research examined how individual gestures work together with spoken language, the next step is to understand what makes a communicator effective with their voice and, ultimately, across all the channels they use to communicate — how gestures combine with voice, facial expressions and body movement. I’m now exploring AI tools that track all these channels at once so I can identify the patterns, not just the isolated gestures, that make speakers more effective communicators.

Ford,,,,,https://marylandmatters.org/2025/12/05/newly-established-department-on-social-equity-makes-first-committee-appearance/,"Maryland's newest department had a tall order, to ""advance social and economic mobility for all,"" and then the feds changed their DBE rules. But Acting Secretary Walter Simmons was largely confident at his agency's first committee appearance.","House Health and Government Operations Committee listens to a briefing Friday on the newly established Maryland Department of Social and Economic Mobility. (Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Maryland’s newest department already had a tall order, to “advance social and economic mobility for all Marylanders,” as Acting Secretary Walter Simmons describes it.
Then, two days after the law creating the Department of Social and Economic Mobility took effect, the federal government made it more challenging by declaring that race- and sex-based eligibility for Disadvantaged Business Enterprise status was itself discriminatory. It’s a change that Simmons estimates could affect up to 7,000 businesses in the state.
But Simmons was largely confident Friday in a briefing for the House Health and Government Operations Committee on the role of the new department and the efforts to stand it up. It was the first public appearance for the new agency.
The hearing came one day after the driving force behind its creation, House Speaker Adrienne Jones (D-Baltimore County) announced she was stepping down from leadership, a fact that was noted at the meeting. But mostly the hearing dealt with the details of setting up a new Cabinet-level department.
The law creating the department took effect Oct. 1 and Simmons became its acting secretary on Oct. 20. He summarized its mission: “To advance social and economic mobility for all Marylanders by removing barriers, investing in inclusive opportunities and aligning these resources. That is something that we are going to be heavily focused on…but also being able to frame it to ensure efficient government efficiency through this work.”

The law creating the department rolls threes existing offices into the new agency: the Office of Minority Business Enterprises in the state Department of Transportation; the Office of Small, Minority, and Women Business Affairs; and the Office of Social Equity in the Maryland Cannabis Administration.
Part of the department’s responsibilities will include promoting and encouraging participation in the regulated cannabis industry by individuals previously impacted “by the war on drugs,” and supporting small or disadvantaged businesses and monitoring trends in social equity programs and policies nationwide.
Del. Harry Bhandari (D-Baltimore County) asked Simmons what the first structural barriers are that the department has taken on since it became established.
Simmons said daily administrative functions remain such staffing, receiving keys to an office and getting emails.
He received help from Yolanda Maria Martinez, special secretary of the Office of Small, Minority, and Women Business Affairs. “She gave me her desk,” Simmons said, while sitting next to Martinez who arrived a few minutes later during the briefing.
But one major challenged that Simmons highlighted was the federal change to its DBE standards. Those changes, published in the Federal Register on Oct. 3,  the U.S. Department of Transportation issued an order that “removes race- and sex-based presumptions of social and economic disadvantage that violate the U.S. Constitution.”
Under the new rule, in order for any business to qualify for certification through a disadvantaged business enterprise or Airport Concessions DBE program must not only provide financial documentation, but also write a “narrative or case-specific justification for all applications.”
Simmons said that could affect more than 7,000 businesses in the state.
“Everybody knows that historically, minorities and women have had a disadvantage for the last 400 years. You don’t have to prove that you have an economic disadvantage, because we know you’ve been economically disadvantaged,” Simmons said after the nearly one-hour briefing.
“The Trump administration says, ‘No, throw that out.’ They [federal government] said that because they’re minority and they’re women [and] that they’re disadvantaged, that’s actually discrimination,” he said of the feds’ reasoning.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The department is required to submit a report to the governor and General Assembly by July 1 that identifies all state programs and units that have a social equity component and provide recommendations on how they can be “reorganized, coordinated, or otherwise made more effective and more efficient to promote social equity.”
Near the end of the briefing, committee chair Del. Joseline Peña-Melnyk (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel) praised Simmons. Peña-Melnyk and several other committee members are familiar with his work as president and CEO of Employ Prince George’s, a quasi-government nonprofit organization founded in 2018 that provides workforce development programs and other duties.
“I can hear your passion. I will sleep well at night knowing that you’re in charge,” Peña-Melnyk said.
She also praised Jones’ work to create the department.
“This is her baby,” Peña-Melnyk said. “It reflects her lasting vision that equity and economic mobility must be permanent, coordinated priorities of state government.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MD-Health-and-Government-Operations-Committee-12-5-2025-1024x579.jpeg,,,2025-12-06 09:57:05.900125

(Screenshot from GRAC video)Supporters of mid-decade redistricting in Maryland showed up in force for a virtual meeting of a state advisory commission Friday, calling on state leaders to redo congressional maps to oppose President Donald Trump (R).
It was the third hearing of the Governor’s Redistricting Advisory Commission and the third different outcome: Redistricting opponents dominated the first hearing and the second was nearly evenly split. Redistricting proponents dominated Friday’s meeting, thanks to a slew of climate and civil rights advocates, union leaders, a few retired federal employees and even a high school student.
Also joining the chorus was Bobby LaPin, the Maryland social media personality who has announced his intention to run against Senate President Bill Ferguson (D- Baltimore City), a commission member who opposes mid-cycle redistricting.
The commission will meet at least once more, on Dec. 12, to hear public comment.
The redistricting saga began with Trump urging Republican-led states to redistrict for partisan gain before the 2026 elections, to pick up GOP seats in Congress. Red states that have passed new maps so far include Texas, Missouri, Ohio and North Carolina. Democrats in California and Virginia have fired back with maps of their own.
The clock is ticking for Maryland to decide whether it will join the redistricting fray, with the filing deadline for the 2026 election on Feb. 24. The General Assembly convenes on Jan. 14, but it remains unclear whether Gov. Wes Moore (D) will call a special legislative session to address the matter sooner.
With battle lines drawn on redistricting, Ferguson and Moore work to shift line in their favor

The opposition of Ferguson, and by extension his chamber, is a significant barrier for the governor’s effort.
LaPin, who has not yet filed to run against Ferguson, seems to be making the issue a centerpiece for his campaign. During his remarks, the Baltimore charter sailboat captain held up a copy of “Project 2025,” a roadmap that he believes Trump is following to concentrate power in the executive branch.
“We have witnessed where this got us: asked police taking away our neighbors, the U.S. military occupying American cities, science being overridden, civil servants being threatened — basically rights stripped away with just the stroke of a pen,” LaPin said.
“We have the power in Maryland to be one of the states that answers back,” he said.
That view was echoed by more than two dozen other speakers Friday. Though many said they would oppose gerrymandering under normal circumstances, they viewed Trump’s effort as an extraordinary assault on voting rights — requiring an extraordinary response.
“We’re in a fight, and we have to fight back,” said Jim Schmitz, a resident of Riverdale Park. “Doing nothing in the hope that other states will notice and do nothing is only a wish. The moral high ground will not protect us.”
Ellen Hornstein, a retired attorney for the U.S. Forest Service, agreed. Hornstein said she left federal service on Trump’s inauguration date.
“I retired because I believed I could no longer uphold the rule of law in the United States. And that has proven true, and I’m doing everything I can now to fight for democracy,” Hornstein said.
Third Act Maryland, a climate advocacy group for seniors, threw its  support behind the idea, and several members spoke during Friday’s meeting.
“In normal times, I would oppose any redistricting for partisan purposes, but these are far from normal times,” said Cynthia Miller, a Third Act member from Huntingtown in Calvert CountySouthern. “The dangers to our democracy, our communities and our civil liberties are real and present.”
Redistricting opponents, however, expressed concern about the implications of redrawing districts. Democrats control seven of Maryland’s eight House districts. Only District 1, which covers the Eastern Shore and sweeps westward to include portions of Baltimore and Harford counties, is held by a Republican.
Teris Pantazes, who said he lives in Baltimore County close to the Harford County line, said District 1 should stay as-is, because those Western Shore communities are similar to Eastern Shore communities. Pantazes said that if voters from Annapolis were drawn into District 1 — one potential idea — he would feel it an effort to “minimize my voice.”
“I’ve heard some people say that Annapolis has the water economy, and it’s a lot like people on the Eastern Shore. Annapolis is nothing like — it has no similarities to places like Federalsburg,” Pantazes said. “Those who claim it are severely misguided.

There wasn’t much debate among panelists and audience members, with the group seeming to agree that the root of the problems facing higher education comes from liberals and the ideas they bring with them.
“The critical thing here to understand is … what has actually gone wrong? Well, a lot of things have gone wrong,” said panelist and American Enterprise Institute senior fellow Joshua Katz. “Who’s responsible? Well, a lot of people are responsible.”

Created by a law passed in the last legislative session, the UI Center for Intellectual Freedom is an entity governed by the Iowa Board of Regents with the goal of expanding intellectual diversity and civics education at the university. The center’s 26-person advisory council is in charge of finding a permanent director to replace de Castro and will advise on academic and other matters.
Kicking off the affair was the “Centers Strategy Colloquium,” which will continue Saturday with discussion of past efforts to create centers similar to the UI’s and the work going on now within the center. While the event was public, only panelists and those invited to attend were allowed to ask questions during the sessions.
The “Reforming Universities Summit” will take place Saturday afternoon with remarks from Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, former regent and current U.S. Assistant Secretary for Postsecondary Education David Barker and others. Sessions will cover the question of whether universities can be reformed and “possible actions and next steps,” with a “Capstone Session” ending the event.
Center Interim Director Luciano de Castro said in a previous interview the center, and the events it holds, are “the democratic process” in action, as Iowa voters made their opinions clear in electing the lawmakers who voted to create the center and shape its mission. Ideas and thoughts brought up during the inaugural event will be “extremely valuable to orient what we do in the center,” de Castro said.
‘What is wrong with universities?’
Main problems identified by panelists related to the actions faculty do or do not take when it comes to fostering debate not only among students, but among their colleagues and in higher education as well, and what universities base their work and priorities on.
Nicola Persico, a managerial economics and decision sciences professor at Northwestern University, provided the “context” that liberals outweigh conservatives in both faculty and administration and that faculty are more likely to say a liberal person would fit in their department than a conservative one. The only “problem” he identified stems from these facts, that faculty are self-censoring in the classroom, in research discussions and online.
Texas A&M University engineering professor John Criscione said faculty need to be “guardians at the gate” to protect higher education’s mission of supporting the exchanging and debate of ideas and the pursuit of truth, especially as “propagandists” seek to take control of powerful institutions at the junction of youth teaching and adult beliefs.
Universities are prioritizing productivity above anything else, he said, when they should be prioritizing the search for truth.
“I think universities really need to change society for the better. There’s no question on that …,” Criscione said. “Our mechanism, our approach to doing that, I think, is pursuing the truth, discovering knowledge, disseminating knowledge, that will change society, that will improve it. If we pick a particular approach, we decide society needs to change in this way, I don’t think we can have credibility.”
‘How did we end up here?’
Panelists had plenty of people, and the ideas they introduced to higher education, to blame for where the industry is now.
Katz separated those responsible for higher education’s issues into two categories — “sheep” and “crazies.” The sheep are “almost everybody,” he said, with the crazies at the fringes of both ends of the political and ideological spectrums. Nearly all university faculty fall into the sheep category, and if they follow a bad idea things can, and have, gone very wrong.
Crazies used to be a small minority of academic units, Katz said, but now there are more of them and they are “malevolent.”
“Don’t hire crazies, don’t be a sheep, and let’s hope that the Center for Intellectual Freedom at the University of Iowa can fix whatever problems there are,” Katz said.
It’s not just the people that have caused problems in higher education, said Texas A&M University finance professor Adam Kolasinski, but the belief they bring with them that “the very fabric of society” is biased against certain people and groups and the “moral crusade” they want to undertake.
“Far left ideology” has been present in U.S. higher education for a very long time, Kolasinski said, but one touchstone moment in the movement was “the rise of critical race theory in law schools” in the late 1970s and early 1980s. He said the “liberal left” had continuing frustration that results of the Civil Rights Movement weren’t followed with as big of changes for minority communities as was hoped, which led to “crackdowns on speech they did not approve of” and “over-discrimination against whites.”
“Left liberals” also have the “fundamental misunderstanding of human nature in the post-war era” that poverty is mostly, or solely, caused by external factors rather than internal ones, he said. This belief led to race-conscious hiring practices, censoring of voices who did not disagree and a “hierarchy of oppression” that brought forward diversity, equity and inclusion programming.
Academics have been pushed out or silenced for going against these ideas, Kolasinski said. He provided the example of former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, who stepped down from his Harvard University presidency after suggesting women were less represented in STEM fields because of “intrinsic aptitude.”
Summers, who was teaching at Harvard and held the position of director of the Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government at the Harvard Kennedy School, has stepped away from the university again due to his ties with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
When asked how to deal with faculty pushing “critical” study and ideologies, Katz said more discussions need to be had around tenure. He added that the “only way to fix anything, at least within two generations,” is to get rid of the employees who shouldn’t have been hired in the first place. Kolasinksi agreed and said if universities can get university leaders who would “stand up against” these faculty members, then “the kooks will be marginalized.”
Some panelists pointed to decades and centuries of past philosophical changes that have led to this point, with Iván Marinovic, associate professor of accounting at Stanford University, suggesting that much of higher education “rejects reason as traditionally understood” and is skeptical and suspicious of “western values.”
“The traditional aim of inquiry has been replaced by a commitment to political activism and a very narrow vision of social justice,” Marinovic said. “The world is interpreted through a rigid oppressor, oppressed framework, reducing persons primarily to their race, gender and sexual orientation.”
The way to fix this problem, he said, is to once again open higher education to “the whole breadth of reason,” including moral, religious and metaphysical inquiry and the approach to deep questions with “intellectual honesty and hope.”
Clara Reynen, a University of Iowa graduate student and Unity Chair in the Campaign to Organize Graduate Students, said she was concerned about what she heard during the panel discussions and thought speakers didn’t “provide any sort of solid, consistent argument to support the creation of the center.”
“Contrary to some of the panelists,” Reynen said, she does believe in self-censoring in her role as an instructor unless a student asks directly, as she is teaching course materials and not her personal feelings.
Other students she’s spoken to have expressed disappointment in the center’s structure, as its director will have near-total control of hiring professors, inviting guest speakers and other actions.
“I think that it’s very clear that folks here are not actually interested in freedom of expression,” Reynen said. “If they were, they would be doing things to make sure that our university did have more equitable access for everybody, and weren’t just appointing from within.”
De Castro ended the event for the evening with a note of “optimism” about the truth and those seeking it.
“Truth has quality that only the truth has, which is the correspondence to reality, and just because of that, you can have for a long time things that are wrong, things that go in the wrong direction, but truth remains, and eventually will prevail,” de Castro said.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The University of Nebraska Board of Regents voted Friday to eliminate four academic programs at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, three of them unanimously.
The eight-member board approved eliminating the departments of statistics, earth and atmospheric sciences, educational administration and textiles, merchandising and fashion design. Together, the cuts total $6.74 million; 51.5 positions will be cut, most of them faculty.


Eliminated programs

Earth and Atmospheric Sciences ($1.85 million, 13 positions eliminated).
Statistics ($1.75 million, 12 positions eliminated).
Educational Administration ($1.69 million, 15.5 positions eliminated).
Textiles, Merchandising and Fashion Design ($1.45 million, 11 positions eliminated).



There are 541 current students in the four cut departments, according to board materials.
The eliminated programs will be phased out over the next couple of years, with some additional department funds retained to support any remaining students who stay after the cuts. NU has a policy to help students who choose to stay after their programs are eliminated.
Bennett has said the programs that will now be eliminated fell below standards for granting degrees, in addition to falling low on a new metrics-based, targeted budget reductions plan that Bennett implemented to avoid across-the-board cuts.
“Positioning ourselves in a place of financial stability will ensure we can continue delivering excellence and student success, research and service to communities throughout our state,” Bennett said.
‘This hurts’
Of the student representatives on the regents, whose votes are nonbinding, one student regent supported all four program eliminations: UNL Student Regent Libby Wilkins.
“Nobody thinks this is good for our university. This hurts. This hurts every single one of us,” Wilkins said. “But I cannot vote ‘no’ when I understand that this would impact more of our students, our enrollment and the entire student experience at the University of Nebraska.”

Regents also unanimously approved merging four departments into two combined areas. The mergers will be finalized in 2026. Each is estimated to save $1 million. The departments to be merged are plant pathology and entomology as well as agricultural economics and agricultural leadership, education and communication.
‘Students won’t be marketable’
Of more than 100 speakers over five hours Friday, a vast majority of them students and faculty in affected programs, many said any students who remain won’t receive the same quality education, yet they will pay the same cost to attend. No speakers favored the cuts.
“A few faculty cannot provide the comprehensive curriculum, field work and experiential learning required for industry and government jobs,” said Dawn Kopacz, a professor in the Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences. “Our students won’t be marketable.”

Many speakers urged regents to delay and find alternatives. An advisory group of faculty, staff and students told Bennett that his tight budget window didn’t allow time to solidify alternatives. 
The cuts were announced Sept. 12. Bennett forwarded them to the regents Nov. 10.
Bhaskar Bhattacharya, head of the Department of Statistics, offered a proposal Friday to merge his department with the University of Nebraska Medical Center Department of Biostatistics. He also proposed stepping back from his leadership role if needed. Many educational administration faculty proposed a more cohesive administrative structure with UNMC and the central NU system office for administrative cuts, a plan they said has been years in the making.
At a special Nov. 21 meeting, regents unanimously authorized President Jeffrey Gold to merge UNL and UNMC as a joint accreditation unit, largely for research reporting and college rankings.
‘A laughable goal’
Susan VanderPlas, an associate professor of statistics, again called out the new Bennett-led metrics-based approach. VanderPlas and other statisticians at UNL said they reviewed the approach and found various flaws. They said they’d grade the data analysis an “F.”
VanderPlas said statisticians are usually “pretty quiet people,” but she said she saw this semester what it takes to get statisticians “pissed off”: “You really just have to come for the data.” She said statistics faculty found savings, but “no one in administration had ears to hear.”
“Eliminating statistics will cripple this university,” VanderPlas said. “It will damage its reputation, and it will make reentry into the AAU [Association of American Universities] a laughable goal.”

VanderPlas’ 9-year-old son, Alex, also pleaded to the board. He said he wants to stay in Nebraska and one day become a paleoartist or paleontologist. Alex told regents their job is to protect the university and ensure it helps Nebraskans, as well as Nebraskans like Alex who want to “study rocks and numbers and books and weather and other things.”
“Preserve them for the future and so more Nebraskans can be Huskers,” Alex said.
The AAU goal that VanderPlas mentioned has been a longstanding aim for the regents and Gold. In 2011, AAU members voted to boot UNL from the organization for failing to meet membership criteria. UNL had been a member since 1909.
Many faculty said these now-approved cuts put the AAU dream even more out of reach and will make it an outlier without critical departments. Many said the cuts also don’t consider net revenues for the departments and that UNL might be hurt more in the long run.
‘We had to make our budget numbers’
Regent Barbara Weitz of Omaha opposed all but the educational administration cut and suggested a two-month delay. In response, Bennett stood by his budget plan and told Weitz, to laughs from faculty and students: “We considered every alternative that we could think of.”

“We had to make our budget numbers,” Bennett said. “So, the absence of any alternative plan that was feasible, I came forward with a final recommendation that’s been presented.”
Seeking to confirm Weitz’s votes after the meeting, Weitz confirmed by text her opposition to the statistics and earth and atmospheric sciences cuts. But she said she opposed the educational administration cut. She said “yes” at the meeting during that vote and voted “no” to the textiles, merchandising and fashion design elimination.
The Examiner provided Weitz time stamps from the meeting livestream to confirm her votes. She did not immediately respond to a follow-up question.
Unclear future for Bennett
The UNL Faculty Senate voted 60-14 last month to express “no confidence” in Bennett. Just a handful of testifiers cited that action Friday. Bennett has not formally responded to the Faculty Senate decision but has continually said he adhered to all applicable budget policies.
Bennett again declined to directly address the Faculty Senate action Friday but told the Examiner that budget and academic reductions are never what a chancellor wants. He previously served for almost a decade as president of the University of Southern Mississippi, which faced almost annual budget cuts while he was there.

“I have a lot of empathy and sensitivity for all the individuals that will be impacted directly and certainly for our campus community,” Bennett said. “We have a lot of work to do ahead of us in terms of implementation. We’re going to do that with a lot of care and concern for everybody who’s impacted.”
Bennett’s contract ends June 30. It has not yet been extended, and Bennett repeated Friday he does not know if or when that might happen.Regents have scheduled meetings in February, April and June. In October, Bennett told the Examiner he desired a contract extension.
“You got to talk to the boss about that,” Bennett said when asked again if his contract would come up for a vote soon. Gold was not immediately available for comment.
Regent Kathy Wilmot of Beaver City again publicly thanked and defended Bennett’s work.
Regent Paul Kenney of Amherst, board chair, read a resolution in support of Gold that he said had unanimous board support. While the resolution was not included in board materials, according to Kenney, regents commended “all the leaders from across our campuses who have stepped up in [these] difficult budget decisions at this time.”
A broader reductions plan
UNL’s cuts and mergers are part of a total $27.5 million budget plan put forth by Bennett. 
The remaining parts of his plan do not require Board of Regents approval, such as $2 million in private philanthropy to cover mandated tuition waivers and an early retirement plan for long-time tenured faculty, which 69 faculty have been approved to accept by Jan. 5.
Breaking down UNL’s final $27.5 million budget cut proposal

Of reductions, $21 million is a structural deficit as UNL expenses continue to outpace revenues. The rest is “proactive” and meant to “help safeguard against repetitive budget reduction cycles.” 
Bennett told the Examiner that of the cuts that did not require regents’ approval: “Everything is moving along at sort of the pace that we expected it to move along. Nothing is complete yet, but we were sort of in line with the deadlines.”
No longer will ‘kick the can’
Regents largely cited the need to act now to mitigate future cuts and said that part of the reason UNL is in its current predicament is a decade of relying on cash reserves.
“We cannot continue to kick the can,” said Regent Tim Clare of Lincoln, the longest current serving regent now in his 17th year.

Regent Jim Scheer, a state senator between 2013 and 2021, including serving his last four years as speaker of the Legislature, said he was empathetic with every single person who spoke. He said he would be advocating the same had he been in their shoes. 
“But from my perspective, I’ve got to make sure that there is a university for people to go to, not just next year, but 10 years from now,” Scheer said. “Shake your heads, but it’s true.”
Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen appointed Scheer to succeed him on the board after Pillen became governor in 2023, after 10 years as a regent. Scheer ran unopposed for election to a six-year term in 2024. Pillen, in January, proposed a 2% cut to NU’s budget. After months of negotiation, NU secured a 0.625% increase in state dollars. Regents last year requested a 3.5% increase.
Scheer placed blame for many NU budget problems on slowing legislative investments over the last decade. He and many others have said those investments have not kept up with inflation and NU has run at more than a $100 million loss each year, which isn’t “chump change.”

To those who attended Friday’s meeting, Scheer said maybe five of them raised their hands and said they went to the Legislature. Scheer told those in attendance: “We got to the game late.”
“Without those extra dollars, we run into a problem where we’re just like everybody else,” Scheer said. “The university has got a checking account, and it’s got to balance.”
Many faculty and students and some regents predicted there might be more cuts to come in the future. Kevin Hanrahan, a professor of voice and voice pedagogy and new chair of UNL’s advisory Academic Planning Committee, said there is no more “fat” to trim, which UNMC Student Regent Brock Calamari echoed.
Last-minute delay fumbles
Regent Rob Schafer of Beatrice said he listened to the speakers and that, of all cuts, the earth and atmospheric sciences cut was the one he thought could use more time to reconsider.
Robert Szot, a graduate student at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln studying meteorology, speaks at a community forum related to budget cuts at UNL. Oct. 21, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Robert Szot, originally from Texas, said he specifically came to Nebraska for graduate studies in meteorology. He was among the earth and atmospheric sciences students to uplift the life-saving nature of meteorology and geology work. He and another student noted Nebraskans depend on the life-saving data, which includes storm chasing research teams.
Szot said Friday’s action might be remembered similarly to the 2003 “hasty” decision to fire Husker head football coach Frank Solich after a 9-3 winning season. 
“Nebraskans will either remember December 5, 2025, as the day the Board of Regents voted ‘no,’ stood up for the state, chose to be visionary, or the day that sent this university to a spiral for which it never recovered,” Szot said.
Deborah Bathke, the state climatologist, said cuts at the federal level make it even more important to maintain state expertise. She said cutting programs doesn’t make weather and climate challenges disappear, just harder to address.
University of Nebraska Regent Jack Stark of Omaha. Dec. 5, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Schafer’s motion failed 4-4. It required 5 votes. Schafer, Weitz and Omaha Regents Jack Stark and Elizabeth O’Connor supported a delay. Clare, Kenney, Scheer and Wilmot opposed it.
Scheer said he didn’t want to give “false hope” that something “miraculously” would change by the regents’ next meeting in February. 
‘Stick with us’
O’Connor said regents have been warning people for years that regents would soon be cutting at the “heart” of NU. She said Friday reached that point.
“We’re past the time now of the university warning people,” O’Connor said. “I think this is a full-out five-alarm fire as to the state of higher education in Nebraska. I’m sitting on this board, and I’m telling you, we’re scared.”
Scheer and Stark said the cuts could one day be reversed, with Stark offering a “big ask” to those impacted.
“Stick with us,” Stark said. “We’ll get through this, somehow.”

(Annie Knox/Utah News Dispatch)A 28-year-old Utah father applying for a green card arrived at a federal office in Salt Lake City on Tuesday planning to answer questions about his marriage and finances. Instead, he was arrested by immigration agents and brought to a detention center in Las Vegas, his lawyer said. 
Attorney Adam Crayk said Friday his client is among the first in Utah to be detained during an appointment with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which handles applications for green cards, citizenship and work authorization.
In the past, he said, “they’ve never been the enforcement arm.”
Similar arrests at the agency’s offices have been documented for months in other states like California and Florida. But Crayk said they didn’t start in Utah until roughly two weeks ago, with three of his clients detained there since.

The apparent escalation in enforcement follows a change in leadership at Salt Lake City’s U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office, with a U.S. Border Patrol official now assigned to oversee its operations, Crayk said.  
ICE and the Department of Homeland Security did not answer a request for comment sent via email Friday.
Crayk and fellow immigration attorney Nicholle Pitt White agree that those with upcoming appointments at the office face an incredibly difficult reality. 
Pitt White worries that ICE operations ramping up at the field office in Salt Lake City will create even more fear and drive immigrants further into the shadows rather than incentivize them to pursue legal status.
“There’s no safe way to do anything anymore,” she said
As people try to follow the law and secure a legal status, Pitt White said many now feel “really stuck between a rock and a hard place.”
“If you don’t show up, then they can send you to immigration court and ICE can arrest you anyway,” Crayk added. For those who go to their check-ins, he said, “if there’s some sort of thing they’ve determined you’re arrestable on, they’re going to arrest you.”

On Tuesday, homeland security agents noted the young father overstayed a visa after being brought to the United States as a child. They also said they considered a mark on his juvenile record to be a criminal conviction, though the case has since been expunged, the attorney said.  
And while his legal team expects he will eventually get a green card, they’re working to get him out of detention first.
Before the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigration, authorities did not cite juvenile matters as a basis for detaining someone, Crayk said. They have not recognized expungements in the adult system since the 1990s. 
Another of his clients completed the first step in a process waiving an earlier deportation order and allowing her to stay in the United States while she applies for a green card, according to copies of documents from her case with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.
When she went to the office Nov.19 to get her fingerprints taken as part of the process, the 54-year-old woman was detained and later brought to Mexico, where she’s originally from, Crayk said. She had lived in the United States for 28 years, Crayk said.
She has traffic tickets but no criminal history, he added. 
ICE operations in Utah were relatively quiet — until an airport arrest shook SLC leaders

A third client detained at the office has a prior criminal conviction, he said.  
Pitt White is a liaison for the Utah Immigration Advocacy Coalition, which issued a community alert Thursday warning of the situation.
She told Utah News Dispatch she worries that this tactic is meant to “create fear, create panic” and encourage undocumented immigrants in the U.S. “to just leave, so that they don’t have to do any work to get them to go.” 
From California, Pitt White said she’s heard of instances of mothers “having their babies ripped out of their arms and being arrested by (ICE) at these interviews.” She added she’s thankful she hasn’t seen that happening in Utah, but she’s worried it could.
Pitt White said so far none of her own clients have been impacted, but she’s nervous for at least one client who had an interview at the field office scheduled for Friday. 
For immigrants who have an upcoming appointment with USCIS in Salt Lake City who aren’t already represented by an attorney, Pitt White encouraged them to have a consultation with an attorney before going. 
“I’m not saying they need to hire an attorney to go with them or anything like that, but I think that an attorney is going to be the best person to give them that risk assessment, so they can have that information and be prepared,” she said.  
She also noted there are nonprofits like the Wasatch Immigration Project based in Park City that does pro-bono work.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_4945-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-05 21:56:36.478182

(Photo by Judy Patrick/provided by ConocoPhillips Alaska Inc.)President Donald Trump has signed a resolution backed by members of Alaska’s Congressional delegation to revoke restrictions on drilling in the National Petroleum Reserve on the North Slope.
The White House announced Friday evening that Trump had signed Senate Joint Resolution 80 into law. 
SJR 80 uses the Congressional Review Act to reverse restrictions enacted during the administration of President Joe Biden. Those restrictions, imposed as part of a 2022 activity plan for the reserve, were intended to protect environmentally sensitive areas against harm from oil and gas drilling.
Developers and drilling advocates opposed the restrictions, saying they could deter work that would provide revenue for local residents and Alaskans at large. Trump has also been interested in developing Alaska’s oil reserves as part of a broader effort to increase American energy production and reduce imports.

The National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska is approximately 23.5 million acres. Located to the west of Alaska’s vast Prudhoe Bay oil fields it — unlike the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve to the east — has been the subject of interest from oil companies.
ConocoPhillips’ Willow Project, approved during the Biden administration, was the first major project to take place in the reserve, and others are planned.
Friday’s signing was one of several Trump administration actions taking place simultaneously to reduce regulatory obstacles for developers interested in drilling within the reserve.

Leadership with Iowa Farmers Union said all of the congressional and Senate candidates were invited to attend the forum. The attending candidates were all seeking the Democratic nominations in their respective races. 
Each candidate was asked to respond to the question: How do the values of Iowa farmers, ranchers and rural community members shape your vision for the future of Iowa?

District 1:
Christina Bohannan, who has run against U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks in the past two elections, said her family “like many many families in Iowa” could not make it in farming, even though it’s what they wanted to do. 
Bohannan said protecting and expanding markets for farmers is something she would fight for in Congress. 
The Democrat from Iowa City also pointed to corporate corruption in politics, which she said has also allowed for greater consolidation in the farm economy that ultimately “hurts Iowa farmers and hurts our agricultural economy.” 
She said her time spent in rural communities across her district has given her the skills to “get bipartisan support” to pass a Farm Bill. 
The federal piece of legislation which outlines farm policy, subsidies and nutrition assistance programs has not been reauthorized since 2018. 
Bohannan said she would also work to break down agricultural consolidation and the lack of competition in farm input industries like fertilizer and seeds. 
She said congressional leaders also need to negotiate for open markets so that farmers “can see the fruits of their labor.” 
Miller-Meeks is running again for the seat. Bohannan is competing for the Democratic nomination against Taylor Wettach, who also spoke at the Friday event. 
Wettach, a trade and national security lawyer from Muscatine, called farmers the “heart and the backbone of our state.” 
Wettach said Iowa Farmers Union values “are the vision” and the “moral compass” dictating the path forward. Wettach, a seventh-generation Iowan, said work ethic, integrity, fairness, responsibility and faith in community are the ethics he was raised with. 
Wettach said farmers, and therefore rural communities have been “squeezed” by consolidation in the seed, fertilizer markets and meatpacking industries. 
“For too long, corporate greed and political neglect have put rural Iowa on the ropes,” Wettach said. 
He advocated for enforcement of antitrust laws, supporting small and midsized farmers and local food processing and purchasing. 
District 2:
Lindsay James, currently serving as a state legislator from Dubuque, said her conversations with rural Iowans often center on the “impossible decisions” they are forced to make because of the current economic reality.
James said these issues impact Iowans everywhere, but for farmers, she said it means they’re picking up extra jobs and sacrificing social opportunities. 
James said it’s not just a policy failure, but a “moral failure.” 
“Iowa is not Iowa without our farmers, and we need to have policies that are going to help our farmers, our producers, our growers, truly thrive,” James said. 
James said rural communities need grocery stores, hospitals, public schools, small farms and post offices. 
Iowa’s 2nd Congressional District seat is currently occupied by U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson, who has announced plans to run for U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst’s seat in the Senate. 
Iowa Rep. Shannon Lundgren, R-Peosta, Sen. Charlie McClintock, R-Alburnett, and former state lawmaker Joe Mitchell are running for the Republican spot on the ticket. 
Clint Twedt-Ball is a Cedar Rapids pastor and founder of the organization Matthew 25 who is also running for the Democratic nomination in the district. 
As a fourth-generation Iowan, Twedt-Ball said rural Iowans and farmers are “an optimistic people.” 
He said it takes optimism for farmers to do their job, especially under all of the challenges they currently face. 
Twedt-Ball said “it’s time” for a Farm Bill that supports family farmers, diversified crops and water quality. 
“We need to get back to a place where ‘America needs farmers’ is much more than a sticker on the Hawkeyes’ helmets,” Twedt-Ball said.

Kathy Dolter, another Democrat running for the seat, said Friday that as a retired nurse, she “can’t stand by and watch people suffer,” as she said they are under the current policies from President Donald Trump. 
“We Iowans all need to use our voices and our votes to make Iowa strong and make America, America again,” Dolter said. 
She listed a number of policies she would prioritize, including: a higher minimum wage, an end to trade tariffs, continued funding for wind and solar energy, right to repair laws and support for rural post offices, hospitals, schools and grocery stores. 
Guy Morgan, a Democrat who grew up in Garden City, also spoke Friday about his campaign which focuses on water quality, support for small and midsized farmers and environmental issues. 
District 3:
Sarah Trone Garriott, a state senator from West Des Moines and a pastor, said the things that “bring us together” like hospitals, child care and public schools, in a rural community are being “chipped away at.”
She said the decisions of the current administration, like tariffs and a system that “does not allow for diversification” on the farm are “hurting the future of agriculture.”
Trone Garriott said it’s time for a new Farm Bill that supports diverse operations, conservation practices and local food markets. 
“We want to make sure that people can stay in their rural communities and support their families and have a great future and a good life that they can pass on to their children,” Trone Garriott said. “But we need leaders who are willing to go and fight for that.”

Trone Garriott is running for the seat currently held by U.S. Rep. Zach Nunn. She is vying for a Democratic nomination against Rep. Jennifer Konfrst, D-Windsor Heights, and several other candidates.
Konfrst, who served as House minority leader, said she would stand up for Iowans from all counties, because the future of the state and the country “involves every single one of you.” 
“Because it can’t just be the counties that are growing, it has to be everyone,” Konfrst said. “We’ve got to bring counties back up, we’ve got to bring population back up, we need to do real economic development.” 
Xavier Carrigan, is also running for the Democratic nomination and spoke late Friday evening.
District 4: 
Ashley WolfTornabane and Stephanie Steiner are two of the Democratic candidates running for Iowa’s 4th Congressional District, currently occupied by Republican U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra, who is running for Iowa governor. 
Steiner, a retired women’s health nurse and small livestock farmer from northwest Iowa, said her life has been shaped by rural America. 
Steiner said her vision includes “fair markets and fair prices” for farmers who want to compete in the market. 
“Fair markets aren’t radical, they’re the bedrock of a healthy farm community,” Steiner said. 
She advocated for a price floor for grain, mandatory country of origin labeling, enforcement of antitrust laws, greater availability of local processors and right to repair laws. 
Steiner also advocated for conservation incentives that “actually fit the scale of our Midwest family farms” to help fix Iowa’s problems with water quality.

“Stewardship is a core Iowa value, but policy must reward it,” Steiner said. 
WolfTornabane, a sixth-generation Iowan from Storm Lake running for the Democratic nomination, said Iowa politicians have “favored agribusiness instead of the family farmer.” 
“It’s time for a new machine,” WolfTornabane said. “We need federal law that protects farmers’ financial and physical health, as well as our precious precious resources of water, soil and wildlife.”
Former state Rep. Dave Dawson of Lawton is also seeking the Democratic nomination.
U.S. Senate:
Josh Turek, a state representative and two-time Paralympian, announced his intention to run for U.S. Senate in August. He joined a crowded field of Democrats running for nomination in the seat currently held by Ernst, who does not plan to run for reelection. 
Turek said he understands in a “deeply personal way” what a “great senator from Iowa can do for an individual, for state and for society,” he referenced former U.S. Sen. Tom Harkin, specifically his work for Americans with disabilities.

Turek compared himself to Harkin as a “prairie populist” and said rural Iowa can be summarized by hard work, community and resilience. 
He criticized President Donald Trump’s foreign trade policy and said farmers are being “betrayed and ignored” by the politicians in Washington. 
“We need representatives in Washington who will fight to strengthen our rural communities, protect our small farms and conserve Iowa’s most precious God given resource: our soil,” Turek said.
State Sen. Zach Wahls, D-Coralville, is also running for the seat, along with Nathan Sage and Bob Krause, who both spoke Friday. Republicans vying for a nomination include Hinson and Jim Carlin. 
Sage, a former sports radio host who grew up in Mason City, spoke against the current tariff policies, the lack of a farm bill, farmers’ inability to work on their own equipment and corporate support of politicians. 
Sage said rural Iowa needs broadband, more hospitals and economic development. 
“But more than anything, we need strong, midsize to small farms,” Sage said. “Those are the ones that power those rural communities.”

Faith Winter, who died at 45 in a car crash last week.
Friends, family and colleagues remembered the Broomfield Democrat as an “altruistic” public servant who followed a steady moral compass during her career and life. More than anything, they spoke about her love for and commitment to her family and friends.
“It’s easy to see that she made an outsized impact in her short time. But to me, it’s not what she accomplished that’s remarkable, but it’s how she accomplished it — with empathy, humility and inclusivity,” Jessica Walker, a lifelong friend of Winter’s, said. “Kindness was her North Star.”

The memorial was attended by many current and former elected officials of both parties, including Gov. Jared Polis, members of the state’s congressional delegation and state lawmakers. Nearly everyone wore orange, Winter’s favorite color, or buttons that read “Lift As You Rise,” a nod to Winter’s ethos of creating better pathways and environments for everyone, especially women interested in public service.
“She knew that our state could be a better place, and she focused tirelessly on making it so,” Polis said. “When Faith was on your team, she was a fierce ally, 100% committed to the cause.”
Winter died in a multi-vehicle crash on Interstate 25 near Dry Creek Road on Nov. 26. The cause of the crash, one of two that occurred around the same time along the same stretch of the highway, is still under investigation. Her autopsy could take a month to finish.
Winter is survived by her two teenage children, Sienna and Tobin Snook. She was engaged to Matt Gray, a former Democratic state representative.
“My mom put so much love out into the world, which is why we feel her absence so strongly,” Sienna Snook said. “She didn’t need a reason for fighting to fight for others. She did because she knew that her voice was made for helping those who didn’t have one.”
Snook said that every night her mother would read her a “feminist story to show me to shoot for the moon.”

Elevating women’s voices
Speakers highlighted Winter’s public policy successes, including championing the successful ballot measure in 2020 that created a state-run paid family and parental leave program.
“She didn’t just win paid leave in Colorado,” said Dawn Huckelbridge, the leader of the national Paid Leave for All campaign. “She won it after fight after fight — after introducing it, after flipping the Senate and then taking it to the ballot for the very first time in this country, ignoring every naysayer and winning.”
Winter also sponsored a major transportation funding bill in 2021 that imposes fees on fuel, deliveries and ride-shares to fund transit and transportation projects. During this year’s regular session, she ran a bill to further protect reproductive health care access in Colorado.
As a representative in 2018, Winter alleged sexual harassment by fellow lawmaker Steve Lebsock, setting the stage for the House to expel him.
She became the assistant majority leader in the Senate in 2023.

Winter previously worked as the director of Emerge Colorado, an organization that recruits and trains women to run for public office. Many mourners spoke about Winter’s commitment to elevating women’s voices and helping them ascend to positions of power.
“Because she was only one person and only had so many hours in each day, she trained others on how to step up and do the work and build the bench that we needed to bring the change that she sought. And I was one of thousands who benefited from that,” said U.S. Rep. Brittany Pettersen, a Lakewood Democrat who served in the Colorado Legislature with Winter and first met her in a fellowship program.
“She said ‘You should run for office,’” Pettersen said. “I immediately laughed and replied that people like me don’t run for office. And she said ‘Isn’t that the problem?’”
While many people spoke through tears about Winter’s life and legacy, the atmosphere was also celebratory. Speakers played upbeat music from artists including Taylor Swift and Kesha, two of Winter’s favorites, before and after the memorial service. Large photos of her with her two children flanked the podium. The steps of the Capitol were adorned with vibrant flowers, arranged by Rep. Jenny Willford, a Northglenn Democrat.
“She loved gerbera daisies and sunflowers because they were bright and bold,” Willford said. “They are cheerful blooms that match her energies — the kind of flowers that don’t shy away from the sun. They turn towards it, just like she did.”

Idaho Gov. Brad Little and fellow Idahoan, Chief of the Forest Service Tom Schultz, on Friday announced the renewal of the state’s Shared Stewardship agreement with the U.S. Forest Service. 
 Agreement aims to reduce wildfire fuels through targeted logging 

The state and federal entity have had an agreement in place since 2018, but the new one comes with goals such as to roughly double current timber sales from National Forest land to 100 million board feet annually within five years. 
Little, Schultz and Idaho Department of Lands Director Dustin Miller emphasized Friday that the idea is to reduce wildfire risk. 
“This broader approach allows us to reduce fuels at a meaningful scale, protecting communities, improving forest health, strengthening local economies,” Little said Friday at a press conference. “… I deeply value our partnership as we work to prevent devastating fires, protect property and safeguard Idaho.” 
Schultz said the goals in the updated agreement align with President Donald Trump’s “Immediate Expansion of American Timber Production” executive order issued in March that directs federal agencies to pursue ways to boost logging production and timber sales from federal lands.

Officials in the U.S. The Department of Agriculture, where the Forest Service is housed, are predicting a 25% increase in the volume of timber product sales over the next four years, Schultz said. 
The Forest Service is providing about $4 million upfront to ramp up the effort, he said, and the boosted timber sales are expected to cover ongoing costs. Other goals include working with private landowners to create fuel breaks and reduce fuels in areas where people live close to the wildland interface. 

The Idaho Department of Lands has developed a map of priority areas for logging and other fuel reduction, such as prescribed burns. Forested areas near McCall and in North Idaho around Coeur d’Alene and Sandpoint are among the primary focus areas. 
The agreement also includes plans to use the revenue from timber sales for fish and wildlife habitat restoration, tree replanting, and recreation improvements. 
Idaho is facing a projected budget shortfall of about $58 million for the current fiscal year, and a roughly $600 million deficit in the next fiscal year. Agencies are not expected to be able to increase staffing or request new employees during the upcoming legislative session. Miller said the state lands department has unique authority to be able to hire foresters to scale up activities if the income from it is sufficient.
Miller said the plan is to “bring on additional foresters to grow the program commensurate to the need.” 
 Schultz says Forest Service staffing is stable, conservation leaders worry it’s not enough

The partnership signed Friday will be executed by federal, state, tribal, and private land managers or forest owners.
Around 40% of Idaho’s land is forested, and nearly 90% of that forest land is owned and managed by the U.S. Forest Service. Staffing at this agency was slashed in February amid mass layoffs as part of an effort by the president and then-advisor Elon Musk to cut back on spending. 
The Forest Service at the time cut around 3,400 positions, Reuters reported, or around 10% of its workforce. After a U.S. district court judge ruled in March that the mass firings were unlawful, the agency announced it would rehire many of the employees, Central Oregon Daily News reported.  
Asked Friday about how the staffing volatility might affect the agency’s ability to increase land management activities, Schultz said he wasn’t concerned. 
“Most of the resources that we have at the district and the forest levels have been pretty stable,” he said. “But we’re also leaning on partners. Partners being states and tribes and (non-governmental organizations) that help us do the work.” 
Idaho Conservation League Public Lands and Wildlife Director John Robison remained skeptical that the staffing situation is enough. Robison sits on the governor’s Shared Stewardship Advisory Council. 
“They have lost a tremendous amount of staff and expertise and institutional memory on the forest that’s needed to get this work done,” Robison said Friday in an interview. “… I appreciate the chief’s statements that the staffing decreases have stabilized, but they’re far short of what they need to be to accomplish the stated goals.” 
On Thursday, a group of Democratic U.S. Senators from mostly western states wrote to Shultz questioning if the Forest Service was doing enough to reduce wildfire fuels, Boise State Public Radio reported. The federal lawmakers’ letter came after an analysis from the advocacy group Grassroots Wildland Firefighters that found a nearly 40% drop in fuel reduction projects compared to previous years.

 Robison: New agreement can improve forest health, but must include public

Idaho and federal authorities have worked closely together since 2015, when the state implemented “Good Neighbor Authority” agreements to use state personnel and resources to assist with federal management. 
Little said the Shared Stewardship agreement uses the Good Neighbor Authority model and expands the cooperation across Idaho’s landscape, regardless of ownership. 
“Both models allow the state of Idaho, through our Idaho Department lands, to help get more work done on the ground,” Little said. 
Robison said that the collaborative approach to reducing wildfire fuels in Idaho has been largely successful. The challenge has been to ensure that timber activity doesn’t return to the “timber wars of yesteryear,” he said.  
He said a key component will be to avoid old growth trees. 
“There is an overabundance of small- and medium-sized trees on the National Forest in Idaho that wouldn’t otherwise be there, if not for decades of fire suppression,” Robison said. “And these overstock stands could actually benefit from some targeted thinning and prescribed fire. Those activities can both improve forest health and protect communities if they’re combined with hazardous fuel reduction efforts on private property.” 
Robison attributed Idaho’s success in this area to robust public participation. However, recent changes under the National Environmental Policy Act, known as NEPA, may limit opportunities for public comment.
This summer, federal agencies, including the USDA, proposed regulation updates that include options to expedite environmental reviews and reduce or eliminate chances for the public to weigh in. 
“The public is in danger of being shut out from decisions made on our National Forests,” Robison said, “at a time when that is a core component for successful restoration and management.”",https://idahocapitalsun.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/logging-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-12-05 19:56:46.313496

This story by Carly Ocasso was first published in The Bridge on Dec. 4, 2025.
One of the three finalists to become Montpelier’s next city manager is facing a $5 million lawsuit stemming from a decision he made at his current job. 
After hours of interviews and some procedural controversy, Montpelier’s City Council chose three finalists on Wednesday to replace former City Manager Bill Fraser: Pinole, CA City Manager Kelcey Young, Pitkin County, CO Commissioner Kelly McNicolas Kury, and Woodstock, VT Municipal Manager Eric Duffy.
However, Duffy is also one of the defendants in an active lawsuit filed in April by Woodstock Police Chief Joseph Swanson after Duffy demoted him. Duffy had placed Swanson on paid leave in October 2024, two days after a traffic incident involving a confrontation between Swanson’s husband and another driver, according to the Vermont Standard. 
In November, an “independent investigation by the Vermont State Police determined that no charges could be filed against either driver,” according to the Standard. The demotion was reversed by the court in December. But Duffy did not drop the matter and hired a private detective on Oct. 25 to investigate unnamed complaints against Swanson, according to the Standard.
Swanson responded in kind with a lawsuit against Duffy, the village trustees, Burgess Loss Prevention (the private investigator), the Town of Woodstock and the Village of Woodstock. The lawsuit claimed Duffy and the other defendants had acted unlawfully, maliciously, improperly and without cause, which damaged his reputation, according to court documents.
Still, Duffy told The Bridge his decision was warranted following a 14 hour hearing where the matter was discussed publicly.  “I am always going to do what I think is right and in the best interest of my staff, my community and the municipality, and if needed, hold people accountable for their actions or lack thereof,” Duffy said on on Thursday. “We believe he was unable to perform his duties as chief,” citing two no confidence votes — one from the police union and one from the dispatch union in November of 2024.
In Vermont, it is required to show proof  of “cause” to  remove a police chief from office, according to court documents. Village Trustees had unanimously supported Duffy’s decision to demote Swanson, but the court decision on Dec. 2 asserted the trustees did not show evidence of “cause” to do so. 
The village reasoned that a ‘for cause’ determination was not necessary because demotion was not equivalent to terminating employment. The court disagreed, stating that a demotion effectively removes one from office.
Duffy said that as a candidate for city manager, if he gets the position he looks forward to working with the community to co-create a place where people have enough housing and are able to thrive economically.  City Councilor Ben Doyle told The Bridge he was aware of the lawsuit during the hiring process, and that Duffy’s ability to face the situation head-on during the hiring process led him to believe Duffy is a man of integrity “who isn’t afraid to make hard choices.” Doyle also said he hopes community members keep an open mind and ask questions of all the candidates during the upcoming public forum.
An evening email to all Montpelier city councilors only yielded Doyle’s response. An email and phone message to Swanson’s lawyer were not immediately returned.

The layoffs include employees at Hoskinson Contracting and Hoskinson Concrete. The concrete company will close permanently.
The post Construction companies lay off 123 workers in Gillette appeared first on WyoFile .","Hoskinson Contracting and Hoskinson Concrete gave walking papers to a combined 123 employees this week, and an official with one firm said the concrete company will close permanently.
The number of workers laid off is significant, according to state officials, and beyond normal seasonal fluctuations in the construction industry.
Both companies are based in Gillette and founded by Charles Hoskinson, CEO and founder of Input Output Group. He also founded the new Hoskinson Health & Wellness Clinic on the south side of town. 
The construction and concrete companies were created to support the clinic, Hoskinson Contracting CEO Chris Davis said in a press statement.
“The large-scale construction needs that led the clinic to create an in-house construction company have come to an end,” Davis said. “As a result, Hoskinson Contracting is scaling back its operations, and the Hoskinson Concrete division is being closed.”
Every laid off employee will remain on payroll through January, according to a company spokesperson. Hoskinson Contracting employed more than 260 workers, according to its website on Friday morning.

Gov. Mark Gordon, in a statement Friday, described the situation as “one of the most significant layoffs Wyoming has ever seen.”
“This is tough news for more than [100] Wyoming workers who showed up, put their skills to work, and who now face job loss,” Gordon said. “I am deeply concerned for the hard-working individuals and families who now face uncertainty, especially during the holiday season.”
Wyoming Workforce Services has organized resources to reach out to affected employees and connect them to other employers in the region, as well as workforce training opportunities.
“We have offered to do a virtual event and to do something at our [Gillette] location,” Administrator of Workforce Programs Holly Simoni told WyoFile. “We’re trying to get specific contact information on these employees so that we can reach out to them and offer our services.”
Affected workers are encouraged to reach out to the Gillette Workforce Center, Simoni said. Job Seekers can look for employment and register at the HireWyo website.
Neither Gillette nor Campbell County elected officials were notified of the layoffs, according to WyoFile inquiries. Reached for comment Friday, Campbell County Commission Chair Kelley McCreery said he was unaware of the layoffs. 
“I do know [the companies] expanded really, really fast,” he said.
The county awarded Hoskinson Contracting a job earlier this year to install a boiler at the Northeast Regional Airport outside Gillette, according to McCreery, but the company asked to get out of the contract.
“They came back to us later and said, ‘We have lost some supervisors and we’re spread too thin, and we’d like to get out of the deal.’ So we let them out,” McCreery said.
Hoskinson Contracting will “work in a more limited capacity” going forward, according to Davis. “It will concentrate on maintaining existing Hoskinson properties and overseeing future construction projects, which it will bid out to local Wyoming contractors.”

,Mississippi Today,2025-12-05 23:41:52+00:00,Mississippi Today,New Orleans leaders call for transparency during federal immigration sweep,"Aliana Mediratta, Verite News",,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/12/05/new-orleans-immigration-sweep/,New Orleans officials are demanding that federal agents be more transparent and humane during an immigration crackdown.,"New Orleans community leaders and politicians, including Mayor-elect Helena Moreno, U.S. Rep. Troy Carter and former Mayor Mark Morial, hosted a press conference Friday to demand that federal immigration agents deployed to New Orleans be more transparent and humane in their tactics. 
The press conference followed a letter sent earlier in the day by City Council to Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino with five specific demands for the recently-launched immigration sweep dubbed “Catahoula Crunch,” taking place in parts of Louisiana and south Mississippi. 
The council asked agents to report data including number of arrests made and criminal history of detainees, ensure due process, require officers to be identified and unmasked, disavow discriminatory stops and provide medical care and language services to detainees. 
The demands from the City Council come less than a week into the operation, which has led to widespread unease among New Orleans’ sizable immigrant population as individuals have been stopped, detained and even chased at their places of employment, homes and churches. 
“We stand here with an obligation to ensure that federal operations are conducted with transparency, constitutionally and with respect for local residents,” Moreno said. 
As anxiety over the operation continues to rise, multiple leaders spoke about the economic impact to New Orleans’ large hospitality and tourism industries, noting concerns of workers not showing up for fear of being detained or deported. 
Carter represents Louisiana’s 2nd District, which includes New Orleans. He decried any operations that create fear and confusion for families, workers and businesses. 
“We want federal partners, we just don’t want occupation,” Carter said. “We want them to work with us, not around us.” 
City Council members in New Orleans, a Democratic stronghold in a deeply Republican state, have grappled with the legal limitations of their power to push back against federal agents, in part because of laws and policies enacted by Louisiana’s conservative state government, such as a recently passed Louisiana law that prohibits interference with federal immigration agents. Moreno said that she felt they were requesting only basic transparency data, which she said she views as reasonable. 
The clash between local, state and federal officials continues as Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill posted a letter sent to New Orleans Police Department Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick, where Murrill wrote that she recommended Kirkpatrick order NOPD officers to cooperate with ICE. 
Earlier in the week, the council published a web page where people can anonymously upload footage that depicts any alleged abuses from federal immigration agents. The page also includes materials to educate people on their rights in English, Spanish and Vietnamese, which states that the NOPD will not ask people about their immigration status. 
Speakers at the press conference urged continued transparency and community collaboration as operation Catahoula Crunch moves forward. 
Council President JP Morrell pushed back against the reasoning behind the quota announced by Border Patrol — to arrest 5,000 people in New Orleans.
“I do not believe you are here for the reason you say you are here but you have an opportunity to prove me wrong,” he said in reference to federal immigration agents. “Provide this information that’s being requested by the New Orleans City Council. … Until then, this council will continue to use all the resources available to us, legal and otherwise, and make sure that the citizens of this city are protected.”

“All I can say is, it's clearly not based in science,” new state Health Commissioner Rick Hildebrant says of the federal change to the 30-year standard immunization schedule.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont health officials reaffirm importance of hepatitis B vaccine after federal advisory panel recommends delays.","A parent holds his 16-month-old daughter as she receives the Moderna Covid-19 vaccination in Salt Lake City, Utah, on June 21, 2022. File photo by Rick Bowmer/AP
The federal panel that advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s vaccine recommendations made one of its biggest moves on vaccine policy to date on Friday, saying that rather than vaccinate all newborns against hepatitis B at birth, parents and caregivers should delay the vaccine series until their child is 2 months old — if they choose to vaccinate them at all.
Vermont state officials are adamant that providers and families do not follow the panel’s recommendation and continue to give infants a dose at birth.  
Even before the decision from the federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, called ACIP, the Vermont Department of Health issued a public advisory to maintain its support for infants to be vaccinated within 24 hours of birth. 
“I’m concerned,” the state’s health commissioner, Rick Hildebrant, said in light of the federal panel’s decision. “The biggest concern I have is the confusion that this will cause.” 
“We sent the press release to make sure Vermonters know what our recommendation is, that it’s backed by science by 30 years of precedent, that it has been effective and safe in preventing chronic liver disease in folks,” Hildebrant said.
The federal panel voted 8-3 for the delayed vaccination. In June, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. gutted the existing lineup of experts on the CDC panel and instead stacked the panel with many outspoken skeptics of vaccines.
The state recommends the birth-dose, followed by a series of vaccines for a child to complete by the time they are 18 months, as essential to prevent hepatitis B infections. The virus targets the liver and can lead to liver failure, cirrhosis and liver cancer. Though adults exposed to the virus are more able to clear it, 90% of infants infected develop chronic conditions.
Typically, the state Health Department buys the vaccines directly from the CDC at a low cost. That allows for easy distribution to the health care providers who administer the vaccines. Since the CDC panel’s recommendation delays, rather than entirely rejects, the vaccine, Hildebrant is not yet sure if or how this decision will alter the state’s ability to buy the vaccines and distribute them.
Kristina Massari, a spokesperson for BlueCross BlueShield of Vermont, said the state’s largest commercial insurer does not expect a significant shortage of vaccines in the coming year, since a recommendation is still partially in place. 
ACIP’s recommendation only applies to infants whose parent tested negative for hepatitis B while pregnant. The panel did not change the recommendations for those whose parents test positive, or those who do not test at all for the virus.
“Blue Cross VT is not changing its coverage of Hepatitis B vaccines,” Massari wrote in an email. “Members will have zero cost-share and will not be required to obtain prior authorization to receive this vital vaccination.”
Hildebrant said he and his colleagues are preparing to act, should they need to adjust the procurement and distribution pathways, though he is not sure what that would look like exactly. He worries about the added cost of buying the vaccines directly from the manufacturer and the logistics of needing to take on the distribution of them. 
Federal insurers will also continue to cover the vaccine, a policy analyst for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, Andrew Johnson, told the ACIP committee, as first reported by STAT, a health care news source.
“Not only do they care immensely about their insured individuals,” Hildebrant said of Vermonters’ insurance companies, “but they also know that this is going to save money. I mean, it’s very costly to not get vaccinated and then end up with a chronic illness. And that’s the least important part of this.” 
Since the CDC adopted the recommendation of a birth-dose in 1991, the United States saw a significant decrease in hepatitis B cases, dropping from a total of nearly 18,000 to fewer than 3,000 new diagnoses annually, a 2023 public health report found.
“You don’t get that kind of response rate in medicine with treatment,” Hildebrant said, becoming animated about the vaccine’s efficacy. “That is just remarkable. And the thought of going back to the days where we’re seeing 14,000 to 18,000 kids contracting hepatitis B across the country is not one that we’re excited about. It’s one we’re really, really concerned about.” 
Cody Meissner, a professor of pediatrics at Dartmouth’s Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, is one of Kennedy’s recent ACIP appointees. He has a history on the panel, having served under President Barack Obama between 2008 and 2012. He was one of the few dissenters in Friday’s meeting. 
“I will just say, we have heard ‘do no harm’ as a moral imperative. We are doing harm by changing this wording,” Meissner said as he cast his no vote during the panel.
The state health department echoed his concerns.
“There’s been a lot of incredible incredulity about this. ‘Why is this happening?’ And I don’t think anyone has a good answer to [the question of] why are people doing this,” Hildebrant said. “All I can say is, it’s clearly not based in science.”
The state Health Department has been coordinating and in frequent communication with counterparts across the region, according to Hildebrant. Following upheaval at the CDC this summer, Vermont joined a regional coalition to solidify more consensus as federal guidance contradicts consensus public health science.
Merideth Plumpton, the department’s Immunization Program manager, authored a Dec. 1 letter with more detailed guidance for providers and parents on the state’s recommended vaccination schedule, in line with that of the American Academy of Pediatrics.
Hildebrant encouraged questions and skepticism of what best protects children from harm, but he encouraged parents to have these conversations with their children’s pediatricians. 
“Do not listen to a politician when it comes to health care decisions, please. These are decisions that belong in an exam room, and they are the people who are the best equipped to give you information about this.” he said.

""Montana Center for Christian Policy"" from the Montana Family Foundation Website. (Image via MFF website) A hard-right Christian legal advocacy organization is moving shop from Laurel to Helena, with the Montana Family Foundation announcing its plans to build the Montana Center for Christian Policy blocks from the capitol building.
According to publicly available data, a permit for 1339 11th Ave., was issued April, matching a site map the organization put in a news release. The permit is for a three-story building, the document says. 
When completed, the new policy shop for the Montana Family Foundation would be across from a Department of Natural Resources and Conservation building and down the street from the state’s new Heritage Center. The organization was previously based out of Laurel.
The Family Foundation did not respond to a request to speak with its leadership and lobbyist Derek Oestreicher, who loomed large during the session. 
In an email, the organization said the new building is, “located in the center of power in Montana” and will include a nonprofit incubator, offices for “Christian attorneys” and a policy and strategy center on its third floor.
“The Montana Family Foundation is a 25-year-old policy partner of Focus on the Family, the Family Research Council, and Alliance Defending Freedom,” the organization said in a news post. “We advance pro-life, pro-family, and religious-freedom principles through legislation and litigation, grounded in a Judeo-Christian worldview and applied in the public square.”
The association with the Alliance Defending Freedom is notable, as one of its members is now on the Criminal Justice Oversight Council, in a position previously held by the American Civil Liberties Union.
The organization said it was a “several million dollar project” and did not specify a timeline in its newspost. The Montana Family Foundation is a 501(c)(4) nonprofit and its 2024 Form 990 said they brought in $133,000 in contributions and grants, down from the previous year, with the documents going on to say they ended the year -$56,538 in net assets or fund balances.
The Montana Family Foundation supported 47 pieces of legislation during the 2025 Legislative session seeing 22 of them pass. 
Great Falls Senator Daniel Emrich, Kalispell Senator John Fuller, Billings Rep. Kerri Seekins-Crowe, and Belgrade Representative Caleb Hinkle, all Republicans, carried many of the bills the Family Foundation sought to pass. A number of those bills also came from known Montana Freedom Caucus members, including Sen. Carl Glimm, a Kila Republican.
They supported legislation that would make judicial races partisan, tightening voting rights, restricting or stopping access to abortions, favoring the display of the Ten Commandments in schools, banning mRNA vaccines, and calling for civil rights investigations into the Montana University System. The organization also supported a resolution against the U.S. Supreme Court’s Obergefell decision, which legalizing same-sex marriage, and a variety of laws targeting the state’s LGBTQ+ population.
“The bills that you lobby on as a lobbyist for the Montana Family Foundation and that Derek (Oestreicher) lobbies on, those are the at the heart of who the Montana Family Foundation is, those social conservative policy bills,” the organization’s executive director, Jeff Laszloffy, said on a recent YouTube podcast hosted by its lobbyists.
All three pieces of legislation it registered in opposition to failed — including SB 139, which would have eliminated a clergy exemption to mandatory reporting laws, meaning religious officials aren’t under any legal obligation to report child sexual assault.
“We question whether the bill is necessary,” Osreicher told the Senate Judiciary Committee on Jan. 28.
According to publicly available lists from the Catholic Church, 47 priests and sisters have been accused of sexual abuse in the Diocese of Great Falls-Billings and 20 priests have been accused in the Diocese of Helena. 
Pastor Tony Aaron Shaw, with Ruby Valley Baptist Church in Sheridan was found guilty of sexual assault against a child earlier this year. And in April of this year, girls who were sexually abused at Morning Star Baptist Church and at the Morning Star Christian Academy filed suit against a pastor — currently serving 30 years — and a church. The girls were around 12 years old at the time of the abuse.
“If everyone that could possibly help someone becomes a mandatory reporter, and there is no place to turn to to get help without winding up in jail, then in the end, they will turn to no one and continue harming children and themselves,” Osreicher told the committee in January.
The bill’s sponsor, Sen. Mary Ann Dunwell, a Helena Democrat, said she worked with the Catholic Diocese on language in the bill that would be acceptable to them, though the bill still failed. 
Dunwell also added that while she disagrees with many of their policies, their right to set up shop where they want isn’t a question.
“It’s democracy,” Dunwell said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MFFConceptArt-1-1011x1024.jpg,,,2025-12-05 18:58:08.745528

Guy Federal Building pictured on Dec. 18, 2024, in Bismarck. (Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)The operator of natural gas production facilities on the Fort Berthold Reservation was ordered Friday to pay a $500,000 fine and do 500 hours of community service for an environmental violation.
Targa Badlands LLC pleaded guilty earlier this year in U.S. District Court in North Dakota to a violation of the Clean Air Act that affected the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation. 
Targa, which operates six natural gas compressor stations on Fort Berthold, failed to install required hazardous air pollutant monitoring systems, federal prosecutors say in court records. 
The violation occurred between 2018 and 2022 on the Johnson Compressor Station near Mandaree. Natural gas gathering pipelines include compressor stations that boost pressure before the gas reaches a natural gas processing plant. 
The combustion engines on the compressor station produce hazardous air pollutants such as benzene and formaldehyde, Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan O’Konek said during the plea hearing, according to a transcript.
The plea agreement indicates Targa self-reported the violation and promptly corrected it by installing monitoring equipment. The company has since taken steps to improve environmental compliance, federal prosecutors said. The attorney for Targa did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday.
In 2019 and 2021, Targa paid a total of $450,000 in civil penalties for similar violations involving compressor stations at Fort Berthold after reaching agreements with the Environmental Protection Agency, court records show. 
The additional $500,000 fine imposed Friday was the maximum penalty for the violation. U.S. District Court Judge Daniel Traynor also ordered Targa to be on probation for three years, do community service work for the MHA Nation and pay a $400 fee. A plea agreement says the company should consult with MHA leaders before starting the community service work.
“Natural gas production is vital to our state’s economy, and it must be done responsibly,” North Dakota U.S. Attorney Nick Chase said in a statement. “This case demonstrates that we can support strong energy production while holding companies accountable when they fall short of their legal obligations.”
MHA Nation Chair Mark Fox said in a statement Friday that tribal leaders appreciate the community service aspect of the sentence, but no formal discussions have occurred about what that will involve.
“We are disappointed with the lack of consultation and are of the opinion that the fines should benefit our nation in some way,” Fox said.
Rep. Lisa Finley-DeVille, a Democrat from Mandaree who also chairs the Dakota Resource Council, said while she acknowledges the company self-reported the violation, it was the third of its kind, illustrating a need for stronger oversight.
“Energy development cannot come at the expense of our people,” Finley-DeVille said. “I will continue advocating for stricter safeguards, better monitoring, and full accountability so our communities receive the clean air and responsible operations they deserve.”

Newborn vaccinations have been critical to stopping the spread of Hepatitis B among Alaska Native children, McMahon said. (Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Western Alaska, where almost all the residents are Indigenous, used to have the world’s highest rate of childhood liver cancer caused by Hepatitis B. After decades of screenings and vaccinations, that problem has been eliminated; since 1995, only one person under the age of 30 has been diagnosed with hepatitis-caused cancer.
Now the Trump administration is seeking to end one of the key tools credited with accomplishing that goal: Hepatitis B vaccinations of newborns.
The federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices on Friday voted to drop a longstanding recommendation for universal hepatitis vaccines for newborns. That is in accordance with the controversial views of U.S. Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr., a vaccine skeptic who fired all members of the previous committee and appointed like-minded members to replace them.
Current federal childhood Hepatitis B vaccination guidelines recommend one dose of the vaccine at birth, followed by additional doses at intervals through 18 months. The recommendation for newborn vaccinations has been in place since 1991.
The advisory committee, part of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, determined that children under 2 months should not be vaccinated unless their mothers are infected or could be infected by Hepatitis B.
Some vaccine critics in the administration, including Kennedy and President Donald Trump themselves, argue — contradicting medical experts and years of medical research — that Hepatitis B vaccines for young children are unnecessary, claiming that it is spread primarily or exclusively through adult behavior like sex and sharing of needles for illegal drug use.
“Hepatitis B is sexually transmitted. There’s no reason to give a baby that’s almost just born Hepatitis B. So I would say wait till the baby is 12 years old and formed and take Hepatitis B,” Trump said at a Sept. 22 news conference.
Those claims are false, said Dr. Brian McMahon, medical and research director of the liver and hepatitis program at the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium.
There is no credible evidence of  a link between the vaccine and autism of any other health problem, McMahon said.
And sexual transmissions accounted for only a tiny percentage of Alaska’s Hepatitis B cases, he said.
Aside from mother-to-infant transmissions, which occur during childbirth, Hepatitis B was predominantly spread in Western Alaska through normal daily activities. That is because, unlike the HIV virus or other hepatitis viruses, the Hepatitis B virus can live for seven days on surfaces in schools and homes, like tables and personal-grooming items.
“The virus can be found all over, on school luncheon tabletops, counters and homes,” McMahon said. “Kids have open cuts and scratches from bug bites or anything else, and then they shed millions of particles of the virus on environmental surfaces. And then another kid comes along with an open cut or scratch.”
Such risks are exacerbated in rural Alaska, he said, where homes can be crowded and people pursue traditional subsistence lifestyles with a lot of outdoor activities. 
“They’re hunting, fishing, cutting up meat, etcetera, and mosquito bites are real prominent,” he said.

	Nationally, only 12.6% of chronic Hepatitis B cases recorded from 2013 to 2018 were attributable to sexual transmission, according to a 2023 CDC study. Transmissions of all forms of hepatitis, including Hepatitis B, are possible through contact sports like football, rugby and hockey, researchers have found.
Alaska’s disease and vaccination success 
Before the past decades of vaccination and screening, Hepatitis B was so prevalent in Western Alaska that it was classified as endemic there. It was the only part of the United States with such a classification. In some villages, 20% to 30% of the residents were infected, McMahon said.
Geography and ancient migration patterns accounted for historically high rates of the disease in Western Alaska, as well as other Indigenous regions of the Arctic.
Various strains have been carried from Asia to Alaska over millennia, according to scientists. And the remoteness of Indigenous communities meant isolation from medical services, making early diagnosis difficult in the past, allowing infections to linger and be passed down through generations, according to scientists.
In Alaska, children infected with the virus early in life had a high likelihood of winding up with chronic infections that caused serious complications later, such as liver failure. The worst cases resulted in cancer, and even death.
For McMahon, now in his 80s, treating cancer-stricken children in the Yukon-Kuskokwim region, where he worked in the 1970s, was harrowing.
One of his patients was a 17-year-old high school valedictorian. A few months earlier, she started having abdominal pains, but she ignored them. 
“She was really busy with school, and she’d gotten a full ride scholarship and was excited about going to the University of Alaska, representing her community,” McMahon said.
The pains turned out to be cancer, caused by a hepatitis B infection that she had not known she had. Too sick to be flown home, she died in the Bethel hospital. 
“It was horrible,” McMahon said.
Another patient was an 11-year-old boy, also diagnosed after he complained of similar abdominal pain. McMahon visited him at home, where the boy was “in horrible pain” and yellow from jaundice. 
“He was just crying. He said I know I’m going to die. Just help me with my pain,’” McMahon said.
“My wife was with me. She was a public health nurse. She was in tears. The community health aid practitioner was in tears. I was fighting my tears and pulling everything I could out of my bag to try to help this patient sedate.  It was just something I’ll never forget. Never.” McMahon said.
He has relayed these and other experiences to the vaccine advisory committee in hopes of persuading members to keep the infant recommendations in place.
“I said, ‘Do you want to be responsible for children getting liver cancer because this decision?’” McMahon said. “So I’m probably not very popular right now.”
Alaska was one of the first places in the world where the Hepatitis B vaccine was used as soon as it became available in 1981.

	The pilot vaccination project was at the insistence of Alaska Native organizations, along with the state government and the Alaska congressional delegation. Under that pilot program, according to newly published study by McMahon and other researchers from the ANTHC and the CDC’s Arctic program, tribal health organizations and their partners screened 53,860 Alaska Native people for infection and gave vaccines to 43,618 Alaska Native people who tested negative, along with starting the universal newborn vaccinations.
Health officials have followed the outcomes since then, and the new study lists several achievements 40 years after universal newborn vaccination started.
Since 1995, according to the study, there have been no new symptomatic cases of Hepatitis B among Alaska Natives under 20 anywhere in the state. Since 2000, no new cases of hepatitis-related liver cancer have been identified among Alaska Natives of any age in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, a region where prevalence was concentrated in the past, the study said. And follow-up surveillance has revealed that childhood Hepatitis B vaccinations remain effective for at least 35 years, the study said.
Successes are also reflected in the trend of acute hepatitis, the form of infection that is short-lived and can be cleared from the body.
There have been no identified cases of acute hepatitis among Alaska Native children since 1992, according to Johns Hopkins University. The rate of acute hepatitis among Alaskans of all ages and ethnicities dropped from 12.1 cases per 100,000 people to 0.9 per 100,000 in the 2002-2015 period, according to the state Department of Health’s epidemiology section.
Alaska’s rate of chronic hepatitis B – the long-term and persistent infection that can lead to serious liver problems – remains higher than the national average. As of 2020, Alaska’s rate of chronic Hepatitis B was 14.2 cases per 100,000 people, nearly triple the national rate of 5 cases per 100,000 people, according to a report by the state Department of Health’s epidemiology section.
McMahon said that is partly because of the legacy of infections in the older Native population, people whose childhood predated widespread vaccination, and prevalence among foreign-born residents who come from countries without widespread vaccination.
Debate over Hepatitis B risks
This year, vaccine skeptics who are members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, however, along with people who are advising the committee, have argued that the risks of Hepatitis B among children are too low to justify universal infant vaccination.
One of the officials making that argument at Thursday’s committee meeting was Dr. Cynthia Nevison, a vaccine skeptic hired as a CDC consultant. She contradicted McMahon’s description of children spreading the virus through casual contact with contaminated surfaces – a process known as “horizontal transmission.”
“There’s very little evidence that horizontal transmission has ever been a significant threat to the average American child, and the risk probably has been overstated,” she said at the meeting. Also overstated, she said, are the risks of “vertical transmission,” the viral transmission between mothers and their newborns.
The committee’s new recommendation must be approved by the CDC administrator before it becomes federal policy.
McMahon said that no matter how national policy might change, Alaska Native tribal health organizations will continue administering Hepatitis B vaccines to newborns.
“I know they’re not going to stop. Even if they have to pay for it. They’re so aware of this,” he said.
His fears, he said, are for low-income families who depend on free vaccinations through state programs that might lose funding and for parents who are getting conflicting messages that may lead to conclusions that the vaccine is not necessary. 
“It could be a real mess,” he said.

(Courtesy of BorderPlex Digital Assets)Developers behind Project Jupiter, the controversial campus of data centers slated for Doña Ana County, have asked state environment officials to sign off on their plans to emit more greenhouse gases than the state’s two largest cities combined, and to generate as much electricity as the state’s largest power company.
Applications for air quality permits confirm figures that Source NM previously reported: If approved, Project Jupiter could emit more than 14 million tons of greenhouse gases per year. By comparison, Albuquerque and Las Cruces emit a combined 6.7 million metric tons of greenhouse gases annually, according to both cities’ climate action plans. The applications also say developers seek to install 41 turbines to annually generate about as much electricity as PNM.
Developers filed two applications, one for a “west microgrid” and one for an “east microgrid.” A microgrid is a self-reliant energy grid that doesn’t need to draw power from a larger utility, like PNM or El Paso Electric. For months, plans have made it clear that developers want to build natural gas generating stations for Project Jupiter’s microgrids, prompting concerns from residents and lawmakers that the data centers won’t comply with the state’s landmark clean energy law, which requires utilities to use 50% renewable energy by 2030, 80% by 2040 and 100% by 2045.
The applications show that together, the microgrids will emit nearly 500 tons per year of nitrogen oxides, an important ingredient in contributing to ozone. Individually, one microgrid is listed at 249.97 tons per year and the other at 248.9.
Environmental advocates say the developers’ proposal to split emissions across two permits for the same project appears to skirt state regulations, which classify projects with at least 250 tons per year of nitrogen oxides as “major sources” of hazardous air pollutants and subject them to arduous monitoring.
“They’ve split it into two separate plants that are ‘minor sources’ to avoid having to monitor their actual air quality impacts, which are going to be huge,” said Colin Cox, senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity’s Climate Law Institute. “They’re coming up to 99.9% of the threshold for when they’d have to do additional work.”
The American Lung Association has long given Doña Ana County a failing grade for ozone, which can cause asthma attacks, increased risk of respiratory infections and even increased risk of premature death.
BorderPlex Digital Assets, the company that has represented Project Jupiter in public meetings, did not respond to a request for comment.
Project Jupiter pits demand for data against New Mexico’s finite natural resources

The permits will only have to go through a public hearing process if an “outside party,” which can include a resident of the area, requests it, according to a spokesperson for the New Mexico Environment Department. No hearings have been scheduled.
Members of the public have, however, tried to stop the project in court.
In October, two residents and a local nonprofit filed a lawsuit against elected members of the Doña Ana County Commission and accused them of voting on an incomplete application when they approved $165 billion in government-backed bonds for the project in September. 
“We’ve seen this with other air permit applications, where they’re right under the limit,” Maslyn Locke, a New Mexico Environmental Law Center senior attorney who is representing residents in the case, told Source NM. “Ultimately that means everything has to go 100% perfectly as they operate to not violate that…I don’t know if that’s realistic.” 
Since filing suit in October, the nonprofit Empowerment Congress of Doña Ana County has withdrawn as a plaintiff in the lawsuit.
Another lawsuit, filed by Las Cruces resident Derrick Pacheco, alleged that county leaders acted inappropriately when they approved the project even though it had yet to go through the Planning and Zoning Commission.

Tony Evers vetoed nine bills Friday including a Republican bill that would have barred local and state funds from being used for immigrants without legal status.
Wisconsin already doesn’t allow immigrants without legal status to access BadgerCare, which Evers noted in his veto message. Republicans lawmakers acknowledged that fact as they advocated for AB 308, saying the bill was intended to block future use of health care benefits by immigrants. The bill would have prohibited state, county, village, long-term care district and federal funds from being used to subsidize, reimburse or provide compensation for any health care services for a person not lawfully in the U.S.
“As this bill’s Republican co-author in the Wisconsin State Assembly plainly stated in the public hearing on this proposal, ‘Wisconsin currently doesn’t allow undocumented immigrants to enroll in BadgerCare,’” Evers wrote in his veto message. 
“I object to Republican lawmakers passing legislation they acknowledge is unnecessary to prevent problems they admit do not exist, all for the sake of trying to push polarizing political rhetoric,” Evers added. 
Evers said the bill was “more about being inflammatory, stoking fear, and sowing division than it was about accomplishing any significant policy outcome or being prudent stewards of taxpayer dollars.” 
U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany, one of two Republican candidates for governor, criticized the veto in a statement, saying Evers was putting the interests of “illegal aliens” ahead of Wisconsin taxpayers and sought to tie Evers’ action to next year’s high-profile gubernatorial election. Evers is not running for reelection, and there is a crowded Democratic field that is still taking shape.
“If Democrats take the governor’s office in 2026, you can count on them to hand out driver’s licenses, in-state tuition and taxpayer-funded health care to illegal aliens. I will not let that happen,” Tiffany said.
No new cigar bars
Evers also vetoed a bill that would have allowed for more tobacco bars in Wisconsin. 
Wisconsin first enacted its smoke-free air law in 2010 — prohibiting smoking cigars, cigarettes, pipes and other products in public spaces. The law included an exclusion for cigar bars that were in existence before June 4, 2009.
AB 211 would have allowed for more exemptions for tobacco bars if they came into existence on or after June 4, 2009 provided that they allowed only the smoking of cigars and pipes and were not part of a retail food establishment.
Evers, a former smoker and an esophageal cancer survivor, said he objected due to the harm that the bill could have on Wisconsinites public health.
“Secondhand smoke, a known carcinogen, causes serious health problems and is responsible for thousands of deaths on an annual basis,” Evers stated. He said the state’s smoke-free air law was “a critically important step forward for keeping kids, families, and communities healthier and safer, improving public health and, most importantly, saving thousands of lives… I cannot in good conscience reverse course on that important step for public health, safety, and well-being by restoring indoor smoking in certain public spaces.”
Bill to ban guaranteed income
Evers also vetoed AB 165, which would have banned local governments from using tax money to create guaranteed income programs without a work or training requirement. 
Evers wrote in his veto message that he objects to lawmakers’ “continued efforts to arbitrarily restrict and preempt local governments across our state.” He said they should instead focus on finding ways to support local communities and ensure they have the resources they need to “meet basic and unique needs alike.”
Building code delay
Evers vetoed AB 450, which would have put off the effective date of Wisconsin’s updated commercial building code until April 1, 2026, saying he objected to “further unnecessary delay in implementing new building standards that will benefit Wisconsin communities.” 
The new building codes were originally blocked by lawmakers on the Joint Committee on the Review of Administrative Rules for years, but they were reinstated this year by the the Department of Safety and Professional Services (DSPS) after a state Supreme Court decision. Justices ruled in July that state laws allowing the Legislature to block executive branch administrative rules indefinitely were unconstitutional.
The current effective date for the building codes is Nov. 1, 2025.
Republican lawmakers claimed the delay to next year was needed to provide clarity to builders who had been planning projects under the previous code. 
Evers wrote in his veto message that the bill would do the opposite. 
“This bill would not only create confusion for developers with current building projects under review but would also further delay the implementation of new safety and energy efficiency standards that have been already widely adopted,” Evers said. “The department has and will continue to work with building professionals throughout the state to ensure proper understanding and compliance with the new building commercial code.” 
Education bills rejected
A handful of Republican education-related bills were rejected by Evers. 
Currently, teacher preparation programs are required to have a full semester of student teaching during the school year. SB 424 would have allowed for programs to use student teaching during a summer session as an alternative to a full school-year semester.
Lawmakers had said the bill would help with recruitment by allowing for more flexibility to students seeking to become teachers. However, Evers said that the bill would potentially reduce the rigor of the current training that students are required to have, especially given that summer sessions can be shorter than a typical school term and may not allow students to experience the same opportunities available during the school year such as parent-teacher conferences.
“Reducing training, qualifications, experience, and work ages are not real solutions for solving Wisconsin’s generational workforce shortages,” Evers said in his veto message. “Wisconsin’s challenges recruiting, training, and retaining exceptional educators will not be aided by making education professionals less trained, less qualified, and less experienced — nor will our kids.”
Evers also vetoed AB 166, which would have required UW system institutions, technical colleges and private nonprofit colleges to report cost and student outcome data and required the information be provided to high school juniors and seniors in academic and career planning services. 
Evers said in his veto message that he didn’t want to burden the state’s higher education institutions with more administrative requirements, especially without “necessary resources.” He noted that the UW system says that the requirements in the bill “overlap substantially” with existing information that is already available. 
The University of Wisconsin system keeps a public dashboard with some of the information that the bill would have required, including for financial aid, retention and graduation, and time and credits to degree.
Evers also vetoed SB 10, which would have mandated that Wisconsin public school districts provide military recruiters with access to common areas in high schools and access during the school day and during school-sanctioned events. He said that while he supports the troops, he doesn’t support lawmakers’ attempts to “usurp” local control of decisions on when and where military recruiters are given access to schools. 
Bill that would have eliminated requirement for Elections Commission appeal
Voters currently can file a complaint to the Wisconsin Election Commission if they allege an election official serving the voter’s jurisdiction has failed to comply with certain election laws or has abused his or her discretion with respect to the administration of such election laws. A voter who doesn’t agree with a WEC decision can appeal to a court, though currently courts are only allowed to take up an appeal if voters have suffered an injury to a legally recognized interest as a result. That requirement was established in a 2025 state Supreme Court decision.
SB 270 would have eliminated that requirement, and Evers said he objected because it “would open the floodgates to frivolous lawsuits that not only burden our courts, but our election systems as well.” 
Penalties for those who falsely claim a service animal
AB 366, which would have allowed housing providers to require documentation for service animals and created penalties for misrepresentation of an animal. Evers said he objects to “the creation of unnecessary barriers for individuals with legitimate disability-related needs.”

The mental health program, which was funded by Congress after the 2022 school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, included grants meant to help schools hire more counselors, psychologists and social workers, with a focus on rural and underserved areas of the country. 
In Connecticut, that included a five-year grant of $3 million for a program at the University of Connecticut’s Graduate School of Social Work. The funds were intended to support 25 graduate students in social work providing mental health services to students in Hartford, New Britain, Waterbury and Vernon. 
President Donald Trump’s administration opposed aspects of the grant programs that touched on race, saying they were harmful to students and told recipients they wouldn’t receive funding past December 2025.
[RELATED: CT sues Trump admin. over funds for mental health services in schools]
Connecticut Attorney General William Tong, along with sixteen other state attorneys general, filed the lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington in July.
In October, U.S. District Judge Kymberly K. Evanson, ruled that the administration’s move to cancel school mental health grants was arbitrary and capricious.
The U.S. Department of Education and Secretary of Education Linda McMahon requested an emergency stay and on Thursday, a panel from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals denied that motion.
The panel wrote in its decision that the government hadn’t shown it is likely to succeed based on its claims that the district court doesn’t have jurisdiction or that it will be “irreparably injured absent a stay.”
The grants were first awarded under Democratic President Joe Biden’s administration. The Education Department prioritized giving the money to applicants who showed how they would increase the number of counselors from diverse backgrounds or from communities directly served by the school district.
The Trump administration said in a statement after the ruling in October that the grants were used “to promote divisive ideologies based on race and sex.”
The preliminary ruling by Evanson, a U.S. District Court judge in Seattle, applies only to some grantees in the 16 Democratic-led states that challenged the Education Department’s decision.

(Photo by Robert Stewart/Verite News)NEW ORLEANS — Local community leaders and politicians, including Mayor-elect Helena Moreno, Congressman Troy Carter, and former Mayor Marc Morial, hosted a press conference Friday to demand that federal immigration agents deployed to New Orleans be more transparent and humane in their tactics.
The press conference followed a letter sent earlier in the day by City Council to Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino with five specific demands for the recently-launched immigration sweep dubbed Catahoula Crunch. The demands asked agents to report data including number of arrests made and criminal history of detainees, ensure due process, require officers to be identified and unmasked, disavow discriminatory stops, and provide medical care and language services to detainees.
The demands from the City Council come less than a week into the operation, which has led to widespread unease among New Orleans’ sizable immigrant population as individuals have been stopped, detained, and even chased at their places of employment, homes, and churches.
“We stand here with an obligation to ensure that federal operations are conducted with transparency, constitutionally, and with respect for local residents,” Moreno said.
As anxiety over the operation continues to rise, multiple speakers spoke about the economic impact to New Orleans’ large hospitality and tourism industries, noting concerns of workers not showing up for fear of being detained or deported.
Carter, who represents Louisiana’s 2nd District — which includes New Orleans — decried any operations that create fear and confusion for families, workers and businesses.
“We want federal partners, we just don’t want occupation,” Carter said. “We want them to work with us, not around us.”

City councilmembers in New Orleans, a Democratic stronghold in a deeply Republican state, have grappled with the legal limitations of their power to push back against federal agents, in part because of laws and policies enacted by Louisiana’s conservative state government, such as a recently passed Louisiana law that prohibits interference with federal immigration agents. Moreno said that she felt they were requesting only basic transparency data, which she said she views as reasonable.

If you see federal immigration agents interacting with the public or have other information related to the operation “Catahoula Crunch,” please contact us on Signal using the username veritenews.22.

The clash between local, state and federal officials continues as Attorney General Liz Murrill posted a letter sent to New Orleans Police Department Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick, where Murrill wrote that she recommended Kirkpatrick order NOPD officers to cooperate with ICE.
Earlier in the week, the council published a web page where people can anonymously upload footage that depicts any alleged abuses from federal immigration agents. The page also includes materials to educate people on their rights in English, Spanish and Vietnamese, which states that the NOPD will not ask people about their immigration status.
Speakers at the press conference urged continued transparency and community collaboration as operation Catahoula Crunch moves forward.
Council President JP Morrell pushed back against the reasoning behind the quota announced by Border Patrol — to arrest 5,000 people in New Orleans.
“I do not believe you are here for the reason you say you are here but you have an opportunity to prove me wrong,” he said in reference to federal immigration agents. “Provide this information that’s being requested by the New Orleans City Council. … Until then, this council will continue to use all the resources available to us, legal and otherwise, and make sure that the citizens of this city are protected.”

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Some Oklahomans in central and downtown Oklahoma City could have two races for the same state House seat on their ballot next year.
Gov. Kevin Stitt on Wednesday set special election dates to fill a vacant seat in House District 92, which was previously represented by Rep. Forrest Bennett, D-Oklahoma City.
Bennett resigned effective Monday to lead the Oklahoma State AFL-CIO, a group of 230 labor unions representing over 100,000 workers. 
The dates the Republican governor set overlap with the 2026 general election dates, an election House District 92 was already set to be on the ballot for. The House seat will remain vacant during this upcoming session. 
Misha Mohr, a spokesperson for the Oklahoma Election Board, said there will be a separate special election ballot. The regular primary for House District 92 will be on a regular primary election ballot. 
“Our interpretation of state law is that a candidate may run in both the regular and special election because, in this case, it is for the same office,” she said in a statement. “The candidate that wins the special election will serve the remainder of the unexpired term. The candidate that wins the regular election will serve the full term.”
Spokespeople for Stitt’s office did not return a request for comment by time of publication or answer questions about why these dates were chosen. 
Candidates seeking to run for the seat in the Oklahoma House must file between April 1 and April 3. 
The special primary will be held June 16. If a runoff primary is needed, it will be on Aug. 25. 
The special general election will be on Nov. 3. If a runoff is not needed, the general election will be held in late August. If a special primary is not needed, the general election will be on June 16. 
If voters elect the same candidate in both the special and regular election, the candidate will serve a full two-year term plus the remainder of Bennett’s term.
However, if two different candidates are elected in the special and regular election, the winner of the special election will only serve a few months.

Counter-protesters gathered on the balcony above. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Redistricting supporters on Friday renewed promises to use their wealth against Indiana Senate Republicans who flout President Donald Trump’s demands for an all-GOP congressional map.
The polarizing proposal would likely eliminate the state’s two Democratic-held congressional districts to create a 9-0 Republican map ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.
The Indiana House approved the legislation Friday. The Senate will begin deliberations on Monday, but the chamber’s Republican leader has warned for months there aren’t enough votes.

“If this thing passes (the Senate) … then, we sent that final exclamation point that we needed to send,” said Brett Galaszewski, an enterprise director at Turning Point Action, the political arm of the Phoenix, Arizona organization founded by the late Charlie Kirk.
“But if it doesn’t — and I hope these senators hear me right now when I say these words — if it does not pass, Turning Point Action is willing to throw more money and resources into these primary races than some congressional races,” Galaszewski said, as cheers rang out.
“We will throw so much money and resources into this state that no amount of money coming from a leadership (political action committee) will be able to offset it,” he emphasized.
Galaszewski spoke to Hoosiers gathered in the Statehouse for a Turning Point Action rally targeting reluctant Republican senators, calling Indiana “the last line of defense for us conservatives.”
Indiana Gov. Mike Braun, who headlined the event, doubled down on his own threats.
Failure in the Senate, he said, “means you’re gonna have to clean house to get real conservatives in.”
Braun later told reporters that the Senate is “the place where things die for any good idea,” and described the chamber’s members as “out of sync with most Republicans and conservatives” in Indiana.

Some are already planning to challenge anti-redistricting incumbents. At the rally was Paula Copenhaver, a top aide to Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith who has launched a campaign against GOP Sen. Spencer Deery of West Lafayette.

Beckwith argued most Hoosiers support new maps. Several polls have found a majority do not.
“When you have the corrupt Indianapolis media telling you that the Indiana people don’t want it, they’re lying to you!” he exclaimed. “Hoosiers, overwhelmingly, … want this to happen!”
Speakers repeatedly pointed to “manipulated” maps in other Democratic states, primarily citing California and Massachusetts, as why Indiana should redistrict mid-census.
“They’ve been playing this game a long time,” said U.S. Rep. Marlin Stutzman, a Republican representing Indiana’s 3rd District. “President Trump was nearly assassinated. Charlie Kirk … was assassinated in front of the entire world. They’re using bullets, my friend. We’re going to use the ballot box!”
Indiana’s seven-member Republican congressional delegation pledged support for redistricting in August, in the early days of the Trump administration’s pressure campaign. That included trips in August and October by Vice President JD Vance to meet with Hoosier leaders.
A few hundred supporters attended Friday’s event, where counter-protesters standing at the balconies overhead jeered  and chanted, “Cheaters, cheaters, cheaters!”
Attendees were encouraged to contact their senators — including at stations upstairs by the Senate’s Republican and Democratic entrances, where constituents could leave handwritten messages.

(Photo: courtesy of Siembra NC)Another large-scale immigration enforcement operation appears to be underway in North Carolina, focusing on the Research Triangle and Triad area, according to immigrant advocacy group Siembra NC.
In a statement Friday, Siembra NC said they received reports of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in Morrisville, Apex, Durham, Greensboro, Charlotte and other locations this week. Some carried rifles and wore vests labeled “HSI Police” (Homeland Security Investigations is the investigative arm of ICE), while others wore masks and approached people in parked cars or pursued them on the road.
NC Newsline has not independently confirmed these reports.
Citing an unnamed source within the Department of Homeland Security, Siembra NC co-director Nikki Marín Baena said the group believes a monthlong ICE operation is underway in North Carolina involving at least 50 agents from other states. She said it’s the largest statewide operation in many years.
A spokesperson for ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement earlier this week that she could not confirm any ICE activities. “Every day, DHS enforces the laws of the nation across the country. We do not discuss future or potential operations.”
The apparent ramp-up comes after heightened Border Patrol operations in November in Raleigh and Charlotte drew protests and led to the detention of some U.S. citizens. “Operation Charlotte’s Web” resulted in more than 425 arrests, according to the Department of Homeland Security.
“Even as workplaces, schools, and communities are still reeling from the devastating impacts of Border Patrol’s operation in November, this new monthlong operation by ICE is threatening a new wave of school absences, economic turmoil, and families ripped apart just a few weeks before the holidays,” Marín Baena said.
Ojo Obrero, an ICE activity tracker launched by Siembra NC in November, shows 10 reports in North Carolina in the past week, centered around the Research Triangle, the Piedmont Triad, and the Charlotte metropolitan area.
In Durham, at least three individuals were arrested on Dec. 4 and Dec. 5 on their way to interviews with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Siembra NC alleged, including a permanent resident set to interview to become a citizen and two mothers arriving for green card interviews.
The activist group laid the blame for the operations on North Carolina House Speaker Destin Hall, quoting his comments last week that “ICE and CBP are doing a great job. We don’t have much to say to them except we just ask that they come back.”
Hall did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but in a social media post on Tuesday, condemned Siembra NC’s promotion of a “Destin Hall Pass” to stay home from work to avoid ICE.
“Looks like a far-left, pro-illegal group is now giving out a ‘Destin Hall Pass’ to help people skip work when ICE is in NC,” Hall wrote. “I’ve never seen a group of people so committed to breaking the law instead of keeping the public safe. Insanity.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Inc403_Greensboro.120425-1024x676.jpeg,,,2025-12-05 17:59:02.163189

Chiquita Moore, 41, was charged Thursday with theft and with tampering with public records. The ASP began investigating her in February at the request of Sonia Hagood, prosecuting attorney for the state’s 2nd Judicial District, which includes Clay, Craighead, Crittenden, Greene, Poinsett and Mississippi counties.
Moore resigned in August 2024 from her position as district court clerk in Earle, a Crittenden County city with fewer than 2,000 people. According to the 2024 report on Earle from the nonpartisan Arkansas Legislative Audit, the district court clerk’s office displayed “noncompliance with state law and accepted accounting practices.”
The report found financial discrepancies totaling $23,671 in bank deposits and receipts from the district court clerk’s office between January 2023 and August 2024. The validity of $11,935 in voided receipts “could not be substantiated,” according to the report, and $6,298 in receipts did not have adequate supporting documentation.
The remaining $5,438 in receipts “could not be traced to a bank deposit,” the report states.
Moore was taken into ASP custody and booked into the Crittenden County Detention Center on Thursday, according to the news release.
Law enforcement is also investigating Earle Mayor Jaylen Smith for alleged financial misdeeds, according to the audit report.
Audit staff could not substantiate documentation Smith provided them regarding $2,866 in hotel and fuel charges for an out-of-state trip, the report states. The city council approved the credit card charges in August 2024 but reversed its approval two months later because the city treasurer had not received adequate supporting documentation.
The report asserts that without the documentation, the expenses might conflict with Article 12, Section 5 of the Arkansas Constitution, which states, “No county, city, town or other municipal corporation, shall… obtain or appropriate money for, or loan its credit to, any corporation, association, institution or individual.”
As of Oct. 9, when the report was released, the city had not paid the credit card charges and Smith had not reimbursed the city.
Earle voters elected Smith at the age of 18 in 2022, making him the nation’s youngest Black mayor. He said earlier this year that he would run for a seat in the state House of Representatives in 2026, but he later decided to instead run for reelection as Earle’s mayor.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-05-at-4.03.32 PM.png,,,2025-12-05 17:59:02.163189

The review was prompted by a contentious election in Bennington County last year in which dozens of voters received the wrong ballots.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Audit finds more Vermont voters assigned to wrong state House, Senate districts .","MONTPELIER — An audit of local voter rolls prompted by the error-plagued race for a Vermont House seat in Bennington County last year uncovered 100 more cases across the state in which people had been assigned to vote in the wrong legislative district.
As a result, the Vermont Secretary of State’s Office, which conducted the review, is calling for additional checks of town-managed voter rolls each time the state conducts the decennial process of redrawing legislative districts after the U.S. census count.
The number of Vermont voters assigned to the wrong district is low relative to the total number of people — about 373,000 — who cast a ballot in the most recent election. Officials from the secretary’s office said Friday they were not aware of any instances in which the results of a recent election would have changed because of voters who were in the wrong district.

The review was required by a law passed earlier this year and was published Nov. 20. It had all 24 Vermont cities and towns that span more than one district, for the Vermont House or Senate, review the checklists that prescribe who in town votes in which district.
Most Vermont municipalities are part of just one legislative district, meaning every voter there chooses from the same slate of state representatives and senators. But in the two dozen others, municipal and legislative district lines do not align so neatly. That means which candidates a resident sees on their ballot depends on where their house is.
That’s the case in the Bennington County town of Pownal, where some 50 voters were found shortly after the 2024 election to have been assigned to the wrong House district. The error stemmed from how a single street in town had been divided, during redistricting in 2022, between the Bennington-1 and Bennington-5 House districts.
Democrat Jonathan Cooper won the race in Bennington-1 over Republican Bruce Busa by fewer than 30 votes, calling into question if the error influenced the result and how the discrepancies should be handled. The full House later voted to affirm Cooper’s win, though several months after, it also passed the law requiring voter rolls to be audited.
The errors on Pownal’s voter rolls were corrected following the 2024 election. The 100 people identified in the latest report were in addition to those, the Secretary of State’s Office said. All of the newfound discrepancies have also since been corrected.
According to the audit, three other municipalities made “minor errors” putting the 2022 district maps into effect. In Burlington, the state’s largest city, 26 out of about 29,200 total voters had to be moved to another House district, the review found. Meanwhile, Colchester and Williamstown had to move five and one voters, respectively.
The audit also found “data integrity issues” related to voters’ records that were either formatted incorrectly or included incomplete information. For instance, a voter may have listed their apartment number on a line meant for the number of their street address, meaning they were assigned to a voting district on the wrong side of the street. 
As a result of those data issues — many of which predated even the latest decennial redistricting process — 68 more voters across 12 different municipalities had to be moved into a different district after the audit, according to the secretary’s office.
In all, that meant more than half of the towns in the state that encompass multiple districts needed to move at least one voter as a result of the audit.
Lauren Hibbert, Vermont’s deputy secretary of state, said inaccuracies on voter rolls are unavoidable and that the office was expecting to find a small number of them. She said the results of the audit should not make people feel less confident in the integrity of the state’s elections because many of the errors were a result of data being entered incorrectly, almost certainly by accident.
She also characterized the findings as an example of the joint oversight of elections between local and state officials working as it should.
“I think Vermonters can feel very comfortable that their town clerk is aware who is on their voter checklist. And, when you take that across all of our towns, that the statewide voter checklist is very well maintained,” Hibbert said in an interview.
She added that the office’s relatively new election management system, which it rolled out earlier this year, has safeguards that would likely flag similar errors in voter data entry going forward. The system also makes it easier for the office to run reports looking for errors in its statewide database that includes all voters, Hibbert said.
Vermont’s election data, and similar data in other states, has come into the crosshairs in recent months due to efforts by President Donald Trump’s administration to collect details on voters across the country. The White House has indicated that it wants the data to crack down on fraudulent voting and identify instances, which data shows are rare, of non-U.S. citizens voting in state or federal elections.
The Vermont Secretary of State’s Office denied a request in August from Trump’s Department of Justice to hand over voter data. On Monday, the Trump administration sued Vermont to force the state to comply.
Vermont’s Republican Gov. Phil Scott said at a press conference Wednesday that he supported Secretary of State Sarah Copeland Hanzas’ decision to withhold the data, which could include voters’ dates of birth, driver’s license numbers and Social Security numbers.
The secretary’s office had no additional information on the lawsuit as of Friday, Hibbert said.

Federal officials have so far identified fewer than 10 people detained in its New Orleans-area sting as having criminal records, and it has not reported how many total have been taken into custody. In comparable ICE and Border Patrol operations in other areas, only a fraction of those arrested have had criminal backgrounds.
The attorney general sent her pointed message to Kirkpatrick as agents continued their roundups, which have included immigrants with legal residency status and people mistakenly targeted.  
“At this time, I recommend that you immediately direct NOPD officers and staff to fully cooperate with ICE and CBP,” Murrill wrote in the conclusion of her letter.
In an emailed statement, an NOPD spokesperson said Murrill’s letter has been received and was under review. 
“NOPD will continue to follow all state and federal laws while staying focused on public safety and maintaining the trust of our community,” Kirkpatrick said in the statement.
Murrill’s letter said NOPD employees would be committing malfeasance in office under state law if they adhere to policies that require them to refuse cooperating with ICE. In addition, they could be charged with a federal felony if they knowingly conceal or withhold information about someone being in the country illegally. 
In the letter, Murrill cited policy in the NOPD Operations Manual that bars NOPD officers from assisting federal immigration authorities except in limited instances. These include when there is a threat to life or safety, when executing a court-issued warrant or order, and sending or receiving citizenship status information to and with ICE.
In an interview with WBOK-AM last month, Kirkpatrick said the NOPD would not take part in any “removals” but during federal immigration sweeps would assist agents “if they need help because of safety.” 
The superintendent has also described the immigration efforts as civil matters, as opposed to criminal. Murrill challenged that stance in her letter to Kirkpatrick. 
“There is no absolution in suggesting that immigration enforcement laws are a ‘civil issue,’ and, on that basis, NOPD cannot assist or support ICE and CBP in their enforcement efforts,” the attorney general wrote. 
Murrill also noted a state law approved in 2024 that prohibits cities from adopting “sanctuary policies” that are contrary to immigration laws, adding that she has the authority to sue any local agency that puts any such ordinances or rules in place.
The attorney general is challenging the Orleans Parish Sheriff’s Office, which operates the city jail, in federal court over its refusal to honor detainer requests from ICE or share information with the agency on the immigration status of people in custody. The sheriff’s office policy has been in place since 2013 as part of a settlement in a federal case involving two immigrant construction workers who were kept in jail at ICE’s request after they had completed their sentences for minor offenses.
The NOPD’s policy is linked to a 2013 federal consent decree meant to address the department’s history of corruption and unconstitutional police practices. It included measures to curb racial profiling, which potentially impacts how immigration enforcement is conducted.    
But less than two weeks before federal agents launched their operation in New Orleans, a federal judge terminated the consent decree at the request of the U.S. Department of Justice and city leaders.    
The Trump administration has acted to quash similar federal oversight agreements for police departments in Louisville, Kentucky, and Minneapolis, arguing they are too far-reaching and limit the ability of law enforcement to tackle crime.

AMES — Iowa legislators discussed food policy priorities, including the Choose Iowa program, food education efforts and support for food insecure individuals Friday at the Iowa Local Food Summit.
The summit, led by Iowa Food System Coalition and Iowa Farmers Union, included panels with state agencies and Republican and Democratic legislators on local food policies. 
The discussions at the summit centered on supporting Iowa food producers, addressing issues of food insecurity in the state and the places where those two issues intersect.

Food insecurity 
About 12% of Iowans are food insecure, according to data from Feeding American. But food security advocates project recent federal changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, will make it more difficult for the state to support food-insecure households. 
Iowa has also enacted its own changes to food assistance programs. In January, Gov. Kim Reynolds’ plan to stop SNAP recipients from purchasing sugary drinks, candy and other items, goes into effect. This summer, the state opted to carry out its own summer feeding program for food insecure children, rather than follow the federal summer feeding program. 
State Sen. Annette Sweeney, R-Iowa Falls, said these programs allowed for greater localization of food assistance. 
“Our local individuals working in the food pantries, they see the need,” Sweeney said. 
With a state-led program, she said, these local individuals are able to advocate for changes and adjustments to a program so they can best serve their recipients. 
Rather than loading money onto SNAP Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) cards on a per-child basis as the federal program operates, the state program partnered with food banks to instead distribute $40 worth of food, per child, to households. 
Erin Drinnin, the division director for community access and eligibility at the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services, said during a panel earlier Friday that the state is still waiting for a finalized evaluation report of the Healthy Kids Iowa program. 
Preliminary feedback from the evaluation, according to Drinnin, showed that parents “really liked the program” but food banks and distribution sites reported there were “lots of operational challenges” due to the amount of food they had to move in a short period of time. 
Reynolds, speaking with reporters outside of her Terrace Hill residence Nov. 25, said the state is still “looking at all options” with the program to decide how it will proceed next year. 
Rep. Beth Wessel-Kroeschell, D-Ames, opposed the state’s summer program and said a return to the federally led program would allow for more consumer choice. 
“People who are on SNAP buy the same groceries that you and I buy,” Wessel-Kroeschell said. “Sometimes we buy a treat, but not always … So I strongly support the SNAP program, the Summer EBT program, I hope we someday are participating in it also.”
Local food policies 
Choose Iowa, the state’s marketing program for locally grown and raised products, represents a crossover between efforts to address food insecurity and to support local food systems. 
Rep. Norlin Mommsen, R-DeWitt, was one of the legislators wh helped push the Choose Iowa program through the Legislature and later advocated for the program’s purchasing program with local food banks. 
This year, the state agriculture department was allotted $200,000 to issue as matching grants to Iowa food banks for the purchase of locally grown food. 
Mommsen said Choose Iowa, which now has more than 300 members across more than 80 of Iowa’s counties, has helped to “cultivate more food produced in Iowa.” 
The food bank purchasing program, he said, also helps Iowans connect to locally grown food so that when they no longer need food assistance, they will “still recognize the Choose Iowa label, and then choose that food or try and connect with that food later.” 
Choose Iowa also had a pilot program that granted funding to Iowa schools for the purchase of locally produced food. This program did not receive permanent funding in the latest agriculture appropriations bill. 
Mommsen said when it came to creating the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship budget for the year, it was simply a “dollars issue” that led the program to go unappropriated.
Haley Hook, the legislative liaison for IDALS, said in a panel earlier at the summit the department hopes to permanently codify the school purchasing program so that a future allocation could be more easily made to the program. 
Sen. Mike Zimmer, D-DeWitt, said the state budget will be tight in the upcoming legislative session and he is “not hopeful” any budget or program will be expanded this year.
“We’re going to be clawing to hang on to what, minimally, we have right now,” Zimmer said. “So to me, if we could just fund Choose Iowa at where it’s at now, I would call that a success.” 
Food education
Zimmer, who has spent his career in education and currently serves as a career and technology education consultant in eastern Iowa, said he sees support for local food procurement at schools as “key” to keeping Iowans fed. 
Zimmer said those programs have to be supported, because as much as local schools want to purchase locally, they cannot afford to purchase locally without any assistance. 
Sweeney said she plans to, again, file a bill to require a semester of food education in Iowa schools. These classes, she said, would teach things like canning, gardening and food preparation, all skills she said “are gone.” 
“So that’s a bill I’m going to run this year to hopefully have people understand more about their food, where it comes from, and then to be able to buy our local foods and know how to fix it,” Sweeney said. 
Zimmer agreed with his colleague and said the loss of these skills has coincided with an increase in purchasing highly processed, high-calorie food items. He said he would love to see a class like this, but from his experience, trying to find educators for these classes is “a tough go.”
“You can have the most beautiful program and (be) well equipped but if you don’t have a teacher, you have nothing,” Zimmer said. “And we do not have teachers going into that field … we’re in the crisis on the education portion of it.” 
Amid all of the hardships facing local food and food security efforts in the state, lawmakers said they are encouraged by the creativity of Iowans in these fields and from everyday Iowans who have stepped up to support one another. 
“If you are always … gonna wait for the government to do it, don’t,” Mommsen said. “Because just look at, (as) we were talking earlier, there was funding in these areas, and now they’re gone. So I would use creativity, and then whatever the government helps, that’s gravy.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-05 21:51:15+00:00,CT Mirror,Will widening I-95 in Stamford help traffic? CT DOT is considering it,John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/05/i-95-widening-lanes-ct-dot/,"The agency will hold a pair of public meetings next week regarding the future of I-95, including an in-person forum at Ferguson Library.","As part of an effort to alleviate traffic on one of the nation’s most congested stretches of interstate highway, the Connecticut Department of Transportation is weighing a fix that has roused local opposition: adding more highway.
In October, the agency delivered a presentation to a committee made up of Stamford residents, business leaders and other local groups unveiling several concepts for a planned overhaul of Interstate 95 through the city’s downtown. One option called for widening the interstate by a single lane in each direction. Another suggests putting up a “collector-distributor” road running parallel to the highway.
A third option presented by the DOT would avoid adding any new travel lanes, and focus instead on reconfiguring the highway’s exits and entrances, as well as adding wider shoulders.
Those proposals were pitched as part of DOT’s long-term study of ways to improve traffic and safety on I-95 between exits 6 and 9, a bottleneck that is well known to Connecticut drivers for producing chronic delays. In addition, the DOT is looking to replace a bridge carrying the highway over local roads and the Metro-North railroad tracks, which is outdated and in need of replacement. 
But some local advocates who had been following the DOT’s work said they were caught off guard by the proposal to widen the highway, which they described as an outdated — and thoroughly debunked — solution to the city’s traffic woes.
“I basically told them that this was pretty bonkers to me,” said Angelo Bochanis, a resident of downtown Stamford who is a member of the local advisory committee that heard the DOT’s proposals in October.
“It felt very out of step with everything we were talking about and the direction I thought this project had been headed,” Bochanis said. “There’s been a national conversation around reconnecting communities that have been adversely impacted by highway construction. I thought CTDOT was really cognizant of that.”
In an interview Friday, DOT officials involved with the study cautioned that the concepts presented at the October meeting were only preliminary and that the agency has yet to settle on a specific plan for the highway.
“We’re early in the planning process for what is the future of I-95,” said Jonathan Dean, the project manager for the DOT’s study. The ideas under consideration at this point, he said, are “all being compared against each other, they’re being compared against, ‘What is the no-build alternative? What if we didn’t do anything other than what’s required just to maintain the highway as it is?'”
The agency has not conducted cost estimates for any of the proposals for I-95 in Stamford, Dean added, nor have detailed designs been produced showing which properties adjacent to the highway may need to be cleared for construction.
A DOT spokesman said that some additional information regarding costs and property impacts could come about as part of the next and final phase of the screening process, before the agency issues its final recommendations late next year. More details, however, won’t be known until those recommendations go through subsequent environmental reviews and design.
“Some will be long-term projects that may not begin for several years,” the spokesman, Josh Morgan, said in an email. “At the same time, we’re working to identify smaller, independent projects that can be done in the next five years.”

The agency will hold a pair of public meetings next week regarding the future of I-95, including an in-person forum on Dec. 10 at Stamford’s Ferguson Library. 
The idea of widening the highway has attracted support from some drivers and businesses, including thousands of commercial truckers that traverse I-95 on a daily basis.
John Blair, the president of the Motor Transport Association of Connecticut, a group representing the trucking industry, pointed out that I-95 in Stamford is one of several locations in the state that perennially rank among the nation’s worst bottlenecks for truckers. (MTAC is also a part of the project advisory council for the I-95 study.)
In addition to the economic costs of having trucks stuck in traffic, Blair said that jams also make highways less safe for drivers.
“There’s a lot of breaking and swerving and traffic and congestion down there,” Blair said. “I think anything they can do to widen it and widen the other spots in Connecticut will help not only the trucking community, but certainly cars and automobiles and passenger vehicles.” 
In its current configuration, I-95 has three travel lanes in each direction through Stamford. The DOT is currently constructing a pair of auxiliary lanes between exits 6 and 7 in order to allow drivers more time to merge onto the highway.
Traffic along I-95 is expected to worsen significantly over the next few decades, according to DOT. By 2050, peak travel times through the 3.2 mile stretch of downtown Stamford are expected to grow by nine minutes in each direction, assuming no major renovations to the highway are made.
Critics of highway widening, including multiple researchers who have studied the topic, argue that it does little to reduce congestion in the long term. The culprit, they say, is a phenomenon known as induced demand. Additional lanes may produce some temporary relief from traffic jams, the theory goes, but other drivers alter their routines to take advantage of the new space — and soon traffic becomes as bad, or worse, than it ever was.
“There are very few examples in this country, if any, where just one more lane solves that problem,” said Peter Harrison, the director of Connecticut programs at the Regional Plan Association, a nonprofit advocacy group focused on the tri-state area. “I think DOT is smart enough to know that.”
Harrison said that while the RPA has yet to take a position on the state’s proposals, the group generally favors other methods — such as public transit or congestion pricing — to reduce congestion. New York City rolled out the nation’s first congestion pricing program earlier this year, charging drivers a variable toll to enter the busiest sections of Manhattan.
Bochanis pointed out that it can take him more than 45 minutes to travel from his home in Stamford to Norwalk by bus, a distance of less than 10 miles. Bochanis said he does not own a car, which makes him more reliant on transit.
“Unless we start talking about creating viable alternatives to driving along the 95 corridor, there’s always going to be traffic along 95,” he said. “There’s no amount of expansion, no amount of homes you can demolish that will fix that.”
Zach Oberholtzer, another member of the project’s advisory committee, echoed those critiques of the DOT’s planning. Oberholtzer is also an organizer with People Friendly Stamford, an advocacy group that supports mass transit and efforts to reduce car dependency.
“The problem with I-95 traffic is that the trains run too slow,” Oberholtzer said. “If you want to move people efficiently, if you want to move stuff efficiently, you want to put people and stuff on rail… They have no new, insightful, creative solutions here. It’s just the same, ‘Well, what if we added another lane?’ and we know that doesn’t fix it.”
Mass transit options are not a part of the study looking at an overhaul of I-95 in downtown Stamford. But Dean, the project engineer, said DOT as a whole is considering all modes of transportation in its long-term planning for the area. In addition, he said the study will look at the design of local streets next to the interstate for ways to improve bike and pedestrian access.
“It’s a very built up area,” Dean said. “There are a lot of access points to and from the interstate, but that’s something that we’re looking at: How does it all work together, and what can we improve?”‘
Gov. Ned Lamont has pledged billions of dollars as part of an effort to speed up train service along Metro-North Railroad’s New Haven Line, though much of that work is unfinished and the results have only shaved a few minutes off commutes so far. Earlier this year, DOT had to raise rail fares in order to plug a budget shortfall and continue operating at existing levels. (Bus fares remained flat this year, at $1.75.)
Some lawmakers have also raised concerns that the state’s Special Transportation Fund — which covers some of the costs of highway and transit infrastructure projects — could run out of money by 2030, while the Lamont administration is arguing that the state needs to curtail its borrowing for transportation projects. 
Morgan, the DOT spokesman, said that no funding has been dedicated to any projects that might arise from the ongoing study of I-95 in Stamford.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/I-95-stamford-e1764960181186.jpg,,,2025-12-05 16:57:38.988467

A former Orange County Sheriff’s deputy has been permanently banned from working as a law enforcement officer in Vermont nearly three years after he was sentenced to jail following his criminal convictions in a road rage case. 
The Vermont Criminal Justice Council voted at its most recent meeting last month to take the action against William Pine, according to Christopher Brickell, the council’s executive director.
The action appears to bring a close to proceedings stemming from the road rage incident that dates back to 2019.

The matter before the council last month had been set for a contested hearing, but Pine did not attend, and the council members voted to approve the measure, Brickell said Friday. 
The Vermont Criminal Justice Council oversees the certification, training and standards of police officers in the state.
Pine could not be reached for comment.
The incident leading to the council’s action against Pine dates back to Oct. 7, 2019. That’s when, according to court records, Pine, who was off-duty at the time, was driving a Nissan Titan in Williamstown. 
Charging documents stated that Pine had followed a Jeep Wrangler on Stone Road for several miles and eventually performed a “tactical maneuver” at the intersection of Route 64 in an attempt to block the Jeep. 
A prosecutor told jurors during a later trial in the case that Pine then yelled at two men who were in the Jeep, “Deputy sheriff, don’t F-ing move.”
Then, court records stated, Pine fired shots into the Jeep, shattering the Jeep’s rear window as the vehicle fled toward Interstate 89.
The Orange County Sheriff’s Department had initially placed Pine on unpaid leave after the incident. Following the jury’s verdict, the department terminated him.
Asked Friday why it took so long for the case to reach the council, Brickell replied that it was due to several factors, including awaiting the results of the criminal matter and then PIne’s imprisonment. 
In addition, according to Brickell, attempts to resolve the matter with a negotiated agreement rather than setting a contested hearing was complicated by difficulties contacting Pine, who had since moved out of state.

John Morley, a longtime village of Orleans employee and former state representative, will fill Orleans County’s vacant seat in the Vermont Senate. 
Gov. Phil Scott announced his appointment in a press release on Friday.
Morley replaces Sam Douglass, who resigned in scandal this fall when his involvement in a national Young Republicans group chat replete with racist and bigoted messages was revealed in a Politico exposé. Top Vermont Republicans, including Scott, quickly called for the former senator to step down.

The Caledonian Record this week reported four people considered to replace Douglass, including three current members of the Vermont House: Rep. Mark Higley, R-Lowell; Rep. Michael Marcotte, R-Coventry; and Rep. John Kascenska, R-Burke. (The report also indicated Marcotte had removed himself from the selection process.)
Morley’s name was not on the reported list, though Scott, in a statement, appeared to allude to the sitting House members he’d considered.  
“I also want to acknowledge how difficult this choice was, with three strong, capable, and effective state representatives from the Kingdom sent by the County Committee for my consideration,” Scott said. “All three are invaluable leaders in the House, in important roles at a critical time during the biennium. I look forward to continuing to work with them on our shared priorities.”
Morley, who works as the Orleans village manager, could not be immediately reached for comment late Friday afternoon. He previously served six years in the Vermont House, ending his tenure in 2010, according to a press release from Scott’s office.

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)The shot clock has been reset on the imminent closure of Roger Williams Medical Center and Our Lady of Fatima Hospital under another extension brokered between attorneys for Rhode Island and the hospitals’ bankruptcy estate.
The agreement presented to a federal bankruptcy judge in Dallas Friday gives prospective buyer The Centurion Foundation until the end of January — rather than Dec. 31 —  to line up the investor-backed financing needed to complete the sale. If Centurion can’t pull it off, the hospitals could be placed under state-controlled receivership.
“Centurion has continued to work this issue, we believe very hard and in good faith,” said Andrew Troop, a New York attorney hired by Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha’s office to represent the state in federal bankruptcy proceedings. “They will work like expletive deleted to get this done.”
Ben Mingle, Centurion CEO, reiterated that the foundation is “aggressively executing” its financing strategy with the intent of closing the sale in January.
“We want to acknowledge the support of Attorney General Peter Neronha and his team, as well as the Department of Health, who agreed to this extension of time and to cover any losses through the month of January,” Mingle said in a statement Friday. State leaders have been instrumental in their support of our plan and the importance of these hospitals to the local community.”
Neronha was still skeptical.
“I’m no cheerleader for anybody,” he said in a call with reporters after the court hearing Friday. “They’ve got to put up or shut up.”
The Atlanta nonprofit lined up conditional state regulatory approval to buy the struggling hospitals from their now-bankrupt owner, Prospect Medical Holdings, in June 2024. But Centurion has been unable to lure investors to back the bonds needed to secure its purchase, much to the dismay of Rhode Island health care leaders, the federal bankruptcy judge and Prospect’s many creditors. 
Prospect’s bankruptcy estate in October sought to close the hospitals by the end of the year, rather than keep racking up monthly operating costs and postponing resolution of the 11-month bankruptcy case. 
But Centurion signaled it needs even more time; Mingle said in a court filing on Monday that the bonds being underwritten by Barclays and Bank of America should close “on or about Jan. 15.”
Neronha on Friday acknowledged that Centurion is the only buyer that has already cleared the extensive state regulatory approval process, and agreed to meet a host of conditions critical to preserving hospital operations, workers and services to patients.

No longer Primed for purchase 
That’s in contrast with Prime Healthcare, which Gov. Dan McKee’s administration courted as an alternative buyer for at least several months. Neronha confirmed Thursday that Prime had walked away — at least for now — unable to reach a resolution with state regulators on the conditions and financial investments expected.
Neronha offered more detail Friday on where talks broke down.
The national hospital chain operator, which owns Landmark Medical Center in Woonsocket, was unwilling to cover the $91 million in hospital labor costs, local taxes and a federal loan repayment that Prospect’s creditors — and Neronha — expected a buyer to cover. Prime also refused to commit to keeping service and staffing levels the same, and wanted a $5 million monthly management fee in exchange for running operations, Neronha said.
Noel True, a spokesperson for Prime, confirmed the company had decided not to move forward with an acquisition of the Rhode Island hospitals but declined to comment on details of its negotiations.
Centurion has already agreed to cover the bankruptcy costs and maintain existing service and staffing levels. It has not sought management fees from the state, Neronha said.
Neronha blasted Rhode Island Health and Human Services Secretary Richard Charest, former Landmark CEO, for exposing the state to legal action by soliciting Prime when Centurion was still under exclusive rights to buy the hospitals. Neronha also blamed Charest for making his job as a state regulator more difficult.
“I can’t negotiate with Prime if Prime believes the state will welcome them unconditionally to ownership of these hospitals,” Neronha said. “I’ve got to negotiate on behalf of Rhode Island. It’s very difficult to do that if the Secretary is taking away my bargaining leverage by telling them they can have the hospitals for whatever they want.”
Neronha also said Prime’s press statements, featuring complimentary quotes from Charest, told him “everything I need to know” about the relationship between McKee’s cabinet member and the hospital owner.  










I can’t negotiate with Prime if Prime believes the state will welcome them unconditionally to ownership of these hospitals. I’ve got to negotiate on behalf of Rhode Island.

Ashley O’Shea, a spokesperson for Rhode Island Executive Office of Health and Human Services, said Charest’s conversations with Prime were “contingency planning” and not formal negotiations on an offer.
“When Centurion was having difficulty closing the transaction, it became apparent to the McKee administration that it was in Rhode Island’s best interest to explore back-up options in case Centurion was not able to close the transaction,” O’Shea said in an emailed response Friday. “Secretary Charest has remained focused on fulfilling the governor’s directive to preserve these hospitals — whose closure would be catastrophic for Rhode Island’s already strained health care system.”

Avoiding catastrophe 
Preserving the pair of safety net hospitals — with 500 beds, 50,000 annual emergency room visits and nearly 2,500 employees between them — has been a shared priority among companies, state leaders and even Chief Judge Stacey Jernigan of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas.
“Even though as a bankruptcy judge I am about debtor or creditor rights, you cannot help but feel some responsibility for these human beings,” Jernigan said Friday. 
Jernigan has had harsh words for Centurion in past hearings, questioning why it has been unable to close the sale over the last year of bankruptcy proceedings. But she expressed support Friday.
“I feel much better today than I have in the past hearings,” she said, adding that she was “content to let the process play out.”
For now, that process hinges on Centurion securing the investor-backed bonds to close a sale by mid-January. A timeline Centurion submitted to the bankruptcy court shows a meeting with investors scheduled in Boston on Dec. 15, with documents finalized and agreements executed by Jan. 5.
“Centurion recognizes that this transaction has taken longer to close than anticipated, and it acknowledges that the court approved the sale in February 2025 and is focused on preventing further administrative drain and ensuring a realistic, near-term path to closing.” Mingle wrote in a Dec. 1 affidavit to the court. “Centurion takes these concerns seriously.”










Centurion recognizes that this transaction has taken longer to close than anticipated, and it acknowledges that the court approved the sale in February 2025 and is focused on preventing further administrative drain and ensuring a realistic, near-term path to closing.


– Ben Mingle, CEO of The Centurion Foundation 


Neronha on Friday said he is solely focused on getting Centurion “to the finish line.”
This includes forking over another $6 million from a state-controlled escrow account to cover hospital operations through Jan. 31. The state already has spent $6 million from the account funded by the facilities’ former owner, private equity firm Leonard Green, to cover operating costs in November and December.
The fund will still have $37 million to $42 million left after January’s expenses, with Centurion — or an alternative buyer — required to replenish the money spent on recent operating costs. 
Closure remains a possibility if Centurion can’t come through on its pledged commitment by the end of January, Neronha acknowledged. An alternative: a court-appointed state receiver, though details of the transfer of the hospitals to a state trustee have not been solidified.
“We’re a long way away from that point now,” Neronha said. 
McKee MIA?
Neronha suggested McKee’s office and the Rhode Island General Assembly could contribute state money to keep the hospitals afloat longer, mimicking actions taken by Gov. Maura Healey in Massachusetts last year after Steward Health Care filed for bankruptcy and sold off its Massachusetts hospitals.
McKee’s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment Friday on whether he plans to offer state funding for the hospitals.
“Keeping these hospitals open remains our top priority,” Olivia DaRocha, a spokesperson for McKee’s office, said in an email Thursday. She also noted that nothing prevents Prime from “reengaging” if the Centurion deal does not go through.
Senate President Valarie Lawson and House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi also have not publicly committed to spending state budget funds on the hospitals though they are monitoring developments, Greg Paré, a spokesperson for Lawson, said Friday.
Helena Buonnano Foulkes, who is challenging McKee for the governor’s seat in the 2026 Democratic primary, criticized McKee and other unspecified “state leaders” for their poor performance.
“They have failed to personally convene key stakeholders and leaders of Rhode Island’s health care system or present any contingency plan,” Foulkes said in a statement Thursday. “This lack of leadership is unacceptable when two hospitals, thousands of patients, and hospital workers hang in the balance.”
Brad Dufault, a spokesperson for the United Nurses and Allied Professionals, which represents 1,500 workers across both hospitals, maintained the union’s stance that Centurion’s offered the best hope of survival. The union has been critical of Prime for its trio of federal settlements over Medicaid and billing fraud, and its allegedly poor relations with union members at Landmark in Woonsocket.
“With time running out quickly, the UNAP is pleased that the state can now keep the focus 100% on closing the Centurion deal,” Dufault said in a statement Friday. “The deal is our best immediate option to keep these important community hospitals open and operational into the new year and beyond.”

(Getty Images)A federal appeals court has rejected a late Delaware woman’s challenge to the residency requirement in New Jersey’s assisted suicide law.
The three-judge U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals panel ruled Friday that assisted suicide is not a fundamental privilege the state must extend to residents from other states. Striking the residency requirement would expose doctors to criminal prosecution, risk inter-state conflicts, and undermine anti-coercion safeguards in New Jersey’s law, they said.
“A prescription lawful in Camden can be evidence of a felony in Philadelphia,” Judge Stephanos Bibas wrote for the panel. “If a New Jersey doctor prescribes a Pennsylvanian lethal pills and she swallows them back in Pennsylvania, the doctor might reasonably fear prosecution.”
Antiabortion pregnancy centers take case against NJ to US Supreme Court

In New Jersey, doctors can prescribe self-administered medication to terminally ill New Jersey adults expected to die within six months so they can end their lives.
Before a doctor can prescribe the medication, a patient must make one written request and two oral requests separated by at least 15 days.
The suit was brought initially by Delaware resident Judy Govatos, Philadelphia resident Andrea Sealy, and two New Jersey doctors.
One of the doctors retired during the litigation. Sealy died before a lower court upheld the residency requirement. Govatos, who had late-stage lymphoma, died in November after oral arguments were held in the case, leaving Paul Bryman, a New Jersey doctor, as the case’s only plaintiff.
“I am deeply disappointed by today’s ruling,” Bryman said in a statement. “Terminal patients outside New Jersey should have the option of medical aid in dying without having to travel long distances.”
New Jersey’s Medical Aid in Dying for the Terminally Ill Act, which passed in April 2019, was controversial, with critics raising ethical and religious objections while supporters said people with terminal illnesses deserve to choose when they would die.
Bryman argued the law’s residency requirement violates the U.S. Constitution’s privileges and immunities clause, which requires states to protect the fundamental rights and privileges of out-of-state residents within their borders.
But those protections do not require New Jersey to guarantee all privileges to residents from other states, the court ruled in its precedential opinion. Assisted suicide — a relatively new practice legal in only 12 states and Washington, D.C. — does not qualify as a fundamental right, the judges said.
“There is no longstanding tradition of doctor-assisted suicide. On the contrary, there is a centuries-long tradition against it,” Bibas wrote.
For the same reasons, the law does not violate the Constitution’s equal protections clause, the panel said.
New Jersey’s law “aims to keep both patients and pills in-state” to avoid exposing Garden State doctors to prosecution in other jurisdictions and avoid causing discord with states where assisted suicide is illegal, the court ruled.
Other states also lack laws barring insurers and others from pressuring patients to go take the medication once they have obtained it, which would undermine protections in New Jersey’s law, the court said.
“New Jersey’s justifications are weighty, rooted in real dangers of extending doctor-assisted suicide to nonresidents,” Bibas wrote. “And its response is well tailored to further those justifications.”
The court rejected claims that the law infringes on federal authority over interstate commerce, finding the statute is not commercial in nature.
The Office of the Chief State Medical Examiner reported 409 people died through the program between August 2019 and the end of 2024, including 122 last year.
“Despite this decision, access to medical aid in dying remains a critically important option for all terminally ill people who wish to receive health care in the state of New Jersey,” said Jess Pezley, an attorney with Compassion & Choices, a Colorado-based nonprofit that represented the plaintiffs.

Emergency shelters in Barre and Brattleboro opened Thursday, offering relief to people without housing.

Temperatures remain bitterly cold across Vermont after extreme cold hit the region on Thursday.
Tyler Danzig, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Burlington, said temperatures dropped into the negative teens on Thursday night, with negative 20s across the central and northern areas of Vermont. Wind chills reached -25 degrees Fahrenheit in parts of Caledonia County and -13 degrees at the Burlington Airport.
The extreme cold on Thursday was mostly due to the previous snow, which kept ground temperatures cool, and wind chills, according to Danzig. But the National Weather Service didn’t issue a cold weather advisory because only some areas in the Northeast Kingdom reached the threshold of -20 degrees Fahrenheit.
These temperatures are not uncommon for Vermont in the winter, Danzig said, but he still recommended people to cover their face in higher winds to avoid frostbites, wear several layers of clothes and make sure pets are inside.
The Office of Economic Opportunity at the Department for Children and Families has recently created a new Extreme Cold Weather Shelter Program, in partnership with Vermont Interfaith Action, to support people experiencing homelessness during periods of extreme cold.
The program will operate from Dec. 1 to April 1, when temperatures reach at least -10 degrees, with projects in Bennington, Burlington, Newport, Rutland, Barre, Montpelier and Brattleboro, Lily Sojourner, director of the Office of Economic Opportunity, said.
The shelters in Barre and Brattleboro opened for the first time Thursday night and provided relief for 26 people, according to Sojourner. Sojourner said this program is just one of many others operating this winter, including the General Assistance Emergency Hotel Program and seasonal shelters across the state.
Tess Taylor, homeless and housing liaison for the city of Barre, said the shelter at the Congregational Church also hosted people in need on Thursday. The space has a capacity of 12 people and will continue to operate when temperatures are around zero, providing food, cots and blankets, Taylor said.
“Low temperatures tonight will fall into the single digits across much of Vermont, with temperatures in the Northeast Kingdom around five to 10, then across the central portions of Vermont around 10 degrees,” Danzig said. 
Monday night temperatures might get lower again, he added.

(File photo by Getty Images)NEWBERRY — A former South Carolina representative pleaded guilty to charges of threatening an agency director over the phone.
Former Rep. Rick Martin, a Newberry Republican, must complete an anger management class in the next six months or spend 30 days in jail, a Newberry County judge decided Tuesday.
Martin was charged in 2021 with misconduct in office and contributing to the delinquency of a minor. Prosecutors said he gave alcohol to a 15-year-old and called the then-director of the Department of Social Services to threaten his job and agency budget, The Post and Courier reported at the time. Martin was accused of making a similar call to an agency lobbyist.
Both charges were dropped this week and replaced with a single count of unlawful communication, which carries a maximum sentence of 30 days in jail and a minimum fine of $100, according to court records. Martin will have to pay $128.75 in court fees.
Martin was suspended from the House as soon as the charges against him were announced in 2021.
He still ran for re-election the following year but placed last in a three-way GOP primary won by Joe White. The retired businessman joined the hardline Freedom Caucus after he easily won the general election that November with no Democratic opponent. White was re-elected last year to the seat representing Newberry County and one precinct in Lexington County.
Martin and his attorney, House Minority Leader Todd Rutherford, did not respond to calls or texts requesting comment.

Students from Iowa need to have earned a 4.0 or higher grade-point average or “have succeeded in the most demanding curriculum offered by their schools” to qualify for the scholarship, the release stated.

“Iowa has always been home to Grinnell College, and Grinnell College champions Iowa. We are grateful for the support and advocacy that we receive from the state, the Grinnell community, and all of the people who make Iowa home for these outstanding students,” President Anne Harris said in the release. “This scholarship recognizes that support and the impact that Iowa’s top students can have at the College and as they go on to professional success and community leadership in our state.”
The Iowa Dean’s Scholarship will become available to students in the fall 2026 semester, the release stated. It joins other financial aid programs offered by the college, including the full-tuition Iowa Access Initiative for students coming from households earning less than $100,000 annually, according to the release, and the $20,000 Founders Scholarship for all admitted resident students.
According to the college’s website, 92% of Grinnell College students receive financial aid, and 100% of “demonstrated need” is met by the college without requiring students to take out loans.
Grinnell College Dean Ruth Feingold said in the release that the university “brings bright, engaged students from around the world to live and learn in Iowa” and fosters a campus where students can join the intellectual community and learn from more people than just their teachers.
“Our new Iowa Dean’s Scholarship is our way of extending a clear welcome to high-performing students from our home state: come join us here,” Feingold said in the release.

Interim President Donald Landry and UF trustees expressed a commitment during a board meeting to “institutional neutrality” regarding how university actors will behave.
“We are not protecting the right to choose topics for classroom instruction, research, or scholarship if that right is not coupled with institutional neutrality,” Landry said. 
“We have to provide protections for free expression, but we are not going to be able to engage in that protection if we have leadership speaking on issues that then create those aligned with leadership and those opposed to leadership. At that moment, those who are opposed to leadership are now afraid to speak, they don’t know if it’s safe.”

Trustees unanimously supported a policy that applies to university employees with access to communications resources used for “university business,” including email distribution lists, university websites, social media accounts, and teleconference systems. 
“University business” encompasses “instructional activities, research and scholarship, administrative functions, communications,” and lobbying. Also: “Guidance regarding or requiring compliance with laws, regulations or policies.”
“Proclamations from UF institutional and unit leadership on issues that polarize society impair the free and open exchange of differing ideas on campus as it divides the student body and faculty into those aligned with leadership and those opposed,” the new policy says, in part. 
The policy, according to its language, “clarifies expectations regarding (1) leadership commentary and proclamations on Social Issues; (2) the use of communication resources for personal expression; and (3) representations of affiliations.”
“When our leaders make comment or proclamations on social issues, political issues, normative issues, current events to their university constituents, these statements divide our faculty and students, chill free expression for those who do not agree with leadership, and send a signal that suddenly there’s no room for open discourse or the contest of ideas at the University of Florida,” Landry said. 
Landry said he met with deans at the school about the neutrality statement. 
“We resist ideological takeover of any unit of the university, we reject ideological indoctrination in favor of open discourse, we accomplish that at this university and in this state mainly through the right of the students to record any lecture,” Landry said. 
The policy allows “political or social advocacy” as long as it’s not represented as UF policy, protecting “personal expression in their private capacities.”
Violation of the policy could result in termination.

“What we’re going to accomplish today is the voluntary restraint of leadership not to speak. If speech must come forth, it will come forth from the president in consultation with the chair, but otherwise we will remain silent,” Landry said. 
Earlier in the meeting, Landry laid out his vision for the university. He holds the position while the university searches for a president. The search started Friday, and Chair Mori Hosseini said Landry signaled he will apply for the permanent position.
“This is a state where individuals can come confident that they will be able to learn, confident that their education will not be disrupted. It is a state where faculty can come, knowing they will be able to teach, they will be able to do research, they will be able to do their scholarship. That stability is priceless. That’s a firm foundation for a vision of preeminence and leadership,” Landry said. 
The DeSantis administration’s political involvement in higher education led various professors to express their desire to leave the state, the Phoenix reported earlier this year.
Landry spent much of his time outlining his vision for the university, talking about expanding and supporting artificial intelligence research. 
Chairs
Hosseini, a major donor to Gov. Ron DeSantis, will serve another term as chair of the state’s flagship university; the trustees unanimously voted Friday to keep Hosseini in charge for another two years. 
Mori Hosseini via UF
Hosseini has served on the UF board since 2016 and before that he served on the Florida Board of Governors, which oversees public universitites, on which he also was chairman. 
Notably, Hosseini stood behind the UF trustees’ support for Santa Ono, even after the state Board of Governors rejected him to be the leader of the university. Prominent Republicans came out in opposition to the former University of Michigan president after he abandoned his previous support for diversity, equity, and inclusion policies that are anathema to the MAGA movement. 
“It’s no exaggeration to say that, in the modern era, I don’t think anybody has had as much influence on the trajectory of the University of Florida than you. From inspiring and challenging our leadership, to leveraging your relationships in Tallahassee for the benefit of our institution, the impact of your work is visible to all of us, every day,” board Vice Chair Rahul Patel told Hosseini. 
The board also voted to keep Patel as the board’s vice chair.

Carla Cunningham, the Democrat who faced a jeering hometown crowd this summer after delivering a controversial speech on the state House floor criticizing immigrants, is seeking an eighth term. 
She’ll likely be in a crowded primary field in House District 106 in Charlotte. 
The Rev. Rodney Sadler filed campaign paperwork on Monday. 
At least two others say they plan to run. Morris McAdoo, a lawyer, has a campaign website. Vermanno Bowman, whom Cunningham defeated in last year’s primary, announced on social media he also plans to run again. 
Cunningham worked for decades as a nurse and has been a prominent voice in the legislature on health and mental health matters.
She is the widow of longtime House member Pete Cunningham, who resigned his seat in 2007 and died in 2010. Carla Cunningham won her first term in 2012.  
Cunningham has emerged as one of the Democrats who votes most often with the Republican majority. This year, she voted with Republicans more than any other Democrat. And Republican House leaders have recognized that by awarding her coveted positions in chamber leadership: she co-chairs the Joint Legislative Oversight Committee on Health and Human Services, and is a vice-chair of the House Health Committee.
But, until now, she has not faced a concerted Democratic effort to oust her. She defeated Bowman in last year’s primary with more than 84% of the vote. 
House District 106 is heavily Democratic, so the primary victor is likely to win the seat. 
Cunningham delivered her controversial speech on immigration as she voted with the GOP to override Democratic Gov. Josh Stein’s veto of House Bill 318. The law puts more requirements on law enforcement to help U.S Immigration and Customs Enforcement with deportations. 
“All cultures are not equal,” Cunningham said in a speech explaining her vote to override Stein’s veto. Immigrants need to assimilate, she added. 
At an August town hall filled with angry Democrats, Cunningham defended her vote and the speech, WFAE reported. 
Last month, the U.S. Border Patrol began an operation in Charlotte that triggered a wave of fear that temporarily closed businesses and had parents afraid to send children to school.
Cunningham was initially dismissive of reports of the operation. She told NC Newsline, “I’m going to be keeping my eyes on my own safety for right now,” saying she had received threats over her July speech.  
However, in an email Friday announcing her reelection bid, Cunningham said her vote was about serious criminal offenders.

Gov. Kelly Armstrong announced Jan. 21, 2026, as the likely date for a special session to address federal rural health funding. (Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong set Jan. 21 as the tentative date for a special legislative session to allocate federal rural health funding.
In a Friday letter, Armstrong notified legislative leaders of the likely special session date, but said it’s contingent on North Dakota receiving its federal funding award.  
North Dakota and other states applied in November for their share of $50 billion through the Rural Health Transformation Program. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is expected to award funding to states by Dec. 31. 
A North Dakota legislative committee gave input on the state’s application, but lawmakers will still need to meet and give final approval for spending those federal dollars.
North Dakota lawmakers build wish list for $500M federal rural health care grant

“We have an incredible opportunity to strengthen and reshape rural health care in North Dakota through the Rural Health Transformation Program,” Armstrong said in a statement. “I appreciate the collaboration with legislative leadership and look forward to a special session laser-focused on the task at hand – appropriating these federal dollars in the most efficient and effective way possible to improve the well-being of our citizens.”
In a letter to House and Senate leaders, Armstrong defined the purpose of the special session as allocating the rural health funding. But once lawmakers convene, they will be able to run the session as they see fit, said Mike Nowatzki, spokesperson for Armstrong.
“He’s not able to limit them,” Nowatzki said.
Senate Majority Leader Sen. David Hogue, R-Minot, said Legislative Management will meet the week before the special session to “set the table,” but the intent of legislative leadership is to limit the focus of the session to the Rural Health Transformation Program funding.
“But, of course, folks could introduce other things,” Hogue said. He added anything introduced by lawmakers would likely require a two-thirds majority in each chamber to be considered, which is a high bar.
Hogue said the tentative Jan. 21 date for the special session was chosen because it gives the Department of Health and Human Services as much time as possible to implement the funding after it is awarded at the end of the year.
John Bjornson, director of Legislative Council, said the shortest amount of time a special session can last is three days because each chamber cannot vote on the first and second reading of a bill on the same day. 
North Dakota’s Legislature is limited to meeting 80 days every two years. Because Armstrong is calling the special session, Bjornson said the Legislature will retain its six remaining legislative days to use before the 2027 legislative session.
States are expected to get at least $500 million from the federal grant, but states could be eligible for more based on certain factors, including if they implement some health-related policies. North Dakota’s application focuses on boosting the state’s rural health workforce, preventive care and healthy eating, bringing health care closer to home and connecting technology and data.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)Rhode Island has taken “an important step forward” with the official completion of demolition of the westbound lanes of the Washington Bridge, Gov. Dan McKee’s office announced Friday. 
The news arrives a few weeks ahead of the original demolition schedule and less than a week shy of the two-year anniversary of the span’s sudden closure on Dec. 11, 2023. State officials initially said the westbound span would be removed by the end of the year. 
“I know travelers are still feeling the frustration of traffic, and I want to assure them that we are fully committed to rebuilding this bridge as quickly as possible, with one of the nation’s top bridge builders leading the work,” McKee said in a statement Friday. “We thank Rhode Islanders for their patience as we construct a new, safe bridge that will improve traffic flow and shorten commute times.” 
In July 2024, demolition crews began to remove the bridge in two parts, starting with the bridge deck and superstructure in July 2024. Work paused in mid-September 2024 to allow state investigators to document its condition as part of the state’s lawsuit against 13 firms that previously worked on it before resuming on Oct. 11, 2024. 
At the end of January, a video of debris falling into the Seekonk River near the Providence side prompted concerns from local residents. The Rhode Island Department of Transportation said the demolition posed no dangers to the eastbound span and that only a small amount of debris had fallen into the water. Officials worked with state coastal regulators to coordinate the removal of debris from the river.
In March 2025, substructure demolition began, with the removal of underwater portions starting in July. 
The final phase of the substructure removal was completed in the first week of December, according to McKee’s office, ahead of the end-of-month timeline that had originally been set. 
State contractors will now focus their attention on the replacement bridge, which is tentatively scheduled to open in November 2028. The Chicago-based Walsh Construction was awarded the construction contract in June 2025. The agreement has a base price of $339 million, but the total could climb to as much as $427 million, with incentives and contingencies.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Most people of Somali descent in America are citizens, including those living in Minnesota, according to estimates from the American Community Survey, an ongoing survey conducted by the Census Bureau.
Immigration enforcement agents have increased their presence in Minnesota in recent days as part of a targeted campaign ordered by President Donald Trump to deport undocumented Somali immigrants. ICE has arrested at least 12 people this month, including 5 from Somalia, in what it calls “Operation Metro Surge,” according to a U.S. Department of Homeland Security release.
Apart from Minnesota’s biting cold this week, one complication in Trump’s plan to deport Somalis from Minnesota through immigration enforcement is that the vast majority of Americans and Minnesotans of Somali descent are U.S. citizens, many of whom were born here.


Exact numbers on citizenship of Somali-Americans are unknown. The American Community Survey, which extrapolates its monthly sampling of selected households to the larger population through a weighting process, indicates that around 22,000 Somalis in America — 8.4% — are not citizens. In Minnesota, around 5,000 people of Somali descent are not citizens, according to ACS. That figure includes people here through other legal means, such as permanent residents, green card holders and the couple hundred covered by Temporary Protected Status, a protection Trump said he would end earlier than planned.
That number has decreased significantly since the start of the century. According to ACS data from IPUMS, a database housed at the University of Minnesota, over 78% of people with Somali ancestry in America weren’t citizens in 2001, about a decade after the start of a Somali Civil War created a worldwide diaspora.
In Minnesota, the number of Somali non-citizens went from over 76% in 2001 to 9% in 2023. In the same period, U.S.-born people of Somali descent rose from 19% to nearly 39% of all Somalis as families settled here and had children.
Estimates for how many people of Somali descent live in the country and in Minnesota vary by source and time. The decennial census, which is sent to all households every 10 years, estimated in 2020 that there were around 91,000 Somalis in Minnesota and 221,000 Somalis nationwide. The American Community Survey estimated that in 2024, there were around 108,000 residents of Somali descent in Minnesota and 259,000 in America.
The numbers could be off by around 10,000 to 20,000, and the precise number of Somalis in the state and country is unknowable. Still, all estimates indicate that Minnesota is home to the largest Somali population in the country.

(Photo by Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)Close to half of South Dakotans aren’t up-to-date on their flu shots or their hepatitis B vaccinations, new vaccine survey results released by the South Dakota Department of Health indicate.
About 63% aren’t up-to-date on their HPV vaccinations, which protect against most cases of cervical cancer, and 78% aren’t up-to-date on their pneumococcal vaccinations, which help protect against pneumococcal infections.
That’s “concerning” to Keith Hansen, president of the South Dakota State Medical Association. Vaccinations are “one of the most important developments in health” to keep people and communities healthy, he said. 
As a reproductive endocrinology and infertility specialist, he is especially concerned with how vaccine-preventable diseases can affect pregnant women and newborn children. 
“It’s really sad when someone isn’t vaccinated and then they come into the hospital because they caught a vaccine-preventable disease,” Hansen said. “Now they have some bad outcome that could have been prevented.”
The state Health Department conducted the survey to better understand vaccination behaviors, decision-making and awareness of the vaccine schedule. A U.S. Department of Health and Human Services grant funded the survey.
COVID pandemic influences some vaccine behavior
More than a quarter of survey respondents said the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted their views on vaccines. Those respondents also had lower vaccination rates for the flu and COVID, at 34% and 4%, respectively.

Among all survey respondents, 96% reported ever being vaccinated. About 98% of respondents with children reported that their child had received at least one vaccination.
About 96% of respondents said they get at least “some” vaccines recommended by their doctor, and nearly 93% of respondents said they follow the routine or a delayed vaccination schedule for their child.
Carmen Toft, director for South Dakota Families for Vaccines and board vice president of Immunize South Dakota, said the state should “celebrate” those positive statistics.
The goal, Toft said, is to reach vaccination rates above 95% to reach herd immunity, which is when the prevention of infectious diseases becomes most effective.
Tdap vaccinations remain high
While most vaccination rates in the survey are lower than Hansen or Toft prefer, up-to-date Tdap vaccination rates were highest among respondents at 78%. The vaccine protects against infections caused by diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough.
Among respondents who said their vaccination views were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, 75.5% of adult respondents were up to date on their Tdap vaccination.
That could be because the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends adults get the Tdap booster every 10 years for adults, Toft said, rather than yearly like the flu. If vaccine hesitancy rises, Tdap vaccination rates could be impacted more slowly than more regularly recommended vaccines.
Hansen added that Tdap vaccinations are sometimes administered in response to injuries, such as cuts, to prevent tetanus. Also known as lockjaw, tetanus causes muscle contractions and can be life-threatening.
Conflicting information could lead to more vaccine hesitancy
The most common reasons respondents gave for not receiving vaccinations included hearing contradictory information — from doctors, social media, news outlets, government agencies and others — and believing a vaccine isn’t safe or isn’t needed.
Concern about vaccine safety was the most common reason respondents gave for choosing not to vaccinate a child, followed by the belief that it wasn’t needed and the prevalence of conflicting information about vaccines.

Toft said fast-spreading misinformation on social media is influencing public opinion. So is U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s introduction of “fringe ideas” to inform policy changes, she said.
“It’s moved off of Facebook feeds and onto ‘CBS Mornings’,” Toft said, adding “the decisions seem more and more politicized, and that’ll only lead to more confusion.”
A CDC vaccine committee charged with setting national guidelines around vaccine policy voted on Friday to eliminate a 34-year-old recommendation that all newborn babies receive a hepatitis B vaccine. There was a 99% drop in serious infections among children between 1990 and 2019, which is attributed to the universal vaccination policy. Recommendations for adults and unvaccinated older children will remain unchanged.
CDC vaccine committee overturns decades-old hepatitis B recommendation for newborns

The new recommendation mirrors COVID-19 guidelines changed by the same committee in September. The change at that time caused widespread confusion about the vaccine’s accessibility and if insurance companies would cover it.
“I think it’ll be a while before we see the long-lasting implications of some of these decisions they’re making,” Toft said of the committee’s decisions.
The recommendations play a key role in determining which vaccines insurance companies are willing to cover and how accessible those immunizations are to the public.
South Dakota’s survey results indicate that most people place their trust in local professionals rather than national entities: 84% of respondents said their preferred source of health information is their doctor or health professional. About 95% said they “somewhat” or “to a great extent” trust their doctor or health professional with vaccine information — more than pharmacists, the state Department of Health, or the CDC. Social media and news outlets were the lowest trusted sources among respondents.
Hansen hopes health professionals take note and choose to broach immunization discussions more often with patients. Toft agreed that health professionals are the best point of contact for vaccine education.
“When we talk to vaccine-hesitant parents, we’re like, ‘Yes, ask questions. I’d love to help you. I’d love to connect you with a provider who can answer your questions,’” Toft said. “We want you to have access to information to make the best decision for you and your family.”

This story was originally published by Canary Media.
Big companies have spent years pushing Georgia to let them find and pay for new clean energy to add to the grid, in the hopes that they could then get data centers and other power-hungry facilities online faster.


Now, that concept is tantalizingly close to becoming a reality, with regulators, utility Georgia Power, and others hammering out the details of a program that could be finalized sometime next year. If approved, the framework could not only benefit companies but also reduce the need for a massive buildout of gas-fired plants that Georgia Power is planning to satiate the artificial intelligence boom.
Today, utilities are responsible for bringing the vast majority of new power projects online in the state. But over the past two years, the Clean Energy Buyers Association has negotiated to secure a commitment from Georgia Power that ​“will, for the first time, allow commercial and industrial customers to bring clean energy projects to the utility’s system,” said Katie Southworth, the deputy director for market and policy innovation in the South and Southeast at the trade group, which includes major hyperscalers like Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft.


The terms of the commitment were first sketched out in a letter agreement between Georgia Power and CEBA last year and then codified in a July settlement agreement between the utility, staff at the Georgia Public Service Commission, and other stakeholders that cemented the utility’s long-term integrated resource plan.


The ​“customer-identified resource” (CIR) option will allow hyperscalers and other big commercial and industrial customers to secure gigawatts of solar, batteries, and other energy resources on their own, not just through the utility.


Letting data centers procure their own energy resources could solve a lot of problems for utilities — like the risk of sticking their customers with the cost of building power plants that may be unneeded if the AI boom goes bust. That’s a real concern for Georgia Power, which plans to spend more than $15 billion to build 10 gigawatts of new gas plants and batteries by 2031. This move could dramatically increase customers’ bills and is almost entirely motivated by gigantic — yet highly uncertain — projections of how much energy that data centers will need.


The tech giants behind most of those data centers could also benefit from being able to track down their own clean energy. The carbon-free resources would not only help in meeting hyperscalers’ aggressive climate targets; they are also likely to be cheaper and faster to build than gas plants, which face yearslong backlogs and rising costs.


The CIR option isn’t a done deal yet. Once Georgia Power, the Public Service Commission, and others work out how the program will function, the utility will file a final version in a separate docket next year.


And the plan put forth by Georgia Power this summer lacks some key features that data center companies want. A big point of contention is that it doesn’t credit the solar and batteries that customers procure as a way to meet future peaks in power demand — the same peaks Georgia Power uses to justify its gas-plant buildout.


But as it stands, CEBA sees ​“the approved CIR framework as a meaningful step toward the ​‘bring-your-own clean energy’ model,” Southworth said — a model that goes by the catchy acronym BYONCE in clean-energy social media circles.


 Opening up the playing field for clean energy

The CIR option is technically an addition to Georgia Power’s existing Clean and Renewable Energy Subscription (CARES) program, which requires the utility to secure up to 4 gigawatts of new renewable resources by 2035. CARES is a more standard ​“green tariff” program that leaves the utility in control of contracting for resources and making them available to customers under set terms, Southworth explained.


Under the CIR option, by contrast, large customers will be able to seek out their own projects directly with a developer and the utility. Georgia Power will analyze the projects and subject them to tests to establish whether they are cost-effective. Once projects are approved by Georgia Power, built, and online, customers can take credit for the power generated, both on their energy bills and in the form of renewable energy certificates. Georgia Power’s current plan allows the procurement of up to 3 gigawatts of customer-identified resources through 2035.


Letting big companies contract their own clean power is far from a new idea. Since 2014, corporate clean-energy procurements have surpassed 100 gigawatts in the United States, equal to 41% of all clean energy added to the nation’s grid over that time, according to CEBA. Tech giants have made up the lion’s share of that growth and have continued to add more capacity in 2025, despite the headwinds created by the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress.


But most of that investment has happened in parts of the country that operate under competitive energy markets, in which independent developers can build power plants and solar, wind, and battery farms. The Southeast lacks these markets, leaving large, vertically integrated utilities like Georgia Power in control of what gets built. Perhaps not coincidentally, Southeast utilities also have some of the country’s biggest gas-plant expansion plans.


A lot of clean energy projects could use a boost from power-hungry companies. According to the latest data from the Southern Energy Renewable Association trade group, more than 20 gigawatts of solar, battery, and hybrid solar-battery projects are now seeking grid interconnection in Georgia.


“The idea that a large customer can buy down the cost of a clean energy resource to make sure it’s brought onto the grid to benefit them and everybody else, because that’s of value to them — that’s theoretically a great concept,” said Jennifer Whitfield, senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center, a nonprofit that’s pushing Georgia regulators to find cleaner, lower-cost alternatives to Georgia Power’s proposed gas-plant expansion. ​“We’re very supportive of the process because it has the potential to be a great asset to everyone else on the grid.”


Isabella Ariza, staff attorney at the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal Campaign, said CEBA deserves credit for working to secure this option for big customers in Georgia. In fact, she identified it as one of the rare bright spots offsetting a series of decisions from Georgia Power and the Public Service Commission that environmental and consumer advocates fear will raise energy costs and climate pollution.










“They’re proposing something that makes total sense and would help some companies be able to say ​‘We’re powering our stuff with 100% clean energy,’” Ariza said of the CIR option. That’s particularly important at a time when many hyperscalers are backing away from their clean energy targets in their hunt for power for AI data centers, she noted.


 The missing piece: capacity value

Despite those benefits, the CIR framework’s omissions are substantial enough that CEBA did not join stakeholders like Walmart, the Georgia Association of Manufacturers, and the Southern Renewable Energy Association trade groups in signing on to it.


CEBA wanted companies to be able to procure a full range of carbon-free generation resources — such as geothermal and small modular nuclear reactors — rather than just renewable energy and renewables paired with batteries. The trade group also sought a pathway for customers to bring projects forward on a rolling basis more quickly than the current settlement agreement would allow.


But one of the biggest issues CEBA has with the current CIR plan is that it ​“does not recognize the full capacity value of customer-funded clean, firm resources to the grid,” Southworth said. Capacity value is a measure of how power plants, batteries, and other resources meet peak power demands during the handful of hours per year that determine how much generation and grid infrastructure utilities need to build.


That’s a significant gap. If the resources that big customers secure under the CIR aren’t considered part of the solution to this challenge — if their capacity value isn’t factored in — they may not be able to reduce Georgia Power’s need for gigawatts of gas-fired power plants, which are the traditional utility backstop for ensuring adequate energy supplies.


This would be bad for Georgia Power customers at large, who would end up paying for more gas plants than are actually needed after the data centers driving up power demand secure their own resources instead. It could also saddle data centers and other big customers with growing capacity-related costs that their self-secured projects could otherwise help reduce.


“A well-designed CIR program that recognizes the capacity value of customer-funded clean resources is a win-win-win for large customers, Georgia Power, and all ratepayers,” Southworth said. ​“Participating customers pay the incremental cost of new clean, firm projects; the utility gets capacity it can count on; and nonparticipating customers benefit from a more diverse, less gas-dependent resource mix without taking on the full cost or fuel price risk of those projects.”


CEBA has ideas for how Georgia Power could financially compensate customers for the capacity value of the resources that they procure. The utility already calculates ​“avoided capacity values” for the renewable energy, battery, and fossil-fueled resources it brings to the table in its requests for proposals. Georgia Power could provide a capacity credit of similar value to subscribing customers for the projects they procure.


CEBA will ​“continue to work with the company and commission staff,” Southworth said. Her group sees Georgia Power’s long-term plan approved this summer ​“as establishing the floor, not the ceiling, for what CIR can become.”


A big shift at the Public Service Commission could lay the groundwork for a reassessment of the program. Last month, Georgia voters elected two Democratic challengers — health care consultant Alicia Johnson and clean-energy advocate Peter Hubbard — to replace Republican incumbents Tim Echols and Fitz Johnson.


The two new commissioners have both pledged to tackle high and rising electricity costs for Georgia Power residential customers. Across the country, utilities and regulators are striving to force data center developers to take on the costs they’re imposing on power grids, rather than foisting them on everyday utility customers.


“Capacity is still an open question” that the Public Service Commission can take up as it decides on the CIR option, said Whitfield of the Southern Environmental Law Center. ​“Georgia Power is certainly on record that they don’t prefer it to be accredited, which makes sense for them. They want to build more and profit more,” as a regulated utility that earns guaranteed profits on its capital investments. ​“But that is going to be very much a live issue.”",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/solar--1024x682.jpeg,,,2025-12-05 15:59:28.191722

The amendment’s birthright citizenship clause has been used to give citizenship to the children of immigrants in the country without legal authorization or on a temporary basis.While a schedule for arguments has not yet been released by the court, it’s likely the case would be heard sometime in early 2026.The Trump administration argued in its petition to the court that the amendment, which was adopted in 1868, was meant to apply to newly freed slaves. It was not meant to provide citizenship to the children of immigrants without legal status, Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote.“Long after the Clause’s adoption, the mistaken view that birth on U.S. territory confers citizenship on anyone subject to the regulatory reach of U.S. law became pervasive, with destructive consequences,” Sauer wrote in the September petition.The petition also sought Supreme Court review of a related challenge to the order by the states of Washington, Arizona, Illinois and Oregon. Friday’s court order did not grant a hearing on that case.Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 20 seeking to redefine the birthright citizenship clause to exclude the children of immigrants in the country without legal authority or only temporarily. Democratic-led states and advocacy groups swiftly sued.Courts have largely blocked enforcement of the order, although the Supreme Court in June allowed it to go into effect in the states that had not sued to preserve the right.In a Friday afternoon statement, the American Civil Liberties Union, a leading civil rights group, noted that several federal judges had blocked enforcement and predicted the Supreme Court would preserve birthright citizenship.“No president can change the 14th Amendment’s fundamental promise of citizenship,” Cecillia Wang, ACLU’s national legal director, said. “For over 150 years, it has been the law and our national tradition that everyone born on U.S. soil is a citizen from birth. The federal courts have unanimously held that President Trump’s executive order is contrary to the Constitution, a Supreme Court decision from 1898, and a law enacted by Congress. We look forward to putting this issue to rest once and for all in the Supreme Court this term.”",,,,2025-12-05 14:57:45.618686

The first parcel is a 174-acre addition to the Copeland Bend Wildlife Area. The conservation groups’ acquisition connects multiple tracts of the existing public lands northeast of Nebraska City. 
The second parcel, also 174 acres, is a few miles southeast of the first site and connects portions of the M.U. Payne Wildlife Area along the Missouri River. The groups said the site will improve access to the northern end of the existing wildlife area. 
The acquisition of the sites was funded by Pheasants Forever and Quail Forever’s Build a Wildlife Area program. The program has led to permanent protections and publicly accessible land for more than 243,000 acres in 17 states since 1982, according to a news release from the nonprofit organizations.
The release said the newest parcels add habitat for the game birds in areas that are “heavily utilized” by Iowan and Nebraskan hunters. 
In 2024, hunters bagged an estimated 460,000 roosters, or male pheasants, and 27,500 quail in Iowa.

(Photo by Caity Coyne/West Virginia Watch)Residents in Mingo County filed a federal lawsuit this week against the New York-based company working to build an ammonia plant, two natural gas power plants and a data center complex in their communities.
The lawsuit was filed on Dec. 3 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia on behalf of 10 Mingo County residents. 
Defendants named in the suit are TransGas Development Systems, the Huntington District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 
Raleigh County-based attorney Stephen New is representing the plaintiffs in the case.
In their suit, the residents in the case allege that the proposed projects — both the ammonia plant and the power plants, which have received separate air quality permits from the state Department of Environmental Protection — could threaten local, endangered wildlife. They say that TransGas, the company behind these projects, has failed to undergo federal actions necessary to make the construction of the facilities legal.
Those actions, per the lawsuit, include consulting with the federal Fish and Wildlife Services on whether the proposed projects would affect protected species or habitats; receiving a permit under the Clean Water Act to affect local waterways; undergoing a review through the National Environmental Policy Act to create an environmental impact statement for the projects and receiving approval from FERC to construct pipelines that could be necessary to supply natural gas to the power facilities.
Unless the court acts to require these actions, the lawsuit reads, then TransGas will move forward in the project and potentially cause “the precise procedural and environmental harm” the named federal agencies are meant to prevent.
The projects by TransGas are collectively referred to as the Adams Fork Energy Project. One portion of the proposed project includes building the largest natural gas-fueled ammonia plant in the world. It would produce up to 2.1 million metric tons of ammonia per year, according to the company.
The West Virginia DEP Air Quality Board granted a permit to TransGas for that project last year. That permit was carried over from one previously granted to the company nearly 20 years ago for the construction of a plant that would convert coal into liquid fuel. That plant — also proposed for Mingo County — was never built.
At community meetings earlier this year, Mingo County resident Ernie Sammons — who is selling his property to TransGas for the proposed data center complex — told concerned residents that the proposed ammonia plant was no longer happening. But no other evidence has been provided by TransGas or anyone else to demonstrate that. As long as the permit is in place, the company can move forward with its plans.
Representatives for TransGas did not respond to requests for comments for this story.
The more recent portion of the proposed TransGas development would entail constructing two new methane- and diesel-burning natural gas power plants. Per the near-identical air quality applications submitted to the DEP, the plants would operate as “microgrids,” powering two new data centers: one at the Twisted Gun Golf Course in Wharncliffe and another near the Mingo-Logan county line at the Harless Industrial Park, in Holden.
The two natural gas plants would each house 117 engines powered by methane, with 114 of those running full-time. If no gas is available, the engines would run on diesel that is stored in 40 tanks on each site. 
Annually, per the applications, each facility would have the potential to emit up to 206 tons of carbon monoxide, 194 tons of nitrogen oxides, 118 tons of volatile organic compounds and 188 tons of fine particulate matter, or soot. 
These kinds of emissions are known to negatively affect air quality in surrounding areas and contribute to climate change. People at risk of developing respiratory problems — including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, black lung or other illnesses — are particularly vulnerable to negative health impacts from these emissions.
Residents in Mingo and Logan County have been outspoken against the proposed projects. They’ve shared concerns how the new power plants could impact their air quality, their health and their water, as well as their overall quality of life. Their concerns have been met with few answers from either the company or state regulators.
Despite the concerns and continued public pushback, the state DEP granted air quality permits for both power plants in October. 
In the suit filed this week, residents are asking the court to put a halt on any “ground-disturbing or project-advancing activities” for the Adams Fork project until TransGas undergoes the named federal processes.

In the 32 years she’s owned and operated her North Broad Street business “Ricard’s Inc.,” it’s taken plenty of sweat and toil to keep the lights on. “I’ve survived hurricanes, the pandemic, the buyout of a partner, all of these things, and I’ve never […]","Kim Krivjanick, owner of Ricard’s, at her supply store on Broad Street in New Orleans, Dec. 2, 2025. (Photo by Christiana Botic/Verite News and Catchlight Local/Report for America)NEW ORLEANS — Kim Krivjanick is not afraid of hard work.
In the 32 years she’s owned and operated her North Broad Street business “Ricard’s Inc.,” it’s taken plenty of sweat and toil to keep the lights on.
“I’ve survived hurricanes, the pandemic, the buyout of a partner, all of these things, and I’ve never been in a situation like this,” Krivjanick said.
But Krivjanick said she has recently started having trouble finding electricians, housekeepers, delivery drivers all essential to her work managing short-term rentals and selling restaurant, catering and janitorial products. People are not showing up or just outright quitting, she said, and she attributes this to workers being afraid that federal immigration agents will target people who have brown skin — even creole women, like her.
She’s not alone.
Broad Street traverses several of the city’s neighborhoods from Broadmoor to the 7th Ward. Long an epicenter of Black-owned businesses, Broad Street is now also a commercial hub for the city’s Latino community. The street and adjacent ones are peppered with a wide variety of businesses — hair salons, grocery stores, restaurants, cafes, auto repair shops, veterinarians and fast food stores. On the strip of Broad between Canal and Tulane, businesses such as Morenita Plus, Ideal Market and Botanica San Simon are frequented by Latino customers. On a normal weekday, music pulses from popular store fronts and people line up at Taqueria El Poblano for lunch.

But now, as the Department of Homeland Security launches Operation Catahoula Crunch, many in the Broad Street business community who spoke with Verite News, say they feel increasingly placed in a quandary: wanting to keep their businesses operating as usual but worried that customers and workers could feel at-risk of being swept up in the operation, which has a reported goal of arresting 5,000 people. They’re saying that the fear that’s gripped residents of New Orleans is negatively impacting business. Some business owners are taking small steps to help where they can.
Others expressed fear of speaking out and drawing the unwanted gaze of immigration agents. Many say that federal law enforcement using aggressive tactics to round up people they see as part of their community is not normal, desired or helpful for business.
“This is not America. This is not who we are,” Krivjanick said. “We don’t have masked men running up to us, grabbing us, throwing us into unidentified cars, you know or to beat us up on the street.”
DHS says the masks worn by many immigration agents protect them from people learning details about them and their families.
Krivjanick said the tactic makes people afraid of the government.
On top of the worker shortage, short-term renters are calling, Krivjanick said, and asking if the U.S. Immigration Customs Enforcement is still going to be roaming the streets around the New Year’s holiday or Mardi Gras. Those are times when Krivjanick typically expects her rentals to fill up. She doesn’t know what to say, because she doesn’t know herself.
In her experience, people come to New Orleans to enjoy themselves. Potential renters Krivjanick said, who’ve seen scenes from other Border Patrol operations across the country play out don’t think a confrontation with masked agents compliments the partying, drinking, dining and dancing people anticipate when planning a trip to New Orleans. Three potential tenants canceled on her earlier this week, citing ICE as a reason for cancelling, she said.
In response to Verite News questions about fears of people being targeted for their skin color, DHS denied that it engages in racial and ethnic profiling, calling allegations that it does so disgusting, reckless and false.

Allowing workers to stay home is one step some businesses said they’re taking to help alleviate the anxiety they’re hearing in light of stories of Border Patrol agents profiling and detaining people.

“I can’t ask anybody to come to work right now,” said Krivjanick, choking on some of her words, “I simply can’t, because I feel if I made pressure and said, ‘Hey, you know, if you come in, I’ll pay you a little extra,’ if I do that and something happens to the family, yeah, I wouldn’t be able to live with myself.”
Tommy LeBlanc, co-owner of HEY Coffee Co., based off of North Broad Street, also said he didn’t want to encourage people to come out to an upcoming fundraiser if they didn’t feel safe. On Wednesday, he and his friend, José Chris Blanco, co-owner of Waska, a pop-up store that specializes in cooking arepas, were hosting an event at LeBlanc’s Broadmoor location.
A portion of the proceeds were set to go to a local nonprofit that serves some of the area’s Hispanic community, Puentes New Orleans. Blanco cooked food and said 70% of the profits from Waska would go to Puentes. LeBlanc said 20% of the day’s sales at his other coffee shop in Broadmoor would go to Puentes. LeBlanc’s shop also sells a coffee blend, café con sueños, that launched this summer and whose proceeds go to Puentes NOLA’s mission.
“We’re just trying to take the time to show our neighbors, our Latino neighbors, that they are cherished and welcome, as far as we’re concerned,” LeBlanc said.

Puentes New Orleans normally works to promote better outcomes in education, career development and cultural integration. But they’ve recently had to pivot into crisis mode, to address the fear and panic setting in among families as uncertainty around the immigration enforcement operation looms, according to the non-profit’s executive director, Angela Ramirez.
For Blanco, whose business is mobile and who has sometimes worked on Broad Street, spending a day cooking arepas so that 70% of the proceeds could go to Puentes New Orleans was a “no-brainer.”
“I love what they do, what they stand for,” Blanco said.
Blanco was born in Colombia, grew up in Miami, worked as a chef in Vermont, and started his pop-up around the end of 2022, he said. For the first time since coming to the country, Blanco is carrying around his green card with him, which he called “pretty wild.”
“I’ve never had to walk around with my residence card, and even that … doesn’t give me 100% protection against what ICE is doing,” he said.
As the Trump administration has deployed surges of immigration agents to cities around the country, they have been accused of detaining people based on the way they look, the language they speak or their place of work. American citizens have been detained in the operations, as well.
He also said he knows people who are not leaving their homes.
“Is this, like, Nazi Germany? Like, what’s going on?” Blanco asked. “People are hiding because they don’t want to go out because they’re afraid of being abducted.”
Blanco’s business partner, Marcella Garcia, said she sees the residents of New Orleans as a fearless people, and that she hopes that those who can will help protect the people who are the most vulnerable to immigration enforcement actions by raising awareness of what agents are doing.
Several Broad Street business owners would only speak anonymously for fear of being targeted by federal immigration agents.
One said he’s losing money in sales daily because some of his customers are afraid to come out to shop, and some of his employees are afraid to come to work. He said they’re scared to be targeted even driving around. In places right outside of the city, a routine traffic stop could lead to immigration detention and deportation.

Malaysia Walker, who’s a longtime seamstress and works as a general manager at Broadway Bound Costume Supplies, was sewing the base for a Mardi Gras Indian suit when she spoke with Verite News.
Walker said that as far as she can tell, her business has not been impacted by the operation, but she was personally not fond of the idea of expanded law enforcement in the streets.
“I do feel it’s an extreme way to handle the situation, and I think it’s going to bring more harm than good to the city,” Walker said.
On Tuesday afternoon at Coffee Science on South Broad Street, plastic whistles sat in a container near the sales register, as business was winding down for the day.
Co-owner Leah Vautrot said that the whistles are there for community members to use as a tool to draw attention to immigration agents to alert others of their presence and help prevent people from being isolated or quietly detained. She said that, as a community hub committed to social justice, the business felt a responsibility to stand up for its neighbors.
“Disappearing our neighbors off the street should never be normalized. That’s why we’re doing what we can, however small, to create resources that help our customers recognize when ICE is present, alert others, and draw a crowd,” said Vautrot.
Vautrot said that what she’s witnessing feels like something out of 1933 Germany, when Adolf Hitler became chancellor of Germany, and his Nazi party completed its takeover of the country’s government.
She also highlighted the important role that immigrants, foreign farms and global exchange play in the main product they sell — coffee — and she said she’s opposed to the idea of disrupting the livelihood of the families that enable their business “from origin to cup.”
“If we don’t stand up for dignity and due process, we’re complicit in a system that erases people,” Vautrot said. “And people are not disposable.”

(Photo by Lauren Sausser/KFF Health News)COLUMBIA — More than 280 people are in quarantine for measles after a significant influx in cases following the Thanksgiving holiday, the state health department said Friday.
An Upstate outbreak reached 84 cases as of Friday, up 22 from last week, according to the department. That includes cases linked to eight schools, whose students account for about 200 of the people in quarantine.

Rainbow Lake Middle School in Chesnee: 61 students in quarantine, 82.2% vaccination rate

“It’s very unfortunate that we’re seeing this ballooning of cases now,” Bell said. “Though we anticipated a possible increase in cases after Thanksgiving, this is alarming.”
Quarantining students who don’t develop symptoms can return to school between Thursday and Dec. 15, depending on when their quarantine began, according to the health department. But health officials are worried about cases continuing to increase as people travel for Christmas and other winter holidays.
Also of concern is the possibility that people infected with the highly contagious disease may break quarantine and further spread the disease, Bell said.
Most of the people infected developed symptoms after a known exposure to another case, and most people are following the health department’s recommendations about staying home during the virus’ 21-day incubation period.
“We want to make sure people are fully aware of the risk that they pose to the community if they do not stay in quarantine,” Bell said.
Without saying how many, she added that some people have broken their quarantine, risking community transmission, she said. Eight reported cases so far came from an exposure at Way of Truth Church in Inman, one example of how much the disease can spread.
The state will not require people to stay home or get vaccinated, Gov. Henry McMaster told reporters this week. However, he also warned that measles can be deadly in certain cases.
“We don’t want to force or have a mandate, but we need people to be very careful, because it is a dangerous disease,” McMaster said.
Of the 84 people infected as part of the outbreak, 77 were unvaccinated, according to the health department. Another three had received one dose of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, one was fully vaccinated, and three have unknown vaccination statuses.
Vaccination is the best way of preventing measles infections, according to the department.
Getting two doses of the vaccine, as most people do during childhood, is about 97% effective in protecting against measles, the agency has said.
Vaccine rates in this South Carolina county lagged for years. Then measles struck.

The vaccine also works within three days of exposure. Adults who are unvaccinated or aren’t sure whether they have received both doses of the vaccine can get their shots at a public health department clinic, doctor’s office or pharmacy.
Symptoms can begin between one and three weeks after exposure, usually starting with a cough, runny nose, red, watery eyes, and a fever.
Within several days, infected people develop a red, blotchy rash that typically starts on the face before spreading to the rest of the body.
Measles can cause severe illness, potentially leading to pneumonia or even death, especially in young children.
The Department of Public Health doesn’t track the outcomes of infections, but it has not received any reports of severe complications, Bell said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/MobileHealthUnit-measles-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-05 14:57:45.618686

(Image provided)This story originally ran in The New Bedford Light.
The federal agency regulating offshore wind development asked a federal judge on Tuesday to allow it to reconsider a key approval — one the same agency granted just last year — for New England Wind 1, a project planned off the Massachusetts coast.
If the federal government’s request is granted, it would be a blow to the project, which plans to invest in New Bedford and use the city for long-term project operations. If the approval stands, the project could move toward construction once it secures a power purchase agreement with the commonwealth.
This is at least the third time the administration has sought a remand of an offshore wind project approval, the others being for SouthCoast Wind and Maryland’s US Wind. The permits give major infrastructure projects the certainty to secure financing and move forward with construction.
The filing comes more than two months after the federal government signaled it would take such action against this project. The remand request was expected sooner, but the weekslong government shutdown pushed the deadline.
The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management filed the motion as part of a lawsuit brought in May by offshore wind opposition group ACK for Whales and other parties, including the Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head Aquinnah, against BOEM and the Interior Department’s approval of New England Wind 1.
This latest move illustrates how President Donald Trump’s administration is using lawsuits brought by municipalities and activist groups as a tool to crack down on the industry. Of the more than 20 actions and orders issued since January, one directed federal attorneys to review pending litigation against projects and consider a remand of permits that the litigation contests.
BOEM Principal Deputy Director Matthew Giacona in a declaration signed Monday cited several of those orders, including Trump’s day-one wind memo.
The Light contacted Avangrid, the company developing the project, for comment Tuesday afternoon.
New England Wind 1 would abut Avangrid’s other project, Vineyard Wind, which sits south of Martha’s Vineyard and is wrapping up construction now.
The Construction and Operations Plan (COP), which BOEM could ultimately decide to revoke or approve with new conditions, is the final stamp of approval from the federal government for a project to build on the Outer Continental Shelf. It is the culmination of years of review that considers expert analysis and input from stakeholders and the public.
Giacona stated the COP approval “may have failed to account for all the impacts” of the project, and that federal reviews “may have also understated impacts.”
He and the federal government did not get into specifics, and cited general concerns such as interference with other marine activities (like commercial fishing and shipping) and “national security.” (The government cited national security concerns in its halting of Revolution Wind; a court later struck down that stop-work order.)
New England Wind 1 plans to construct the project out of Salem (a terminal yet to be built that, in August, lost $34 million in federal funding), but house its long-term operations and maintenance hub in New Bedford.
The project, along with SouthCoast Wind, issued letters of intent to use the under-construction New Bedford Foss Marine Terminal for operations and maintenance work, which is meant to last as long as the turbines operate — or about three decades.
Per a 2024 filing from Avangrid, the project planned to start construction in the second quarter of 2026, at the earliest.
New Bedford Mayor Jon Mitchell previously said if the project doesn’t move forward, it would eliminate at least 100 future jobs in the city. He added that estimate doesn’t include indirect jobs created, and other economic benefits to city businesses, including restaurants, hotels and shoreside operations.
Contingent on the project moving forward, the Danish company, Liftra, plans to establish a crane manufacturing facility in New Bedford.

Mitchell on Tuesday said he was disappointed, but not surprised: “Whether this particular project goes forward is becoming more in doubt by the day.”
The remand request further complicates negotiations for a power purchase agreement between the commonwealth and New England Wind. The agreements have been delayed several times, in large part due to federal actions. The deadline is now the end of this month.
The request for a remand will be decided by a federal judge. A different federal judge last month allowed the federal government’s remand request for SouthCoast Wind.
The government cited this in its argument to the court, stating its reasoning for New England Wind is the same, and that the court should reach the same conclusion and grant the remand request.
Meanwhile, several states, including Massachusetts, are waiting for a federal judge to rule on whether Trump’s day-one wind memo, the document underlying the administration’s actions against projects, is unlawful. It’s unclear when that decision will come, and what scope of relief it could provide to the states challenged by a president bent on stopping the industry.
Just as the federal government has not given a timeline for the review ordered by Trump’s memo, it has not given a timeline for the remand review. It said the projected timeline is “currently uncertain,” and asked the court to not impose a deadline by which it must make a determination on the 2024 approval.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)The Kentucky Lantern is suing the University of Kentucky after it refused to release records related to a $375,000 settlement with a faculty leader who had challenged the administration’s decision to disband the University Senate.
The Lantern filed the lawsuit on Nov. 26 after Attorney General Russell Coleman’s office rejected the nonprofit news outlet’s appeal of UK’s decision. Under Kentucky’s open records law, parties can appeal the attorney general’s decisions in a local circuit court. 
Earlier this year, the Lantern sought records of email exchanges that preceded the university signing a $375,000 separation agreement with DeShana Collett, who had been a tenured professor in physician assistant studies. A provision in the agreement between UK and Collett required her to withdraw her request for emails among UK administrators that mentioned her. The Office of the Attorney General (OAG) had earlier ruled that under state law Collett was entitled to the records.

Collett played a prominent role last year in opposing a change to UK’s internal governance and presided over a vote of no confidence in UK President Eli Capilouto. After the vote, Collett warned faculty that the administration was taking steps that she thought could lead to retaliation against the president’s critics. Collett entered the separation agreement in June 2025. 
Filed in Fayette Circuit Court, the Lantern’s complaint says that while “the University’s denial and the OAG’s rubber-stamping of the denial based on a dangerous interpretation of the preliminary records exemption should concern” Kentuckians, the “bigger picture is the University’s attempt to buy its way out of the Open Records Act.” 
“This Case calls upon Kentucky’s courts to yet again tell its largest state university that the Open Records Act means what it says: disclosure is in the public interest, and the law’s exemptions must be narrowly construed,” the complaint says. 
The lawsuit has been assigned to Fayette Circuit Judge Lucy Ferguson VanMeter.
Michael Abate, who is representing the Lantern along with Jeremy Lister-Perlman, said in a statement that the case is important “for anyone that cares about transparency or the governance of the state’s flagship university.”
“UK paid almost $400,000 to a professor that had won an open records appeal against it and made the payment contingent on her dropping her request for records. The public has a right to know what the University was willing to pay so dearly to hide,” Abate said. 
“On top of that, the Attorney General’s decision attempts to re-write the narrow exemption for ‘preliminary’ records to include virtually any email or other ‘non-final’ document possessed by an agency,” he continued.” That interpretation, if accepted, would gut the Open Records Act and render most of the documents now accessible to the public off-limits.” 
UK spokesman Jay Blanton defended UK’s denial of the records and pointed to the attorney general’s decision in favor of the university. 
“The University believes the Attorney General’s decision is correct,” Blanton said in an email Friday. “Indeed, the Attorney General’s decision is fully consistent with all Attorney General’s decisions since 2021.”
The Lantern’s records request mirrored a request for records from Collett that asked for emails with her name sent by Eric Monday, UK’s executive vice president for finance and administration and co-executive vice president for health affairs, between July 1, 2023 and June 30, 2024. UK denied the request in early September. 
That time frame spans campus discussions around shared governance at UK. In April 2024, the UK Board of Trustees voted 19-1 to change the University Senate to a faculty senate — a move that faculty members warned would limit their decision-making power over academic decisions.
The aftermath of the no-confidence vote was the subject of an article in The Chronicle of Higher Education that reported Collett had written to faculty members warning of acts of retaliation by the UK administration after the vote. 
In an Aug. 20, 2024, email, Collett forwarded a message that she had shared with faculty members to Lisa Tannock, a former associate provost for faculty advancement, saying that provost office employees were assuming control of the University Senate’s voting system, a PollEverywhere account, which had access to all Senate-recorded votes.
Collett added in her email to Tannock that the University Senate did not keep records of individual members’ votes and was not required to. 
Tannock said in a response that “this matter is under serious investigation with the possibility of becoming a criminal investigation.” Collett’s attorney told the Lantern that UK’s general counsel later said there was no investigation. Tannock no longer works at the university.
Collett’s attorney, Joe Childers, told the Lantern that she decided to leave the university because she was “not comfortable in the environment that she was subjected to” after the controversy over the governance change.
In response to Collett’s open records request, the attorney general’s office issued an opinion partially in her favor in February.
However in the Lantern’s appeal, the attorney general’s office sided with UK, arguing that state law exempts public agencies from disclosing “preliminary” documents in response to open records requests. 
“Describing the contents of emails created during its ‘decision-making process,’ the University explains that the emails contain ‘(1) early drafts of documents; (2) communications between various university officials; and (3) communications between the University’s attorneys and other university officials, including requests for advice and providing information necessary for the University attorneys to formulate legal advice,” the attorney general opinion says. 
In recent years, UK has gone to court with Kentucky news outlets over denied open records requests, including the student-run newspaper, the Kentucky Kernel.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_0798-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-05 14:57:45.618686
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-05 19:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Yale hints at layoffs to help pay for endowment tax hike,Michayla Savitt | Connecticut Public,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/05/yale-endowment-tax-layoffs/,The university estimates Trump administration's new tax will amount to $300 million per year beginning in July 2026.,"Yale University this week informed faculty and staff there may need to be layoffs down the line, as the school continues tackling budget challenges amid federal actions. The issue stems from a major increase to university endowment taxes, enacted under President Donald Trump and Congressional Republicans’ “One Big Beautiful Bill”.
The university estimates it will pay the federal government $300 million per year beginning in July 2026. The Trump administration raised the endowment tax from 1.4% up to 8% on investment gains under the federal policy signed into law in July, as The Yale Daily News reported. Yale must pay the maximum tax, with its endowment valued at over $44 billion dollars.
Cost-cutting measures such as retirement incentives and a three-month hiring freeze, among other moves have already been in the works at Yale. The budget update from the Office of the Provost Wednesday said that’s helped but, “cannot make up for the significant long-term reduction in funds that support students, faculty, and staff.”
This fall the university also requested three-year budget plans from each school and unit, to tackle the rest of the funding gaps. In the update to faculty and staff on Wednesday, Provost Scott Strobel said more staff reductions may also be needed.
“Nearly two-thirds of the university’s expenses relate to compensation and benefits,” Strobel said in the written announcement. “Unfortunately, this means several units may need to meet their budget targets by reducing their workforce. We are hopeful that most reductions can be accomplished by eliminating open positions and through regular turnover and retirement incentives.”
Daniel Martinez HoSang is on the executive committee of the Yale chapter of American Association of University Professors (AAUP). He said people understand these are all difficult budget choices, but that more faculty, students and staff deserve a say.
“I think there is a growing concern among faculty at Yale and other colleges and universities that the problem is not a recognition about the crisis we’re likely to face, but it’s the very, very uneven ways that faculty, students, staff and others are allowed to participate in decisions about what the impact and consequences of these budget reductions will be,” said Martinez HoSang, a professor of American studies and political science.
He said there need to be better ways for people to weigh in.
“Other than a small number of faculty who might have appointments in these committees, many faculty feel kind of in the dark about these processes,” Martinez HoSang added.
Yale’s budget challenges also extend beyond the university, since the school gives tens of millions of dollars in annual funding to the city of New Haven. As Yale Daily news reported, the city of New Haven and Yale are in negotiations about financial contributions in fiscal year 2027, which is slated to decrease by $8 million.

Michelle Lujan Grisham's office announced Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department Secretary Melanie Kenderdine resigned on Dec. 5, 2025. (Courtesy photo)Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham on Friday morning announced that New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department Secretary Melanie Kenderdine is resigning “for personal reasons,” effective immediately.
Kenderdine has held the position since May of 2024. At the time, Lujan Grisham praised Kenderine’s reputation as “a strategic thinker in the realm of energy policy” and said she expected Kenderdine to play a large role in “helping New Mexico shape our clean-energy future.”
Source NM reached Kenderdine briefly on Friday morning, who said her husband was in poor health. In an email to EMNRD staff, she wrote that her resignation would be effective on Jan. 5, but that Friday would be her last day in the office.
“I’ve enjoyed my time leading EMNRD and appreciate the opportunity the governor has given me. I must, however, attend to serious personal matters — my husband’s health needs — that require levels of attention I cannot give while working full time,” she wrote.
In a May statement, Kenderdine said she was “honored” to join the governor’s administration and wanted to see New Mexico emerge as “a national leader in the country’s journey to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions.”
Kenderdine, an alumna of Albuquerque’s Manzano High School and the University of New Mexico, was co-founder and executive vice president of Energy Futures Initiative, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit focused on transitioning to renewable energy. In November, the national Women’s Council on Energy and the Environment named her the “2025 Woman of the Year” for her “long history of mentoring and supporting women in the field of energy.”
Kenderdine previously served in the U.S. Department of Energy, where she oversaw a 26-country initiative to support clean energy research and shaped the Strategic Petroleum Reserve oil exchange, under Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton.
“Melanie brought national energy expertise to New Mexico, and I’m grateful for her contributions at EMNRD,” Lujan Grisham said.
Deputy Cabinet Secretary Erin Taylor will serve as acting cabinet secretary, according to a news release.
Taylor has been deputy cabinet secretary since April and previously held leadership roles with EMNRD’s Energy Conservation and Management Division, as well as its Mining and Minerals Division. Before that, she worked for the U.S. Department of Energy and oversaw programs that offered technical assistance for energy programs in every U.S. state and territory.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/kenderdinehorizontal-1024x472.png,,,2025-12-05 13:58:30.203850

Matt Pierce, left, speaks against the Republican congressional redistricting proposal during Indiana House debate on Friday, Dec. 5, 2025. (Photo by Tom Davies/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana House Republicans voted Friday to go along with President Donald Trump’s demand for redrawing the state’s congressional maps.
The House action sends the congressional redistricting issue to the state Senate, where its Republican leader has said for months that too few senators are in support for it to pass. 
House members voted 57-41 in favor of the new maps crafted to produce a 9-0 Republican delegation by carving up the districts currently held by Democratic Reps. André Carson in Indianapolis and Frank Mrvan in the area along Lake Michigan near Chicago.
Twelve Republicans joined Democrats in opposing the bill.
Democratic lawmakers denounced the proposed redistricting as a racial gerrymander for dividing Carson’s 7th District — the state’s most urban and racially diverse — among four new districts. Those extend far into rural heavily Republican counties, with two of the proposed districts stretching to the Ohio River and another nearly reaching Lake Michigan.
Republican Rep. Ben Smaltz, author of the redistricting plan in House Bill 1032, maintains the new districts were drawn “purely for political performance” of GOP candidates.
Attention will now turn to the state Senate, which is scheduled to take up the proposed maps beginning Monday.
Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray has repeatedly declared too few senators are in support for redistricting to pass. But under political threats from Trump and Gov. Mike Braun, Bray announced two days before Thanksgiving that senators would make a Statehouse return to “make a final decision on any redistricting proposal sent from the House.”
Trump started the national redistricting fight by pushing Texas Republicans to redraw its congressional map this summer. The pressure on Indiana Republicans has included trips in August and October by Vice President JD Vance to Indianapolis.

The current three-dose […]","Members of a key CDC advisory committee, known as the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, met in Atlanta on Dec. 4. Maya Homan/Georgia RecorderATLANTA — A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention committee voted to eliminate a recommendation that all newborn babies receive a vaccine against hepatitis B, ending a policy that has been in place since 1991 to protect Americans against an incurable liver disease that can lead to cirrhosis, cancer and liver failure.
The current three-dose series for hepatitis B includes one vaccine administered to infants within 24 hours of birth, and subsequent booster shots given one month and six months after the initial dose. There was a 99% drop in serious infections among children between 1990 and 2019, which is attributed to the universal vaccination policy.
The agency will leave in place a recommendation that babies born to mothers who test positive for hepatitis B receive a vaccine at birth. However, the new guidelines leave the decision in all other cases to “individual-based decision-making.” They also suggest that parents delay the first dose of the vaccine for at least two months after birth.
Friday’s decision comes after an 8-3 vote from a key CDC advisory committee, known as the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which is charged with setting national guidelines around which people should be vaccinated against a wide range of preventable diseases and when those vaccines should be administered. The recommendations play a key role in determining which vaccines insurance companies are willing to cover and how accessible those immunizations are to the public.
Retsef Levi, an ACIP member and professor of operations management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, called the updated recommendation a “very positive change in policy.” arguing that blanket vaccine recommendations force newborns to serve as “a safety net for adults’ mistakes.”
But Dr. Cody Meissner, another member of the committee who also serves as a professor of pediatrics and medicine at Dartmouth College, argued that there was no scientific evidence to support the changes implemented by the panel.
Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices member Robert Malone, a doctor and biochemist who once said he views the label of anti-vaxxer as “high praise,” was recently appointed to vice chair of the committee. Maya Homan/Georgia Recorder
“Thoughtful inquiry is always commendable,” he told the committee. “But that inquiry should not be confused with baseless skepticism, which is what I think we’re encountering here.”
The updated recommendation for the hepatitis B vaccine mirrors COVID-19 vaccine guidelines passed by the same panel in September, which places new emphasis on the risks of immunizations, though the CDC’s own data shows that the vaccines are safe and effective for most people. As with the new COVID-19 vaccine recommendations, the updated hepatitis B guidelines will not take effect until being officially signed off by the CDC director.
A second vote, which passed 6-4, encourages parents to discuss using serology testing, a type of blood test that measures antibodies to gauge how well a patient’s immune system has responded to a disease, before allowing their children to receive additional doses of the hepatitis B vaccine.
The changed recommendations will not prevent doctors from administering hepatitis B vaccines to newborns, but may impact which insurance companies are willing to pay for the immunizations. Children enrolled in Medicaid or the Vaccines for Children program, which provides free immunizations to children who are uninsured or underinsured, will continue to be eligible for hepatitis B vaccines at birth under the new recommendations, according to program liaisons.",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_1921-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-05 13:58:30.203850

(Photo courtesy of Paige McAtee.)GREAT FALLS —On Nov. 13,  26 year-old Dakota Wheeler pulled into the parking lot of his workplace, Rainbow Senior Living in Great Falls, to drop a friend off for his upcoming shift. The two sat in the car for a few moments, watching videos on their phones, when a silver Dodge Charger pulled up beside them. 
“They came out immediately with guns,” said Brycen Pickering, Wheeler’s friend and coworker. “They kept yelling, ‘Get out of the car! Get out of the car!’” 
Pickering said Wheeler didn’t immediately move from the car, because he didn’t understand what was happening. 
“He kept asking, ‘What’s going on? What’s wrong?’ They were shouting something about warrants, but Dakota doesn’t have any warrants,” Pickering said.  
When asked if officers ever identified themselves, Pickering said they did not. The surveillance footage released by Rainbow Senior Living, shows agents approaching the vehicle with guns drawn.
“They had vests on that said ‘Police,’ that’s all. The car had no markings on it. It could have been anybody,” he said. “And it’s hard to concentrate on anything else when there’s pistols pointed at you and your good friend in the car.”
 A Home in Great Falls 

Wheeler has been in Montana since he was 15, brought to the United States on a visitor’s visa from England with his mother. The visa expired in the spring of 2016, and Wheeler has been trying ever since to finish the naturalization process. The main factor in the way, according to his 20-weeks pregnant fiance, Paige McAtee, has been money. 
“It’s at least $10,000 to get everything situated,” said McAtee. “People can’t even make it on minimum wage as it is. And with our 2-year-old daughter it was, pay bills, feed her, get diapers, and then try to save $10,000.” 
Wheeler has worked at Rainbow Senior Living for eight years. His mother, Lisa Anderson, is the Business Office Director, and remembers the cost when she first came to America. 
“When I went through my immigration, it was $6,500,” said Anderson, emphasizing the process took about three years to complete from start to finish. 
On the day Wheeler was taken, McAtee spent hours trying to find him, calling local police, the sheriff, the U.S. Marshals, and the county jail, none of whom had any record of him. It wasn’t until after she went with Wheeler’s mother and stepfather to the federal courthouse to speak to U.S. Marshals in person, that they were able to make some progress on his whereabouts.
“We got a call later finding out that he was taken by Immigrations and Customs Enforcement,” confirmed McAtee. 
The following day, after researching similar cases, his family located a petition for a restraining order against ICE and filed it that afternoon. Within two hours a federal judge granted it, ordering that Dakota could not be removed from Montana, must have access to counsel, and had to receive proper legal process.
  Federal Inmates as Revenue 

Wheeler is currently being held at the Cascade County Jail, along with 11 other immigration detainees at the time of publication of this article. Unlike other jails in the state, Cascade County has a unique federal contract that allows it to hold immigration detainees longer than 72 hours, a practice Cascade County Sheriff Jesse Slaughter emphasizes is not new. 
“When we signed our marshal contract back in 2021, ICE was delineated on that contract,” explained Slaughter. “And that meant that we would hold anybody that the marshals want us to hold, including ICE detainees, basically making us a federal detention facility.”
The Cascade County Jail is utilized by a variety of agencies, including Great Falls Police Department, the Sheriff’s office, Montana Highway Patrol, the Great Falls pre-release center and more. Each of these agencies holds a specific contract to house inmates at the jail. 
Depending on the contract, the agency will pay anywhere from the state rate of $82 per bed per day, to $115 per bed per day. 
The marshal contract covers all federal agencies, such as the FBI, DEA, IRS, even the EPA. The county recently signed a separate contract with Customs and Border Protection (CBP). 
In a July meeting of the Cascade County Commissioners, Slaughter explained the need for these federal contracts, spotlighting the jail’s reliance on outside contracts for 70% of its $14 million annual budget. Only $4 million of the jail’s budget is covered by taxpayers. 
In June of this year, Cascade County sent out what is called a “white paper” to open negotiations to have a standalone contract with ICE that would pay more in revenue compared to the current marshal contract that already requires Cascade County to hold immigration detainees. 
The county never heard back on the inquiry. 
“In a perfect world you’d levy $5, $6 million and you would kick all your feds out and you’d drop your population by about 140 (people) a day. You would be a fully funded community,” said Slaughter. “So I’d have a smaller operation that would be smaller in the long term to the taxpayer.” 
Until such a levy is passed, however, the county has few options.
“I struggle to think now’s the time to ask for it,” said Slaughter. “But hey, this is what we’re up against.”
In the meantime, Wheeler’s family awaits his Dec. 10 hearing. McAtee has started a GoFundMe page, where they’re raising funds not only for Wheeler’s current legal fees, but also for the $10,000 required to complete the naturalization process. 
“Today I had my 20-week ultrasound,” said McAtee. “Lisa came with me, but he’s been there for every single OB appointment. That was hard going there without him. Everything has changed because he’s always been there, he’s always been such a constant in our lives.” 
Their two year old daughter, Cleo, wants him home more than anyone.
“He’s always at work from six to two, so she’s good in the morning,” said McAtee. “And then dinner comes and nighttime is horrible because she just screams for him. She looks for him. And I don’t know what to tell her.”
“And with a baby on the way,” McAtee continued, “he’s super excited, he’s the one who picked out the name. He loves being a dad. We just want him home.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Wheeler-family-1024x769.jpg,,,2025-12-05 13:58:30.203850

Gabriel Olivier describes himself as an evangelical preacher and alleges the city of Brandon, a suburb in the Jackson Metro area, improperly restricted his religious and free-speech rights. 
But lower courts have ruled a legal quirk may prevent him from challenging the city’s regulations in court.

Olivier also frequently protested outside Mississippi’s only abortion clinic before it closed in 2022 after the U.S. Supreme Court, using a Mississippi case, overturned abortion rights nationwide. In 2021, Olivier stood outside the Brandon amphitheater, a popular concert venue, waving posters with pictures of aborted fetuses, passing out fliers and using a loudspeaker to get his message out.
Police in Brandon arrested Olivier and charged him with breaking a recently passed city ordinance that confined protests to a designated area near the theater. Olivier pleaded no contest to the charges, received a fine, and was placed on probation.
After Olivier pleaded no contest to the charges, he filed a civil lawsuit against the city seeking to overturn its protest ordinances. But a prior Supreme Court precedent, Heck v. Humphrey, places strict limits on when criminal defendants can file civil rights lawsuits that relate to their conviction. 
The city of Brandon in court papers argues its regulations aren’t about the content of the speech, but rather about limiting disturbances caused when he and his group yelled insults such as “Jezebel,” “nasty,” and “drunkards” at people passing by.
A district court and the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against Olivier and sided with the city, but the Supreme Court will have the final say.

While the Virginia Freedom of Information Act presumes all government business is by default public and requires officials to justify why exceptions should be made, too many Virginia leaders in practice take the opposite stance, acting as if records are by default private and the public must prove they should be handled otherwise.
In this feature, we aim to highlight the frequency with which officials around Virginia are resisting public access to records on issues large and small — and note instances when the release of information under FOIA gave the public insight into how government bodies are operating.
  Locations of hundreds of Flock cameras in Hampton Roads revealed

In late November a federal judge in Norfolk released the location of about 600 Flock Safety security cameras in the region, the Virginian Pilot reported. The release comes after local cities and counties have rejected requests from media and activists for lists of camera locations. 
U.S. Magistrate Judge Lawrence Leonard ordered the regional list be unsealed as part of a pending federal lawsuit against Norfolk. It’s also not the first time a lawsuit has ensued in Virginia over murky access to the cameras. A Cardinal News reporter drove 300 miles through Southwest Virginia and submitted requests to see captured footage of their drive — ultimately taking localities to court over the matter.
Flock cameras are a form of what is known as an automated license plate reader; the technology has been used nationwide by law enforcement to assist with investigations. However, the technology has been scrutinized, including in Virginia, for potential law enforcement overreach and for privacy concerns. 
As the cameras proliferate across the commonwealth, state lawmakers passed a new law this year to regulate the technology by setting limits on data storage time frames and other guardrails, but it was heavily debated and nearly defeated along its journey to become law.
 Martinsville fulfills a FOIA, with heavy redactions

Cardinal News sought information on a misconduct investigation against Martinsville’s former city manager via a Freedom of Information Act request — but the document the city responded with was almost entirely redacted. 
Martinsville City Council was split in their votes on whether or not to release the investigation to the public earlier this year, following the completion of the probe led by law firm Sands Anderson. The heavily redacted documents are one of three versions of the report to circulate within city hall and to councilors.
 A less redacted version was given to councilors and that version was what Cardinal had requested, but the city’s FOIA officer instead gave the newsroom the version with much of the content edited out.
 Alexandria’s school board may create a website to boost transparency

Alexandria’s school board is considering creating its own website in order to boost transparency, ALX Now reported.
The site would include two posts per month at a minimum and up to 35 posts per month. Content would be topical explainers on key decisions made by the board, information under review by the board that is not confidential, along with board members’ statements as well as vote results and progress updates on matters the board is working on. 
“According to a draft proposal, Board Chair Michelle Rief would designate two board members to be co-editors to manage content, and that all content not republished from the Alexandria City Public Schools website would have to be approved by the school system’s attorney before publication,” ALX Now wrote.
The board would  review the website’s policy annually, if it comes to fruition.



The Mercury’s efforts to track FOIA and other transparency cases in Virginia are indebted to the work of the Virginia Coalition for Open Government, a nonprofit alliance dedicated to expanding access to government records, meetings and other state and local proceedings. 


 State senator’s FOIA shed more light on on former UVA president’s departure 

State senator Creigh Deeds, D-Charlottesville, received a more than 200-page response to a Freedom of Information Act request he sent last month seeking more details about former University of VIrignia president Jim Ryan’s resignation. 
Deeds then gave the details to UVA student newspaper Cavalier Daily, which had also submitted FOIAs on the matter but had not received records. 
Among the details Deeds gleaned were community announcements surrounding Ryan’s resignation, letters from the Justice Department and previously unreleased records like text messages and emails between Board of Visitors members and Ryan’s initial resignation letter. 
Ryan’s departure from UVA made local, state and national headlines this year amid pressure from President Donald Trump’s administration, which has targeted public universities’ Diversity, Equity and Inclusion policies this year.

“I’d like to thank Secretary Turner for taking the time to come to Marygrove and the opportunity to share my vision with respect to affordable housing in Detroit,” Sheffield said in a press release. “I’ve spent my entire career advocating for strong neighborhoods that contain diverse housing options for every Detroiter, from transitional to affordable to market rate.”
“As Detroit’s next mayor, my first priority is to ensure our city has the resources we need to improve the quality of life for all Detroiters, to expand housing opportunities for renters and new homeowners, and to build on the progress we’ve made as a city over the past decade,” she continued. “I will continue to work with our partners on the state and federal level, Democrats and Republicans, to ensure Detroit can rise higher.”
Turner told reporters after the meeting that federal government intervention is not the solution on certain issues, including redevelopment of the General Motors Renaissance Center in downtown Detroit, Axios Detroit reported. 
“I think she has a great vision,” Turner added. “She’s a pioneer of sorts, and so we look forward to working with her for the people of Detroit.”
Turner and the department of Housing and Urban Development have recently come under fire, including in a lawsuit filed by Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel and 22 other state leaders, for changes made to a funding program that has historically allowed state and local governments to put money towards permanent housing solutions. 
The department, under the current administration, has also pushed to limit the scope of public housing and housing voucher programs. Housing advocates have warned that changes like these could exacerbate homelessness and make it harder for state and local governments to address it.

(Perry Bennett | West Virginia Legislative Photography)As the question of whether West Virginia will allow religious and philosophical exemptions to its school vaccination requirements works its way through the courts, health committee leaders for both the House of Delegates and Senate say they’re not planning bills to change the requirements during the upcoming 2026 session.  
Senate Health Committee Chair Laura Chapman, R-Wheeling, said legislation about vaccines should come from the House of Delegates next session. During the 2025 session, the Senate passed a religious exemption bill, but the measure failed in the House. 
“This issue is not going away. However, I don’t think it’s necessarily the best use of time to bring this issue up on the Senate side again, because we’ve proven that we care about constitutional rights and can pass the bill,” Chapman told West Virginia Watch. “So from my perspective, I think a bill needs to come from the House if it will pass this session.”
Del. Evan Worrell, R-Cabell, chair of the House Health Committee, said a vaccine exemption bill is not his personal priority, and hasn’t been the focus of conversations with other lawmakers about the upcoming legislative session. 
“It’s not a priority of mine personally, to push through a vaccine exemption bill, especially in light of everything that’s going on through the court system,” Worrell said. “But if the caucus and or the committee, the majority of members feel that that’s something we need to take a look at, we need to take up, then we’ll do it.”
While she doesn’t plan to introduce the legislation, Chapman said she’d support a bill that would codify religious exemptions. 
“All of our surrounding states allow for religious exemption,” she said. “We allow our West Virginia children to play sports against kids from Kentucky and Pennsylvania, and we don’t require vaccines for those kids. And so really it’s a fundamental issue because it’s a constitutional issue, but we’re also not fairly treating children the same because we do allow them to play sports with kids who may or may not be vaccinated.”
State lawmakers have tried for years to water down the state’s strict school vaccine mandates. West Virginia does not allow children whose families object to the shots on religious or philosophical grounds to opt out of school vaccine requirements.
During the 2024 legislative session, lawmakers passed legislation that would have allowed private and parochial schools to have their own vaccine requirements and exempted students attending virtual schools from school mandated vaccinations, but Former Gov. Jim Justice vetoed the bill.
In January, on his second day in office, Gov. Patrick Morrisey issued an executive order requiring the state to allow religious exemptions. The governor’s executive order remains in effect even though lawmakers rejected Senate Bill 460, which would have codified the religious exemption. The executive order is based on the Equal Protection for Religion Act of 2023, a religious freedom bill. The state Board of Education advised county boards not to accept religious exemptions. 
The issue has been the subject of lawsuits around the state. Raleigh County Circuit Judge Michael Froble last week issued a ruling enjoining the state Department of Education and the Raleigh County board of education from enforcing the school’s vaccination rules on any family that’s sought a religious exemption to the requirements based on the state’s religious freedom bill. The Supreme Court stayed that decision, and the state education officials have reinstated its policy of not accepting religious exemptions.
In comments about the Supreme Court action this week, a spokesperson for Morrisey hinted at the possibility of legislation concerning the issue.
“Whether we prevail in the courts or prevail with the legislature, West Virginia will ultimately join the other 45 states that protect and defend religious liberty and will no longer be such an outlier on vaccine policy,” Morrisey Press Secretary Drew Galang said. 
Worrell said there are plans for legislative changes related to the state’s application for the federal Rural Health Transformation Program, and he’s looking into more legislation to align with the Make American Healthy Again agenda. No one is “clamoring” to take up vaccines again this year, probably because the issue is tied up in court, Worrell said.
“We’ve got so many issues with our child welfare system,” he said. “You’ve seen articles about even a local school in my area that does psychiatric residential treatment closing down. We had one happen in Charleston. We’ve got issues with the PATH system. I mean, there are a lot of problems, as you’re well aware. 
“I feel like my first year as health chair got bogged down on certificate of need and vaccines,” Worrell said.  “And this next session, I’m not going to let that happen again. Other priorities fell by the wayside because of it.”
Senate President Randy Smith, R-Preston, and House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, R-Clay, did not return a request to comment for this story.  
While Worrell said the legislation won’t be his priority, other Republican delegates said they’ll introduce vaccine legislation. 
Del. Kathie Hess Crouse, R-Putnam, said she’d prefer the state prohibiting vaccine mandates altogether, but she plans to at least introduce a bill adding religious and philosophical exemptions.  
“Parents should always have the option to turn down a medical procedure like that, which it is a procedure. It’s getting a shot, a vaccine,” Crouse said. “If it’s something that affects their child’s health, they should have the option, with informed consent, on what they choose to do.” 
Crouse said she’s also working on a bill that would require school board members, school faculty and staff to have the same vaccines that are required for students, unless there are expanded exemptions for students and to limit school travel to areas that have the same vaccination laws as West Virginia. 
Most states require students attending school be vaccinated for a series of infectious diseases like measles, polio and whooping cough.This year, Idaho officials passed a bill that prohibits all vaccine mandates, including those for school students. Florida officials have also announced plans to end vaccine mandates.
The action comes as cases of vaccine preventable illnesses are on the rise. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 46 measles outbreaks have been reported in 2025, up from 16 last year. Measles cases have been reported in 43 jurisdictions this year, not including West Virginia. 
In 2024, West Virginia reported its first measles case in 15 years. Health experts have attributed the strict vaccination laws with limiting disease outbreaks. Cases of pertussis, commonly referred to as whooping cough, have increased in West Virginia this year. In neighboring Kentucky, three infants have died of the disease this year. 
Del. Chris Anders, R-Berkeley, said he plans to again support a bill to eliminate vaccine mandates. Anders was a co-sponsor of a similar bill earlier this year that was introduced but went nowhere. 
“No government official, no politician and no bureaucrat should be able to tell you what you have to shoot into your own body,” he said. “That’s just absolutely immoral, and it violates the core principles of individual liberty.”
The 60-day legislative session starts Wednesday, Jan. 14, 2026.

Putney’s educational legacy is something Vermonters can be proud of. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Tyler Baker: Why Putney is an epicenter of progressive education in America.","Tyler Baker is an assistant professor of history at Landmark College in Putney. He is the author of a forthcoming history of Landmark College, published by the University of Vermont Press.



Putney is, on the surface, another rural Southeastern Vermont town, but there is more going on in the town than meets the eye — and has been for nearly a century.  The dirt roads, the rolling hills, and the single general store — they do not give the impression of a place that would reshape American education.
And yet, for nearly a century, Putney has been home to an extraordinary concentration of experimental schools and institutions that have had an outsized role in how Americans learn, teach and imagine the purpose of education. 
I imagine some Vermonters, and most longtime locals, know bits and pieces of the story.  Fewer know just how interconnected it really is — or how much the identity of the village was, and is, forged by a deep, almost stubborn commitment to educational innovation. 
It began with The Putney School in the 1930s, one of the earliest American schools built around progressive ideals: experiential learning, farm-based education, democratic governance and a belief in the social value of the arts. Hickory Ridge School followed, incorporating anti-war activism and cooperative living into its curriculum.
The Experiment in International Living brought global immersion and cultural exchange programs into the village, long before “study abroad” became a standard line in college brochures. Antioch University’s Graduate School of Education incorporated an additional dimension, training generations of teachers to rethink teaching beyond what traditional expectation
But the most dramatic chapter happened on a hill overlooking town, where the former Windham College campus now houses Landmark College. 
When Windham closed in 1978, the campus fell into disrepair. The residents of Putney had reason to be worried. Several proposals were floated for the 125-acre property, none of which sat well with the town — understandably.
One proposal would have turned the site into a facility for Cuban anti-Castro refugees. Another plan would have made it a federal prison. A third proposal involved the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi organization, which sought to transform the campus into a Transcendental Meditation university.
Each time, Putney residents organized and pushed back. They understood something simple, yet vital: whatever moved onto the outside of town would shape Putney’s future for decades to come. 
When Landmark College arrived in 1985, the match between institution and town felt almost inevitable, at least in hindsight.
Landmark was the first college in the country created explicitly for students with learning differences — particularly dyslexia — at a time when most colleges did not know how to accommodate, much less fully educate, students with non-typical learning profiles. The college’s founding represented the latest evolution of the same educational impulse that animated Putney for decades: a commitment to redesigning learning from the ground up. 
Over four decades, Landmark has expanded its mission to serve students with ADHD, autism, executive-function challenges and other learning profiles. What has remained constant is the college’s core belief that students should not be seen as exceptions in need of accommodation, but as whole individuals whose strengths, challenges and learning styles should shape pedagogy itself. In other words: difference is not a disruption to education — it is a foundation for it. 
Putney, quietly and consistently, created the conditions where Landmark could thrive. The college did not sprout from apathetic citizenry. Landmark’s history is tied to the town’s long-standing willingness to support models of education that diverge from the mainstream. 
That belief matters now more than ever. Vermont, like the rest of the country, is addressing difficult conversations about retention, mental health, accessibility and the purpose of higher education.  Students who learn differently are enrolling in college at higher rates than at any time in our nation’s history. Disability services offices are overwhelmed. Colleges are struggling to retrofit systems that were never designed for the students they now serve. 
But in Putney, a working model has existed for decades. Landmark shows what’s possible when accessibility is designed into an institution from the start — when pedagogy, advising, campus culture and student life are built around human variation rather than standardized expectations. 
And it also matters that this is not just a Landmark story. It is a Vermont story. 
It is a story about a town that repeatedly chose education over expediency. It is about residents who asked what kind of community they wanted to become, and who recognized that what happens on a campus also happens to the surrounding town. It is a story about a place where innovation was not a buzzword; it was, and continues to be, a civic value. 
Putney’s educational legacy is something Vermonters can be proud of.  In a rural corner of the state, generations of educators, students, activists and community members built — and protected — a tradition of progressive education that continues to shape lives far beyond the town’s boundaries.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-05 17:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,The burden of student debt is transforming education,Collin Jefferson,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/05/the-burden-of-student-debt-is-transforming-education/,"Rising debt makes higher education less about ability and more about affordability, reducing opportunity and diversity on campuses.","What if I told you the only way you can get your college degree is by spending the next 20 years paying off the debt to attend that school. Would you still go? 
Many people I know need to achieve that dream of walking across a stage and receiving a diploma to put themselves in a better position in life. However, that dream comes with a price tag now. A price tag that is so big at times that these people that I know have to give up on their dreams. 



It has gotten to the point where higher education to earn a good paying job seems to be an unreachable luxury. Many kids who have a passion to pursue a certain career after high school cannot because they are too poor to reach a higher level of education. This makes higher education less about ability and more about affordability, reducing opportunity and diversity on campuses. 
Even for those who make it to college, rising tuition widens the gap between students from wealthy families and those from low-income backgrounds. Many talented students must work long hours while studying, leaving them less time to focus on academics and extracurricular activities. The rise in cost takes away time from campus events and functions that students can attend during some downtime to get a leisure activity in. 
In my personal experience as a student athlete, not only am I a full-time student that must prepare and study for class, but I also must prepare and train for my sport while also taking up a part-time job at the school. Balancing sport, school, and the mindset of making enough money to stay in school comfortably leads to lack in performance and mental health.

The issue of debt doesn’t just affect individual students. The issue of student debt affects entire communities and the country’s economy. When young people are forced to take out massive loans, they end up delaying important milestones like buying a home, starting a family, or even beginning a business. Instead of contributing to economic growth, they spend years trapped in a repayment cycle. 
Furthermore, many students who start college but cannot keep up with tuition end up dropping out, leaving them with debt but no degree to show for it. This cycle creates long-term financial stress and limits upward mobility for millions of Americans.
The constant rise in tuition makes college feel less like an opportunity to learn and more like a business transaction. The cost of education discourages students from pursuing degrees in fields that truly interest them. Instead, many choose careers that simply offer higher salaries, rather than following their passions or pursuing work that benefits society. This means a lack of teachers, social workers, and artists. which are professions that shape communities and culture. When education becomes only about survival and not personal growth, society loses creativity and compassion. Schools should focus on helping students succeed, not just on making profits.
Colleges often justify tuition increases by pointing to improved facilities, technology, or campus programs, but those benefits mean little if fewer students can afford to experience them. Education should be a right, not a privilege reserved for the wealthy. If the goal of higher education is to prepare the next generation of thinkers, leaders, and innovators, then it must be made accessible to all who are willing to work hard for it.
Overall, the growing cost of college is transforming education, which is supposed to be a pathway to open doors, into a barrier that limits success for many hardworking students. Colleges and policymakers need to find solutions to make higher education more accessible and affordable. 
Expanding need-based scholarships, increasing state funding for public universities, and controlling unnecessary fees could help ease the cost that gives many students an untenable burden. Investing in education benefits everyone by creating a stronger, more skilled population that can achieve a career after their time in college to help boost the economy and quality of life in our country. 
If tuition continues to rise unchecked, fewer students will be able to achieve their educational goals, and the nation will lose out on the talent and innovation that come from diverse backgrounds filled with motivated graduates who still have so much potential left to reach.

The city is one of three in the state's southwestern-most county that received nine years of taxpayer money meant for the local hospital. (Photo by Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — People in one of Kansas’ southernmost counties noticed in 2014 their local hospital was struggling, so they voted to create a sales tax that would direct funds to keep their health care system afloat.
In the decade that followed, the Morton County hospital only received about half of the sales tax revenue it was owed, missing out on nearly $2 million.
The cities of Morton County received the money instead.
The Kansas Department of Revenue, for nine years, sent checks to Elkhart, population 1,726; Rolla, population 356; and Richfield, population 30, and the cities spent that money.
David Thompson, the county attorney, told a committee of legislators Tuesday in Topeka the clerical error that led to the misappropriated funds “was just an oversight — an accident.”
Rep. Ken Rahjes, a Republican from Agra, called the situation “head-scratching.”
Sen. Rick Kloos, a Berryton Republican, wondered how the cities didn’t realize they had extra money in their coffers for so many years.
“It just bewilders me how you can have that kind of money coming in that long of a period of time and somebody didn’t recognize,” Kloos said.
Thompson pitched the committee on forcing the state to pay the $1.9 million in lost revenue, without interest, to make the hospital whole.
But finger-pointing preempted solutions and the root of the problem.
“The county’s position is this is Department of Revenue’s mess,” said Thompson, who is also the Elkhart city attorney, “and we’ve already spent a lot of time and effort trying to clean this up.”

Rick Kloos, back left, asks Morton County attorney David Thompson, right, during a Dec. 2, 2025, committee hearing in Topeka, Kansas, how three cities went nine years without realizing state checks weren’t meant for them. (Kansas Reflector screen capture of Kansas Legislature YouTube channel)
When the Morton County Commission put the voter-approved sales tax on ballots, it cited the law incorrectly. It used a statute’s subparagraph 1, a general tax provision, instead of subparagraph 5, which is dedicated to health care facilities. Under the first section, retail sales tax revenue should be distributed proportionally between a county and its cities. Under the fifth, revenue should be sent to a county, which then spends it on the health care facility.
The commissioners realized their error soon after ballots were cast. Before the retail sales tax became law in 2015, they passed a series of ordinances to try to fix it.
But the revenue department adhered to the initial iteration of the ballot measure, doling out about half of the countywide sales tax revenue to the county and the other half to its cities. The money went into the cities’ general funds. The mayor of Elkhart did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Thompson acknowledged the county made a mistake. But it corrected that mistake, he said.
Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach issued a nonbinding opinion in May that affirmed Morton County’s stance, concluding the will of the voters was to direct all sales tax revenues to the county hospital.
“The question here is whether the electors of Morton County understood what their vote meant on the ballot proposal,” Kobach wrote. “We believe they did.”
The county’s resolutions, formal election notices and the ballot question indicate that voters were aware they were being asked whether they wanted to fund the hospital through a sales tax, Kobach said.
Since Kobach’s opinion, monthly checks containing the full revenues have been delivered to the Morton County Hospital. They total about $36,000, Thompson said.
Richard Adams, who has been CEO of the hospital since August, said the recent checks doubled the previous amounts.
He said that money helps with overhead, operating costs and recruiting staff in an environment where rural hospitals across Kansas ride thin margins. All rural hospitals are struggling, said Adams, who was the hospital’s chief financial officer for two and half years before retiring and then returning to take the CEO role.
Hospitals vie for the same nurses and field the same cuts in Medicaid reimbursements. He said when a hospital disappears, a town tends to dry up.
“It feels like we’re just being squeezed from all directions,” he said.
He credits the local support of the hospital for keeping it afloat. It is the county’s largest employer, according to Thompson.
The recent increase in sales tax revenue provides a cushion. A $36,000 monthly check isn’t monumental, Adams said, but carrying that over 12 months makes a marked difference.
“From the hospital’s standpoint, if the funds were designated for the hospital and they were diverted or put somewhere else, then, yes, whoever made the mistake should own up and then the hospital should be compensated or made whole,” Adams said.
The revenue department has argued Morton County could seek reimbursement from the cities rather than the state.
“For me, the issue really goes back to what happened in 2015,” said Ted Smith, chief counsel for the state revenue department, at the Tuesday legislative hearing.
“And really was it a clerical error?” he said.
The department’s position, Smith said, is that the matter is “a little more substantial than that.”
He said the commissioners’ initial ordinance “sort of tied the department of revenue’s hands.” He argued the department doesn’t have the authority to assume the will of the voters and the county should have taken the matter to court.
Instead, Smith said, “I think both parties just sort of shrugged their shoulders.”
The legislative committee, which handles claims against the state, did not order the county to be reimbursed. Lawmakers voted to send the issue on to another committee, which could take it up in the 2026 legislative session that begins in January.
However, Rep. Marty Long, a Ulysses Republican whose district encompasses Morton County, said he will wait to take direction from the county commissioners. He said in an interview he plans to attend the commission’s regular meeting Monday, at which point he could decide whether to pursue legislation.
He said he has questions that need answered.
“I don’t like to look for fault in these kinds of things, but there was probably either a miscommunication or something happened,” Long said. “I haven’t gotten to the bottom of it yet.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/downtownElkhart-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-05 12:57:44.689173

With the Dec. 8 candidate filing deadline fast approaching, the high court’s decision likely means Texas’ new map will be used for the 2026 midterm elections.
Justice Samuel Alito ruled that it was “indisputable” that Texas’ motivation for redistricting was “pure and simple” partisan advantage, which the court has previously ruled is permissible. Alito rejected the argument that Texas had engaged in racial gerrymandering.

The ruling is a major win for Republicans in Texas and nationally. President Donald Trump had pushed Texas to redraw its map over the summer, hoping to secure five additional GOP seats to shore up the party’s narrow majority in the U.S. House through the midterms.
On Nov. 18, two federal judges barred Texas from using the new map for 2026, saying there was evidence state lawmakers had racially gerrymandered in redrawing the lines. Galveston District Judge Jeffrey Brown, a Trump appointee, authored the opinion ordering Texas to return to its 2021 map, while 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Jerry Smith vociferously dissented.
The state asked the Supreme Court to overturn Brown’s ruling entirely, but that could take weeks or months to proceed through the court system, especially if the justices decide they want to hear arguments in Washington, D.C. With Thursday’s ruling, the justices have temporarily paused Brown’s ruling while that longer legal process can play out.
The ruling said the lower court, under Brown, “improperly inserted itself into an active primary campaign, causing much confusion and upsetting the delicate federal-state balance in elections.”
The new map, approved by the Texas Legislature and signed by Gov. Greg Abbott in August, is engineered to give Republicans control of 30 of the state’s 38 congressional districts, up from the 25 they currently hold under the 2021 map. Numerous Republican candidates have stepped forward to run in the newly favorable districts, while several Democratic incumbents were pushed into nearby districts already occupied by another Democrat, forcing them to contemplate primaries or retire.
Brown’s ruling upended those calculations. But in restoring the new map, the Supreme Court likely ensured that Republicans running for redrawn districts will get to campaign under the new lines in 2026.
Attorney General Ken Paxton celebrated the ruling, saying it was a win for Texas and every conservative who is tired of watching the left try to upend the political system with bogus lawsuits.”
Texas Democrats, meanwhile, condemned the outcome, with House Democratic Caucus Chair Rep. Gene Wu of Houston saying the high court had “failed” Texans.
“This is what the end of the Voting Rights Act looks like: courts that won’t protect minority communities even when the evidence is staring them in the face,” Wu said.
In her dissent, Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan criticized the court for reversing Brown’s 160-page ruling “based on its perusal, over a holiday weekend, of a cold paper record.”
“Today’s order disrespects the work of a District Court that did everything one could ask to carry out its charge,” Kagan wrote on behalf of the liberal justices. “Today’s order disserves the millions of Texans whom the District Court found were assigned to their new districts based on their race.”

But since then, only 80 elective abortions have been performed in the state. Thousands of Missourians had to seek care out of state. 
This is the reality until a trial plays out next year to determine which of Missouri’s anti-abortion laws violate a voter-approved reproductive health care constitutional amendment passed last year — and which can remain in place. 
“It’s hard to hear after we’ve had the vote,” Emily Wales, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Plains said. “Even knowing that the case really is moving at a wild speed and that we are pushing for trial as quickly as possible.”
Looming on the horizon is another statewide vote on abortion. Republican lawmakers placed a new constitutional amendment on the 2026 ballot that would ban nearly all abortions in the state, with limited exceptions for survivors and for medical emergencies. 
Abortion may be legal again in Missouri, but for most patients, it’s not yet within reach. 
Decades of restrictions have gutted the state’s provider network. Now, Planned Parenthood is the only option. And medication abortion — the method most people previously relied on — is still unavailable as the courts sort through which old laws conflict with the new constitutional amendment.
Some abortion-right advocates say this was all inevitable, arguing the amendment approved by voters last year didn’t go far enough. Others push back, saying access can’t be restored overnight even under the best circumstances. 
“It takes time to rebuild infrastructure that was decimated over decades,” said Mallory Schwarz, executive director of Abortion Action Missouri.
Signs lean against the wall at the Planned Parenthood in St. Louis’ Central West End (Anna Spoerre/Missouri Independent).
It leaves activists on both sides of the abortion debate asking how best to move forward when so much is in flux. 
“If you want an abortion, you want to make that call now. You don’t want to have to wait and see what the state might do to interrupt your care,” Wales said. “And Missourians are thinking about that. When they call us, they are asking, ‘Is care really going to be available and what might happen,’ which is almost impossible for us to say.”
Between January and October, there were 80 in-clinic abortion procedures in Missouri across Planned Parenthood clinics in Kansas City, Columbia and St. Louis, according to data from the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services.
An additional 79 abortions were performed in Missouri hospitals. All were marked as being medical emergencies when reported to the health department.
State Sen. Mary Elizabeth Coleman, who helped pass Missouri’s trigger law that banned abortion in 2022, questioned whether the national donors who bankrolled the passage of the abortion-rights amendment last year will open up their checkbooks again to fight the proposed ban next year. 
In 2024, anti-abortion groups were outspent six to one.
“They spent $30 million for 80 abortions. Are they going to do that again? I don’t know,” said Coleman, an Arnold Republican. “We’re a bad place to invest if you are part of the national pro-abortion movement because we’re not going to stop and we’re going to continue and we’re more unified than we used to be.” 
 Rebuilding infrastructure

To say Julie Burkhart knows something about running an abortion clinic in a hostile environment is an understatement. 
Burkhart worked for Dr. George Tiller’s abortion clinic in Wichita, Kansas, when an anti-abortion activist fatally shot Tiller in 2009. More than a decade later, Burkhardt opened an abortion clinic in Wyoming in spite of the state’s abortion ban.
She is also co-owner of Hope Clinic, a private abortion provider in Granite City, Illinois, located a 15 minute drive northeast of downtown St. Louis. Between 2019 and 2022, the numbers of Missourians making the short trek to her clinic more than tripled. 
The year Tiller was murdered, 6,881 abortions were performed in Missouri, according to state health department data. By 2021, there were only 151. 
In 2024, it’s estimated 7,780 Missourians traveled to Illinois and 3,960 traveled to Kansas to access abortion, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive rights research group.
In Missouri, in what used to be a network of private and non-profit abortion clinics, Planned Parenthood now stands alone. 
“ When we have clinics closing because of government hostility, it’s not an abstract function. It’s not theoretical,” Burkhart said. “What that does is that puts more pressure on real people who are just trying to live their lives, make the best decisions about their lives, the lives of children that they might already have.”
Last year, Planned Parenthood Great Rivers, which is based in St. Louis and operates clinics in the metro area and in the Ozarks, announced the closure of three locations in North St. Louis County, south St. Louis city and Joplin in order to expand telehealth services.

This year, at least 45 Planned Parenthood clinics around the country have shuttered, many due to the ban on abortion providers receiving Medicaid reimbursements. 
“If you don’t have that infrastructure, then it’s just chaotic,” Burkhart said. “People are left not knowing if something’s available or not, or to what limit or not, and it’s just incredibly stressful and chaotic for patients.”
Burkhart has no plans to open an abortion clinic in Missouri, though she sees a “desperate need” for more providers. 
But if a private provider were interested in moving into Missouri, she said they would likely face challenges like finding a financial institution willing to finance them. And she’d advise waiting until after the parameters of the abortion rights amendment are fully litigated and the November vote on the abortion ban. 
“I feel like I’m painting a very grim picture,” she said. “Start-ups can be done, but I think it’s just a matter of good strategy, time and patience to navigate all those hurdles.”
Margot Riphagen, CEO and president of Planned Parenthood Great Rivers, said there is early talk of restarting abortion procedures at the other clinics she oversees (including in Rolla, Springfield, St. Peters and western St. Louis County) after the January trial offers some legal clarity.
At the Planned Parenthood clinic in St. Louis’ Central West End, abortions accounted for less than 1% of all services provided in the 2025 fiscal year ending in June. The majority of appointments were for STI screenings.
The clinic did not provide the total number of abortions it performed in the past year, but said 20% of the abortion patients came from out of state. The clinic is currently offering abortion appointments once a week for patients up to 18 weeks gestation, said spokesperson Krissy Durant.
Wales, with Planned Parenthood Great Plains, hopes for a day when abortion doesn’t rest solely on Planned Parenthood’s shoulders. 
“What I want as a Missourian and as someone who wants people to have access to their own fundamental rights is for there to be providers in every single community who have patients in the waiting room who are there to get obstetrical care or regular checkups or wellness visits or abortion care,” she said, “ … That is what real access to abortion looks like. The challenge we have, though, is getting to that point of normalizing care and having providers feel safe enough to do it.”

Robin Frisella, community engagement director for Missouri Abortion Fund, said conversations about rebuilding access often neglect strategies to fund abortion. 
“When you fund abortion, you are funding the immediate needs of abortion seekers right now,” she said. “You don’t have to wait for elections. You don’t have to wait for amendments to pass to make a real difference in abortion access.”
Missouri law prevents private insurance companies from covering any abortion costs. Federal law bans the use of federal funds, such as Medicaid. 
The average cost of an abortion in the first trimester is about $600, Frisella said. Abortions later in pregnancy can cost upwards of $10,000.
So far in 2025, the fund has paid for out-of-state abortions for more than 1,570 Missourians. But the past few years have seen a steady decline in donations, Frisella said. 
Missouri Abortion Fund is also part of What’s Next, a group made up of reproductive justice activists and organizers who previously called for a constitutional amendment to appear on the Missouri ballot with no restrictions on abortion. 
“When amendment three is considered a win, it gives the false impression that this issue has been solved in the state,” Frisella said. “What a win looks like for abortion access is not limited appointment availability.”
 Republican response

In October, former Missouri Republican Gov. Mike Parson stood before a room of Missouri Baptists and warned they may be facing their “last chance” to remove abortion rights from the Missouri constitution. 
“If we don’t get it done this time,” Parson cautioned, “you’ll be fighting this issue for a long, long time.” 
State Rep. Brian Seitz was in the crowd. 
“Society in general is changing,” Seitz said. “I don’t know that the ideas that some of us have, as conservatives and/or Christians, are really holding sway as much as they did 10, 20, 30 years ago.”
“If the Missouri voter says no to this one, can we run the same thing again?” Seitz said. “ I don’t think so.”
While nothing is stopping the legislature from trying again to ban abortion if next year’s vote fails, Seitz said he thinks a repeat attempt is unlikely. Instead, he said, the fight would take a different form. 
He thinks the best path forward is legislation that would establish fetal personhood. This means that from the moment of conception, an embryo, and then fetus, would have full rights as an individual. This could “negate” the abortion rights amendment, he said, because abortion could then legally become classified as murder.
Rep. Brian Seitz, a Branson Republican, speaks during House debate on Feb. 11 (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications).
Coleman, the Arnold Republican senator, said if the abortion ban fails at the ballot next year, she will immediately go back to the drawing board to find a new path to restrict the procedure. 
“ This fight isn’t going to go away. I will never stop working on this, and I am one of hundreds of thousands of Missourians who will never stop fighting to protect the unborn,” Coleman said. “The idea that there is one end all be all, it’s not true.”
Legislation pre-filed by state Sen. Mike Moon, a Republican from Ash Grove, and state Rep. Burt Whaley, a Republican from Clever, seeks to charge anyone who has or performs an abortion with murder.
“Instead of protecting a culture that allows the shedding of innocent blood, we must protect preborn babies from abortion and the souls of the mothers who commit them by deterring abortions in the first place,” Whaley said in a statement. “This legislation will help us accomplish this simple directive from God.”
 ‘Changing culture’

Sam Lee, an anti-abortion lobbyist who has spent decades roaming the Missouri Capitol, has been collecting books by progressive activists on topics like environmentalism and violence. 
“They’re really instructive to me in terms of what could be done,” he said. “If we’re going to have a pro-life culture or a culture that respects life, then maybe we need to teach kids that, as opposed to just dealing with guns on one side or the other. What about just relationships? It’s an idea; we’ll see.”
Lee hopes these texts may give him some insight into how to motivate a younger population to his movement. 
“I’m talking about changing culture. Gosh, we lost by just 1.6%; such a close vote,” Lee said. “What could we have done 10 or 15 or 20 years ago, where we could have won that? It’s a legitimate question, and it’s a legitimate criticism of the pro life movement if we could have dealt with it, and we didn’t, when we were focused almost exclusively on trying to overturn Roe versus Wade.”
The question of messaging is top of mind for those on both sides of the abortion movement. 
This fall, volunteers with Abortion Action Missouri started hosting house parties to invite their friends and neighbors to talk about and learn about abortion.
Schwarz, with Abortion Action Missouri, said her organization made a conscious effort to shift toward normalizing the phrase “pro abortion” a few years ago, noting that anti-abortion groups were far more likely at the time to say the word “abortion” out loud. 
Students hold up anti-abortion signs at the Midwest March for Life on May 1, 2024, at the Missouri State Capitol (Anna Spoerre/Missouri Independent).
“How silly that we have ceded that ground to them in favor of something like choice, or women’s healthcare or reproductive healthcare,” she said. 
Schwarz said she sees the destigmatization — something crucial to winning over more support as she knocks on more doors in parts of the state that are historically more conservative and Christian.
“It is freeing. People are itching to talk about this experience, and stigma has kept them silent,” Schwarz said. “Being approached at their door or invited to a meeting, it helps people heal from the shame that they experienced themselves, and they see that they didn’t need to. 
Schwarz said putting abortion on the ballot and winning is not the end all be all. 
“The only path towards a Missouri where we’re not fighting the same attack year after year after year is one where we change the composition of the legislature,” she said. “ … “It was never sufficient for us to look at a 10 plus year plan to flip the state legislature and think we could just live under a ban during that time.”
Jamie Morris, executive director of the Missouri Catholic Conference, said the slim margins of the November 2024 vote re-energized the anti-abortion voters. 
This time around, he’s hopeful the campaign in favor of the abortion ban will be better-funded.
“ It’s easy to go back and sort of Monday morning quarterback, but we lost by 1.6%,” he said. “You don’t even need another $30 million. You just need to raise a little bit more and target in certain areas a little bit sooner than I think our side did last time.”
He also hopes part of the messaging, including what’s preached to those in pews, focuses on laws that help women choose to continue a pregnancy.
“Is it a financial issue? Is it the social safety net that we need to bolster?  Is it childcare issues?” he said. “Pick that public policy topic, but it’s all of these things that help women decide to have the child. How can we impact that and really focus on the women who feel like they have no other choice?”
For now, Missourians sit in the uneasy space between a constitutional right and the reality on the ground — a state where voters restored abortion access, but where it remains largely out of reach. 
“(Lawmakers) can sow chaos on their end,” Wales said. “We’re just going to keep organizing and coordinating and moving with one vision for Missourians to be healthier and safer and free.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_8059-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-12-05 11:58:20.621137

“We don’t have to wait for somebody to tell our own story, we can tell our own story,” said Fiona Vernal, curator of the museum and associate professor of history and director of the University of Connecticut’s Africana Studies Institute.
The West Indian Social Club was founded in 1950 as a home away from home for Caribbean farmworkers who came to Connecticut during World War II to grow tobacco.
In a state where more than 100,000 people now identify as West Indian, the new Caribbean Museum is the result of the club’s organizing, mutual aid and cultural work in Hartford as a way to preserve and keep documenting their heritage.
“Some people say the museum is an offspring of a 13- or even 18-year process,” Beverly Redd, Board of Directors’ chair of the West Indian Social Club, said. “But it really took us 75 years to get here.”

From idea to reality
In 2014, the club’s Board of Directors started brainstorming how to sustain the organization in the long run. As a result, a cultural heritage committee was formed under the leadership of Tanya Dorman, the club’s current director of compliance and regulatory services, who was serving as vice president at the time.
Dorman recalls the club’s basement and attic were full of photos, artifacts and relics of past members, club presidents and parades. Some items have been loaned to different organizations when they needed to use them for West Indian-themed exhibitions. But Dorman wanted these items to have an organized and digitized home.
“So our leadership team decided that we needed to make something of it, and I said, boy, it would be really good if we could have a museum, because we do not have a Caribbean cultural museum here,” Dorman said.
The club then got into partnership with nonprofit Education for Development and Support Network, and that was when Vernal, who had already done oral history exhibitions with the Connecticut Museum of Culture and History since the ’90s, joined the museum project.
Fast forward, Redd and Dorman created the nonprofit Caribbean Cultural Heritage Alliance to be able to accept donations to spin off the project.
“We’re building it from the ground up, without much,” Redd said.
The work Redd, Dorman and Vernal do at the club is on a volunteer basis, like the rest of the members. Outside of the club they have full-time jobs as well as families. Hence, putting together the museum became a slow but steady process that they did not want to give up on.
“I was thinking about how difficult it was for those Black Caribbean men in 1950 to come up with the idea of the organization, fund it, find a building, purchase the building, during times of segregation,” Vernal said. “I have the ghosts of these men, not in a frightening way, in an inspiring way,  reminding me that we should be able to pull this off and take it farther than they did.”

Curating the museum
Vernal had help from graphic designers, student interns and her UConn departments of Africana Studies and History, as well as contract workers ripping up the carpet, doing the electrical work, and flattening the walls, so that the room used for the museum would be ready. They also had the support and guidance of the West Indian Foundation.
“I might be the connected thread with everybody, but this project is a collaborative effort,” Vernal said.
Each of the walls in the museum has its own school program.
Accompanied by a map of the Caribbean, the first panel is called the ‘invitation’ where the curator invites attendants to engage, and learn about the West Indian migrants and their descendants’ history of mobility, organization and leadership that has transformed Hartford into a ‘Caribbean city’.
Next to the map, are the stories of the oldest members of the West Indian Social Club: Sidney Barnett and Kenneth Bennet Sr.
“It’s important to document those stories, because our older generations are dying out, and they’re taking the history with them, so how can we capture it? Here, with the museum,” Redd shared.
The oral history listening station takes place on a touchscreen where you can click on the audio recording stories from field work Vernal has done for more than 25 years.
Alongside the touchscreens, the wall is dedicated to black Caribbean organizing and leadership efforts, like Marcus Garvey, a Jamaican political activist, founder and first President-General of the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League, which had a Hartford chapter. There are archive photos of Negro World, Garvey’s newspaper which became one of the most widely distributed and influential Black newspapers in history.
The walls also display a timeline of the West Indian enclave history in Connecticut, the ‘starvation’ ship that transported the first West Indian laborers, photos of cricket and soccer teams, women’s auxiliary, the pageant and parades, which were carefully curated by Vernal and her interns.
In the past museum openings, Dorman said she heard multiple children pointing to the photos and the list of the club’s founding fathers. Dorman said they shouted  ‘that’s my grandpa’ or older adults uttered ‘that’s my auntie.’ It happened to her too, since Dorman’s father is in the photos as well.
“My own father came here as a farm worker and he has his picture and artifacts too. That’s part of the museum. My dad died before my second birthday so my soul attachment is through those artifacts”, Dorman said.
Redd wants the museum to feel like a community hub for West Indians, but also to ‘friends of the Caribbean.’ It’s a place they want all to feel welcomed, especially if they live away from home, and if they are second or third generation.
“When you leave a country like Jamaica, you leave the warmth, where you could walk outside and go get a piece of sugarcane to eat. And then you come to Hartford, and you’re lonely, you’re locked inside,” Redd said. “This space is for them and for all, ‘come on in this is your home away from home.’”

Future plans 
The museum has been open since October — every third Saturday of the month, even though they are still continuing to work on other pieces for it. 
There are some parts of the walls that are meant to have interactive activities, but they wanted to leave it to the community to decide what they want to see so there are areas where people can stick Post-its to the wall with their ideas for what they would like to see added.
Vernal hopes the museum can raise money for a complementary mural project.
“We’re looking to collaborate and partner with the school system from an educational perspective, so there will be field trips,” Dorman added.
Redd, Vernal, and Dorman said the museum can grow as long as they have funding, which has been a longtime struggle. For now, it will stay where it is.
“We’re hopeful that the museum will tell our story 150 years from today,” Redd said.

The ongoing Brain Drain series is part of that effort. You can read more about the Ideas section here.

Nearly 6,500 people have filled out our brain drain survey to date, which is more than we could have imagined when our three organizations – Mississippi Today, the University of Mississippi’s Center for Population Studies and Working Together Mississippi’s Rethink Mississippi initiative – began developing this project.
Responses have come from people living in 76 of Mississippi’s 82 counties and 48 of 50 states (looking at you, North and South Dakota). We have also received responses from Mississippi expats living in 17 countries.
The most important takeaway from the survey is obvious without even looking at the results: Many people care deeply about Mississippi’s future, even if they live far away. 
Our work is not done. We are still collecting responses, so if you haven’t taken the survey yet, we invite you to take a few minutes to fill it out now. If you have taken it but haven’t shared it with your friends and family, we’d love for you to do so. 

Take the survey

Every additional response moves us a step closer to the goal of finding solutions to the brain drain. There are many theories, but the only way to know what will actually work is for you to tell us. It doesn’t matter where you’re from or where you live now – we even want to hear from people who have never been to Mississippi. After all, Mississippi’s brain drain is the result of thousands of personal and family decisions, and each individual response tells us how our state can retain, recruit or return at least one more person.
We know that many of you have lengthier thoughts about Mississippi than could fit in the confines of the survey. We will soon start contacting people who volunteered to be interviewed to hear your stories and learn more about your ideas for making the state a place that you and others want to call home. We will also be convening community conversations around the state and in places that Mississippians have moved, so if you signed up for our mailing list, be on the lookout for information about when we will be in your area. 
Reversing the brain drain will take a collective effort, so we will make as much of the data available to the public as possible. The demographic experts at the Center for Population Studies will continue to dig into the data as it comes in, and we will release more updates ahead of a final report in the new year. All of our findings will be published through Mississippi Today and www.rethinkms.org. 
Below you’ll find an update on the results we’ve received so far. They could change as more responses come in. In fact, we hope they do – that will mean we’re reaching new people who have different priorities and perspectives. We have received responses from a diverse range of places, identities, ideologies and professions, but our current sample is whiter, more female, more highly-educated and more left-leaning than the general population. Additional responses will help us achieve a more representative snapshot and delve more deeply into specific geographies and subgroups. 
Below are select responses to just a few questions in the survey.
Describe why you stayed in Mississippi or moved back.
“This is my home. I want to make it better. My family lives here.”
“I love Mississippi and it can’t get better if everyone leaves. Investment and buy-in is very important.”
“I lived away from Mississippi during college and after college for about 15 years. I moved back to raise my children in a solidly conservative area surrounded by family and rooted in traditions of the land.”
“Despite its flaws, Mississippi is really a great place to live and raise a family.”
“I have always lived in Mississippi because I want to be near my family. I love Mississippi despite its struggles, and Mississippi has many wonderful people. Unfortunately those people aren’t the ones in charge. So our state, the poorest state in the country, cannot move forward due to the people in power.”
Describe why you moved away from Mississippi.
“I moved away because it was the only way to find a job in my field.”
“Job opportunities, access to people my age and to experience different cultures I now live in a city with walkability and access to public transit. I do not own a car and biking is my primary mode of transit which I could not do in Mississippi.”
“The people are too close minded, lack of job opportunities, poor infrastructure, poor leadership, there aren’t enough social activities, too much poverty, terrible healthcare system, high crime, poor water quality in Jackson. A lot of these issues stem from racism.”
“My politics beliefs do not align with the state, and as a result, my job prospects were slim to none in my field as I work in politics. I got my undergrad education in Mississippi but moved to pursue my masters to give me the best chance of finding a job I love.”
“Lack of economic opportunity. Lack of diversity in ideas and beliefs. Felt oppressive. Lack of access to health care and transportation.”
What ideas do you have for making your community and/or Mississippi a more attractive place to live for others?
“We have to have people stay here and be invested. We need investment to help make Jackson better. Rural health care and access HAS to improve.”
“Build the capital. For example, downtown Jackson has way too much potential for it not to be more bustling. Improve public transportation in our capital city and surrounding neighborhoods. Survey and take care of the needs of those with the least resources.”
“We have to be more accepting of all people, help people who are not able to pull themselves up due to generational poverty, and find a way to improve education in underperforming rural areas.”
“Better public access to parks and recreational areas in good repair. Mississippi has this, they should lean into it with better upkeep and advertise it.”
“Elect younger and more progressive leadership. Work with state and regional leaders as much as practical to gain benefits for Jackson.”
What state and/or local changes could encourage you to move back to Mississippi?
“Improving incentives for first time home buyers to make it more accessible and making in-state college tuition more affordable.”
“Tightening up public corruption laws so that our tax dollars actually go where they are designated.”
“More opportunities for professional jobs. I think the state should invest in small businesses through legislation that promotes the use of in-state businesses as well as incubators to foster more small businesses, particularly tech and expertise driven fields. I see engineering and scientific contracts awarded to companies that have few or no employees in this state.”
“Better access to women’s health care, more walkable cities, attention to climate change and the health of the environment.” 
“The enemy of the state isn’t diversity, minorities, the poor, or immigrants. What’s holding us back is clinging to a past we should be ashamed of and fear instilled by the politicians who have nothing of any substance to offer so they peddle fear to the weak minded to stay in office and enrich themselves.”

A loud chorus of medical and public health leaders decried the actions of the panel, whose current members were all appointed by U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — a leading anti-vaccine activist before this year becoming the nation’s top health official.
“This is the group that can’t shoot straight,” said Dr. William Schaffner, a Vanderbilt University vaccine expert who for decades has been involved with ACIP and its workgroups.
For decades, the government has advised that all babies be vaccinated against the liver infection right after birth. The shots are widely considered to be a public health success for preventing thousands of illnesses.
But Kennedy’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices decided to recommend the birth dose only for babies whose mothers test positive, and in cases where the mom wasn’t tested.
For other babies, it will be up to the parents and their doctors to decide if a birth dose is appropriate. The committee voted to suggest that when a family decides not to get a birth dose, then the vaccination series should begin when the child is 2 months old.
The vote passed 8-3.
“We are doing harm by changing this wording, and I vote no,” said committee member Dr. Cody Meissner.
The acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Jim O’Neill, is expected to decide later whether to accept the committee’s recommendation.
The decision marks a return to a public health strategy that was abandoned more than three decades ago.
Asked why the newly-appointed committee moved quickly to reexamine the recommendation, committee member Vicky Pebsworth on Thursday cited “pressure from stakeholder groups wanting the policy to be revisited.” She did not say who was pressuring the committee, and a spokesman for Kennedy did not respond to a question about it.
Committee members said the risk of infection for most babies is very low and that earlier research that found the shots were safe for infants was inadequate.
They also worried that in many cases, doctors and nurses don’t have full conversations with parents about the pros and cons of the birth-dose vaccination.
The committee members voiced interest in hearing the input from public health and medical professionals, but chose to ignore the experts’ repeated pleas to leave the recommendations alone.
Dr. Peter Hotez of the Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development in Houston declined to present before the group “because ACIP appears to have shifted its mission away from science and evidence-based medicine,” he said in an email to The Associated Press.
The committee gives advice to the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on how approved vaccines should be used. CDC directors almost always adopted the committee’s recommendations, which were widely heeded by doctors and guide vaccination programs. But the agency currently has no director, leaving acting director O’Neill to decide.
In June, Kennedy fired the entire 17-member panel earlier this year and replaced it with a group that includes several anti-vaccine voices.
Hepatitis B is a serious liver infection that, for most people, lasts less than six months. But for some, especially infants and children, it can become a long-lasting problem that can lead to liver failure, liver cancer and scarring called cirrhosis.
In adults, the virus is spread through sex or through sharing needles during injection drug use. But it can also be passed from an infected mother to a baby.
In 1991, the committee recommended an initial dose of hepatitis B vaccine at birth. Experts say quick immunization is crucial to prevent infection from taking root. And, indeed, cases in children have plummeted.
Still, several members of Kennedy’s committee voiced discomfort with vaccinating all newborns. They argued that past safety studies of the vaccine in newborns was limited and it’s possible that larger, long-term studies could uncover a problem with the birth dose.
But two members said they saw no documented evidence of harm from the birth doses and suggested concern was based on speculation.
The panel was to vote Thursday, but voted to postpone after some members said they had just received the densely-worded vote proposals and wanted clarification and more time to consider it.
Three panel members asked about the scientific basis for saying that the first dose should be delayed for two months for many babies.
“This is unconscionable,” said committee member Dr. Joseph Hibbeln, who repeatedly voiced opposition to the proposal during the sometimes-heated two-day meeting.
The committee’s chair, Dr. Kirk Milhoan, said two months was chosen as a point where infants had matured beyond the neonatal stage. Hibbeln countered that there was no data presented that two months is an appropriate cut-off.
Meissner also questioned a second proposal — which passed 6-4 — that said parents should talk to pediatricians about blood tests meant to measure whether hep B shots have created protective antibodies.
Such testing is not standard pediatric practice after vaccination, but proponents said it could be a new way to see if fewer shots are adequate.
A CDC hepatitis expert, Adam Langer, said results could vary from child to child and would be an erratic way to assess if fewer doses work. He also noted there’s no good evidence that three shots pose harm to kids.
Meissner attacked the proposal, saying the language “is kind of making things up.”
“It’s like never-neverland,” he said.
Health experts have noted Kennedy’s hand-picked committee is focused on the pros and cons of shots for the individual getting vaccinated, and has turned away from seeing vaccinations as a way to stop the spread of preventable diseases among the public.
The second proposal “is right at the center of this paradox,” said committee member Dr. Robert Malone.
Some observers criticized the meeting, noting recent changes in how they are conducted. CDC scientists no longer present vaccine safety and effectiveness data to the committee. Instead, people who have been prominent voices in anti-vaccine circles were given those slots.
The committee “is no longer a legitimate scientific body,” said Elizabeth Jacobs, a member of Defend Public Health, an advocacy group of researchers and others that has opposed Trump administration health policies.

Gretchen Whitmer speaks at a gun safety rally at the state Capitol Building on April 22, 2025 | Photo: Anna Liz NicholsFor most of her tenure as Michigan’s chief executive, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has earned her reputation the old fashioned way: by delivering results that matter to the people she represents.
GOP propaganda to the contrary, she kept Michigan on an even keel during a global pandemic, as the first Trump administration seemingly worked overtime to tip the boat over. 
She invested in long-neglected infrastructure while expanding workers’ rights, strengthening reproductive freedoms, and pushing forward common sense gun safety reforms that had been ignored by prior governors.
And even in the face of a plot to kidnap and murder her, Whitmer stood resolute against the rising tide of right-wing extremism that resulted in a blatant attempt to steal the 2020 election and an attempted coup on January 6.
As data centers flock to Michigan communities, what protections exist for residents?

But a governor who stood firmly for the rights of citizens over those of vested interests is now leaning in a strange direction.
Whitmer’s name became prominently mentioned as a potential contender for the White House precisely because she governed with a clear sense of public purpose and leadership that was widely, and rightly, respected.
But her sweeping embrace of massive data center projects has left many Michiganders, including this one, confused. Especially as it is so seemingly in line with the priorities of President Donald Trump, whose July executive order demanded the pursuit of “bold, large-scale industrial plans to vault the United States further into the lead on critical manufacturing processes and technologies that are essential to national security, economic prosperity, and scientific leadership.”
Now compare that to the comments Whitmer offered to the Michigan Public Service Commission this week in support of the massive data center proposed in Saline Township, in which she urged the regulatory body to provide the utility an expedited approval.  
“Right now, time is of the essence,” Whitmer stated. “This is a matter of national security and economic competitiveness, and if we do not act, it will cost us thousands of jobs and billions of dollars of investment in our economy.”
And while she has insisted that “Michigan’s environmental protections remained non-negotiable” in the vetting process, that is a conclusion far more in line with the utilities and tech companies than with environmental advocates.
The governor who has demanded accountability from corporate interests like Enbridge and its Line 5 pipeline through the Straits of Mackinac is now actively courting companies that demand immense public resources, with long-term implications for the air we breathe and the water we drink, in exchange for limited economic return.
It’s perplexing — and hard not to wonder what changed.
The sudden enthusiasm for data centers is especially surprising given the industry’s profile: massive energy consumption, minimal permanent job creation, substantial taxpayer subsidies, and heavy strain on local infrastructure.
Yet Michigan is now extending public money to data center operators — many of them among the most powerful and profitable companies in the world — as if they were fragile startups in need of nurturing.
While Whitmer has leaned enthusiastically into promoting data centers as a symbol of Michigan’s high-tech future, Attorney General Dana Nessel, a fellow Democrat, has struck a far more cautious tone, underscoring the risks that come with rushing such projects forward. 
A new unifying issue: Just about everyone hates data centers

Whitmer, like Trump, has heralded proposed developments as transformative investments, framing the industry as a competitive necessity in a rapidly evolving digital economy. Nessel, by contrast, has repeatedly pressed for rigorous oversight, intervening in utility proceedings and urging full public hearings to ensure that residents are not saddled with higher energy costs, hidden subsidies, or environmental burdens. 
Where Whitmer emphasizes opportunity and momentum, Nessel stresses transparency, accountability, and the need to safeguard public resources. The divergence between the two reveals more than just a policy disagreement but a fundamental difference in governing instincts: one eager to accelerate economic development, the other insistent that Michigan not trade away long-term public protections for short-term headlines.
If she continues down this path, Whitmer risks transforming a strong, people-first narrative into a muddled story of corporate appeasement and economic strategy on autopilot.
If she does have political ambitions beyond the end of her governorship, which seems to be a source of back-and-forth speculation, this is a puzzling path to take toward wooing Democratic voters exhausted by industry-driven agendas that seek to paper over poisoned water and polluted air as necessary progress. 
And that’s what makes this moment so baffling: she doesn’t need to do any of this. Not for her legacy, not for Michigan, and not for the future she’s already spent years shaping.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Facetune_22-04-2025-13-24-00-1-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-12-05 11:58:20.621137

As of Oct. 1, penalties increased for those caught driving over 100 mph, and drivers convicted of either two or three moving violations, must take a driver retraining course. There are also increased fines for drivers who do not yield to pedestrians and new helmet requirements for motorcycle drivers under 21.
Similarly, red light cameras and speeding cameras continue to pop up across the state, since state law allowed for the installation of automated traffic regulation in 2023. Many municipalities and cities are continuing to push for additional cameras.
Historically, fatal accidents occur on Connecticut roads fairly consistently through the year, although summer months have seen slightly more in some years.
That could be attributed in part to traffic volume, which increases in the summer on I-95. 
But while roads in the state tend to be busier in the summer, that could slow traffic overall. According to Department of Transportation data, more drivers tend to speed in the winter months.
Meanwhile, an analysis of each state’s road safety reported that Connecticut could use more laws addressing child and passenger protections in cars.
Connecticut received a ranking of “yellow” or “caution,” from the report, published by Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety. While surrounding states New York and Rhode Island received “green” ratings, based on their traffic policies, most states in the nation aligned with Connecticut. 
The report gave Connecticut credit for the adoption of red light cameras, and the state received a “good” ranking for automated red light and speeding camera usage and allowance.
However, Connecticut received “danger” ratings for seatbelt laws. While the state requires that all front seat occupants wear seatbelts, it is not required for back seat occupants over the age of 16 to wear a seatbelt. Motorcyclists over the age of 21 are not required to wear a helmet.
As for child passenger safety laws, Connecticut fell in line with 38 other states, receiving a “danger” rating. Most states in the nation, like Connecticut, do not require children who have outgrown a front-facing car seat to use a booster seat. Instead, any children 8 or older or over 60 pounds are allowed to use just a seatbelt.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GooV7-number-of-fatal-crashes-in-ct-drops--1024x652.png,,,2025-12-05 11:58:20.621137

Benson had said that ballots returned with mismatched numbers between the ballot stub and the envelope should be counted as a “challenged ballot,” but Judge Brock A. Swartzle ruled Wednesday that if the numbers do not match, the vote cannot be counted. 
Swartzle’s order specifically noted that in Michigan election law, as amended in February 2024, rules about the ballot stub and envelope numbers matching were written into law. 
“While the Secretary can issue instructions and guidance, those must be fully consistent with the laws of this state,” he writes. 
The case, brought by the Republican National Committee, the Michigan Republican Party and Chesterfield Township Clerk Cindy Berry, was first filed in state court in September 2024.  SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Benson’s lawyers had argued that because there was no specific instruction in the law about what to do with a ballot if it was returned with mismatching numbers, it fell within her realm to make a decision on. Swartzle pushed back on that argument, writing that though there is no specific guidance on what to do in that situation, the law is clear that such a ballot should not count. 
“Our Legislature could not have been clearer: if the condition is met—i.e., if the numbers match—then the ballot is to be tabulated,” Swartzle wrote. “The obverse is equally plain and unambiguous: when the numbers do not match, or when no match can be made because there is a missing stub, the board of election inspectors has no statutory authority to tabulate the ballot.”
Swartzle left one question open for a further decision on the case, and asked both parties to submit further briefs on what should be done with an absentee ballot with mismatching numbers, including if an elector should be granted the chance to cure the ballot.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-182152179-700x467-1.jpg,,,2025-12-05 10:59:58.344920

(Photo: Duke Energy)A trade group representing large industrial utility customers is claiming Duke Energy’s proposed rate hike does not comply with North Carolina state law because it only covers two years.
The Carolina Industrial Group for Fair Utility Rates, or CIGFUR, is asking the North Carolina Utilities Commission to deem Duke Energy’s rate increase application incomplete, or to reject the proposal completely.
Duke Energy’s application, filed with the NCUC on Nov. 20, asks for a 15% rate increase over the next two years. This would apply to Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress, the company’s two utilities in the state.
But this timeline deviates from state law, according to CIGFUR’s NCUC filing Nov. 26.
“HB 951 established a specific three-year rate plan with express guardrails in place that were painstakingly negotiated through a 9-month stakeholder process established by Speaker Hall,” Susan Vick, a registered lobbyist representing CIGFUR, told NC Newsline.
House Bill 951, titled “Energy Solutions for North Carolina,” became law in October 2021.
Vick described the measure as a product of “intense lobbying” by Duke Energy, who wanted quicker cost recovery. The tradeoff the utility agreed to was to give more transparency and certainty to the ratemaking process for consumers.
“That Duke now seeks to unilaterally change the parameters and submit a plan that is different than what HB 951 requires is a concern,” Vick said, “and requires NC industrial customers to weigh in and object.”
Bill Norton, a spokesperson for Duke Energy, told NC Newsline the company is seeking a two-year multiyear rate plan for 2027 through 2028 so that future rate cases align with a planned merger of Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress.
“If that combination is approved by regulators next year, a two-year rate plan enables our customers to start benefitting from the efficiencies of a combined utility sooner, and these will be our final rate cases as separate utilities,” Norton wrote.
Rates for the two utilities would gradually blend over time in future filings after Jan. 1, 2027, subject to approval from the NCUC, according to Norton.
State leaders like Attorney General Jeff Jackson and Gov. Josh Stein have voiced their opposition to Duke Energy’s proposed increases, NC Newsline previously reported.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/DukeEnergy-Damage-from-Helene-1024x650.jpg,,,2025-12-05 10:59:58.344920

California is home to nearly 1 million children with physical, developmental or cognitive disabilities — most of whom receive at least some services through Medicaid. But cuts from President Donald Trump’s sweeping budget bill have put those crucial services at risk — leaving California parents worried about their children’s futures.
As CalMatters’ Carolyn Jones explains, the $1-trillion cuts to Medicaid over 10 years help fund a broad range of services to disabled children, including speech and physical therapy, wheelchairs and in-home aides. They can receive therapy through regional centers, which seek to help people with disabilities live as independently as possible. California’s regional centers work through a network of 21 nonprofits — a third of which are funded by Medicaid.
Medicaid also pays for therapists, equipment, vision and hearing tests and other services for schools, which are accessible to all students, not just those with disabilities. 
But because of the federal budget’s funding cuts — which were made to help offset the cost of extending Trump’s 2017 tax cuts that mostly benefit the wealthy — money for the regional centers will run out by the end of January, and it’s unclear what services will be on the chopping block.

Kristin Wright, executive director of inclusive practices and systems at the Sacramento County Office of Education: “We have a delicate web of services that, combined, support a whole child, a whole family. So when the basic foundational structure is upended, like Medicaid, for example, it’s not just one cut from a knife. It’s multiple.”

The cuts are raising alarm among some California families, such as Los Angeles resident Lelah Coppedge. She and her husband have a 16-year-old son with cerebral palsy. Though both parents work and have private health insurance, they could not afford their son’s care — which includes a nurse who comes four days a week to help him with basic activities — without government help.

Coppedge: “I go down this rabbit hole of worst-case scenarios. Before this happened, I felt there was a clear path for my son. Now that path is going away, and it’s terrifying.”

Newsom pitches nuance for tech CEOs

For making what he views as concessions to the Trump administration, Gov. Gavin Newsom has been quick to admonish some industries and institutions — like when he slammed law firms for “selling out” to the administration’s demands this year, and threatened to pull state funding from California universities that made certain agreements with Trump.
But when it comes to Big Tech, the governor takes a more forgiving approach, writes CalMatters’ Jeanne Kuang. 
At The New York Times’ finance summit Wednesday, Newsom characterized tech leaders’ efforts to court Trump’s favor as “situational” and that he doesn’t see their apparent shift to the right “as big a shift as perhaps others do.”

Newsom: “I think it’s a little bit more, I don’t want to say the word transactional, but it’s fiduciary.”

As a former mayor of San Francisco, Newsom has had a long relationship with tech executives. California relies on the industry’s gains to help balance its budget, and if Newsom decides to run for president in 2028, he could find Silicon Valley’s wealthy donors valuable.

Peter Leroe-Muñoz, a senior vice president at the Bay Area Council: “At the end of the day the governor recognizes that we all have a stake in the success of California and so not cutting off ties or undermining those industry players is in the long term success of the Golden State.”

Poll: Most Californians tired of fed’s immigration crackdown

A new poll examining California voters’ opinion of the Trump administration’s campaign to rein in immigrants, including those with criminal convictions, shows waning support for the administration’s policies — even among a slim majority of Republicans, reports CalMatters’ Wendy Fry.
Commissioned by pro-immigrant organizations, the poll by Goodwin Simon Strategic Research surveyed 1,200 self-identified voters. It found that 84% of Democrats, 61% of independents and 54% of Republicans agreed that “even if someone does have a record, they deserve due process … before being deported.” 
On the topic of California’s sanctuary laws, 61% said they want California prisons to stop directly handing immigrants over to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for deportation. 
The new poll is consistent with other recent surveys that found voters disapprove Trump’s immigration tactics. Last week, a UC Berkeley poll found that one-third of Latino voters who supported Trump now regret their decision, and the Public Policy Institute of California reported 71% of Californians surveyed disapproved of the job ICE is doing.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-05 15:11:27+00:00,CT Mirror,US work authorizations for legal immigrants slashed from 5 years to 18 months,Ariana Figueroa | States Newsroom,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/05/work-authorization-slashed-legal-immigrants/,The new policy follows the shooting of two West Virginia National Guard members by an Afghan national granted asylum earlier this year.,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration Thursday announced new restrictions for immigrants, reducing the work authorization periods from five years to 18 months, the latest crackdown on legal immigration.
The new policy follows the shooting of two West Virginia National Guard members by an Afghan national granted asylum earlier this year. 
The shift will not only affect hundreds of thousands of immigrants, but the shortened period for work authorization could create massive backlogs at the agency responsible for processing legal immigration requests, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. 
“Reducing the maximum validity period for employment authorization will ensure that those seeking to work in the United States do not threaten public safety or promote harmful anti-American ideologies,” USCIS Director Joseph Edlow said in a statement.
“After the attack on National Guard service members in our nation’s capital by an alien who was admitted into this country by the previous administration, it’s even more clear that USCIS must conduct frequent vetting of aliens,” he continued. 
Immigrants affected by the new changes include refugees; those granted asylum; those with a withholding of removal; those with pending applications for asylum or withholding of removal; those adjusting their status, for example by gaining a green card; and those who fall under the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act of 1997.
That act applies to certain Nicaraguans, Cubans, Salvadorans, Guatemalans, nationals of former Soviet bloc countries and their dependents who in the 1990s had applied for asylum and were systematically denied.
Additionally, USCIS fees for applying for permits and other paperwork increased as a result of the massive tax and spending passage that Republicans passed over the summer and President Donald Trump signed into law. For initial employment authorization, fees are now $550 and $275 to renew. 
Following the shooting, U.S. Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom, 20, died. A second guard member, U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, remains critically wounded but hospitalized in stable condition. 
In response, the Trump administration has ramped up its crackdown on legal immigration and highlighted the need for its mass deportation campaign. The suspect, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, pleaded not guilty to several charges in court on Tuesday. 
This week, all immigration applications from 19 countries listed on Trump’s “high-risk” countries or travel ban from earlier this year, were paused — a move that freezes processing for green card holders and citizenship applications.

(Photo by Alex Brandon - Pool/Getty Images)TOPEKA — The Trump administration in January cut off 36 people who were bound for Kansas when it canceled travel plans for refugees who planned to relocate to the United States.
Months later, cuts in aid through the One Big Beautiful Bill Act continue to eliminate needed food services for immigrants living in Kansas.
One refugee was a mother waiting to join her family, which had immigrated without her because she was pregnant and unable to travel, said Yeni Silva-Renteria, executive director of International Rescue Committee in Wichita.
Today, that mother still awaits approval to reunite with her husband and children who live in Wichita, she said.
“Now she’s stuck,” Silva-Renteria said. “People come to the office all the time, asking when is my son coming, when is my wife coming, and we cannot answer that at this moment. People are going through a lot of stress right now, and it’s very difficult. This world right now, especially within resettlement and within the immigration system — I’ve never experienced this much stress.”
That stress ramped up when new regulations for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program went into effect in November.
Many immigrants who had previously received SNAP support for food and Temporary Assistance to Need Families, or TANF, were kicked off the programs, including human trafficking victims and refugees, Silva-Renteria said. 
Silva-Renteria stressed that anyone in the country illegally was never able to receive those government dollars, as is often erroneously reported.
Refugees, who often have been living in refugee camps for years before they are approved for relocation, usually receive a work permit and a Social Security card and, typically, eligibility for programs like SNAP to help them as they adjust to their new lives, she said.
SNAP and TANF are especially important when refugees first arrive in the country, Silva-Renteria said.
“The expectation is that within 90 days they’ll obtain a job,” she said. “Within the systems, we know that they’re not going to be self-sufficient within 90 days. Especially in Kansas, day care is a challenge, transportation is a challenge, the language barrier.”
It doesn’t mean that they’re not working, she said, or that they’re taking advantage of the system.
“There is an investment that we provide to those families until they get on their feet,” Silva-Renteria said. “These are people who have been at refugee camps for several years and have endured a lot of trauma. Some of them are the only survivors in their family. That support is critical for them because there’s no other way they’re going to make it without relying on that assistance.”
 
Eliminating support
Federal law previously allowed certain categories of noncitizen residents, such as refugees and human trafficking victims, to receive Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, said Erin La Row, spokeswoman for the Department for Children and Families.
“In state fiscal year 2025, the average number of legal non-citizen residents receiving Kansas SNAP benefits per month was 9,483,” she said.
The One Big Beautiful Bill Act changed eligibility, limiting it to U.S. citizens, U.S. nationals, lawful permanent residents, Cuban and Haitian entrants and Compact of Free Association citizens, which is an agreement between the United States and the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of Palau, La Row said.
Beginning Nov. 1, 4,039 individuals in the state were no longer eligible to receive benefits, although the loss of those benefits may not occur until DCF processes a review of their case, La Row said. SNAP requires recertification case reviews to be done within the next six to 12 months, La Row said.
La Row said DCF couldn’t be certain who would lose benefits until each case was reviewed, so after Nov. 1, all applications, reviews or other changes would be verified through the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements system, called SAVE.
“Any family that is no longer eligible to receive benefits will be notified once that review has taken place,” she said. “Additionally, we are working with the International Rescue Committee to determine how best to notify families, as that is the entity that engages with the majority of the population losing their eligibility for these benefits.”
 
The fallout
Silva-Renteria said her organization is doing its best to work with immigrant families as their assistance disappears.
“We’re doing a lot of outreach and communicating with the families. They have to understand this new change and see what that means for them,” she said.
IRC is connecting families with community resources and also using donations to its organization for food and other types of assistance.
Their work happens amid the organization’s own federal grant losses, including the shutdown of a grant funding its resettlement program that forced the layoff of 11 people in February.
“We have minimized our expenses as much as we can to prioritize direct services and support to the families,” Silva-Renteria said. “There’s only so much we can do.”
She and her staff have watched as immigrants have been vilified across the country, including online discussions and political comments after an Afghani immigrant shot two National Guard members.
Cautious about being misunderstood, Silva-Renteria said she doesn’t support violence in any way, but she knows that one person’s actions don’t speak for their entire immigrant communities.
“We do need a lot of support, obviously financially but also understanding and awareness that we’re dealing with people,” she said. “We’re dealing with families, children who deserve a safe space, a home, a place. Unfortunately right now, even within our community in Wichita, some of them may not feel as welcome or as safe just because of the climate.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/trumpjuly42025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-05 10:59:58.344920

It’s been more than a month since ICE’s agreement with CoreCivic and Torrance County regarding the facility expired. (Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)More than a month after a contract expired governing the operation of a New Mexico immigrant detention facility, local officials have yet to receive any updates from the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency or the facility’s private operator CoreCivic, officials told Source New Mexico on Thursday.
The inter-governmental services agreement between Torrance County, ICE and CoreCivic  expired Oct. 31 during the federal government shutdown. But even after the government reopened Nov. 13, County Manager Jordan Barela said he has neither received an updated contract from ICE nor word of when it could be renewed.
“We’ve been checking weekly, and the feedback we have received is that ICE is still evaluating the terms and conditions of a potential extension,”  Barela told Source via email Thursday. 
Torrance County immigration detention center continues operating without ICE contract

An ICE spokesperson did not respond to Source New Mexico’s request for comment on the contract. Ryan Gustin, a CoreCivic spokesperson, did not respond to questions about the contract status, but instead responded that the company is “committed to providing safe, humane and respectful care for everyone entrusted to us, and we take seriously our obligation to adhere to all applicable federal detention standards.”
Advocates for approximately 550 ICE detainees in the jail, as well as U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-NM), say the lack of a contract means ICE should immediately stop detaining immigrants at the facility. They point to ICE standard operating procedures that require ICE to remove detainees and equipment from the facility absent a contract, as well as long-standing issues about detainee treatment at the facility.
In a statement Thursday to Source New Mexico, Heinrich said he remains “deeply concerned about the situation” at the facility in Estancia, noting that an inspector general overseeing ICE called for the facility’s closure in 2022.

“Conditions have not improved, and now they’re purportedly running the facility without a contract,” he said. “ICE’s inaction on this contract, and refusal to meet their own minimum detention standards, is another example of the agency shunning accountability.”
Heinrich sent a letter to ICE on Nov. 7 demanding the agency identify what authority it has to continue detaining immigrants in Estancia and that it transfer ICE detainees out of the facility in the meantime. ICE had not responded to Heinrich as of Thursday, according to a spokesperson.
Meanwhile, about 30 ICE detainees signed a handwritten letter to Source New Mexico recently saying they continue to face poor conditions inside the jail, including problems accessing tablets they rely on for various necessities.
“Tablets are our only means for vital services such as communication, medical care at the center, and our only way to ‘complain’ about our various needs, not to mention our only access to legal resources for an adequate defense process for the detainees here,” the detainees wrote in Spanish.
Gustin said CoreCivic was unaware of any “recent significant outages or issues with the tablets,” but noted that staff immediately create a service ticket when they learn of technological issues.

Heinrich’s staff also previously noted non-working tablets during a visit in late May and included that in a letter to ICE that also reported complaints of verbal and physical abuse, lack of access to laundry and lack of medical care. 
Previously, detainees, including Rogelio Bolufé of Cuba, said they were repeatedly denied access to the legal library and to legal aid groups, allegations that CoreCivic also denied. 
The letter, which Source received Nov. 24, has signatures from inmates who say they lacked access to the tablets since Nov. 14 due to what jail operators described as a “technical failure.” It’s unclear from the letter whether the problem has been resolved, and Haymel de la Vega, Bolufé’s friend and contact, did not respond to Source’s requests Thursday for an update.
The letter’s signatories said they are from Guatemala, Honduras, Cuba, Mexico and Ecuador. One detainee who identified himself as Edin Santos of Honduras wrote that he missed his son’s birthday due to the issue.

On Wednesday, Cordova Telecom Cooperative and GCI announced a partnership to lay an undersea fiber optic cable from Juneau to Cordova and a second cable from Cordova to Seward.
When open for service in fall 2027, the two cables will provide high-speed internet to small communities in Prince William Sound and northern Southeast Alaska. 
The development matters to the rest of the state as well, because when combined, they will provide a route for internet traffic between the Railbelt and Outside. Currently, four undersea cables through the Gulf of Alaska are the principal routes for internet and phone traffic between Alaska and the rest of the world. 
Matanuska Telecom Association opened the state’s first overland fiber connection in 2020 as an alternative, and the new route will give the state another redundant option, said Cordova Telecom CEO Jeremiah Beckett.
“With what we’ve built out, scalability wise, we could put all the current Alaska traffic on our network if needed,” Beckett said.

While satellite internet services like Starlink have transformed life in rural Alaska, ground-based fiber internet remains the backbone of worldwide telecommunications, delivering service faster and in volumes that satellites can’t provide. 
“It’s kind of like rural communities that don’t have the ferry,” Beckett said. “Places without fiber don’t have the same access that folks with fiber do. So this is really to help connect those rural areas and give them the same access to the digital economy and marketplace as the rest of the world.”
Despite their advantages, fiber-optic cables can be vulnerable.
“Up north, it’s ice scouring … and in our area, it’s typically ship anchors and earthquakes,” Beckett said. 
Alaskans have become intimately familiar with the consequences of broken cables in recent years.
Northern and northwest Alaska are particularly familiar: Quintillion’s fiber-optic cable has been severed three times in two years. The latest break wasn’t fixed for more than seven months because sea ice precluded repairs. That caused widespread problems in areas served by the cable.
In March, a break in a subsea cable left the Alaska Legislature to do business on paper for a day and knocked out both cellphone and internet service for much of Juneau. Juneau had alternatives; a temporary fix was in place within days.
When the cable leading to Sitka broke in 2024, it took weeks to repair. People canceled surgeries and businesses went cash-only until internet service was restored.
Adding a backup fiber route reduces the odds of blackouts like those. Currently, Cordova is served by a single undersea fiber line through Prince William Sound to Valdez.
When the project is complete, internet and phone traffic will have three possible routes: north, west, and east. 
The two cables will cost roughly $88 million combined, according to figures provided by Beckett, and the project is principally funded through two federal grants. Cordova Telecom is paying for part of the project, as is GCI, which will be what Beckett calls an “anchor tenant and partner.”
“It was a good matchup for both of our long-term goals,” he said.
In a prepared statement, GCI senior vice president Billy Wailand praised the plan, which is formally known as Fiber Internet Serving Homes in Southeast Alaska, or FISH in SEAK. 
“Critical state services require network diversity,” he said. “GCI turned up the first subsea cable to Alaska in 1999 and landed a second diverse fiber in 2008. We are thrilled to partner with CTC on its FISH in SEAK project, which includes a next-generation cable that ensures Alaska and its capital city continue to benefit from the newest technologies and adds another crucial layer of redundancy to the network.”
Communities along the cable route will see huge changes, Beckett said. Residents of Pelican on Chichagof Island in Southeast Alaska, who use boardwalks instead of roads and four-wheelers instead of cars, will be able to get fiber internet access directly to their homes.
The island village of Chenega in Prince William Sound, which has about 50 year-round residents, likewise will have new access to fiber internet. 
Alaska’s Lost Coast, between Glacier Bay and Yakutat, could be dotted with cellphone towers. 
Beckett, who grew up in Cordova, returned to the town with his spouse 12 years ago, “basically when Cordova got its subsea fiber,” he said. “We were both teleworkers, and that created the opportunity for us to move back to Alaska, essentially.”
Since then, he’s seen internet service improve and has become head of his local telecom, which has just 20 employees. 
Because it’s a cooperative, it’s run as a nonprofit, he said. That means the telecom’s goal is to deliver faster service and low rates, not necessarily generate a profit.
In Yakutat, “a few years ago, you couldn’t get cell service anywhere,” Beckett said. 
“We’ve upgraded the cell service there to 4G and outside of the fishermen complaining because their wives can get hold of them, it was a huge boost for the community,” he said.
“If someone gets hurt, they can call the paramedics and not have to drive 20 miles before they get to service. … It’s giving people reasons to think about moving home, because it’s one less inhibitor to be back in Alaska,” Beckett said. 
“Yakutat actually got a new clinic a couple years ago, and then with this, I think they’re going to see some good growth. Everyone likes core services, right?”

Kevin Sparks, R-Midland, looks over a proposed congressional map during a redistricting hearing at the Texas Capitol in Austin on Aug. 6, 2025. (REUTERS/Nuri Vallbona)Texas can use its new, GOP friendly congressional map while a legal challenge plays out, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled, temporarily pausing a lower court ruling that had blocked the map from going into effect. 
With the Dec. 8 candidate filing deadline fast approaching, the high court’s decision likely means Texas’ new map will be used for the 2026 midterm elections.
Justice Samuel Alito ruled that it was “indisputable” that Texas’ motivation for redistricting was “pure and simple” partisan advantage, which the court has previously ruled is permissible. Alito rejected the argument that Texas had engaged in racial gerrymandering.
The ruling is a major win for Republicans in Texas and nationally. President Donald Trump had pushed Texas to redraw its map over the summer, hoping to secure five additional GOP seats to shore up the party’s narrow majority in the U.S. House through the midterms.
On Nov. 18, two federal judges barred Texas from using the new map for 2026, saying there was evidence state lawmakers had racially gerrymandered in redrawing the lines. Galveston District Judge Jeffrey Brown, a Trump appointee, authored the opinion ordering Texas to return to its 2021 map, while 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Jerry Smith vociferously dissented.
The state asked the Supreme Court to overturn Brown’s ruling entirely, but that could take weeks or months to proceed through the court system, especially if the justices decide they want to hear arguments in Washington, D.C. With Thursday’s ruling, the justices have temporarily paused Brown’s ruling while that longer legal process can play out.
The ruling said the lower court, under Brown, “improperly inserted itself into an active primary campaign, causing much confusion and upsetting the delicate federal-state balance in elections.”
The new map, approved by the Texas Legislature and signed by Gov. Greg Abbott in August, is engineered to give Republicans control of 30 of the state’s 38 congressional districts, up from the 25 they currently hold under the 2021 map. Numerous Republican candidates have stepped forward to run in the newly favorable districts, while several Democratic incumbents were pushed into nearby districts already occupied by another Democrat, forcing them to contemplate primaries or retire.
Brown’s ruling upended those calculations. But in restoring the new map, the Supreme Court likely ensured that Republicans running for redrawn districts will get to campaign under the new lines in 2026.
Attorney General Ken Paxton celebrated the ruling, saying it was a win for Texas and every conservative who is tired of watching the left try to upend the political system with bogus lawsuits.”
Texas Democrats, meanwhile, condemned the outcome, with House Democratic Caucus Chair Rep. Gene Wu of Houston saying the high court had “failed” Texans.
“This is what the end of the Voting Rights Act looks like: courts that won’t protect minority communities even when the evidence is staring them in the face,” Wu said.
In her dissent, Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan criticized the court for reversing Brown’s 160-page ruling “based on its perusal, over a holiday weekend, of a cold paper record.”
“Today’s order disrespects the work of a District Court that did everything one could ask to carry out its charge,” Kagan wrote on behalf of the liberal justices. “Today’s order disserves the millions of Texans whom the District Court found were assigned to their new districts based on their race.”

(Photo by Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)Maine’s Somali legislators denounced President Donald Trump’s increasing attacks on the immigrant community in an open letter on Thursday.
“This moment is bigger than any one politician or any one community,” wrote Reps. Mana Abdi of Lewiston, Deqa Dhalac of South Portland and Yusuf Yusuf of Portland. The three are the first Somali-Americans to serve in the Maine House of Representatives.
“What we are witnessing is part of a coordinated effort to destabilize immigrant, Indigenous, and other communities of color, undermine democratic norms, and reshape the fabric of America through exclusion and extrajudicial force,” they wrote.
In the wake of last week’s shooting of two National Guard members in the District of Columbia by an Afghan national who was granted asylum, the Trump administration has taken several drastic steps to halt the nation’s legal immigration and asylum processes. At the same time, the president has turned his ire on the Somali-American community, launching an immigration enforcement campaign in Minnesota’s Twin Cities targeted at Somali people, who he called “garbage” during a Tuesday cabinet meeting.
Minnesota, followed by Ohio, is home to the largest Somali community in the country. Outside of those two states, Maine’s Androscoggin County, which includes Lewiston, boasts one of the nation’s most robust Somali populations.

In their letter, Maine’s Democratic lawmakers said the president’s “dehumanizing” rhetoric is dangerous because it could embolden people “to harass, intimidate, or threaten our neighbors.”
They also condemned the president’s actions to limit temporary protected status for certain immigrant populations, leaving them open to deportation. TPS is granted to people who hail from countries deemed too dangerous for a return, due to violence or major natural disasters. 
Within hours of Wednesday’s shooting, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services halted all immigration requests from Afghan nationals. The administration also ended TPS for more than 330,000 nationals from Haiti. And Thursday, the head of the USCIS announced that by direction of Trump the agency would reexamine every green card application from “every country of concern,” which are the 19 countries on the president’s travel ban list.  
In the letter, the Maine lawmakers said the majority of those being targeted by the Trump administration’s policies “are law-abiding individuals who are legitimately working to attain citizenship,” many of whom “have called America their home for decades, raising families, contributing to our economy, and strengthening our communities.”
“Every person in this nation, regardless of immigration status, is entitled to due process. That is not optional,” they wrote. “Today, TPS holders are being targeted. If we remain silent, we normalize a politics that can, and will, be turned against others.”
In a separate statement, Maine Gov. Janet Mills condemned the president’s comments about Somali immigrants and said he is “demeaning the very idea and spirit of America.”
Mills said the “beauty of America is not that we are bound by a common racial or religious heritage,” but rather people are bound by the principle of being “treated equally under the law and we are all guaranteed equal opportunity to succeed.”
Other community leaders have also spoken out. Lewiston resident Safiya Khalid, who previously served as the first Somali-American elected to the city council, said Trump’s targeting of Somali communities is “incomprehensible, harmful, and absolutely appalling.”
“I expect our state leaders and elected officials to speak out forcefully against this vile attack and to show unwavering support for their Somali constituents,” Khalid wrote on social media. “This is not a moment for silence or political calculation. Our communities deserve dignity, respect, and allies who will stand with us when it matters most.”

“They are ready to go,” Gov. Henry McMaster told reporters. “They’re pleased to go; they’re serious about it, and they’ll do their job.”
The deployment comes a week after a West Virginia soldier was killed and another was severely injured in a shooting attack that the Trump administration has called an act of terrorism. In response, Trump has ordered an additional 500 guardsmen to Washington.
The second deployment round of South Carolina’s guardsmen, which will last 90 days, was scheduled before the shooting took place and is not part of the ramp up. There are no plans for an extension or an increase in number of soldiers, according to a statement from the South Carolina adjutant general’s office.
Soldiers of the 4-118th Combined Arms Battalion, based in Columbia, were the first from the state to go to Washington in August as part of what the president has coined “Operation D.C. Safe and Beautiful.” The group of 200 guardsmen remained in the capital for about 30 days before returning to the Palmetto State.
This time, national guardsmen of the 1st Battalion 178th Field Artillery Regiment, based in Georgetown, were assigned to rotate in and relieve members of Georgia’s national guard.
“Their primary mission is to provide critical support to law enforcement agencies, reinforcing safety and security for residents, workers, and visitors in the nation’s capital,” reads the statement from the adjutant general’s office.
The 178th has previously deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan, according to its commander Lt. Col. W. Brunson De Pass III.

“The leadership in the state of South Carolina trusts this battalion. This battalion has a lot of history of doing things the right way and being successful,” De Pass said in a statement.
During the August deployment, South Carolina guardsmen provided security and patrols at transit stations, events and popular destinations, including the National Mall, Union Station, and the White House.
Both times the troops have been deployed under an agreement called Title 32. Under this arrangement, the federal government covers the cost, but Gov. Henry McMaster retains control and can call the guard back at any time.
Upon their arrival in Washington, D.C., the guardsmen will be briefed and receive additional training from federal law enforcement.
“We are confident our soldiers are trained, equipped and ready to accomplish their duties,” Maj. Gen. Robin B. Stilwell, adjutant general for South Carolina, said in a statement.
Meanwhile, prosecutors have charged Rahmanullah Lakanwal, a 29-year-old Afghan national with first-degree murder, assault with intent to kill and illegal possession of a firearm in the shooting that killed Specialist Sarah Beckstrom, 20, and critically wounded Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24.
Their fellow guardsmen shot Lakanwal. He pleaded not guilty from his hospital bed Tuesday.
On Nov. 27, a federal judge ordered the Trump administration to end the deployments by guard units, declaring the use of troops was “unlawful” and usurped local officials’ authority.
The order had been on hold for 21 days as the U.S. Department of Justice filed an appeal. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals officially continued the hold Thursday as it considers the case.

She’s fighting to clean it up,Deborah Brennan,,,,,https://calmatters.org/environment/2025/12/tijuana-river-paloma-aguirre-pollution/,The Tijuana River’s sewage contamination continues to sicken communities in southern San Diego County. San Diego County Supervisor Paloma Aguirre has become a leading force in pushing for binational fixes and emergency funding to protect public health.,"In summary
The Tijuana River’s sewage contamination continues to sicken communities in southern San Diego County. San Diego County Supervisor Paloma Aguirre has become a leading force in pushing for binational fixes and emergency funding to protect public health.


Hours after a November storm, the Tijuana River flooded a grove of trees in Imperial Beach, gushed through a row of calverts and exploded into mounds of fetid foam. 
This is ground zero for the contaminated river, which sickens thousands of people in southern San Diego County.
“The Tijuana River is one of, if not the most polluted, river in the entire United States,” said San Diego County Supervisor Paloma Aguirre, who viewed the overflowing river wearing black rain boots and a hot pink respirator mask. “The river is carrying dangerous chemicals, pollutants, pathogens and toxic gases that are impacting South San Diego communities.”
The site, known as the Saturn Boulevard hot spot, is part of a system of polluted waterways and failed sewage treatment plants in the cross-border region. In the ocean, the contamination leaves swimmers and surfers with breathing problems, digestive illness and rashes. Unsafe conditions have closed parts of the Imperial Beach shoreline for three years.
Last year, researchers discovered that the pollution is airborne as well. Foul-smelling hydrogen sulfide emissions near the river sometimes rise hundreds of times higher than the state’s odor threshold. At those levels the gas triggers headaches, nausea, eye irritation and respiratory distress. And there are other chemicals, viruses and bacteria in the mix. 
For children, the effects are worse, said Tom Csanadi, an Imperial Beach physician who has been active in the issue. Their lung surface area to body size is higher, which means they absorb more toxins. Children breathe faster than adults and they’re still growing, so it can affect their body tissues more severely. There are 11 schools within three kilometers of the hot spot.
“It could lower IQ, stunt cognitive development,” Csanadi said.
As a surfer, activist and elected leader, Aguirre has spent two decades tackling this problem, which she considers one of the worst environmental crises in the country.
“She’s been at the forefront of the advocacy side of this for a long, long time, before her political career even started,” said Falk Feddersen, an oceanographer with Scripps Institution of Oceanography who has mapped sewage flows up the coast from Mexico.
A cocktail of chemicals
While storm water seeped across the road at the hot spot, a swiftwater rescue truck drove through puddles, scanning for stranded motorists. The culverts under the crossing were installed to keep flooding under control, but they also churn the water, spewing noxious gas and other pollutants. 
“The unintended consequence is that it’s exacerbating the release of all the molecules and aerosols into the air,” Aguirre said. “It’s literally rocketing them into the environment.”
Hydrogen sulfide, with its distinctive rotten egg odor, is an indicator of that toxic brew, said Kim Prather, an atmospheric chemist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography. She raised the alarm about airborne pollution from the Tijuana River last year.

“That’s one in a cocktail of thousands of compounds,” she said. “It’s a blessing that it smells. I know it sounds strange, but it tells you to get away.”
Aguirre described her own struggles with Tijuana River pollution, including migraines, chest pain, shortness of breath, and waking in the middle of the night to an odor she likened to a “porta potty.”
Recent improvements to wastewater treatment plants in the U.S. and Mexico have reduced water pollution by keeping tens of millions of gallons of sewage out of the ocean each day. Aguirre and others celebrate that news, but note the river still contaminates surrounding areas.
More big upgrades are in the works on both sides of the border, but fixing the Saturn Boulevard hot spot quickly could offer immediate relief, Aguirre said.
“This is a very specific and low hanging fruit that will at least begin to mitigate the amount of gases being released into the air and benefit tens of thousands of people that live here,” she said.
Waves of pollution
Tijuana River pollution dates back to at least the 1930s, when the U.S. and Mexican governments built the first cross-border sewage plants. As Tijuana’s population soared with its booming industry, the city’s waste outstripped its treatment systems. Plant failures and sewage spills became common in the early 2000s, along with frequent beach closures along the south San Diego coast.
That’s when Aguirre encountered cross-border pollution in the surf at Imperial Beach. Growing up in Puerto Vallarta Mexico, she was used to surfing in muddy water after rains, so the discolored waves didn’t seem worrisome. 
“I remember going out here in Imperial Beach while the water was chocolate brown, not knowing that it’s nothing like what I was used to, because that was sewage,” she said.
She was the only one at the beach that day, except for a man posting signs stating “Clean water now.” He was Serge Dedina, executive director of the environmental group WildCoast, and he enlisted her in the fight against sewage pollution.
Aguirre first volunteered for the organization and soon joined its staff. She worked there for more than a decade, while earning a master’s degree in marine biodiversity and conservation at Scripps Institution of Oceanography. At WildCoast she organized a citizens’ group, advocated for improved water testing using DNA analysis, and served on working groups for a binational agreement on cross-border pollution, called Minute 320.
When Dedina was elected mayor of Imperial Beach in 2014, Aguirre saw a path to solving the sewage problem.
“I thought, well, if he can do it I can do it,” she said. “And I built on the momentum that he was able to create on this issue.”

Aguirre won a seat on the Imperial Beach City Council in 2018 and was elected mayor in 2022, when Dedina left office. With a bigger platform, she called on California and the federal government to declare a state of emergency over the border pollution problem and lobbied to classify the area as a Superfund site.
Those efforts haven’t gained traction, but other angles yielded results. Imperial Beach sued the International Boundary and Water Commission with the city of Chula Vista and Port of San Diego in 2018, alleging that it violated the Clean Water Act and other federal laws by failing to control coastal sewage pollution. They settled the lawsuit in 2023 with a promise of more resources and binational cooperation. 
“My tenure as mayor of IB really focused on advocating and working in a bipartisan fashion to secure the additional funding that was needed,” to fix cross-border pollution, she said.

Aguirre led delegations of local officials to Washington, D.C. to drum up money for costly infrastructure upgrades needed to get the sewage problem under control. She met with White House officials in both the Biden and Trump administrations, and with lawmakers who had served as Navy SEALS and had experienced the pollution problem at BUD/S, the Navy SEAL training program in Coronado.
In July, Aguirre won a special election for an open San Diego County Board of Supervisors seat. She immediately led county plans to study the health effects of cross-border pollution and asked the state for $50 million to fix the Saturn Boulevard hot spot. 
“She’s moved a problem that has been stuck, when other people could not,” Prather, the Scripps atmospheric chemist, said.
Sewage spills prompt quick fixes
The long-standing pollution problem came under new scrutiny in 2017, when a spill from a damaged line in Mexico dumped an estimated 143 million gallons of wastewater into the Tijuana River, sending foul odors wafting through the region. That accident revealed just how dilapidated the aging infrastructure had become.
“That’s one of the reasons why things are so horrific, because they’re playing catch up on fixing these things when they have catastrophic failures,” said Feddersen, the Scripps oceanographer.
In early 2022, another major spill released hundreds of millions of gallons of sewage-tainted water across the border for two and a half weeks. 
That summer, San Diego congress members freed up more than $300 million that had been authorized for wastewater treatment upgrades through the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Mexico committed $144 million to replace failing sewage treatment facilities in Tijuana, with an updated treaty between the two countries known as Minute 328.
In 2024, the lawmakers persuaded the Biden administration to add another $370 million to repair the aging South Bay International Wastewater Treatment Plant near the border, Rep. Scott Peters said.
After decades of deterioration, major improvements came online this year. The South Bay International Wastewater Treatment Plant, which was barely operable, is now fully functioning and expanded its capacity from 25 million to 35 million gallons of wastewater per day. The project was expected to take two years, but was completed in 100 days, according to the U.S. International Boundary and Water Commission.

By the end of next year that will climb to 50 million gallons per day, with higher capacity for peak wastewater surges. The commission, which manages the wastewater systems, has spent $122 million on the first series fixes, and the full project will cost $650 million.
Although the Trump administration has clawed back federal funding for many projects, it has doubled down on the cross-border sewage problem, Aguirre said. In July U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin met with his Mexican counterpart to seal the environmental deal.
In April Mexico repaired its Punta Bandera plant, located on the coast about six miles south of the border. The plant had failed completely in 2020 and was dumping raw sewage into the ocean. It now handles 18 million gallons of wastewater per day. That’s a big boost for beach safety, said Feddersen, whose research tracked the flow of sewage in ocean currents and modeled scenarios for reducing it.
“The best bang for the buck, the greatest reduction in beach closure and reduction in human illness, was fixing Punta Bandera,” he said.
Yet, the Tijuana River still threatens residents in its watershed with untreated sewage and industrial chemicals from maquiladoras in Tijuana. That includes solvents, heavy metals and toxins known as PFAS, or “forever chemicals,” Prather said.
“The river right now is a wastewater treatment plant without any processing,” she said.
Removing the culverts would eliminate the turbulence that sprays out hydrogen sulfide and other toxins. The county plans to finish a feasibility study on the project by January. That project would keep contaminants out of the air, but not out of the water.
Aguirre also wants new infrastructure to clean up the Tijuana River on the U.S. side. The recent binational Treaty, Minute 328, includes that option, and the International Boundary and Water Commission is exploring what it would take to divert and treat the river flows. There’s no funding for the project yet, but Aguirre says it’s on her agenda.
“Rivers are diverted up and down,” she said.  “It’s doable. Is it expensive? Yes. Are our lives in South San Diego worth it? Yes.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/112125_Paloma-Aguirre_AH_CM-22.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-05 09:57:39.753225
,California,2025-12-05 13:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,‘We may be deporting the wrong people’: New poll shows doubts about immigration crackdown,Wendy Fry,,,,,https://calmatters.org/justice/2025/12/immigration-poll-criminal-record/,A new poll shared exclusively with CalMatters adds to a slate of recent surveys suggesting Californians’ support is waning for Trump’s harshest immigration enforcement policies.,"In summary
A new poll shared exclusively with CalMatters adds to a slate of recent surveys suggesting Californians’ support is waning for Trump’s harshest immigration enforcement policies. 


If you found out your neighbor had a past criminal conviction, your knee-jerk reaction might be that you’d want them relocated. 
But what if that person committed a burglary in their late teens, served years in state prison, turned their life around, and now mentors at-risk youth?
Do the details matter? Researchers found that they do.   
A new poll by Goodwin Simon Strategic Research examines California voters’ attitudes toward due process for immigrants with criminal convictions during the Trump administration’s nationwide crackdown on unauthorized immigration. The survey also examined support for how tax dollars are spent and Californians’ views on the state’s sanctuary policies.
It found bipartisan support for ensuring that immigrants facing deportation receive due process, including ones with criminal records.
“This survey shows that there’s clear concern about the current administration’s approach to immigration enforcement,” said Sara Knight, a research director at Goodwin Simon Strategic Research. “I’m not surprised by the results, but I am heartened to see how strong the support for due process is and the growing frustration with treating people inhumanely in our immigration system.” 
President Donald Trump campaigned on the promise of mass deportations that targeted criminals, among other things, and he has made good on that. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have arrested more than 160,608 noncitizens nationwide with criminal convictions or pending charges, since his inauguration. 
The Trump administration has sought to expand the use of “expedited removal,” which allows immigration officers to remove certain non-citizens, like those convicted of crimes, from the United States without a hearing before an immigration judge.
Researchers say this latest poll by Goodwin Simon Strategic Research, released to CalMatters this week, also reflects waning support, even among a small majority of Republicans for the harshest immigration enforcement practices. It showed  84% of Democrats, 61% of independents, and 54% of Republicans agreed that “even if someone does have a record, they deserve due process and the chance to have their case heard by a judge before being deported.” 
The poll was commissioned by the Immigrant Legal Resource Center and the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, both pro-immigrant organizations. Goodwin Simon Strategic Research describes itself on its website as an “independent opinion research firm.” Researchers wrote the survey questions and polled more than 1,200 self-identified voters. Knight said the partisan divide among those polled mirrored the party-affiliation split in the electorate. The margin of error was 3 points. 
Some other recent polls echo similar conclusions released in recent weeks, including one released last week by UC Berkeley’s Possibility Lab that found one-third of Latino voters who supported Trump now regret their choice. Another public opinion poll by the nonpartisan research firm Public Policy Institute of California found 71% of Californians surveyed said they disapproved of the job ICE is doing. And, a CNN exit poll after the Proposition 50 redistricting election on Nov. 4 found that about three-quarters of California voters said they’re dissatisfied with or angry about the way things are going in the U.S., and 6 in 10 said the Trump administration’s actions on immigration enforcement have gone too far. 
Tricia McLaughlin, an assistant secretary at the Department of Homeland Security, pointed to other recent national polls to argue the public supports Trump’s immigration policies.
“President Trump and Homeland Security) Secretary (Kristi) Noem are delivering on the American people’s mandate to deport illegal aliens, and the latest polls show that support for the America First agenda has not wavered – including a New York Times poll that nearly 8 in 10 Americans support deporting illegal aliens with criminal records,” McLaughlin said in a written statement.
“The American people, the law, and common sense are on our side, and we will not stop until law and order is restored after Biden’s open border chaos flooded our country with the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens,” she continued.
From prison to ICE
In the more recent Goodwin Simon Strategic Research poll, 61% of voters surveyed said they want California’s prison system to stop directly handing immigrants over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement for deportation. 
The state’s sanctuary law does not apply to immigrants who have been convicted of serious crimes. State prisons have transferred to ICE more than 9,500 people with criminal records since Gov. Gavin Newsom took office in 2019, according to data released to CalMatters. So far in 2025, ICE has picked up 1,217 inmates directly from the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, the data shows. 
The corrections department also provides ICE with information that helps the agency locate, arrest, and deport people who are not directly transferred. CalMatters obtained and reviewed more than 27,000 pages of emails between state prison employees and ICE. The emails show prison employees regularly communicate with ICE about individuals in state custody, including U.S. citizens. They often share personal details about their families, visitors, and phone calls. Often, these family members have no criminal records and are U.S. citizens
Newsom, U.S. Senator Alex Padilla, and Speaker Robert Rivas have all denounced ICE’s broader deportation efforts. But all three have also indicated some level of support for having federal immigration officials remove noncitizens with prior convictions for violent crimes from the community. 
The governor has stated he would veto legislation that seeks to restrict the state prison system’s ability to coordinate with federal immigration authorities for the deportation of felons.
‘We may be deporting the wrong people’
Goodwin Simon researchers found that voters’ opinions change when they find out more details about the personal circumstances of a noncitizen with a past criminal conviction, even for violent crime. Pollsters gave two narratives to voters.
One was about a man who was brought to the United States from Mexico as a child. He got into a fight in his early 20s that left someone injured. The man was sentenced to seven years in state prison, where he turned his life around by taking college classes and helping other inmates get their high school diplomas. When he got out of prison, he was deported to Mexico before an immigration judge could decide on his case. 
The other narrative was about a person closely connected to a man whose family fled genocide in Cambodia when he was a baby. In the U.S., the man was the lookout for a robbery when he was a teenager and served 30 years in state prison. Upon his release, prison officials turned him over to ICE. 
“We may be deporting the wrong people. Although this last person did commit a crime, he has served his time and is now a valuable member of society, so it would be hard to say for sure if a person ever committed a crime deserves to be sent back. That is why the due process is important,” one Republican voter from Sacramento responded to the poll. She shifted her opinion from the view that people with past criminal convictions should be automatically deported to favoring a judge reviewing each individual case after hearing the narratives. 
After voters reviewed both pro- and anti-messaging and the two stories, support for having an immigration judge review individual cases before deportation increased from 84% to 90% among Democrats; from 61% to 74% among independents, but it dropped from 54% to 51% among Republicans. Central Coast voters and Republican women voters increased support for due process by 9 points after hearing the stories.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/061125-Socal-Raid-PR-03.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-05 08:57:20.342611

Gateway Cities with budgets already nearing a breaking point will now lose out on funds they have used for nearly a decade.,"FOR THE SECOND YEAR in a row, the Legislature has directed gaming revenue used for mitigating the local impacts of casinos into its own coffers, leaving city and town leaders frustrated amid worsening municipal budget strains.  
The move falls in line with the Legislature’s penny-pinching efforts to alleviate state budget pressures amid a host of federal funding claw backs nearly a year into the second Trump administration. Gateway Cities with budgets already nearing a breaking point will now lose out on funds they have used for nearly a decade for projects that address the adverse local impacts of casinos, such as increased crime, traffic, and regional gambling addiction. 
The Community Mitigation Fund (CMF), established in 2015 and used to award millions of dollars in grants to municipalities that host a casino or are next to a community that does, normally receives 6.5 percent of the annual revenues collected from a tax on casinos.  
In the 2025 state budget, lawmakers allowed a temporary redirection of those gaming revenues – a move Gov. Maura Healey branded as a one-time maneuver to free up $100 million for state spending during a tight budget year. But the 2026 state budget saw the Legislature again redirect the funds to priorities like transportation, education, economic development, and tourism. 
“Retrospectively, I think that’s when we should have really voiced concern that they’re touching the money at all,” Springfield’s chief development officer Tim Sheehan said in an interview. “From the Legislature’s standpoint – we did it once and we didn’t have any pushback, therefore, we’re going to take it again.”  
With funding for the CMF now stalled for two consecutive years, the Massachusetts Gaming Commission will use the small remainder of the funds – around $5 million – to award grants for fiscal year 2027. Those allocations will be significantly smaller than the ones in previous years, leaving the mitigation fund to run out of money unless funding is restored.  
The gaming commission has awarded nearly $80 million in grants from the CMF to eligible municipalities and entities since 2015. In 2024, the total amount awarded was approximately $22 million. Eight Gateway Cities are eligible for the funding, including Everett, Chelsea, Revere, Malden, and Lynn, because of their proximity to the Encore Boston Harbor casino in Everett, as well as Springfield, Holyoke, and Chicopee, because of the MGM Springfield casino.
The city of Lynn used a $200,000 grant to install dozens of surveillance cameras in public areas for increased safety. 
Holyoke used the funds to conduct a survey assessing harmful gambling habits in the area, according to Aaron Vega, Holyoke’s planning and economic development director.  
“Now that we have this data, what do I do with it?” Vega said. “I’ve got no funds to address it, whether that’s an educational campaign or targeting youth and seniors.”  
In Springfield, Sheehan said the funds have been used for fire equipment and police presence around the casino, as well as major improvements to sidewalks and street lighting near the casino. It also helped pay for improvements to neighborhood parks like Court Square. 
Springfield has been receiving around $3 million annually from the CMF since 2022, but the city is expected to receive just $360,000 in fiscal year 2027. (Springfield began receiving mitigation funds in 2016.) 
“Three million may not seem like a lot to Boston, but it’s a lot to Springfield,” Sheehan said. “Those funding resources for that type of programming are no longer going to be there.” 
In October, the Springfield City Council adopted a resolution calling for the restoration of casino mitigation funding for the city.   
“The Massachusetts Legislature recently allocated $10 million in mitigation funding to Eastern Massachusetts communities to address the impacts of the 2026 FIFA World Cup, while Western Massachusetts communities lost their casino mitigation support,” the resolution stated. 
Boston’s host committee for the World Cup games had requested $20 million for operations, transportation, and other expenses related to the event, which was included in Healey’s supplemental spending proposal. But the Legislature earmarked only $10 million. 
State Sen. Adam Gomez of Springfield filed an amendment to the fiscal year 2025 closeout supplemental spending bill that would have restored the statutory 6.5 percent allocation of total gaming tax revenues to the CMF, but it was rejected by the Senate in October. But Sheehan and Vega said the effort was too little too late, and state lawmakers representing the cities didn’t respond forcefully enough when the cuts were first proposed. 
“It happened. They didn’t question it. Then they were called out on it, and they tried to do something about it,” Sheehan said of the lawmakers. “The train had already left the station. That ball had already dropped.”  
Sen. Gomez did not respond to interview requests. CommonWealth Beacon also reached out to State Rep. Patricia Duffy of Holyoke and Rep. Bud Williams of Springfield, both of whom did not respond to interview requests.  
In addition to traffic and public safety projects, Vega said Holyoke has been able to use the mitigation funds to create the Explore Holyoke website and initiative, which supports tourism and small businesses in the city. Like many other projects, it’s something the city wouldn’t have been able to pay for themselves, he said.

“The city is not going to give me $20,000 a year to run the Explore Holyoke website. It can’t give me $15,000 a year to run a shuttle bus between Springfield and Holyoke for events. It wouldn’t be able to give me $15,000 to do a survey on gambling habits in the city,” Vega said. 
Local leaders appear to agree that the funds should be used locally for their original, intended purpose, despite the state’s budget woes. Vega said the state taking the money for itself was “a little bit of an insult.”  
In January, the Holyoke City Council will likely file a resolution like Springfield’s calling for the restoration of the funds, according to Vega. Even if the budget has passed, lawmakers could still restore casino mitigation funds through a separate spending bill.  
Funding for mitigation projects was promised to the community when the MGM Springfield casino was first being built in 2015, Sheehan said.  
“The bottom line is that this was the compact that was made between the host communities and the state,” he said. “Clearly, those promises that were made have now been broken.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/everettmayor-6-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-05 08:57:20.342611

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Coal-fired generators at the Intermountain Power Plant, located in Delta, stopped producing energy the day before Thanksgiving as its owners move to cleaner resources and Utah leaders search for buyers to avoid what they deem an early retirement of dispatchable energy. 
The plant owned by 23 Utah municipalities has been the subject of legislative action for years amid an effort to retire its coal-fueled operations in favor of a multibillion-dollar natural gas project known as IPP Renewed — meant to keep serving its main client, California, as it takes aggressive steps away from fossil fuels.    
“The coal units have been laid up in an operable condition while the state of Utah conducts its search for new customers for the coal-generated power,” said John Ward, spokesperson for Intermountain Power Agency. “But there they are no longer operating.”

That’s because of a law the Utah Legislature passed this year that forbade the Intermountain Power Agency from disconnecting switchyard equipment from its coal-powered facilities. Aiming to comply with that legislation, the agency kept one of the coal units connected to the switchyard, so if the coal unit is restarted it could immediately be connected to the grid, Ward said. 
Cox signs bill to keep coal plant open amid warnings of federal conflict

There aren’t any decommission activities in place for the units, which have a joint 1,900 megawatt-capacity — state law would also prohibit that. 
However, the state’s plans to secure buyers for the plant’s coal power aren’t ripe yet. Emy Lesofski, director of the Utah Office of Energy Development, said the Utah Energy Council that the Legislature created this year received 14 responses to an initial request for information process to gather data on companies to keep the coal units going. 
But, there’s still a long way to go before negotiations with potential buyers start.
Advocates from the Sierra Club highlighted in a news release that shutting down the units had no impact on customers, and questioned who should “shoulder the cost of keeping an obsolete coal facility on standby.”
“On one of the biggest holidays of the year, people’s lights stayed on and no one noticed that these coal units went offline. That silence speaks volumes: we don’t need to keep our communities tethered to outdated, dirty coal plants to maintain reliable power,” Zack Waterman, western manager for the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal Campaign in Utah and California said in a statement.
Before ceasing operations, the coal units had been working at low capacities for several years because the agency’s users hadn’t been calling on the power, Ward said. 
The plant was built to deliver most of its energy to California, which pledged to eliminate coal from its power supply.

“We were allowed to continue operating these plants under the existing power purchase agreements up until now,” Ward said, “but we were not able to continue to sell power to California after those agreements expired.”
In the meantime, the Intermountain Power Agency’s natural gas project is still under development, with one of the two planned units starting commercial operations last October, and the second scheduled to do the same later this month, Ward said.
The new facilities will also be able to use hydrogen to produce 840 megawatts and store the resource in underground caverns, which would allow them through its natural gas turbines anytime. 
“So it works like a battery, except batteries are good for hours. This can last for months or years, and it’s also much, much larger in scale,” Ward said.
The original power purchase agreement with California was scheduled to expire in 2027. With this new project, and without coal, they have been extended through 2077, according to Ward.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/020325_Intermountain-Power-Plant_03-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-05 08:57:20.342611

(Alander Rocha/Alabama Reflector)A joint legislative committee Thursday temporarily blocked four legal contracts after a senator on the committee raised objections to a lawsuit over the distribution of proceeds to local governments from the state’s internet sales tax.
The Contract Review Committee put holds on three legal contracts for Legislative Services and one by the Pharmacy Board. Sen. Greg Albritton, R-Atmore, the chair of the Alabama Senate’s General Fund committee, said Thursday he wanted to send a message that the Alabama Legislature is the final authority on the distribution of state tax revenue.
“This lawsuit, I think, didn’t need to be dropped (filed),” Albritton said in an interview with the media following the meeting. “I don’t think it should have been dropped. I think that lies directly between the Legislature’s purview and the legislative role. You don’t need to go to the judiciary. You don’t need to be impatient. You just come here and let’s work it out.”

While Albritton’s request pertains only to the contracts presented before the committee in December, he didn’t dismiss the possibility of continuing to hold future contracts until the matter is resolved.
“We’ll see how that develops,” Albritton said.
The city of Tuscaloosa and the city of Mountain Brook filed suit against  the Alabama Department of Revenue in August, arguing the internet sales tax, known as the Simplified Sellers Use Tax (SSUT),  violates the state’s constitution. It further argues some of the retailers who are part of the program should be disqualified because they are ineligible to be part of the alternative taxing program.
Walt Maddox, the mayor of Tuscaloosa, said in a statement on Thursday that several cities have been working with the Alabama Department of Revenue to fix the legal issues pertaining to the SSUT for nearly a decade.
“Seeking a legal remedy is not an action we have taken lightly; however, our responsibility is to protect our citizens, educate our children, and invest for the future,” Maddox said. “Unfortunately, SSUT jeopardizes these sacred responsibilities.”
Prior to the 2018 U.S. Supreme Court decision in South Dakota v. Wayfair, local taxing entities such as cities and counties could only collect sales taxes on businesses that were within their jurisdictions. The decision by the nation’s highest court overturned that precedent and allowed governments to collect sales taxes on commercial enterprises that are not located in the area but also conduct business through the internet.
Companies, however, may apply to be part of SSUT, which exempts them from collecting local sales taxes at 10%, and instead charge their customers the lower rate of 8% outlined in the rules governing SSUT.
Brick-and-mortar retailers have long complained that that gives Internet retailers a price advantage and makes it harder for them to do business.
Lawmakers changed the program in 2017 and placed more stringent requirements to be eligible for the program. It disqualified any business with a storefront or an affiliation with another business in the state.
The Association of County Commissions of Alabama has been traveling throughout the state to warn counties about the potential revenue loss that could happen because of the lawsuit. The organization expressed its concerns at the Montgomery County Commission in September. It said that several area municipalities could lose almost $200 million, according to a memo distributed at the meeting.
Montgomery County, according to the memo, received about $40 million in tax revenues because of SSUT, which could now be at risk.
Plaintiffs in the case allege that SSUT reduces the amount of revenue they could receive when retailers that are part of the program pay less in sales taxes because of commercial activity. According to the lawsuit, the city of Tuscaloosa is projected to forfeit about $14.6 million in revenues because of the difference in the amount that is collected from SSUT versus the traditional sales tax scheme.
“If they have a shortfall in revenue, they can raise the taxes,” Albritton said. “They have three, four, five-person councils. And all they need is two votes, or three votes, or whatever, to get it done. Here, we have to deal with 140 people plus the governor. So, if they want to raise a tax to improve their revenue, or if they want to tax something different, they can.”
Maddox said that Albritton displays a passion for his district similar to the way he has passion for the city of Tuscaloosa.
“Multiple solutions have been proposed since 2017, and I firmly believe as leaders with authentic conviction we can find a way forward,” Maddox said.

,California,2025-12-05 13:01:00+00:00,CalMatters,Assembly Speaker Rivas promises to scrutinize how California’s new laws work,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/dan-walters/2025/12/assembly-speaker-rivas-new-laws/,Speaker Robert Rivas says real legislative oversight of the effects of new laws will become regular practice starting next year.,"The California Legislature not only habitually passes legislation without considering downside risks, it also only rarely examines whether those new laws deliver the promised results.
The latter is called “oversight,” and while legislators often tout its virtues, only rarely do they seriously implement it. What are termed “oversight hearings” are often merely exercises in self-congratulation or vehicles for grinding political axes, rather than objective inquiries into efficacy.
Robert Rivas, the speaker of the state Assembly, says he wants to make real oversight a regular practice starting next year, terming it “outcomes review.”
“Passing laws is only the first step,” Rivas said in a statement as he announced the new effort. “The real test is ensuring they work. Gone are the days when laws can be signed and forgotten. The outcomes review tool empowers Assembly members to evaluate real-world outcomes, engage directly with residents, and refine our solutions for greater impact. It’s a forward-looking approach to oversight that every 21st century Legislature should adopt.”
The program includes identifying specific laws to be examined, scheduling hearings and community meetings to invite public comment on how the targeted laws are working and, finally, announcing what was learned and what, if any, changes need to be made to make the laws more effective.
Rivas said the new process would begin with four measures:

Assembly Bill 744, passed in 2019 and carried by Assemblywoman Cecilia Aguiar-Curry, a Davis Democrat, requires health insurers to cover medical appointments via the internet the same way as in-person treatments.
AB 2011, a 2022 measure carried by Assemblywoman Buffy Wicks, an Oakland Democrat, makes it easier to build housing for low-income families in commercial areas.
AB 488, a 2021 law authored by Assemblywoman Jacqui Irwin, a Democrat from Thousand Oaks, enables the state Department of Justice to regulate online charitable solicitations. 
AB 457, a measure passed this year and carried by Assemblywoman Esmeralda Soria, a Merced Democrat, streamlines permitting for farm worker housing.

On paper, what Rivas proposes makes a lot of sense. The Legislature should have always been checking up on the effects of its decrees, rather than assuming that what it does will automatically have the desired effects.
However, it appears that legislators will have to volunteer their bills for scrutiny, which could mean that only obviously successful ones will be subjected to the process. 
It’s difficult to believe that the turkeys — measures that are publicity stunts or payoffs to campaign contributors, for instance — will be scrutinized, much less those with unintended and negative consequences. 
If Rivas is serious about oversight, the most controversial measures should be on the list even if their authors don’t volunteer.
One of many examples: a measure Gov. Gavin Newsom signed in 2023 that raises the minimum wage for fast food workers to $20 an hour. Since it took effect, labor unions and the fast food industry have jousted over its impact.
The unions, backed by research from pro-union academics, have argued that the law increases economic security for fast food workers without having negative effects on employment or food prices. The industry counters that it has reduced fast food jobs, hastened the adoption of labor-saving technology and forced outlets to raise prices.
The situation cries out for objective research as part of an oversight process. California has two watchdog entities that could provide it, the State Auditor and the Legislative Analyst’s Office.
To be taken seriously, the Assembly’s new oversight process would have to tackle the tough bills, not just the low-hanging fruit, and ensure that the measures get rigorous and authoritative examination.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/081825-RedistrictingPress-MG-CM-05.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-05 08:57:20.342611

(Photos: Richard Bednarski and Jeniffer Solis/Nevada Current)A Nevada law that requires lobbyists to register within two days of attempting to twist the arms of state lawmakers has no teeth, says the Nevada State Education Association, following the Legislative Counsel Bureau’s decision to let violations of state law slide against a former governor, a union boss, and a consultant who lobbied lawmakers on behalf of the current governor.   
The NSEA, which represents teachers throughout Nevada except in Clark County, filed two complaints last month with the LCB regarding the failure of former Gov. Brian Sandoval, analyst Jeremy Aguero, and Clark County Education Association chief John Vellardita to file as lobbyists during the November special session. 
Lawmakers convened to consider several bills, including Assembly Bill 5, which, if passed, would have expanded Nevada’s film tax credit from $10 million to $120 million a year. The credits, issued to companies that invest in Nevada, are often sold at a discount to casino companies which use them to pay their tax liabilities. 
“Following the confidential investigation in this matter, each of the individuals named in the joint complaint registered as a lobbyist under the Lobbying Act,” LCB Acting Director Roger Wilkerson said in an emailed response to the NSEA on Tuesday, adding he had determined the three lobbyists’ compliance, albeit late, “carries out the primary public purpose of the Act” and would issue no sanctions. 
The law allows the LCB to suspend the lobbying privileges of violators.  
NSEA is questioning whether Wilkerson followed state law, which requires him to not only conduct an investigation, but also to report suspected violations to the Legislative Commission and the Attorney General, “who shall investigate and take any action necessary to carry out the provisions of this chapter.” Wilkerson did not respond to a request for comment.
A spokesman for Attorney General Aaron Ford was unaware of the office receiving a report.
Wilkerson’s assertion that the late registration resolves the matter indicates he found “suspected violations of law,” the NSEA’s legal team said via email.
Gov. Joe Lombardo’s spokesperson Elizabeth Ray confirmed Aguero worked on the film tax credit “for the Governor and consulted with state lawmakers on the potential fiscal impact of the bill. Jeremy was in compliance.”
“When an elected official reaches out and asks for assistance, I was always raised that there are only two appropriate responses: (i) “yes” and (ii) “yes sir/ma’am,” Aguero said Thursday via email, adding he learned from LCB that the current interpretation of the law suggests that providing “technical assistance” to a legislator “can require registration in Nevada. With that understanding, I was happy to make the appropriate registration as I suppose others will need to do as well.” 
Aguero did not respond to a subsequent email asking if he was paid.
Alex Marks of NSEA says Aguero’s assignment from Lombardo was to discredit the LCB’s non-partisan budget experts who warned the film tax credit would lead Nevada off a fiscal cliff. 
It’s the third time in two years that Aguero has been called out for failing to register. 
The first was in 2023, when he presented a bill with Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager to pump hundreds of millions of dollars of public money into a campus for the unhoused, and never disclosed he was working for Wynn Resorts. 
The second was when he presented Gov. Joe Lombardo’s 2023 special session bid to provide $380 million in public financing and incentives toward the construction of a major league baseball stadium on the Las Vegas Strip for the A’s, and again failed to disclose who he represented. 
Aguero subsequently went to work for the ball club, while simultaneously working for the Las Vegas Stadium Authority, a position he eventually left to avoid the appearance of a conflict.
Marks says NSEA’s complaint to the LCB “was more about the pattern we’ve seen since 2023” and the “powers that be that believe they’re above the law,” than just about Sandoval, Aguero, and Vellardita. “While the response to our complaint from LCB was largely non-responsive, they did confirm a violation.”
A complaint filed in 2023 by NSEA affiliate Schools Over Stadiums never got a response from the LCB. Wilkerson declined to provide one now, asserting it is confidential.    
The LCB’s refusal to disclose the outcome of the 2023 investigation, Marks contends, is at odds with Nevada law, which states its primary purpose is to “provide both disclosure and regulation of lobbying activities in order to promote and foster the people’s faith, trust and confidence in the honesty, integrity and fidelity of their representative government.”
The law states its provisions “must be liberally construed and broadly interpreted to achieve their intended public benefits,” and any uncertainty “must be resolved in favor of carrying out the public purposes… ”
“What would be the point of allowing any person to allege a violation and requiring the Director to investigate if the results of such an investigation were allowed to remain secret?” the NSEA’s legal team asked rhetorically.
Sandoval, who currently serves as president of the University of Nevada Reno, testified on behalf of UNR in support of the film tax credit. 
The former governor was seen meeting with legislators and “remained a presence around the building throughout Session despite being unregistered,” Marks of NSEA said via email, adding Sandoval had “just been named chairman of Resorts World the same day the Special Session was called.” 
Michael Flores, a government affairs specialist who works for Sandoval, noted the former governor has been UNR’s president for multiple legislative sessions, “and has represented the university in Carson City in different hearings on different bills, and has never been required to register as a lobbyist.”
Sandoval, as chairman of the Resorts World Las Vegas Board of Directors, now wields not only the influence of a university president and former governor, but also that of a gaming company executive with the ability to influence its political contributions. 
“I have not heard him say that he thinks there’s a conflict there,” Flores said. “He’s dedicated his life to public service in Nevada.” Nevadans can be assured Sandoval is representing UNR, not Resorts World’s interests, Flores says, by listening to his testimony.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/sandageroditta-1024x567.jpg,,,2025-12-05 08:57:20.342611

The company's old logo remains outside its former North Kansas City headquarters (Suzanne King/The Beacon).In January, hackers gained access to a cache of Cerner electronic health records stored on a legacy network.
But some patients whose sensitive health and financial information may have been exposed are only now being notified — and many others still haven’t been told.
NKC Health, formerly North Kansas City Hospital, is one of the most recent hospitals to let patients know about a cyber incident involving Cerner, now Oracle Health. The Nov. 25 notice said the hospital had only “recently learned” of the incident, which has been unraveling for months and reportedly dates back to January.
About a dozen hospitals across the country, including Mosaic Life Care in St. Joseph, Missouri, have sent similar notices to patients. Oracle has not publicly disclosed the number of hospitals involved or how many patients may have been affected.
But Elena A. Belov, a lawyer representing victims of the data breach in a federal class action lawsuit filed in the Western District of Missouri, said she has been told by Oracle’s attorneys that 80 hospitals’ patient records may have been involved. And that could amount to millions of victims.
“This is one of the most massive breaches in the health care industry in the last couple of years,” said Belov, who practices with the Almeida Law Group. “We still don’t know the entire universe. The list of affected hospitals has not been made public.”
Oracle Health, which acquired North Kansas City-based Cerner for $28 billion in 2022, did not reply to requests for comment about the incident. The company is the country’s second-largest electronic medical records vendor, managing patient data for about 20% of the nation’s hospitals and doctors’ offices.
News reports about the January data breach said it involved data on Cerner’s old network that had not yet been transferred to Oracle’s cloud network.
While details of the Cerner data breach began appearing in news reports last spring, and the company started informing customers about the incident this summer, Oracle did not announce it to the media, and left it up to its health care clients to report the breach to patients and to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Civil Rights’ Breach Portal.
“It goes to the big problem we have,” Belov said. “Even huge companies who are in the business of digital security like Oracle are not paying enough attention to security.”
 Health care data breaches are common

Data security experts said the Cerner network hack illustrates just how vulnerable patients’ health and financial information can be.
During the first 11 months of 2025, health care organizations reported 493 data compromises, which involved more than 34 million victims, according to the Identity Theft Resource Center, a nonprofit that tracks and works to prevent such incidents.
Until 2024, health care accounted for the most data breaches of any industry for six years in a row. But last year the financial industry took the top spot and health care came in second. The trend continued this year.

James E. Lee, president of the Identity Theft Resource Center, said health care is particularly vulnerable to cyber attackers because it is so large and diverse.
“There are small providers in small towns, all the way to huge multinational health care organizations and everything in between,” he said.
Health care involves hospitals, doctors, pharmacies, labs and insurance companies, all of which have access to patients’ personal information, including identity data like Social Security numbers, names and addresses; financial data like credit card information; and personal health information like diagnoses and medications.
All it takes to break in is one legitimate login and password at one point in the system. That leaves plenty of room for weak links, Lee said.
Companies like Cerner, which digitize health records so every doctor and hospital has easy access to patient charts, have become a major part of the system. From its beginnings in 1979, Cerner’s founders promised the electronic management of health records would cut costs and bring better care.
“The idea of digitizing the records — from a patient perspective — was a good one,” Lee said. “What we didn’t anticipate, and it is true across all industries, is the level to which professional criminals would become engaged. These are professional, multinational organizations, not some kid sitting in a basement drinking Red Bull.”
 NKC Health incident

NKC Health’s statement said its patients’ records may have been accessed as early as Jan. 22, but Oracle Health only informed them about the incident recently.
In its notice to patients, NKC said Oracle Health told the hospital that “law enforcement investigators” had urged it to delay notifying patients and hospital customers “because it could have impeded their investigation.”

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), the federal law that deals with patient privacy, requires health care providers and their associates to notify patients when sensitive information has been compromised “without unnecessary delay,” and no later than 60 days after an incident. But the law makes an exception if law enforcement requests a delay.
News organizations reported in March that the FBI was looking into the attack, and in April, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency issued a security alert, warning that “the nature of the reported activity presents potential risk to organizations and individuals.”
Oracle has informed some of its hospital and physician practice customers about the data breach individually.
Belov called the lack of transparency “really dismaying.”
“We’re losing valuable time for people to protect their information and their identities,” she said. “This is going to be a huge problem.”
 Stolen data comes with ‘deadly outcomes’

Legal and health experts said breaches of health care information can be among the most concerning.
Beyond the potential loss of Social Security numbers, names, addresses and credit card information, victims of health care data breaches also risk much more worrisome losses, experts said.
If health records are altered or in some way compromised in a data breach, doctors might lose critical information about a patient’s medications or health history. And that could lead to medical errors or decisions that compromise care and endanger a patient.
“Stolen health data can lead to deadly outcomes,” Belov said.
That’s why many hospitals and doctors offices end up paying a ransom to get data back from hackers. Health care organizations often won’t talk about hacks. They worry that would make them look vulnerable and expose them to additional problems.
But a cybersecurity expert with the American Hospital Association has estimated that at least a third of the time, hospitals end up paying a ransom to get information back. Unlike other industries that might be able to wait out criminals or rebuild databases, they need the information right away and can’t risk waiting.
“Patient lives are on the line when something critical happens,” said Alexander Boyd, a data privacy and security lawyer with the Polsinelli law firm.
Clients across industries regularly consult him about situations in which data has been compromised. And, among those cases, ransomware attacks happen “more often than we’d like.”
In those cases, criminals break into a company, encrypt the data and demand a payment to unlock it. When one of those attacks happens to a health care provider, it can be an emergency.
“It’s not just a money issue, it’s a well-being issue,” Boyd said. “If the health care provider doesn’t have good backups, sometimes the only option is to pay the ransom.”
Coveware, a company that helps clients respond to cyber extortion incidents, reports the average ransom payment made by victims of cyberattacks has been falling. In the third quarter of this year, the average ransom payment for all industries was $376.94, a 66% drop from the previous quarter. The median payment was $140,000, down 65%.
Boyd said companies are getting better at avoiding attacks in the first place. More often they have data backed up so they don’t have to make ransom payments.
But when a client does have to negotiate with a hacker, Boyd turns to Coveware or another firm that specializes in dealing with the criminals. Those firms know through experience how much the hackers may be willing to negotiate and whether they may actually turn over an encryption key if their demands are met.
Typically, after coming to an agreement — after, perhaps, sending sample files to verify that the hackers actually can unlock them — clients pay the bitcoin ransom (there is no escrow) and then wait for the encryption key.
None of it is comfortable.
“You hope and wait,” Boyd said.

(Photo courtesy Pamela Tsigdinos)The Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (TRPA) is so deep into group-think and committed to failed policies serving its pro-development partners that it has lost the ability to think critically to the detriment of Lake Tahoe.  
This bi-state agency governing Nevada and California’s Tahoe basin, ratified by Congress more than 50 years ago, was created “to adopt and enforce a regional plan of resource conservation and development” and “exercise various environmental controls and adoption of environmental threshold capacities over the Tahoe Basin.” 
In recent years, however, the agency and its layers of commission and committees have chosen to:

diminish once sacrosanct scenic quality thresholds 
dismantle once strict environmental safeguards established in the 1982 bi-state Tahoe Environmental Impact Statement 
allow ecological damage in Lake Tahoe and near its shore 
dress up pro-growth tourism policies with euphemisms like “cultivating community” and “destination stewardship” 
approve a large event center with promises that vehicle miles traveled (VMT) would be neutral yet the project’s traffic monitoring plan went uninstalled
strong arm counties into loosening land use codes.

While Lake Tahoe’s annual average clarity declined 15 feet from 2014, the agency inexplicably continues to push urbanization – increased building height, density, and coverage — along with streamlined approvals despite consistently voiced valid concerns. Some include:

radical land use changes likely to adversely impact lake clarity further; flooding due to more impermeable surfaces is as much of an issue as stormwater treatment
dramatically altering Lake Tahoe’s largely rural north, east and west communities damaging remaining fragile ecosystems 
ignoring aging limited infrastructure incapable of supporting intensified development
endangering the basin population and visitors during increasingly high-risk wildfire seasons 
foregoing income caps on intensive new development calling into serious question the agency’s claims that code changes are aimed at workforce housing. 

With TRPA’s history of caving to developers, more than a few seem to be holding out for more incentives. Others have used existing land holdings as bargaining chips tied to larger projects. 
For example, a real estate investment firm bought the north shore Tahoe Inn in 2007. It’s since become a boarded up motel near the Nevada-California state line. There have been repeated broken promises to take action. The property remains in blight. The same firm owns a large Tahoe ski resort that it’s looking to privatize. The investment firm’s founder also happens to be a founding member of the tony Tahoe Fund. Fund donors include at least one TRPA board member and many businesses with matters before the TRPA. This influential non-profit works with its resort, real estate, and business partners to generate funds through specific programs that create more tourism amenities the resort and business partners can advertise in return. 
Just inside the Nevada state line steps away from the derelict Inn sits another larger, poorly vetted, now boarded up project touted by the TRPA: a proposed Waldorf Astoria to replace an aging operating hotel. The developer shut down the hotel casino and later went into foreclosure without the promised demolition. This latest dilapidated Washoe Tahoe structure now leads in TRPA’s north shore competition for fire-risk eyesores. While Washoe County Commission Chair, TRPA governing board member, and Nevada Democratic gubernatorial candidate Alexis Hill read the motion for the now failed luxury project into the record at both the county and TRPA, she hasn’t brought it up publicly since.
At the agency’s latest governing board meeting, the executive director, in an ironic twist, sang praises for the agency’s COO. He is one of Nevada’s primary architects of the controversial 2012 Tahoe Regional Plan update that kicked off the Tahoe basin land use morass. This updated regional plan ushered in new incentive-based development without requiring environmental analysis commensurate with the proposed intensified development. It also weakened environmental standards.
TRPA’s latest move is to sweeten the pot further in phase three of its multi-phase march to continue to appease and entice deep-pocketed developers and real estate investors. Keep an eye on that Waldorf Astoria project. With phase three TRPA incentives it’s likely to resurface larger and more opulent than before. 
Reversing decades of environmental conservation
A lawsuit brought by the Sierra Club Tahoe Area Group in 2013 foresaw the folly that providing more power and influence to ambitious developers and speculators would bring. A 2013 interview in the Tahoe Quarterly laid out the worst case scenario:

“This new [TRPA regional] plan fails to recognize that an increase in buildings, rooftops and pavement will mean an increase in the amount of polluted rain and snowmelt—runoff that flows directly into The Lake,” says Laurel Ames of the Tahoe Area Sierra Club. “Stormwater from pavement and roads is the leading cause of The Lake’s loss of clarity. Allowing more pavement and roads seriously undermines efforts to clean up the once-pristine lake.”
“Ames says the TRPA never produced numbers demonstrating more clustered development will result in the critical mass necessary to fund a full-time public transportation network. She also notes that the idea of leveraging private dollars in an era of dwindling public funding is sound theory but does not want Lake Tahoe to serve as an experimental laboratory.
“What happens if they try it ﬁout at Tahoe and make a mess of it?” Ames asks. “The Lake loses. It’s a big risk. There is too much ‘don’t worry, it will work’ in this plan.”

Those words are as relevant today as when spoken 12 years ago. Well-respected environmentalist and former journalist Ames passed away earlier this year.

Current Sierra Club Tahoe Area vice-chair and retired environmental engineer Tobi Tyler noted at a recent TRPA meeting: “Conceding to development and recreational pressures will be the ultimate demise of the lake, which is already showing persistent severe summertime clarity problems. TRPA’s job is to protect the lake, not appease the hordes of tourists and moneyed interests.”
The agency’s more recent tactics and strategies include a potpourri of workshops, consultant-developed PowerPoint presentations, and a heavy dose of PR campaigns with word salads and hard to compute, fluid “bonus unit” formulas that include acronyms such as CFA, TAUs, and PAOTs. 
Persons At One Time (PAOT) are “allocations.” If new facilities involve recreation; they’re transferable (chapters 30, 33, 50 and 51). Commercial Floor Area (CFA) and Tourist Accommodation Units (TAU) became commodities to trade as laid out in TRPA’s “Sustainable Communities Program.”  Since rebranded “Cultivating Communities,” the program has taken the head-spinning formulas further.
This multi-phase, piece-meal ordinance approach, introduced in Tahoe county by county in Nevada and California have led to a series of significant land use code changes making it near impossible for the average citizen to make heads or tails of – and that’s by design. None of these changes ever make it to a ballot. Had they been put to a referendum they would never have seen the light of day. Instead, developers and privately funded quasi-governmental organizations lobby and get their way. 
Lake Tahoe faces severe risk from further urbanization
If past is prologue, the film “Lake Tahoe in Depth,” updated this year by the UC Davis Tahoe Environmental Research Center demonstrates that the Tahoe basin formed millennia ago by volcanic activity, glaciers and still active faultlines, which have (and can), lead to earthquakes and tsunamis now face human-driven threats, development, and climate change dangers. On its current trajectory Lake Tahoe will grow murkier with toxic algae blooms, microplastics, and invasive species. The film shows how urbanized land from the one city in the Tahoe basin, which sits on the south shore makes up just 11% of the Tahoe basin, but contributes nearly three-quarters of Lake Tahoe’s fine particle pollution. Particles carried into the lake are primarily responsible for the loss of clarity. 
Why TRPA wants to urbanize with more buildings, more people and more tourism defies logic. Long-time north shore resident John Eppolito, whose earlier career was as a math teacher, made this point to TRPA’s Advisory Planning Commissioners: “I would like to explore the logic behind [how] increasing the number of units decreases the miles traveled. My middle schoolers would have had a lot of fun with this logic.” 
Adding to the agency’s illogical approach, TRPA’s plan is to scope out an EIS after, not before development changes are codified. 
The December 17 governing board hearing and potential vote on the contentious Washoe Tahoe Area Plan ignores ongoing legal action against Washoe County for approving the plan amendments in August without considering “serious threats to public safety and wildfire evacuation.” 
The existing outdated Washoe County evacuation plan never included Tahoe’s millions of year-round tourists and day trippers. Those numbers continue to escalate, jeopardizing the evacuation risk of residents, workers and visitors alike, according to a 2024 independent wildfire simulation and analysis. A missing comprehensive evacuation plan for Washoe Tahoe and the absence of a comprehensive county environmental impact statement apparently aren’t enough to stop the TRPA from moving forward on the Washoe Tahoe Area Plan. Another lawsuit is ongoing against the Placer Tahoe Area Plan to Nevada’s west.
One of the Placer Tahoe plaintiffs, the North Tahoe Preservation Alliance’s president Ann Nichols, reprimanded agency leadership Nov. 19: “You can’t claim no net growth while enabling 3,316 new units. You can’t claim environmental thresholds while removing review. You can’t claim equity while producing market-rate housing with no income cap. You can’t claim public process while making decisions in working groups that don’t reflect basin residents.”
Other public commenters pointed to the agency’s lack of analysis and shifting boundaries and promises. “Public safety must come before upzoning,” said North Tahoe resident Niobe Burden.
Resident Helen Neff asked for a realistic evacuation plan and workforce housing. She noted: “the report itself acknowledges that even with reforms, significant cost/valuation pressures remain that will skew production toward high-value housing” and called the program an “illusion of workforce housing.”
Keep Tahoe Blue warned the agency to maintain the integrity of the development rights system and the regional growth cap and not allow incentives that could be used for market rate housing or short-term rentals. Echoing that sentiment was resident Melissa Soderston: “achievable does not mean affordable.”
An agency once made up of scientists and environmentalists whose primary goal was to protect Lake Tahoe from overdevelopment and urbanization is now mainly composed of self-congratulatory toadies who continue unabated on a reckless quest for development and in pursuit of grants and funding that will grow its budget and enrich its corporate partners.
Signaling to the market that the agency plans to sweeten its incentives, fast track approvals, allow property owners to put additional cash-generating investment structures on their land, and (wink, wink) sell it to the public as “achievable housing” with no income caps and a shoddy record of deed restriction enforcement does nothing to address the workforce conditions described by Pastor Jorge Herrera of St. Francis of Assisi: “workers that support the Lake Tahoe economy are being forced to live in crowded and unsafe conditions. As a priest, I go and visit families and see the conditions, how they live. You as the board have the power to do something about this.”
A functional government agency with proper oversight would examine this series of project and policy failures as a reason to make personnel changes or move in a different direction. That seems highly unlikely.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/laketahoepg-1024x763.jpg,,,2025-12-05 08:57:20.342611

(Joshua Bowling/Source NM)When a nonpartisan organization announced it would host a town hall meeting where candidates for the highest offices in New Mexico could discuss their plans to address climate change, it posted an online flyer with 10 candidates’ headshots.
By the time more than 100 people filed into an Albuquerque community college building on Thursday night to hear the candidates, only one gubernatorial hopeful stood before them.
Former Las Cruces Mayor Ken Miyagishima, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for governor, used his time behind the microphone to speak about his experience leading clean-energy initiatives in the state’s second-largest city. His fellow Democrats running for the position — former U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland and Bernalillo County District Attorney Sam Bregman — sent surrogates to answer questions on their behalf.

No Republican candidates participated in the event. Rio Rancho Mayor Gregg Hull and freshman state Sen. Steve Lanier (R-Aztec) are both in the race for governor and prominent cannabis CEO Duke Rodriguez has flirted with candidacy. Republican lieutenant governor candidate Manny Lardizabal also did not attend. Event organizers said they invited “all known” candidates for both races.
Three candidates for lieutenant governor — Loving Village Mayor Pro Tem Jackie Lee Onsuarez, state Sen. Harold Pope (D-Albuquerque) and New Mexico Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver — also attended in-person. 
Members of the exclusively Democrat panel disagreed on little and were not allowed to issue rebuttals during the event, which was sponsored by the nonpartisan group Healthy Climate New Mexico. All spoke broadly of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, embracing renewable energy sources and finding ways for the state to fund responses to extreme weather-related disasters.
Candidates had 90 seconds each to answer questions. An air horn signaling the end of each candidate’s allotted time often sounded before they discussed the details of their policy proposals.
The primary election for governor and lieutenant governor is June 2, 2026.
Greenhouse gas emissions
Throughout the night, candidates overwhelmingly agreed on the issues facing New Mexico. Everyone who spoke said their campaigns prioritize reducing greenhouse gas emissions across the state.

Schnurer, representing Bregman’s campaign for governor, said the state needs more regulatory oversight and enforcement of polluting developments. Miyagishima touted Las Cruces as being among the first cities in the state to install solar panels on municipal buildings and purchase electric buses.
Onsuarez, though, said the problem may lie in the Capitol building.
He praised the state’s Energy Transition Act that requires utilities to run on completely renewable energy by 2045, but said “we need to move faster.” He said implementing longer legislative sessions and term limits are important steps in doing so, echoing a November proposal from the Bregman campaign.
“We need to extend our legislative sessions — we need longer time so that environmental issues can truly be debated,” Onsuarez said.
Renewable energy
Similarly, candidates agreed the state should increasingly embrace renewable energy resources such as solar, wind and geothermal energy.
“We have the land, we have the wind, we have the sun,” Toulouse Oliver said.
Conservation Voters New Mexico CEO Demis Foster appeared virtually on behalf of Haaland’s campaign and said that Haaland believes New Mexico ought to be “the renewable energy capital of the country.” 
“She’s going to recruit more clean energy projects to our state that hire New Mexicans into good-paying union jobs, give them the training they need and lower energy costs,” she said. 
Discussions over renewable energy often do not focus on the logistics of powering homes, cars and businesses with wind, solar and geothermal sources. Modernizing the state’s energy grids and transmission capacity will be vital steps in implementing more renewable energy sources, Bregman’s campaign representative Schnurer said.
Bringing jobs to oil and gas towns
Most every candidate said that New Mexico’s elected leaders need to make in-roads to communities where oil and gas jobs are disappearing as the state transitions to cleaner energy sources. No one should have to choose between their health and a paycheck, they said.

“I think this is the story of New Mexico,” Pope said. “It’s been uranium mining, coal mining…this isn’t an option. We have to look out for oil and gas workers and those communities. We need to set up an oil and gas transition fund that would help the impacted communities with job training, apprenticeship programs and economic diversification.”
Foster said that while leading the U.S. Department of the Interior, Haaland worked to issue $775 million to 21 states to clean up orphaned oil wells and help workers transition to other careers. 
Water and extreme heat 
Moderators asked candidates how they would handle the ongoing drought affecting New Mexico’s water. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has made addressing the state’s water woes a priority and has proposed introducing treated brackish water and treated “produced water” — wastewater from oil and gas production — into the state’s strategic water supply.
Pope said he would “push back” on that, if elected. “That’s really toxic waste,” he said, calling the proposal an act of “greenwashing.”
As much as New Mexico feels the effects of drought, it also increasingly feels the effects of extreme heat. Candidates expressed interest in crafting state law similar to a recent Albuquerque ordinance, which requires landlords to furnish rental units with air-conditioning units. 
Money for climate-related disasters

Moderators asked candidates how they would respond to other extreme climate disasters, alluding to the Hermit’s Peak-Calf Canyon Fire and the fire and flooding in Ruidoso.
Across the board, candidates expressed interest in creating a state-managed “extreme weather resilience fund” that could take the financial burden off of rural and tribal communities during these episodes. 
State lawmakers passed and Lujan Grisham signed last April  Senate Bill 48, the Community Benefit Fund, which contains $210 million for communities to use for a series of projects to mitigate climate change impacts. 
“We’d (also) need to have a fund for remediation,” Pope said. “If we had something like that with what we’re dealing with with the fires up north and in Ruidoso, we could’ve done a lot to prepare but now we’re having to fund a lot of that remediation.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/townhall7-2048x1536-1-1024x768.png,,,2025-12-05 07:57:30.182853

Pennsylvania regulators will investigate a proposed rate increase by the state’s largest water and wastewater utility. The potential move could increase bills for some customers by more than 40%.
Pennsylvania American Water Co. (PAWC) filed the rate request last month, citing $1.2 billion in ongoing system improvements. The publicly traded company serves about 2.4 million people in 37 counties.
The state Public Utility Commission (PUC) voted unanimously Thursday to refer the proposal to its Office of Administrative Law Judge for investigation and recommendations on possible decisions.
The office’s process will include public hearings to gather testimony from concerned consumers and other interested parties, the PUC said in a statement. The commission will announce dates, times and locations for the hearings.

The utility’s proposal includes an increase of $168.7 million in total operating revenue. For a typical consumer (based on 3,263 gallons a month), the rate increase would translate into higher bills between $2.73 and $27.77 a month, depending on location. That’s between 9.8% and 41.1%, according to the PUC. 
Sewer bills would jump as much as $26.29 or 54% each month if the increase is approved, the PUC said. 
PAWC said in a statement when it filed the rate request that the additional revenue would support its plans to modernize and strengthen the water systems it operates throughout the commonwealth. The plans include replacement of 117 miles of aging water mains and 32 miles of sewer mains, removing and replacing lead service lines and addressing other contaminants, such as polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in drinking water.
PFAS are a type of manmade chemical used widely for nonstick cookware, stain-resistant carpets, and waterproof clothing because of their oil, water and heat resistant properties. Known as “forever chemicals,” they were also used in firefighting foam, which caused ground water contamination near military installations and firefighter training facilities. 
In addition to the rate increase, Pennsylvania American Water has also proposed a bill adjustment that would calculate sewer fees based on wintertime water use, when outdoor hoses and sprinklers are used less. It also requested permission to start a pilot program to support low-income renters in buildings without separate meters for apartments, who are not eligible for utility assistance, PAWC said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/SINK-WATER-NJ-ART--1024x669.jpeg,,,2025-12-05 07:57:30.182853

That sobering data point, shared with state lawmakers Thursday, comes as violent crime has dropped but remains far ahead of pre-pandemic figures. 
Police in Washington solved just 44% of reported violent crimes last year, said Marshall Clement, director of the Council of State Governments’ Justice Center. That amounts to solving 62% of homicides, 51% of aggravated assaults, 31% of robberies and just 25% of rapes.
“How low can this rate go before the entire criminal justice system is rendered useless?” Clement told a state House panel. “Nothing else in our criminal justice can even happen, rehabilitation, deterrence, incapacitation, unless we have a system that actually solves the majority of violent crime.”
Before the pandemic, Washington slightly outpaced the national average in its clearance rate for reported violent crime. Like the rest of the country, the percentage of cases Washington authorities were solving dropped during the pandemic, and has gradually rebounded since. 
Still, since 2022, over 49,000 violent crimes remain unsolved in Washington, including more than 400 homicides, nearly 29,000 aggravated assaults, almost 7,000 rapes and over 13,000 robberies, said Clement, citing FBI data.
Police departments in Seattle, Tacoma, Kent and Auburn are among those with particularly low clearance rates, defined as the percentage of crimes for which an arrest has been made, not necessarily a criminal conviction.
Washington isn’t alone. Half of states have slipped in their clearance rates since 2019. Nationwide, solve rates have been dropping consistently for over half a century. 
After years of rising crime since the pandemic, Washington saw some declines last year. Murders statewide dropped nearly 19% from 2023, with a total of 312 people killed, but that figure is still more than 50% higher than 2019, according to the Washington Association of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs.
Robberies were down 16%, creeping closer to 2019 levels. Meanwhile, a yearslong rise in assaults since the pandemic slowed but didn’t abate.
And preliminary figures show those drops continuing in 2025. 
Routinely not solving violent crimes creates a cycle of distrust in law enforcement that causes people to no longer cooperate with police, thus exacerbating the issue, Clement said. And people who commit crimes may feel emboldened to do more if they think they can get away with it. 
It’s up to the state to step in and help solve the problem, Clement said.
“This is not something local law enforcement can do alone,” he told the House Community Safety Committee. “It’s not something that state police can do or prosecutors can do alone. This is going to require leadership from you all to really make this a priority and to focus resources on improving these outcomes.”
Hiring difficulties
It’s not just about throwing money at the problem. While law enforcement expenses statewide have risen, better clearance rates haven’t come. And Washington continues to lag the rest of the country in police staffing. This contributes to longer response times, which leads to lower clearance rates, said Jeff Asher, a crime data analyst.
Asher called for creativity in using police resources to free up time to focus on these unsolved investigations. For example, New Orleans hired a civilian contractor to respond to car crashes that don’t cause injuries, so officers don’t have to.
“This isn’t the 1990s, it’s much harder to hire officers in 2025 than it was 30 years ago,” Asher told the committee. “So we need to think outside the box.”
After much strife, lawmakers this year approved a new $100 million grant program to boost police hiring. But the money can go for more than officers, like peer counselors, behavioral health personnel, crisis intervention training, emergency management planning and community assistance programs, among other spending options.
House Community Safety Committee Chair Roger Goodman, D-Kirkland, said he’d like to see more of that money go toward criminal investigations, as opposed to patrol. He thinks that would increase solve rates.
“I’m going to be making noise about that,” he said.
At this stage, it’s unclear if that would mean less state funding for the other spending ideas progressive lawmakers pushed to avoid the money solely going toward hiring more cops. 
“It’s all embryonic in its formulation right now,” Goodman said after the hearing.
To access the grants, cities and counties need to either implement a new 0.1% sales tax for public safety or have already imposed a similar tax. They also need to follow state model policies as well as collect and report use-of-force data. 
None of the $100 million has been spent yet.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/police-tape.jpg,,,2025-12-05 07:57:30.182853

Federal agents this week seized 73,000 products containing 7-hydroxymitragine, commonly known as 7-OH, from three Kansas City-area warehouses.
The seized products included things like power bars, pills and liquids shots that are made with a concentrate of 7-OH, which is the main opioid-inducing element in kratom. 
The action came out of a partnership between the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and U.S. Justice Department, according to the DOJ’s press release issued Tuesday.
“While 7-OH occurs naturally in trace amounts in the plant kratom, products containing 7-OH as an added ingredient can be dangerous,” states a civil forfeiture complaint filed on Nov. 21 in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri. “In the human body, 7-OH is able to bind to opioid receptors, raising concerns about its potential for abuse.”
7-OH products are advertised as improving chronic pain and “mental clarity,” and they are sold in Missouri smoke shops, gas stations, convenience stores and online shops. 
The FDA sent warning letters in June to the facility owners, Shaman Botanicals LLC and Relax Relief Rejuvenate Trading LLC, stating the 7-OH products were considered “adulterated” and their labels were illegal under federal food laws.
On Nov. 12 and 13, FDA officials did an unannounced inspection of the three facilities, where they tagged and detained 76,000 units. Vince Sanders, who owns Shaman Botanicals LLC, said the company had the opportunity to appeal the FDA’s action, which they did. Shaman was the first company to make 7-OH products, Sanders said.
The DOJ filed a complaint to seize the detained products on Nov. 21, and officials from the FDA and U.S. Marshal Service seized the tagged boxes on Tuesday.
“The 7-OH products seized are illegal under federal law and pose risks to consumers, including children,” said R. Matthew Price, U.S. attorney for the Western District of Missouri. “We are committed to helping American consumers protect themselves from dangerous chemicals posing as health products.”
Price said the department will continue to work with the FDA “to ensure illegal products never enter the stream of commerce and pursue all possible civil and criminal remedies against those who violate federal laws.”
Missouri AG launches investigation into manufacturers of kratom, 7-OH

However, Sanders told The Independent Thursday the seized units were only a small portion of the 7-OH products that were at the warehouse during the FDA’s November inspection. And his employees were allowed to continue making products while the federal agents were tagging and later seizing products in the warehouse. 
“This is the craziest part,” Sanders said. “We literally sat there continuing to make the same products that they were taking.”
Sanders said the agents explained that they were targeting the finished packages, but there were many more finished products in the warehouse than the ones that were detained and ultimately seized. 
In the FDA’s June warning letter, the agency deemed that 7-OH is a “new dietary ingredient.” The letter states that a dietary supplement is adulterated under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act if it contains a new dietary ingredient that doesn’t have enough evidence to show it isn’t dangerous.
“Because there is inadequate information available to provide a reasonable assurance that 7-OH does not present a significant or unreasonable risk of illness or injury, it is illegal to sell dietary supplement products containing it as an ingredient,” the release states. 
Sanders told The Independent in July that his company conducted three research studies on the products, including using rodents and beagles, which he believes shows the products are safe.
“This is just destroying something that has the potential to save hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of lives long term,” Sanders said.
He said there will likely be a hearing on the recent action in the next few weeks.
On the same day the DOJ’s complaint was filed on Nov. 21, Missouri Attorney General Catherine Hanaway sent “civil investigative demand” letters to Sanders’ company and six other producers and distributors of 7-OH products.
The letters mandate the company hand over multiple types of documents, including lab test results, research on health risks and safety label information.
Consumers, Hanaway said in a press release, “may be exposed to unapproved, unsafe and deceptively marketed opioid-like drugs.”
According to the letters sent to each company, the attorney general’s investigation targets the distribution of products containing 7-OH or “any part of the plant Mitragyna speciosa,” which is the kratom plant.
“We are deeply concerned,” Hanaway said, “that Missourians are being sold drug-like substances under the guise of harmless supplements, with no FDA approval, no safety testing, and in some cases no meaningful disclosure of what these products actually contain.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-04-at-5.33.16 PM-e1764891668919.png,,,2025-12-05 07:57:30.182853

Tragically, she not only lost her 20-week pregnancy, her young son required hospitalization and surgery due to a severe Campylobacter and E. coli infection linked to the raw milk.
Her story illustrates a painful truth: parents trying to protect their children’s health are increasingly misled by misinformation amplified by people entrusted to lead and safeguard the public.
As we look back on 2025, the data paint a sobering picture of a nation backsliding on basic public health protections. We have witnessed a resurgence of preventable diseases, with alarming statistics:

Measles: 1,753 cases, with 12% hospitalized and three children losing their lives.
Whooping cough: 25,000 cases and three infant deaths.
Influenza: Low vaccination rates and the highest pediatric death count since national reporting began—280 and climbing.

These epidemics were preventable. Together, they underscore not only the life-saving role of vaccines, but the necessity of a robust public health system — one rooted in facts, scientific principles and transparent communication.
That system is now under direct assault. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his allies have systematically weakened the nation’s health-protection infrastructure through funding cuts, staffing reductions and sweeping personnel firings. Under the banner of “radical transparency,” they have reframed well-established scientific facts as open questions.
The effect is predictable: sowing doubt, discrediting science and undermining evidence-based medicine.
As the public is encouraged to focus on the extremely small risks associated with vaccines, genuinely dangerous products are quietly pushed into the mainstream under the banner of “natural wellness.” The messaging often aims to make parents feel guilty for relying on science rather than appearing “wholesome” or “pure.”
The consequences are already visible. The CDC website — which for decades served as the global gold standard for authoritative scientific information — now includes statements that are scientifically false, including the assertion that “vaccines do not cause autism is not an evidence-based claim.”
Such messaging distorts decades of research, depriving American families of a trusted and impartial source of truth.
When a claim is simple, anyone can evaluate it. If someone insists a cat is a dog, the truth is obvious.
But complex scientific questions require years of specialized training. Most families do not have medical experts at home to help interpret these issues. Historically, Americans relied on public-health agencies for accurate guidance on vaccines, infectious diseases, and emerging threats. Today, that option is eroding.
Layer onto this a chaotic online environment, where misinformation spreads instantly, sometimes through automated or coordinated accounts, and families are left vulnerable. Dangerous products are marketed as “natural,” while genuinely life-saving tools like vaccines are recast as suspect. In this vacuum, parents searching for answers about autism or other medical conditions become political pawns.
When government websites obscure evidence and present falsehoods, it’s simply propaganda — and it puts families at risk.
Parents today face an unusually complex information landscape. The cost of this war on science will be measured in American lives if the integrity of our public-health agencies is not restored.
Let’s breakdown some key pieces of misinformation:
 Are vaccines linked to autism?

This myth began with a discredited 1998 study by Andrew Wakefield, funded by lawyers preparing to sue vaccine manufacturers. The paper was later retracted, and Wakefield lost his medical license. Yet the myth persists.
High-quality studies — including one tracking more than 657,000 children — find no association between the MMR vaccine and autism.
Other claims focus on aluminum adjuvants. A 24-year study of more than 1.2 million Danish children found no link between aluminum-containing vaccines and any autoimmune, allergic, or neurodevelopmental disorders. For context: while children receive about 3 mg of aluminum from vaccines by age two, a breastfed infant consumes 7 mg in the first six months of life.
Thimerosal, a preservative once used in some vaccines, has also been falsely implicated. The work of Mark and David Geier, early proponents of the thimerosal-autism claim, has since been discredited for flawed methodology, and both have faced professional sanctions. A landmark Danish study compared autism rates before and after thimerosal was removed from vaccines in 1992 and found no association.
Despite this overwhelming evidence, RFK Jr. has now appointed David Geier — an individual with a long, well-documented record of scientific misconduct — to investigate whether vaccines cause autism. This is not only a reinvestigation of a question that has been definitively answered; it reflects a troubling full-circle moment.
The original autism–vaccine myth grew from research funded by those seeking to sue vaccine manufacturers. Now the individual leading the nation’s health-protection agency has himself profited from lawsuits targeting vaccines and is using federal resources to search for evidence that what decades of science show does not exist.
This cycle doesn’t advance public health—it erodes trust and diverts attention from the real work of protecting American families.
 Is Ivermectin effective for cancer or COVID-19?

No clinical trial has shown that ivermectin improves survival or outcomes for cancer patients or individuals with COVID-19. Despite this, some states, including Texas, have made the drug available over the counter, increasing the risk of misuse, overdose, and avoidable harm.
 Why do autism diagnoses appear to be increasing?

It is important to recognize that diagnostic criteria have broadened significantly from DSM-I (1952) to DSM-5 (2022). Increased awareness, expanded definitions, and better access to services may all contribute to rising diagnosis rates.
 More Changes Coming

Earlier this year, RFK Jr. dismissed all 17 members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), the federal advisory committee responsible for providing vaccine recommendations to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
This week, the committee is slated to review Hepatitis B vaccine recommendations. Unfortunately, vaccine experts within the CDC have been excluded from the discussion once again. It is difficult to see how implementing policy without a sound scientific basis or rationale will enhance public health. State-level leaders must carefully consider the importance of offering clear, scientifically grounded guidance in the vacuum of public health leadership.
Parents today must navigate an unusually complex information environment. As health professionals, our responsibility is to provide clear, accurate data; answer questions respectfully; and support families in making informed decisions.
Regardless of political viewpoint, our shared goal is the same: healthy children, strong communities, and a future where preventable illnesses no longer claim young lives. To achieve this, we must prioritize science, restore trust in our health institutions, and push back against misinformation.
Together, we can safeguard the next generation and ensure that preventable diseases do not take more innocent lives.",,,,2025-12-05 07:57:30.182853

(Courtesy photo)In recent years, the Indiana Commission for Women has thrown a lovely event to honor Indiana women with Torchbearer Awards.
A plated meal in a well-appointed banquet room or historical setting; women coming up on stage to be recognized for their accomplishments and efforts. It was the highlight of the commission’s year.
But this year, there was no public event. No cheesecake dessert or stage or round of applause from hundreds of attendees. Instead, the five Torchbearer honorees received their awards in a private meeting in the governor’s office. Reporters weren’t even invited.
“We believe this format was best suited to give these exceptional women a personal audience with the governor and allow time for conversations about the important work they do,” said Griffin Reid, press secretary for Gov. Mike Braun.
But it’s really a part of a larger move away from highlighting women and minorities, including state contracting programs.
The commission has been around since 1992 by executive order and since 1996 by statute. Its mission is to “elevate the well-being of women in Indiana by understanding their needs and supporting their active involvement in all areas of society.”

Similarly, the Torchbearer Awards were created in 2004 to celebrate the achievements of talented women across diverse industries and roles with Indiana.
“A Torchbearer epitomizes a trailblazer who, through her courage, resilience, and compassion, emerges as a guiding light. Leading by example, she sparks inspiration, igniting a flame that illuminates pathways for others to follow,” the website says.
“Titled ‘Torchbearers,’ these remarkable women carry forth the torch for Indiana’s women to follow. The statue of Victory atop the Soldiers and Sailors Monument at Monument Circle was chosen to symbolize these awards. Victory embodies the character and achievements of our esteemed recipients, while the flame she holds aloft not only beckons other women to follow but signifies the brilliance Hoosier women have brought to our state and communities.”
Before Braun took office in January, the Indiana Commission for Women had its own line item in the state budget of $113,601 annually. That’s now gone.
The women’s commission is ostensibly part of the Civil Rights Commission now, which provides administrative support for the group and four other cultural commissions.
The other four, though, kept their funding line items — albeit slightly reduced. The Civil Rights Commission also had its budget cut by lawmakers and the governor.
In addition, the Indiana Commission for Women hasn’t met all year — aside from a January meeting that was scheduled before Braun took over.
Brooklyn Marrs, from the civil rights commission, said a May meeting didn’t have a quorum but the executive committee met in July.
“The Indiana General Assembly did not approve an allocation for the Indiana Commission for Women for this budget biennium. There are no specific staff members assigned to the ICW, but the Indiana Civil Rights Commission team is providing administrative support.
It’s a shame that we have reached a point that programs to honor or recognize women have been scuttled.
It was only 100 years ago that women were able to vote. Heck, it was 1988 when Congress eliminated the requirement that women have their husband or another man co-sign for business loans. 1988!
It seems obvious to me that women have some more progress to make before we can reach true equality, and if that means an annual public event to tout successes I’m all for it.

(Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)For nearly a year now, state officials have been wrestling with a surprisingly difficult question: where do you put a 4-ton bronze Marcus Whitman? 
The statue, which occupies the north portico of the Washington state Capitol, is so heavy it threatens the integrity of the building. Moving it outside exposes it to the weather and vandalism. Finding a new indoor space requires costly structural engineering. And placing it next to the forthcoming statue of Billy Frank Jr. is appropriately off the table.
But after months of meetings, alternatives, and six separate location proposals, the state is still circling around the same flawed assumption: that the Whitman statue must be saved.
It doesn’t.
If we want to be honest about how we commemorate our past, Washington should consider an option officials haven’t yet put on the table: dismantling or otherwise retiring the statue.
This isn’t about erasing history. It’s about stopping the long-running mistake of elevating a myth.
A manufactured legacy
Whitman’s story is familiar to anyone who passed through the Washington public school system before the last couple of decades. The missionary-doctor who “saved the Oregon Territory” through a heroic ride east, an early frontier morality tale.
But generations of historians have undercut that myth. The story wasn’t merely exaggerated; it was manufactured. It was deployed to justify white settlement, minimize Indigenous sovereignty, and frame American expansion through a Christian nationalist lens.
The statue in Olympia was installed for that purpose. The program for its 1953 dedication spells out the message in stark terms: Washington’s political leaders openly used Whitman to elevate a factually wrong, racially exclusionary narrative of the region’s past.
The object itself embodies that propaganda campaign. Keeping it upright on our state Capitol grounds, no matter where it’s placed, keeps the old story upright as well.
Part of this quandary exists because the state never established a clear process for removing outdated monuments.
In 2022, state Sen. Sam Hunt proposed a thoughtful framework that would have given the Department of Enterprise Services clear authority to relocate or retire statues under conditions such as structural necessity, modern cultural evaluation, or legislative direction.
That bill didn’t pass. As a result, agencies are now improvising a process with committees, stakeholder groups, public comment, and months of studies. The result is we’re spending time and resources trying to preserve an object we have no public obligation to maintain.
Letting go
Statues are tools of commemoration, not historical records. We don’t honor someone in bronze so future generations can learn about them; that’s what museums, archives, books, and classrooms are for. We honor someone in bronze because we want them to literally loom over our civic space.
Whitman can and should remain part of our historical record. But the argument that removing a statue “erases history” has it backwards. Leaving a monument built to support a discredited myth actually obscures history. It keeps the lie visible and the truth buried in specialist texts.
The Legislature recognized this when it voted in 2021 to replace Washington’s Whitman statues with representations of Billy Frank Jr., whose leadership on treaty rights, salmon recovery, and environmental justice shaped modern Washington. The question now is not whether Whitman should continue to serve as a symbol of the state. The Legislature already answered that.
The question is why we are still trying to find him a place of honor.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/marcus-whitman-1024x597.png,,,2025-12-05 07:57:30.182853

The owner of a Johnson property worth $240,000 was offered about $40,000 by FEMA. “I feel like the mortgage company got their money, the town’s getting our property, and we’re getting sh-t,” Mandy Lacefield said.

This story by Aaron Calvin was first published in News & Citizen on Dec. 4, 2025.
Nearly two and a half years ago, Mandy Lacefield and her husband, Matt, woke in the night as dark water seeped into their home in Johnson.
Lacefield and Matt, trapped in their home on River Road West overlooking the confluence of the Lamoille and Gihon rivers, had to be evacuated the night the river broke its banks on July 11, 2023, devastating Johnson with one of the worst flooding events to hit the town in nearly a century.
In the aftermath, there was the cleanup, the dragging out of all their worldly belongings, now soaked with sewer sludge and refuse. At the same time, they had to meet tight deadlines to submit vital documents to the Federal Emergency Management Agency if they wanted any assistance from the federal government.
While the American Red Cross workers who showed up in the aftermath provided unquestioning support, Lacefield noted, FEMA gave them a checklist and a timeline. Lacefield and her husband scrambled to locate birth certificates and social security cards in the sodden wreckage.
Even after the deluge and destruction, Lacefield, who grew up in town, wanted to keep her home. After scraping and saving, she and Matt had moved into the home in the village in 2019 and spent the first few years renovating its interior, unchanged since it was built in the 1970s.
While they waited to hear from FEMA, they were effectively made homeless. Flood insurance only covered the remaining mortgage on the home. FEMA couldn’t assist them in finding temporary housing because Lacefield refused to part with her pets, which she had owned for over a decade.
After promising to park a temporary mobile home at her father’s property on Ober Hill Road on the north end of town, the agency canceled those plans after weeks of wrangling over what Lacefield said were minor septic capacity issues on the property.
She wasn’t alone. The agency had initially promised to set up 20 such homes in Montpelier but ended up backing out by the end of 2023 and providing the town with monetary compensation instead, according to VTDigger.
She ended up acquiring a camper trailer, whose owner had originally listed it for $5,000 but instead donated it to Lacefield after learning she had been displaced by the flood. Waiting on the trailer home promised by FEMA, she did not weatherize the makeshift home and spent a frigid winter in the camper.
A year after she was first displaced, Lacefield said she was informed by FEMA that the agency would not assist in restoring the home to its former state, and would only provide monetary assistance for elevating the home or through a property buyout, a process which would compensate Lacefield and make town owner of the land.
Two years after Mandy Lacefield and her husband, Matt, were evacuated as the river destroyed their home, Lacefield finally received an offer on her property. Despite her home being appraised by FEMA at a pre-flood value of $240,000, she was offered just a fraction, about $40,000. Courtesy photo
Both of Lacefield’s neighbors on River Road West have also pursued buyouts, as has the owner of the former Sterling Market on the far side of the river, through a separate federal program.
Federally aided home elevation is just as arduous, if not more, than the property buyout process, and appealed to Lacefield even less, so she went with the latter option.
Two years after she and her husband were evacuated as the river destroyed their home, Lacefield finally received an offer on her property. Despite FEMA appraising the property at a pre-flood value of $240,000, Lacefield was offered just a fraction of that — about $40,000. She said the agency justified the low appraisal based on the home’s flood insurance, which made the bank that held the mortgage whole but went no further.

“I feel like the mortgage company got their money, the town’s getting our property, and we’re getting sh-t,” Lacefield said.
Lacefield is set to close on the buyout process later this month. Earlier this year, her dad died, providing a bitter solution to her search for viable shelter — his Ober Hill home. Despite nearing the finish line of a process that was supposed to help her move on from the worst moment of her life, she said it feels like it’s still happening, and FEMA’s slow process and meager assistance at the end of the wait has offered little consolation.
“It still feels like a living nightmare, and it’s never ending, and I want to wake up from it,” Lacefield said.
Getting closure
In the aftermath of the July 2023 flood, and faced with the prospect of increasingly severe and frequent floods as the climate in Vermont warms, the state, in an effort to shift the settlement patterns in towns along once-commercially crucial rivers, pledged to provide a portion of its federal COVID-19 recovery funds to help FEMA fund property buyouts.
Lacefield is one of 17 residential property owners in Johnson who have pursued buyouts. Just five of those have concluded the process or are scheduled to conclude it soon, according to Sarah Henshaw, a coordinator with the Lamoille Area Recovery Network, a group founded in the aftermath of the flood of July 2023 — and funded by the United Way of Lamoille County — to assist people affected by the disaster.
It’s a similar picture elsewhere in Lamoille County.

Of the eight owners of single-family homes in Wolcott who pursued a buyout — five of which were funded by the state instead of FEMA — only one has not concluded the process.
In Cambridge, just one of the seven buyout properties, including three multi-family buildings accounting for 10 units, has reached its conclusion. Morristown and Elmore each have one buyout property, both still in limbo.
For some who have reached the conclusion of the property buyout process, Henshaw said, it hasn’t brought solace or left them financially better off.
In one case, FEMA offered less than the mortgage holder says is due, saddling the former property owner with debt. Another is having to seek legal remedy after a flood insurance provider mandated by the property’s mortgage holder paid out less than previously promised. One property went into foreclosure by the time the buyout process was concluded, as the former owners could not afford to keep up mortgage payments on both a habitable residence and their destroyed home.
Other complicating factors have further slowed FEMA’s progress. A home was initially misclassified by the state and federal inspectors delayed the process by six months, according to Henshaw. The agency’s assistance program for renters, which aids tenants who would be displaced by the buyout of a multi-family property, is also complicating and slowing those buyout cases.
In October, Grist, a climate-change focused nonprofit news site, reported that Vermont Emergency Management was put under increased scrutiny from FEMA after overspending millions in federal funding on an expensive consultant company after flooding in the Northeast Kingdom in 2024. Despite this, spokesperson Mark Bosma said a state program that provides support for displaced renters will continue in 2026.
“We have a group of people in our community that were very good, solid, middle-class people, contributing members of our community, that now have financial problems,” Henshaw said.

Phil Murphy launched last year.,"LaShawn Fitch was so excited to FaceTime friends after he was released from prison that he did so before even leaving the prison grounds on Dec. 4, 2025. (Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)BRIDGETON — For 17 years, LaShawn Fitch has fought for his freedom, saying he never participated in the 2008 murder in Eatontown that landed him behind bars on a 40-year prison term.
Thursday, he was released from South Woods State Prison to an impatient, joyful crowd of family and other supporters, after Gov. Phil Murphy commuted his sentence last month. He was one of 283 people to get clemency so far under a sweeping initiative Murphy began last year.
Although he walked out the prison doors two hours later than scheduled, he loitered in the cold sunshine across the street to hug loved ones, FaceTime friends, give a speech, change into an outfit his mom brought, make sure boxes of legal paperwork got into the right car, muse about his future, and do any other number of things besides leave.
“C’mon, you got to get off of these prison grounds,” supporter Derrick Hamilton told him after about 40 minutes. “You’ve been here long enough.”
So everyone hit the road home. But Fitch said he’s far from done with the prison system.
“I’m not going to stop until my name is exonerated,” he said. “I’ve been helping brothers with lawsuits. I still got three, four pending lawsuits against prisons right now … So just know this: This is just being written. We still going. We moving forward.”

Fitch’s fervor is unsurprising to anyone who knows him.
At New Jersey State Prison in Trenton, he became a paralegal and eventually director of the inmate legal association, a prisoner-run group in some prisons that helps incarcerated people with court filings. He has filed grievances, sued the state, and spoken out publicly over everything from better computer access for incarcerated people to solitary confinement to pandemic restrictions that lingered long after the crisis ended. He suspects he was transferred from Trenton, where he’d spent most of his time incarcerated, to South Woods, the state’s largest lockup, as retaliation for his prison activism, so he sued over that too.
Thursday, he took advantage of the moment to continue agitating for change. He thanked Murphy for his “courage and boldness” in granting more than twice as many clemencies as previous governors combined in the past 30 years — and then he called on Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill to carry on the work.
“There’s so many deserving brothers and sisters that need the opportunity that I get today,” he said.
He also blasted New Jersey’s worst-in-the-nation racial disparities in its prison population and urged lawmakers to act on Murphy’s stalled plan to stop sending technical parole violators back to prison. Those are people who break the conditions of their parole, rather than get charged with new crimes.
Two exonerees joined Fitch’s family outside the prison to cheer his release — Hamilton, who left prison 14 years ago after his wrongful conviction in a New York case, and Sean Washington, who was exonerated in 2020 in a Camden case and befriended Fitch when both were incarcerated in Trenton.
Both men beamed at Fitch as he flitted among his relatives for hugs and high-fives, remembering well the days they finally saw freedom.
“I like to say we left in the Flintstone era and came back in the Jetsons era. Everything is so fast, these phones, this technology, you know, everything’s changed over the years. It’s a rough transition,” Washington said.
Hamilton thinks Fitch will be just fine. Hamilton is now the deputy director of Cardozo School of Law’s Perlmutter Center for Legal Justice, and his center has been investigating Fitch’s case for two years with the goal of clearing his name.
“We going to do everything we can to find the evidence that we can to exonerate him,” Hamilton said. “We take our time. We want to make sure we get it right.”

Murphy has taken a categorical approach to clemency to make it fairer, considering cases that fit certain categories, including those with excessive trial penalties. That’s when a defendant refuses a pretrial plea bargain and exercises their right to trial, only to get a much longer sentence after conviction. Prosecutors had offered Fitch a 20-year plea bargain, but he opted to go to trial because of his innocence claim — and then got 40 years.
The state has also increasingly trended toward leniency for juveniles in criminal trouble. Fitch was 17 — just one year older than his son is now — when the murder that derailed his life occurred.
He’s now 35. Soon, he will join father Anthony Robinson’s remodeling business until he can resume his legal work. He aims to be a lawyer — though that is not news to his family. He represented himself at his 2014 trial after he lost faith in his assigned counsel. He also wrote a book, titled “A Prisoner’s Plight,” that he hopes to get published, and he plans to start a nonprofit called Justice for Jersey and a podcast to feature the stories of those granted clemency.
“I carry full and wholeheartedly the spirit of a fighter. I’m going to continue to fight,” Fitch said.
But first, sweet potato pie.
His aunt Tereasa Robinson was up at 4 a.m. making several pies, and his mother, Barbara Robinson, said the family planned a belated Thanksgiving celebration at her Jersey Shore home with collard greens, macaroni and cheese, fried chicken, and more of Fitch’s favorite foods.
“Today is an amazing day. I’m just so overjoyed,” his mother said. “This is surreal. It’s surreal. I don’t have many words other than this is just surreal.”

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)Assembly Minority Leader Greta Neubauer (D-Racine) told the Wisconsin Examiner in a year-end interview that Democrats have spent the past year preparing to lead and she is optimistic about the chances for flipping the Assembly. Neubauer reflected on the current session and previewed what’s ahead.
The effect of smaller margins and the remainder of session
This session has been different from previous ones, said Neubauer, who was first elected to the state Assembly in 2018 and has led Assembly Democrats since 2022. 
“Closer numbers in the state Assembly and state Senate have yielded some more bipartisan work,” Neubauer said. Republicans hold a 54 to 45 majority in the Assembly, and a 18 to 15 majority in the state Senate. 
She felt the difference this year  from her first seven years in the body, she said, when Democrats were “in a position where we really were on defense and having to spend a huge amount of time just trying to prevent the worst policy ideas from going through.”
That work across the aisle, she said, was evident in the state budget, when Senate Democrats had a seat at the negotiating table and were able to secure more money for public schools. She also sees a difference in some of the housing bills that recently passed the Legislature. Neubauer said that Assembly task forces focused on children’s social media use and elder care also allowed for discussion across the aisle and she is hopeful they will yield some bipartisan legislation.
Still, she said, the session hasn’t yielded everything she had hoped for. 
“We have not seen the kind of movement that I would have hoped, especially given that we’re  all up for election next year, and everyone’s going to have to go home and answer to their constituents for what was and was not accomplished.”
Neubauer said Republicans have continued to “ignore” the core challenges facing Wisconsinites, which for the most part center on costs. 
“That’s what we hear over and over from the people that we represent,” Neubauer said, noting several issues where Democratic lawmakers have introduced proposals or advocated for action. “There’s been no interest from our Republican colleagues on addressing the cost of prescription drugs and health care, especially in light of the [Affordable Care Act] premiums going up in a significant way. We have had a bill out for the entire session on Healthy School Meals. This would save the average family with two kids $1,800 a year. People would really appreciate that money right now, especially going into the holiday season, but we’ve had no interest from our Republican colleagues in addressing that issue…. and we do need to see more movement on housing and on child care.” 
Neubauer also noted that a bill to extend postpartum Medicaid remains stuck in the state Assembly due to opposition from Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester). Democratic lawmakers tried to force a vote on the issue during their last scheduled floor session this year, but failed. 
Neubauer said she still hopes that measure could advance next year in the time remaining in the session. 
“We know that people across the state believe that new moms should have access to health care. It’s essential for mom and baby… You do have to ask why [Rep.] Pat Snyder and [Rep.] Jessie Rodriguez, authors on that bill, are not able to get it done when they are governing,” Neubauer said. “They’re in the majority, and they have been for a long time.”
Despite the gridlock on certain issues, Neubauer said Democratic lawmakers have been able to think differently this year. 
“We are able to think about what bills are we going to pass when we’re governing. How can we work across the aisle and use our numbers to get things done and put pressure on Republicans to make the bills better if they need our support,” Neubauer said. “I do think that we are preparing to govern in that way, and we’re really working over the next several months to get more input from our constituents on the things that are important to them to make sure that our agenda and our plan for the first hundred days is really tuned to the particular challenges that people are facing.” 
Democratic lawmakers have spent the session introducing and advocating for bills on a number of issues including K-12 education, higher education, local government and elections. Most haven’t advanced or received a public hearing, but they are laying the groundwork for the future. 
“The bills that we’ve rolled out this fall would be things we would absolutely do when we come into the majority,” Neubauer said. “We also know there are some pretty essential rights and freedoms that we would want, things like enshrining access to abortion in state law, in case there are further court cases that would put that at risk.” 
Neubauer said Democratic lawmakers will have additional bills coming out in the next few weeks and in 2026, addressing public safety, housing and health care. She declined to provide details on what those proposals might do.
Neubauer said her caucus will continue to push for additional education funding in the fall, including general aid. This year the state budget included additional funding for special education, but Republican lawmakers refused to provide an increase in general aid — something that public school leaders and advocates have said will strain their budgets and put pressure on property taxpayers. 
“We have failed to adequately fund our local public schools and what we see from Republicans is [a plan to] consolidate districts and close local schools. No one’s asking us for that,” Neubauer said. “They’re asking us to maintain that essential funding that will allow their kids to attend a grade school where they get a good reading and math education, they’re safe, and they’re prepared for their future career.”
Neubauer also commented on a handful of other issues that the Legislature is grappling with.

Neubauer called WisconsinEye, the independent, nonprofit service that provides coverage of Wisconsin state government similar to C-Span, “essential.” WisconsinEye has announced it will have to cease operations Dec. 15 if it does not receive more funds. She said she thinks there is a bipartisan understanding of the service the network  provides and is hopeful lawmakers will be able to make changes to the law to allow WisconsinEye to access state funds that were set aside for it. She said Wisconsinites deserved to know what’s going on in the state Capitol. “They deserve to be able to watch testimony on a bill that’s really important to them or their family and to know how their representative is responding on a certain issue or voting on the floor of the Assembly,” she said. “We should have structured their funding a little differently in the state budget, but we have an opportunity to do so now to make sure that they can provide that service.” The state initially set aside $10 million for the nonprofit in the 2023-25 state budget that it could only access if it raised the same amount, but it failed to do so. The opportunity to access the funds for an endowment was extended in the 2025-27 state budget, but the organization has struggled to raise funds for both the endowment and its operational costs.
Lawmakers have also been discussing, once again, legalizing medical marijuana, though Neubauer said she isn’t sure if Republicans, who are standing in the way, will budge this session. “The reality here is that THC products are available in Wisconsin because of the Farm Bill… so I do think that that’s shifted the conversation. People of Wisconsin have been very clear that they want access to both medical and recreational marijuana, and we should be regulating this market and taxing it, making sure that kids don’t have access to these products,” Neubauer said. “I do think it will be difficult for Republicans to go home and explain why they still have not done anything when we’re an island of prohibition here.” 
On funds that have not been released to combat PFAS contamination in drinking water, Neubauer said she hopes the Legislature can finally get something done. “There have been some productive conversations on this issue. The central conflict really remains that Democrats believe that polluters should pay for the damage that they have done, and I’m not really sure my Republican colleagues would agree with that, and so that’s been a challenge for us to move through, but we just have to do something,” Neubauer said. “We have communities in Wisconsin that cannot drink the water coming out of their tap, and that’s unacceptable.” 

2026 elections and a potential majority
Neubauer, who confirmed she will be running for another term in the Assembly, said she is optimistic about Democrats’ chances of winning the Assembly majority next year. The 2026 elections will serve as Assembly Democrats’ second opportunity under new legislative maps adopted in 2024 to try to flip the chamber for the first time in 16 years. 
In 2024, Democrats won 10 additional seats. For Democrats to win control in 2026, they’ll need to hold all of their current seats and win five more. 
The seats that they’ll be competing for are very close, Neubauer said, including some that former Vice President Kamala Harris won in 2024, even as she lost the state as a whole.
“There are people who like the vision that we’re putting forward in these districts, so the path is there. We are recruiting great candidates who are very connected to their local community and who are ready to go out and speak directly to the voters of their district from now until election day,” Neubauer said. “That’s how we win. We win by talking about the failures of Republicans and pointing out that they have been in control here for coming up on 15 years, and they have really failed to provide the essential services that people deserve.” 
Neubauer said it helps that Democrats have fewer seats that they need to flip in 2026, so they’ll be able to better focus on tough districts. 
Neubauer said Democrats have candidates from a diverse array of backgrounds including teachers, coaches, small business owners, farmers, public safety employees and union members, who she said are representative of the state.  
“We know that people want to see folks in office that remind them of themselves and of their neighbors and who understand the challenges that they’re going through. We’ve got folks running who get what it’s like to be looking at the budget and worried about how they’re going to make it to the next month or how they’re going to afford those Christmas gifts or special meals for the holidays,” she said. 
She said to look out for more candidate announcements early next year.
Neubauer also said the election results from across the country bode well for Democrats in Wisconsin. She said the results in  New Jersey and Virginia were a “really strong overperformance for Democrats.” She said it’s a sign that people are unhappy with Republican leadership and the direction of the country.
“[President] Donald Trump said that he was going to focus on the economy and making life a little easier for folks, and he has engaged in reckless trade wars, and taking other steps that have made it harder for people to get by — not easier,” Neubauer said. She also said it is “shocking” that Trump would “completely fail” to recognize how cutting SNAP funding would hurt people, and said his comments about running for a third term are “unsettling” and it is “incumbent on all of us who believe in democracy and who believe in fair elections” to push back.
“I think you’re seeing the effects of that on people across the country. Not only the federal Republicans, but their state level Republicans are just not following through on the promises that they made so I think people are looking for something different and that gives us an opportunity here.”
Wisconsinites will also make a choice next year in a high-profile open race for governor, and Neubauer said she’ll do everything she can to elect a Democratic governor. 
“I am looking for someone who understands the necessity of winning in Wisconsin next year and is focused on communicating with the people of this state a vision for how life would be better with Democrats running the state Capitol,” Neubauer said. “It’s really important that we put out a vision, and that we connect directly with the people of Wisconsin and push through the frustration that folks have with politics right now by being really clear about what we’ll do and then winning and then getting those things done.”
Neubauer said she is happy with the field of Democrats running for governor, especially given how many have legislative experience, but won’t be making an endorsement. She noted that Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan and U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore all spent time serving in the Wisconsin Legislature. 
Two current lawmakers, state Rep. Francesca Hong (D-Madison), and state Sen. Kelda Roys (D-Madison), are running along with former lawmakers Lt. Gov. Sara Rodriguez, Milwaukee Co. Executive David Crowley and former Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes.
“We’re excited that so many folks understand what it’s like to be a legislator and who will work well, I think, with our caucus in a governing trifecta,” Neubauer said. 
Former Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation CEO Missy Hughes, another Democratic gubernatorial hopeful, has no legislative experience.
In the event a Republican wins, Neubauer said Democrats in the Legislature will “work with them to the best of our ability to deliver.” 
U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany, who is considered the frontrunner in the primary race, and Washington County Executive Josh Schoemann, are the current Republican hopefuls.
“We show up every day remembering that our constituents sent us here to get things done and that has to be our first priority, so we will work with anybody who wants to work with us and that would include a Republican governor if that’s the situation that we’re in,” Neubauer said. “People are struggling, and it is our responsibility to respond to that and to do what we can to help.”

Those findings were delivered Thursday in a new report from the Citizens Research Council of Michigan, which analyzed the budget bills passed by the Legislature for the current 2025-26 fiscal year, including the transportation funding deal that underpinned many of the disagreements between the Republican-controlled House of Representatives and the Democratic-led Senate.
The report looked at the sources of new revenue, as well as how the funding would likely be distributed among the Michigan Department of Transportation, the state’s county road commissions, and local road agencies.
One of the key findings is that the oversights in the funding bills make it hard to predict if the bills would fund the roads as intended, and on time to really make a difference.
“By replacing the sales tax with an increase in the motor fuel tax rate, the Michigan Transportation Fund will receive a meaningful funding increase that should be dependable for years to come,” said Eric Paul Dennis, PE, research associate for infrastructure and author of the report. “But much of the other changes in this package appear haphazard and not well thought-out. Policymakers and road agencies will have to wait and see how much revenue from the Marijuana Wholesale Tax and Corporate Income Tax will become available.”memo1183-assessment_of_2025_transportation_funding_package
Dennis said that even if all of the anticipated revenue is provided, the uncertainty “imposes new difficulties in planning and programming construction projects.”
The package was intended to provide up to $1 billion in new road funding in 2026, and $2 billion by the 2030 fiscal year.
But much of that funding could be delayed from distribution, the report said, and might not be fully available. The report also found that the funding approach was overly complicated, inefficient and ineffective at making the available funds ready for the best use.
Of note, the Citizens Research Council of Michigan determined that the package did not address any other road and infrastructure issues aside from the funding needed to make it happen.
“It is unclear if the authors of the 2025 [package] intended for Michigan’s state road program to prioritize local agencies over MDOT so drastically,” the report said. “If so, it is unclear why. Such an approach is likely to increase the reliance of local road agencies on state funding with little accountability. Further, it is unclear if funding dedicated to MDOT will be sufficient to continue to improve and maintain the critical state trunkline system.”
The council also called the formula, which will give 50% of increased revenue sharing to local road agencies, antiquated, as it will then be distributed to local agencies in a way that has been done for many years.
“This has led to some local agencies being drastically underfunded while others likely receive more state revenue than makes sense,” the report said. “The 2025 [package] did nothing to address such inequities.”
As for the policy implications, the road agencies will likely be holding their breath to see if the new wholesale 24% tax on marijuana products sold in Michigan – a key piece of the new revenue model – will go up in smoke as it is being challenged in state court.
“Even if all anticipated revenue is provided, the uncertainty imposes new difficulties in planning and programming construction projects,” the report said. “More funding may be a partial temporary solution. But when applied to a broken system, more funding is just as likely to cause more problems.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_8629-1024x627.jpg,,,2025-12-05 06:57:17.948748

As farmers face historic headwinds and market hardships, calls to the national Farm Aid hotline and the Iowa Concern hotline — where farmers can get support in times of mental health crisis or need — are increasing.
This fall the Iowa Concern hotline saw four to five times the number of calls it had in the same months last year, said Tammy Jacobs, the hotline’s manager.
The Farm Aid hotline is also seeing a change in the urgency of calls.
“We’re seeing more established farmers calling in — people who know how to play the game and how to access programs. They’re calling more often now, because even with all that institutional knowledge, they’re still running into issues for the first time that are more complex and difficult to solve,” said Lori Mercer, a Farm Aid hotline operator. “The system that’s in place is simply letting them down. There’s just no further safety net.” 
Research shows farmers die by suicide at least twice as often as people in the general population, so there’s urgency to address the uptick in need. 
“It’s a huge issue. I mean, we’ve known at least three families this year whose loved ones died by suicide,” said Emma Yerkey, who’s part of the Ag Chapter of Gray Matters, a monthly meetup for ag producers around the Quad Cities to talk about their struggles.
Farmers experience a lot of stressors and uncertainty that they can’t control — isolation, weather changes, and financial pressures — along with low access to mental health care in rural areas and stigma that may make them keep their pain to themselves. Market conditions made worse by a trade war and inflation are adding to the stress. Mental health professionals are thinking outside the box to get producers care. 
Understanding the stress
Yerkey’s family farms corn, soybeans, and hay in Geneseo, Illinois on land they’ve owned since the Civil War. The farm is filled with memories, especially of her dad, Tim Yerkey. 
She played baseball with him in their driveway, the family ate meals together in the home, and, one year, her father helped her raise a ribbon-winning calf. 
“That was a really good memory that I have with him,” said Yerkey.
But the farm could be stressful, too. Tim Yerkey worked the land with his family, but at times had to take outside jobs to make ends meet. In 2011, he’d been struggling for about a year when spring floods left fields underwater. He’d reached out to friends and visited the emergency room seeking help, only to be told there were no beds, Yerkey said. He died by suicide in June 2011.

“I miss my dad, and I don’t want anybody else—or any other family—to go through that,” Yerkey said.
But many farming families experience similar pain. Between 2003 and 2017, more than 1600 farmers died by suicide, the majority older white men.  
Experts say factors that contribute to stress and higher suicide rates among farmers include isolation, easy access to guns, a cultural expectation of toughness, stigma around seeking mental health care, worries about who will take over the farm, and a lack of recognition for their hard work.
Financial losses and stress are also significant risks for depressive symptoms. And right now, times are tough for farmers. 
Producers have endured high inflation and growing input costs on farms since at least 2020. The spread of COVID and, more recently, policy decisions like President Trump’s tariffs and increases in immigration enforcement have all increased operating costs. At the same time, prices for major commodities are low — lower than the cost to grow them. Corn prices are about $0.85 below the break even point and soybeans are about $2 below. 
This year, many states are expecting a record corn crop, but farmers aren’t celebrating.
“It’s very discouraging for farmers to think that they’ve done all the things right in their fields and have put innovations in place and made good decisions, but yet, even with strong yields, they’re gonna be facing a loss on what they’re producing,” said Aaron Lehman, president of the Iowa Farmers Union.
In 2024, the U.S. exported about 42% of its soybeans, most of it to China. With China not buying in the midst of the trade war some farmers who usually send their crop abroad have struggled to find new markets. The U.S. in November struck a new deal with China, potentially extending a lifeline to producers still scrambling to move their harvest, but it remains to be seen what China will actually buy.
Some programs that helped connect farmers to domestic markets, like the Local Food Purchase Assistance initiative, have also been cut by the USDA. 
“Since the beginning of the year, the farmers have just been thrown into a different level of uncertainty with policy things like losing access to some markets through tariffs, losing access to staff and programming with the government shutdown, and the funding freezes. A big one we’re hearing about is losing access to labor with the ICE raids, etcetera,” said Mercer, with Farm Aid. “I was just speaking to a farmer the other day who was basically watching his crops rot on the vines because his usual labor support was just too afraid to show up this year.” 
In addition to all of the financial stress, farmers say they feel the work can be thankless. 
“This work is incredibly hard, and nobody understands where their food comes from. Nobody knows that [farmers] work 20 hours a day so that they can have a strawberry,” said Anna Scheyett, a retired professor of social work who studied farmer stress and suicide at the University of Georgia.
Meeting farmers where they’re at
Despite the many struggles, some families are finding hope and community in turbulent times. To honor her dad, Yerkey joined the new Ag Chapter of Gray Matters, a Quad Cities nonprofit that provides mental health resources, education, and safe spaces 
Gray Matters hosts monthly Barn Talks, where participants can share what’s weighing on them, whether it’s stress, depression, anxiety, or other struggles, and receive support from others. The organizers hope to build a sense of community and normalize talking about mental health.

“Feeling comfortable and safe to say that — ‘Hey, I am stressed out, or I am really hurting right now. Maybe I am depressed, maybe I have some anxiety,’ — whatever it might be,” said Heather Gritton, one of the group leaders.
Offering spaces where farmers can meet and take some of that load off their shoulders can help break down the stigma around getting help, said Sara Kohlbeck, assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral medicine at the Medical College of Wisconsin. 
It’s key for those spaces to be easily accessible to farmers. 
“Bringing that support to the farmers—or to the rural communities—rather than expecting those folks to come and get those resources for themselves is really important,” said Kohlbeck. “Otherwise, you know, we’ve got folks that are kind of suffering in silence because they just don’t have the time. Sometimes there’s stigma, and there’s kind of that pride issue.” 
There are also practical barriers. Telehealth isn’t a viable option for many farmers, as cell and internet reception in rural areas are limited. Driving long distances to see a counselor can also be impractical, especially during the busy harvest season. 
Another approach to reaching farmers has been to train people who farmers trust and regularly interact with — such as suppliers, lenders, large animal veterinarians, and spouses — to recognize when someone may be dealing with mental health challenges and teach them how to support them and direct them to resources. 
For example, Scheyett has trained agricultural lenders to recognize warning signs of suicide ideation and taught them how to respond. She’s also trained extension agents to take a few minutes at the beginning of agricultural production meetings to talk about stress and offer resources, something she says can make a real difference for farmers.
In one study, Scheyett and her co-authors found that farmers who were present at meetings where about 10 minutes were dedicated to talking about stress management walked away with new ideas for managing stress and a higher level of commitment to doing it. 
Sometimes, offering practical and logistical solutions to big problems can be a part of mental health services, too. 
“If a farmer has not really looked and done a deep dive into their farm financial system, we have a program that’s called farm financial associates, and they’ll come out to the farm, do a big evaluation over the farming operation to see where the hard points are and is there a way to switch things around, diversify, in order to help offset some of the farming losses and costs,” Jacobs, with the Iowa Concern hotline, said.
For farmers facing grain storage challenges, Jacobs suggested partnering with other farmers as an alternative to traditional co-op arrangements.
Scheyett suggests everybody can help by thanking farmers the same way we do with the military.
“Every time I see a farmer, I say thank you — thank you for your service, because what you do keeps us healthy, fed, and clothed,” said Scheyett.
It’s all in the hopes of providing care and saving lives.
“Even if you can save one life, I mean, that’s so worth it,” said Yerkey. “I feel very passionate about it.” 
Farmers can reach out to the 988 Lifeline or 1-800-FARM-AID for help. Help is also available in Spanish.
The Iowa Concern hotline is available 24/7 via chat, email, call, or text at 800-447-1985.

A new state law expands the exemption, however, allowing the industry a larger tax break on electricity purchased to move petrol via pipelines.
The post Wyoming Supreme Court denies $3M tax exemption claim by oil and gas company appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming oil and gas producer Merit Energy is not entitled to $3 million in tax refunds for electricity it purchased for its operations, the Wyoming Supreme Court ruled this week.
In a 20-page ruling authored by Justice Robert C. Jarosh, the high court denied Merit’s claim that electricity purchases from 2020 to 2023 qualify under a state tax exemption intended for businesses engaged in “transportation.” Rather than transporting the product to market, according to the court, the electricity expenses were associated with production — like powering submersible pumps used to bring petrol and associated fluids to the surface and distributing them to separation facilities.
Essentially, the tax exemption applied only to power purchases for transportation via pipelines necessary to transfer the custody of the product and not for production-related activities, according to the court. 
“Across its units, Merit produces over 1,000,000 barrels of water daily to yield 15,000 barrels of crude oil,” the court noted. “The fluid arriving at the wellhead is not marketable crude oil, it is a commingled stream requiring processing before custody transfer.”

The ruling overturns a Wyoming State Board of Equalization decision and spares local governments from millions of dollars in potential “clawbacks,” according to some observers who say a ruling in favor of Merit might have incentivized other oil and gas operators to make similar claims. Local officials in Park County, for example, fretted over a series of amended oil and gas tax filings under various statutes asking for refunds, potentially jeopardizing budgets that were set on revenues already distributed.
New law expands ‘transportation’ tax exemption for industry
Though Merit’s electricity purchases from 2020 to 2023 did not qualify under the exemption, the same types of purchases will qualify going forward, due to a new law passed by the Legislature this year.
House Bill 311, “Exemption for transported fuel and power sales-amendments,” which went into effect July 1, extends the tax break to “sales of power or fuel to a person transporting tangible personal property by railroad or by pipeline when the power or fuel is consumed directly in generating motive power for actual transportation purposes, regardless of ownership of the transported tangible personal property.”
The previous version of the exemption either did not apply to, or was legally obscure, regarding some oil and gas pipelines, according to the Petroleum Association of Wyoming, which brought the measure to lawmakers.
“Our argument was, some pipelines are already exempt, but not all pipelines,” PAW President Pete Obermueller told WyoFile. “And that is a major competitive disadvantage to [Wyoming] operators that have to do a lot of moving of their product through these gathering lines.”

“Gathering” refers to a web of small pipelines that originate at individual wells and funnel toward larger pipelines that take petrol to refineries and, ultimately, to regional and national market trading points.
However, the “disadvantage” Obermueller mentioned — that Wyoming oil and gas producers had endured prior to the legislation — is unclear. When asked, Obermueller said he didn’t know how Wyoming’s laws compare to similar taxation methods in competing oil and gas-producing states.
Expanding the exemption will result in less revenue for oil- and natural gas-producing counties, according to the Wyoming Department of Revenue. But just how much is unclear.
According to the bill’s fiscal note: “The fiscal or personnel impact is not determinable due to insufficient time to complete the fiscal note process.”
Both PAW and the Department of Revenue noted that even the expanded tax exemption does not apply to all electricity purchases in the oil and gas industry.
“It’s pretty small in the sense that it only affects a certain amount of electricity purchased for a very specific reason,” Obermueller said, “and the only way to get the exemption is if you know how much electricity you’re using for that specific purpose.”
Overall, the expanded exemption could result in an annual revenue loss of about $10 million, Obermueller estimated. Electrical “power costs in Wyoming, apart from labor, are the single largest expense for producing resources here,” he said. “The point is, power costs are a barrier to production.”
The average monthly cost of electricity for all “industrial” consumers in Wyoming decreased by 2.3% year-over-year in August, according to a report by the University of Wyoming School of Energy Resources, compared to a 5% increase nationally.
The spot price for Wyoming crude oil was down 15.4% year-over-year, as of October. Production for the same period had ticked up only 0.1%. Wyoming natural gas production, year-over-year in August, was down nearly 5%.

Wyoming looks to pursue a grant for $5M renovation in one of its most popular parks. In the wake of recent via ferrata snafu, state is seeking as much public input as possible.
The post In Sinks Canyon State Park, makeover opportunity rises appeared first on WyoFile .","The Middle Fork of the Popo Agie River tumbles through snow-topped boulders in a yawning canyon before veering suddenly to the east and disappearing. 
The cave that swallows the river is the Sinks — a geologic marvel that is the centerpiece of one of Wyoming’s most popular state parks. Sinks Canyon State Park attracted more than 680,000 visitors in 2024. 
The facility where visitors can learn about the Sinks, however, is small and aging. The visitor center, built in 1972, features a small second-story exhibition space filled with taxidermied snakes and mammal skulls, area maps and souvenirs for sale. The building’s water system was damaged by a long-ago high-river event, and the bathrooms haven’t been open for at least a decade. There is no classroom for student fieldtrips, and school bus drivers have to make an awkward maneuver to exit the parking lot.

Wyoming State Parks has an opportunity to pursue matching grant funds to rebuild the visitor center — with a potential project budget of $5 million. And the agency is taking pains to gather public input before proceeding. 
“We don’t have a specific plan,” Carly-Ann Carruthers, planning manager for Wyoming Department of State Parks and Cultural Resources, told a room of locals on Dec. 1 in Lander. “Community feedback is vital. We want to hear from you.”

This process is coming on the heels of another Sinks Canyon development proposal that did not go smoothly for Wyoming State Parks. The agency in 2023 pulled the plug on a contentious proposal to build a via ferrata in Sinks following years of backlash and debate. 
Much of the initial concern stemmed from the fact that the proposed project cliff was a nesting site for peregrine falcons. Others criticized the process, expressing dismay that they were unaware of the via ferrata until after the park’s master plan was finalized.

This time, State Parks collaborated with a local group to host an informational meeting, and turnout was high. The crowd appeared engaged and open as people asked questions and brainstormed ways to update the visitor center to accommodate modern needs.
State Parks staff emphasized there are no current plans and the meeting was just the beginning. Ideas that were floated included relocating the building, erecting a star-gazing perch and incorporating more Indigenous history and interpretation.

Here at home, so far, things are mostly quiet. Farmers in western Wisconsin report no ICE raids on the dairies where 60% to 90% of workers are immigrants without legal status. There have been a few high-profile arrests and deportations in Milwaukee, Madison and Manitowoc, but nothing like the scenes of chaos in the streets of Chicago and Minneapolis, where masked federal agents are aiming guns at civilians, smashing out car windows and dragging parents from their children, hustling them off to detention centers to be fast-tracked out of the country without due process.
One of the most disturbing things about this campaign of terror is that it seems to be directed by the president’s whim. In a Thanksgiving post full of invective and schoolyard insults directed at Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, Trump denounced the Somali community he claimed was “completely taking over the great State of Minnesota.” One week later, CBS News confirmed that ICE operations were underway targeting Somali immigrants in the Twin Cities.
Since we can’t count on the federal government to stay inside the bounds of reason or the law, it is critical that local and state leaders stand up to the racist, unconstitutional and unAmerican assault on immigrants. 
It was good news when, on Wednesday, the Wisconsin Supreme Court accepted a case filed by the state chapter of the ACLU on behalf of the immigrant rights group Voces de la Frontera, contending that Wisconsin law enforcement agencies do not have the authority to make arrests or keep people in jail on detainers based solely on ICE’s administrative warrants.
Tim Muth, the ACLU of Wisconsin’s senior staff attorney, said hundreds of people throughout the state are being illegally held for days.
“It is extremely important for the Wisconsin Supreme Court to determine whether any law enforcement in Wisconsin has the legal authority to put or keep people in jail when they have not committed a crime and when no judge has issued an arrest warrant,” Wisconsin immigration attorney Grant Sovern wrote in an email to the Examiner. “Anyone in Wisconsin would want dangerous people to be kept from the public. But ICE is currently making no determinations about dangerousness or the likelihood to show up for a hearing if a summons is issued. A summons is a perfectly rational and legal way to address a civil legal question like someone’s immigration status. Jailing people before any independent adjudicator determines someone to be dangerous is against the Constitution and not the Wisconsin way.”
At a press conference Wednesday, Christine Neumann-Ortiz, executive director of Voces, told the story of a landscaper in Green Bay who was picked up for driving without a license (immigrants without legal status are barred by a 2007 state law from obtaining driver’s licenses). He was sent to county jail and then handed over to ICE. “He was a grandfather, very active in his church,” Neumann-Ortiz said, describing him as “someone who does not represent any kind of threat to society at all” and who, on the contrary, is a pillar of his community and beloved by his family. 
Voces helped fight the deportation in a case that is still working its way through the courts. “At least he’s out and together with his family,” Neumann-Ortiz said. “But that’s an example of how people can be impacted by this.” 
As it scrambles to meet arbitrary deportation quotas, ICE sends detainers even for people who have never been convicted of a crime and have only minor charges pending in Wisconsin courts. 
Voces has been fighting at the local level since the first Trump administration for local law enforcement to refuse to collaborate with ICE unless there is a judicial warrant for someone, meaning that person is being sought in connection with a serious crime. As a result of Voces’ efforts, that is now the standard in Milwaukee County. The state Supreme Court case is an effort to establish the same standard statewide.
Neumann-Ortiz said she’s grateful the Supreme Court justices recognized the urgency of the issue in agreeing to take the case on an expedited basis, “given the current level of abuse that we’re seeing happen, and which will only escalate.”
And, she added, “We certainly very much anticipate Milwaukee being one of the cities that will be targeted for militarized occupation with these aggressive sweeps.”
Whether or not Wisconsin communities can protect people from the kind of violence we’ve been seeing in other states depends on the courageous actions of state and local officials, advocates and informed community members. It begins with recognizing that the Trump administration’s actions are wrong and then standing up.
At the press conference, a reporter asked about ICE’s assertion that the agency doesn’t have room for everyone in its detention facilities and therefore needs space in county jails. Muth responded: “Detain fewer people.”
Neumann-Ortiz added some clarifying context. “They are profiling people, they are just grabbing people without any probable cause. So it’s a very racist program that is using violence against people and is trying to hijack, through bribery and through threats, local law enforcement to be part of this mass deportation machinery,” she said. 
“We’re seeing, at the local level, community come together,” she added, “to reject these efforts to undermine local law enforcement — which is supposed to play a public safety role — into just this arm of deportation driven by xenophobia and racism. And which is making a lot of money for the for-profit prison industry.”
This year, communities across the state have pushed back on 287g partnership agreements between local law enforcement and ICE. Palmyra, Ozaukee and Kenosha counties rejected ICE’s offers of money to transform their sheriffs into agents of federal immigration enforcement.
The Kenosha sheriff’s office made its decision not to participate after the ACLU and Voces had already named it in the Supreme Court lawsuit, along with Walworth, Brown, Sauk and Marathon counties. Palmyra also reversed a decision to accept a large payment from ICE to participate, responding to public outrage.
“Resistance is happening, it’s successful, it’s building community,” Neumann-Ortiz said. “But we do need state protections to uphold our rights.”

Steve Pearce, Trump’s nominee to run the BLM, has worked to privatize and undermine our public lands, writes Aaron Weiss.
The post This Trump nominee wants to liquidate public lands appeared first on WyoFile .","This commentary was originally published by Writers on the Range.


Opinion

Do Western senators really care about keeping public lands in public hands? Steve Pearce, President Donald Trump’s nominee to run the Bureau of Land Management, is a litmus test of their commitment.
Throughout his political career, Pearce has worked to privatize and undermine our public lands. As a New Mexico congressman, he co-sponsored several bills to dispose of national public lands. This alone ought to disqualify him from running the agency charged with stewarding 245 million acres for current and future generations.
In a 2012 letter to House leadership, Pearce argued that the federal government owns “vast” land holdings, “most of [which] we do not even need,” and called for a massive sell-off to pay down the national debt. Pearce’s vision for our public lands is not conservation or even balanced management — it’s liquidation.
Trump has been down this road before: During his first term, he nominated anti-public-lands zealot William Perry Pendley to run the BLM. Pendley never even received a hearing, and the White House dropped the nomination after his record was revealed. Pendley went on to write the public lands chapter of the now-notorious Project 2025 blueprint for a second Trump administration.
Pendley spent his career as a lawyer arguing that the federal government should not own public lands. Steve Pearce has gone even further. From inside Congress, Pearce spent 14 years undermining public lands, seeking to gut wildlife protections and sell off huge amounts of public land.
Pearce’s nomination comes as our public lands are being attacked from all sides. Over the last 10 months, Trump has elevated officials such as Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, both of whom view our public lands as nothing more than assets to monetize through drilling, mining and logging. 
These officials are currently working to execute Trump’s vision of selling out public assets for private profit. Pearce would accelerate this effort, liquidating lands to the highest bidder — including corporations and luxury developers.
Even by recent standards, Pearce’s public lands record is radical. It is also unpopular. This spring, Utah Republican Sen. Mike Lee tried to include a public land sale provision in the sprawling budget bill, framing it as a housing solution. The measure would have mandated the sale of 2-3 million acres of BLM and Forest Service lands.
But Lee’s amendment triggered immediate backlash from hunters, outdoor recreation groups and Western lawmakers. Within days, he abandoned the effort. If the Senate rejected Lee’s market-rate sell-off as radical, it should be easy now to reject a nominee whose goal is to get rid of even more public land.
That brings us to the Senate Stewardship Caucus, co-chaired by a Republican, Tim Sheehy of Montana, and a Democrat, Martin Heinrich of New Mexico. It launched last month to “advance bipartisan efforts to conserve the nation’s lands and waters” with science-based policy. The caucus has been applauded by hunting, outdoor recreation and conservation organizations as a promising start for defending public access and wildlife.
Pearce’s nomination is the caucus’s first real test. If its members cannot draw a bright line at a nominee who has worked tirelessly to sell off public lands and weaken laws that protect them, then its vision of “stewardship” is nothing but empty branding.
The stakes are immense. BLM’s multiple-use mandate requires balancing energy, grazing, recreation and conservation under long-term land use plans grounded in science and public input. That mission collapses if the agency’s leader believes we must “reverse this trend of public ownership” of the very lands he is charged with managing.
Westerners understand what happens when responsible stewardship is abandoned. Rural communities lose the long-term economic engine that healthy public lands provide. Hunters, anglers and campers lose access they have relied on for generations.
Steve Pearce’s nomination is a referendum on whether Congress believes our shared lands still belong to all Americans. The Stewardship Caucus and every senator who claims to care about the West’s outdoor heritage should reject Pearce’s nomination. America’s public lands are a unique legacy we pass down to future generations, not a portfolio to liquidate.

Jim Pillen listens during a summit of the governors of South Dakota, Iowa and Nebraska with business leaders in the Sioux City area. (Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)LINCOLN — After state officials initially denied rumors of downsizing, Nebraska’s Department of Economic Development acknowledged that it has paid roughly 22 fewer full-time employees over the past two months.
Similar workforce reductions have also impacted various other state agencies, prompting new concerns from some frontline workers that Gov. Jim Pillen and his administration are focusing on staff cuts to balance Nebraska’s budget.
The Governor’s Office initially claimed, in response to a reporter’s questions, that DED had seen “0 layoffs/reductions in force” through September and October, when the Examiner first asked in early November.
The state changed its tune after payroll records obtained by the Examiner from the Department of Administrative Services in recent weeks indicated 112 full-time employees on DED’s payroll in September, then 101 in October and 93 in November.
Justin Pinkerman, a spokesperson for the Department of Economic Development clarified this week that DED was down to just over 90 filled full-time positions by the end of November.
Governor’s Office spokeswoman Laura Strimple amended her statement to say all of the reductions in full-time staff from September to November had been voluntary. And the department, via Pinkerman, now says the downsizing is part of a winding down of pandemic-era programs.

Last month, Pinkerman had said DED eliminated only a single position this summer, that of Deputy Director of Operations Joe Lauber.
The DED downsizing comes as other cuts have impacted different state agencies, including the Nebraska Department of Revenue. The state laid off 11 revenue agents in October, closed the department’s Scottsbluff office and shrank its Lincoln-based individual income tax collections office.
At a press conference this week for a union representing state employees, the Nebraska Association of Public Employees, Executive Director Justin Hubly said reducing revenue agents when the state is short of funds was a “bananas decision” considering that State Auditor Mike Foley recently reported that unpaid state taxes had grown 15% over the past year, rising above $310 million.

Additionally, Hubly said at least four employees were cut from the state Office of the Chief Information Officer. He said smaller cuts have impacted several other departments in recent months.
At DED, evidence suggests that the majority of the downsizing was focused on managerial and higher-up positions not covered by union protections. Hubly said NAPE logged about seven voluntary departures within DED between June and November. NAPE represents roughly 55-60 DED workers, he said.
Lauber, who served as DED’s deputy director of operations and its chief legal counsel, said in August he was told his position had been eliminated due to budget cuts, and he was escorted out of the building. He had worked at DED for 13 years.
“It came as quite a shock to me,” Lauber said of his dismissal.
Prior to his termination, Lauber said there were signs of budget cuts impacting DED, like hiring freezes and directives to stop travel. He said during a management meeting he attended, then-interim director Maureen Larsen shared that it was the governor’s goal to reduce the size of DED through attrition.
Agencies often do this by not filling positions people vacated through retirements and having or encouraging people to leave on their own. Lauber said the state implemented strategies such as Pillen’s return-to-work order and enforcing a strict 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. work schedule in hopes of getting people to consider whether they wanted to stay working for the department. Lauber said employees were not allowed to end their days earlier than 4:30 p.m.
Hubly said NAPE workers in other state agencies have also seen a pattern of the state cutting jobs this year to save cash.
Pillen has discussed his intent to cut Nebraska’s two-year budget by $500 million by the end of lawmakers’ 60-day legislative session in 2026. Lawmakers will enter the 2026 legislative session needing to fill a projected $471 million budget hole.
Hubly suggested the state implement retirement incentives as a way of tightening the budget, arguing that hiring younger workers would reduce staffing costs. Hubly said the governor rejected this proposal.
Pillen recently named Larsen the permanent DED director after she had served as interim director since July following former director K.C. Belitz’ resignation. Belitz did not return a request for comment.
Prior to her appointment, Larsen served as Pillen’s general counsel and deputy director of his Policy Research Office. Hubly said he’s heard some concerns from workers that Larsen was appointed as director as part of a “hatchet job,” a term often used for someone hired to cut staff, due to a lack of outreach she did with the rest of the department.
“We did hear a lot of concerns when she was kind of installed temporarily,” Hubly said. “She wasn’t out and about, she wasn’t introducing herself to people. So I think there was kind of this general consensus from people we talked to that was like, ‘She’s here to do a hatchet job and get rid of people.’”
Larsen did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Pinkerman, reaching out on her behalf, said DED “experienced dramatic growth following the coronavirus pandemic.”
Pinkerman shared data showing that between 2020 to 2023, the department’s full-time staff grew by about 10-15 people per year. It reached a peak of about 114 filled full-time positions on June 30 of this year, which has since dropped to around 90.
Larsen took over as interim DED director on July 21.
“As DED winds down pandemic-era economic recovery programs and identifies greater operational efficiencies, not all positions that come open are being filled,” Pinkerman said in an email.
Hubly called on the Nebraska Legislature to protect frontline workers when debating budget adjustments this spring, arguing that staff cuts should be the last place state officials look to fill the deficit.
Instead, he proposed searching for new revenue sources or surveying state workers for ways to improve efficiencies.
“It is not possible to continually cut positions and increase workloads on state employees and not affect the quality of the services the employees provide,” Hubly said.

Hayes joined the Idaho Conservation League as a program director almost 25 years ago and worked on numerous conservation and environmental initiatives before being named executive director in 2018, the Idaho Conservation League announced in a press release issued last week. 
As executive director, Hayes led the Idaho Conservation League, or ICL for short, through two new strategic plans, helped launch new wildlife and water programs, opened a new McCall field office and oversaw an increase in revenue and financial performance, the Idaho Conservation League announced.
Hayes succeeded Rick Johnson, who pushed for more than 20 years to win protection for the Boulder-White Clouds Wilderness, as executive director of the Idaho Conservation League.

Hayes has accepted a new position as the North Rockies conservation director for American Rivers, where he will focus on protecting and restoring wild rivers in Idaho, Montana and Wyoming, officials said. 
“Serving as executive director has been incredibly rewarding for me,” Hayes said in a written statement. “But it has also meant spending less time personally doing the conservation work that first drew me to this field. At 57, I’m not ready to retire — but I can see it on the horizon. As I’ve reflected on how I want to spend the final phase of my career, I’ve realized that I want to be back on the ground, as a staffer, doing work focused on the rivers and fish that have always inspired me.”
 What’s next for the Idaho Conservation League?

Following Hayes’ departure, Conservation Director Brad Smith will serve as interim executive director of the Idaho Conservation League, the organization announced. Idaho Conservation League officials will conduct a search for the next permanent executive director in the coming months, officials said.

“Justin has been an exceptional leader for ICL, and he will be deeply missed,” Smith said in a written statement. “We’re grateful for all he has accomplished and wish him the very best in his next chapter. Thanks to Justin’s dedication and vision, he leaves ICL in a strong and stable position for our next executive director.”
In 2023 Idaho Conservation League celebrated the 50th anniversary of its founding in 1973. Headquartered in Boise with offices in McCall, Sandpoint and Ketchum, the Idaho Conservation League employs 24 people and focuses on protecting clean air, clean water, land and wildlife.

Ryan Zinke campaigning in Bigfork, Montana leading up to the 2022 midterm election (Photo via Ryan Zinke for Congress Twitter).Those of us who came of age during the ’60s well remember the Vietnam War, its horrific toll of human life, its cost, the division it caused, and its long-term effects upon those who served and survived.  
We also remember the phony incidents and propaganda that threw our young men and women into combat in what became our nation’s longest war…which we lost.  
As noted in 2008 by the U.S. Naval Institute in reference to the Gulf of Tonkin incident: “But once-classified documents and tapes released in the past several years, combined with previously uncovered facts, make clear that high government officials distorted facts and deceived the American public about events that led to full U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War.”  
Combined with the propaganda that the “Domino Theory” would see all of Southeast Asia under communist rule if the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, also known as “North Vietnam,” overthrew the government of South Vietnam, the Dogs of War were unleashed.
We saw a similar concocted reason for the Iraq War in the assurance from President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney that “Weapons of Mass Destruction” – or WMDs – existed, just awaiting use against the United States.  It was a flat out lie — but again, with horrifying consequences of death, destruction, cost, and long-term mental and health effects on the nation’s men and women in the military — all to virtually no positive outcome. 
Comes now the next attempt to push our nation into yet another fabricated war — this time with Venezuela, which just coincidentally happens to have the largest proven reserves of oil on the planet at 303 billion barrels.  
This time around it’s Trump’s propaganda machine that declares drugs from Venezuela are a threat to our nation on such a scale that we now have dozens of warships, planes, and 15,000 troops in the region as the president threatens to invade that sovereign nation and has already drawn international condemnation for blowing up suspected drug boats and killing more than 80 individuals — without releasing a scintilla of verification to the public.
Which begs the question:  Given that three of the four members of Montana’s Congressional Delegation are veterans, and that two of them – Rep. Ryan Zinke and Sen. Tim Sheehy are former Navy SEALS – how can they stand silent while this deadly charade unfolds?  
This is particularly poignant since other members of Congress — both Republican and Democrat — are openly questioning the fabricated rationale for the war.  They’re also critical of a violation of the international Law of Armed Conflict by a “double tap” by SEAL Team 6 that killed two survivors left clinging to the wreckage of an alleged drug boat in the middle of the ocean. 
As reported by the Associated Press: “I can’t imagine anyone, no matter what the circumstance, believing it is appropriate to kill people who are clinging to a boat in the water,” said Michael Schmitt, a former Air Force lawyer and professor emeritus at the U.S. Naval War College. “That is clearly unlawful.”
Given our past involvement in disastrous foreign wars fueled by propaganda and false information one would expect the veterans in Montana’s Congressional delegation to speak up, demand answers and proof, and honor the Oath of Office they took as soldiers and elected officials to uphold the Constitution’s mandate that only Congress may declare war.  
Moreover, they have not even bothered to ask Montanans about sending their sons and daughters to yet another foolish foreign war — a “war” which they are aiding and abetting through their unconscionable silence.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Ryan-Zinke-in-Bigfork.jpg,,,2025-12-05 06:57:17.948748

(Photo by Dan Koeck/For the North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota expects to receive roughly $17.8 million in federal disaster relief aid related to two summer storms, but a request for another estimated $3.6 million was denied by the federal government.
The state applied for the funding as part of requests for disaster relief for multiple storms that hit the state in June and August. 
North Dakota’s requests to the Federal Emergency Management Agency seeking assistance for damage caused by the storms was approved, said Darin Hanson, North Dakota’s Homeland Security and Emergency Management director.
But in addition to seeking public assistance to address the impacts of those disasters, states can also ask for hazard mitigation money to help communities better protect themselves from future harm.
Trump approves federal disaster relief for June storms in North Dakota

Hazard mitigation funding can be used to pay for things as wide ranging as flood control infrastructure, weather warning sirens and storm shelters, Hanson said.
“Some of these are relatively small projects, but they can make a big difference,” he said.
While North Dakota’s requests for this kind of assistance are often also approved, North Dakota’s hazard mitigation requests for the June and August storms were denied, said Hanson.
Hanson said he doesn’t know for sure why those applications were denied, since the federal government doesn’t share that information with states.
It appears to be a policy decision by the Trump administration, since other states are having their hazard mitigation requests rejected, too, he said.
Gov. Kelly Armstrong said in a Tuesday Emergency Commission meeting that the denials may stem from the executive branch’s belief that FEMA has been mismanaged by previous presidential administrations.
“It seems like the response to that is just to spend less money instead of figuring out how to run FEMA better,” Armstrong said.
He said hazard mitigation may have been targeted since FEMA’s primary role is emergency response, as opposed to emergency prevention.
“I think some in D.C. would say FEMA is expanding their scope beyond what they were originally intended to do,” said Armstrong, a Republican who served three terms in Congress.
North Dakota is appealing both denials, Hanson said. FEMA will review the requests and make a recommendation to the White House on whether to grant the appeals. The president makes the final call on what to do next, he said.
Trump denies disaster aid, tells states to do more

Hanson said that in the appeal letters, the state tried to make the case that it has a track record of using hazard mitigation funding effectively.
“About 97% of the funding we receive, we’re able to get out to communities to do these projects,” he said. “We do have a list of future projects ready to go should funding become available.”
The 19 counties eligible for relief under the June storm disaster declaration are Barnes, Burleigh, Cass, Eddy, Emmons, Foster, Grant, Griggs, Kidder, McLean, Morton, Oliver, Ransom, Sheridan, Sioux, Steele, Stutsman, Traill and Wells.
Counties eligible to receive relief for the August storms are Barnes, Grand Forks, Griggs, Kidder, Nelson, Steele and Stutsman counties.
Hanson said FEMA will reimburse 75% of the costs for projects addressing storm damage, with the state government covering 10% and local communities paying for the other 15%. Communities are reimbursed for the projects after they are complete.
So far, FEMA has committed funding for one public assistance project related to the June storms, Hanson said. He said another 16 project proposals for the June disaster are under review by FEMA, and the state expects to submit an additional 59 projects for review over the next few weeks.
Hanson noted relief funding for both disasters wasn’t impacted by the government shutdown. 
The June 20-21 storms were devastating to the state’s agricultural industry and included multiple tornadoes, one of which touched down in Enderlin and claimed three lives. The Aug. 7-8 storms also caused extensive damage, especially to electrical infrastructure, state officials said previously.
Earlier this year, FEMA canceled more than $20 million in infrastructure grants for North Dakota that were part of the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program.
In August, a federal judge temporarily blocked FEMA from reallocating money originally earmarked for the program after a group of states sued. North Dakota is not part of the lawsuit.
The $20 million included $7.8 million for a regional wastewater treatment project in Lincoln, $7.1 million for a water intake project in Washburn and $1.9 million for a wastewater lagoon project in Fessenden.

Trump administration puts a hold on immigration applications from 19 nations

The Idaho Office for Refugees, which administers Idaho’s refugee resettlement program, has not received any official communication about these proposed steps or what the process would look like. 
Idaho welcomed more than 2,670 people with refugee status during the 2021-2025 timeframe under review. They are all families and individuals seeking freedom from life-threatening persecution. They have become an essential part of our state, contributing as leaders, students, neighbors, friends, entrepreneurs, and hard workers who make a positive impact.
Being subjected to scrutiny again – after being thoroughly vetted and assured permanent welcome – creates anxiety for the very people who found hope and safety in the U.S. and sends the false message that they don’t fully belong here. As someone working closely with a wide range of Idahoans from refugee backgrounds, I can say they do belong, they are deeply appreciated, and our community would not be the same without them.
 Background and impact of refugee policy in the U.S.

The Refugee Act, passed by Congress in 1980, provides for the permanent resettlement of approved refugees who have been displaced from their home country and have no safe option of returning. Before resettling, refugees undergo rigorous medical and background screenings by multiple federal agencies. Most refugees wait many years in limbo for an opportunity to resettle in a permanent home like the U.S. and become citizens. Any one of us could be in their shoes depending on the time and place we were born.
Refugee resettlement provides a secure pathway for families and individuals uprooted by persecution, bringing more stability to people’s lives, to regions experiencing turmoil, and to our own national security and economy. Resettlement brings hope of being able to belong to a country again without fear of future displacement. To put refugees’ legal status back on the table goes against what the program was designed to do.
They had tickets. A flight number. An arrival time. Then Trump’s executive order changed everything.

Other changes this year have created barriers to resettlement. An executive order in January paused the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program. There’s an ongoing lawsuit seeking to honor the approval given to refugees whose flights were abruptly canceled. In October, the administration set a historically low refugee arrivals ceiling of 7,500 for the current year, prioritizing just one group of people, Afrikaners. People who were approved to resettle before the January suspension are not included.
For 50 years, Idaho’s refugee program has advanced values we all share — freedom, safety, opportunity, and lending a hand when we can help. We are grateful for the many ways newcomers have made our schools, workplaces, and community gathering spaces stronger.

Bill Lee, photographed at the groundbreaking for a Rutherford County charter school in 2023, spurred the creation of a state board authorizing charter schools. (John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)That crumbling sound you hear is not the Tennessee Vols defense falling apart brick by brick. That was more of an implosion against Vandy last weekend at Neyland Stadium.
No, this is the gradual dismantling of the “wall of separation between church and state.”
The latest disassembly involves an opinion by Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti saying the state’s prohibition on religious-based charter schools “likely” violates the free exercise of religion in the First Amendment.
Skrmetti wrote the opinion at the request of Republican state Rep. Michelle Carringer of Knoxville who has a bill relating to charter schools. Carringer said Thursday she requested the opinion for “legal clarity” on the relationship between the Constitution and Tennessee charter laws but has no plans to bring legislation related to it.
The opinion, which is not binding, points out state law requires public charter schools “to operate as … nonsectarian [and] nonreligious.” Similarly, another state law prohibits bodies that “promote the agenda of any religious denomination or religiously affiliated entity” from sponsoring a charter school.
“Those restrictions exclude otherwise qualified religious entities from participating in a public benefit, and no compelling interest is apparent,” the opinion says. Thus, the state’s restrictions “likely violate the free exercise clause.”
Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti issued an opinion that a prohibition on religious-based charter schools “likely” violates the First Amendment.
This leap of faith is supported by three U.S. Supreme Court decisions after a case called Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board v. Drummond left the question unresolved, according to the opinion. The court was divided on that matter, and Justice Amy Coney Barrett recused herself.
The trio of rulings found that “excluding religious entities from a public benefit ‘solely because of their religious character’ penalizes (religious freedom) and triggers ‘the most exacting scrutiny,’” the opinion says.
In applying those decisions, the attorney general concluded Tennessee’s exclusion of religious charter school sponsors “likely” violates the free exercise clause in the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
The relationship between charter schools and public school boards is sketchy at best. Metro Nashville’s school board has turned down several charter requests, mainly because of concerns that the charters wouldn’t serve all students, only to see its decisions reversed at the state level. 
Under Gov. Bill Lee, the legislature formed a charter school authorizing board that has the final say on the formation of charters, which are run by nonprofit entities using public dollars and, often, public buildings. In the last three years, the state put about $67 million into charter facilities.
This blurring of lines between government and religion is nothing new around these parts. Lee started the Governor’s Office of Faith-based Initiatives, and the legislature began pouring millions into it three years ago. The total is up to $4.5 million, with about three-fourths of that going to staff.
In addition, Tennessee is doling out $144 million for a private-school voucher program, essentially an entitlement program involving religious schools across the state.
Any time someone brings up the “wall of separation between church and state,” folks argue that those words aren’t in the Constitution. They’re right. It’s only a principle designed to keep dratted politicians from controlling religion.
The U.S. Supreme Court decided more than 75 years ago that the wall “must be kept high and impregnable.”
The question is whether Tennessee will use a stick of dynamite to blow it up or a sledgehammer to knock it down brick by brick. Either way, it seems to be falling.
Backing vouchers
Two East Tennessee families represented by EdChoice Legal Advocates want to defend the state’s private-school voucher program, filing a motion seeking to intervene in a case challenging its legality. The Beacon Center of Tennessee is representing the parents as well.
The state is defending itself against a lawsuit claiming the program is unconstitutional because it diverts money from public education.
The program provides $7,300 per child to attend private schools, $144 million for 20,000 children this year, and that number could rise in 2026.
EdChoice said in a release this week the families of Denise Fair of Jefferson City and Mike and Monica Sweeney of Knoxville depend on the program to put their children in learning environments that meet their families’ “moral values.” Otherwise, they would face “significant financial hurdles.”
“Behind every legal filing are real children whose futures hang in the balance. This lawsuit threatens to take choices away from families who have done everything right – families who simply want to place their children in the learning environments where they can thrive,” said Thomas Fisher of EdChoice Legal Advocates.
The Sweeneys’ three children are using the vouchers to pay for tuition at a Catholic school this year after homeschooling them because they didn’t like pandemic procedures at their school.
TN-Motion-to-Intervene
Fair and her husband, who are first responders, worked extra jobs to send two of their six children to a Christian school. The state funding “eased that burden,” according to the release, and allowed them to keep their two girls at Lakeway Christian Academy and cut back on part-time work.
“It has allowed me more time to dedicate to attending activities with the girls and freed up enough financial resources to allow the girls to attend some school field trips,” Denise Fair said in a release.
A court ruling against the program would put “a real financial burden” on the family and keep them from affording Lakeway Christian’s tuition, she said.
Thank you for the honesty.
The state’s own financial impact analysis showed 66% of those likely to receive the vouchers were attending private schools already (Gov. Lee prefers “scholarships” even though students don’t have to earn them).
This appears to be a point of contention, because the state Department of Education won’t disclose how many of the 20,000 students receiving the money really were enrolled in private schools already, probably because it’s closer to 90%.
The demand is there, according to the governor, so the program must be expanded. He has said repeatedly his main concern is that more “scholarships” aren’t available.
Maybe it’s time to shift that concern. In the words of some worry warts, have you ever seen an entitlement program shrink or disappear? 
Maybe it’s time for the state to dispense with the niceties and stop the public schools charade. Whether it’s called a voucher or a scholarship, just give everyone a few thousand bucks and let them fend for themselves. 
We need to toughen up anyway.
Hold up on executions
A group of nearly 20 Tennessee medical professionals is asking the governor to pause executions until a court can review the state’s new execution protocol, which depends on the drug pentobarbital.
The group sent a letter to Lee this week urging him to hold up on the next execution set for Dec. 11 to give the courts more time to handle a death row lawsuit over the protocol. A coalition of media also filed suit to gain more access to executions.
The medical professionals’ letter points out Lee stopped all executions in 2022 because of concerns about the protocol for lethal injections and ordered an independent investigation. The Department of Correction came up with a new lethal injection protocol last January that relies solely on pentobarbital, “and we have grave concerns about this unreviewed method,” their letter says.
The group of medical professionals isn’t taking a stance on capital punishment but says the use of pentobarbital “creates a serious risk of a prolonged, agonizing death. It also exposes Tennessee’s correctional officers to chaotic and psychologically harmful executions,” the letter says.
An Associated Press reporter who witnessed the execution of Byron Black in August said at one point the inmate moved his head around once or twice off a gurney, exhaled a couple of times and told his spiritual advisor, “Oh it hurts so bad.”
The 69-year-old Black, the first person executed since the new protocol took effect, was wheelchair-bound and suffering from dementia, brain damage, kidney failure and congestive heart failure, according to his attorneys. He was executed for the 1988 murder of his girlfriend and her two young daughters.
The Nashville Banner also reported it took about 10 minutes to put an IV in Black’s arm, causing a puddle of blood to form on his right side.
Asked in September whether his administration would investigate problems with Black’s execution, Lee said no.

Light speed
Less than 48 hours after capturing the 7th Congressional District seat in a special election, Republican Matt Van Epps was sworn into office in Washington, D.C., using his daughter’s pink Bible for the ceremony.
Van Epps, a former Tennessee commissioner of General Services and Army special operations helicopter pilot, said, “America’s strength comes from our enduring belief that freedom is worth fighting for and from our commitment to protect and empower the hard-working families who make the American dream possible,” according to an Associated Press report. He also promised to help enact President Donald Trump’s “America First” agenda after defeating Democratic state Rep. Aftyn Behn by 9 percentage points. The margin of victory dipped just a tad from former U.S. Rep. Mark Green’s typical 20-plus-point wins.
Van Epps’ victory was critical in helping Republicans maintain a majority in the U.S. House as it copes with critical issues such as the Epstein files and an investigation into the bombing of an alleged drug smuggling boat off the coast of Venezuela. Hitting the vessel twice would have been illegal.
It’s amazing how fast the federal government can work when control is on the line.

,Mississippi Today,2025-12-05 11:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Dozens locked in Hinds County’s jails without an indictment — some for over a year,"Daja E. Henry, The Marshall Project",,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/12/05/dozens-locked-in-hinds-countys-jails-without-an-indictment/,At least 60 people arrested in Hinds County have been jailed in its detention facilities for over three months — including at least five for more than a year.,"At least 60 people arrested in Hinds County have been jailed in its detention facilities for over three months — including at least five for more than a year — with no indictment filed against them and no pathway to a trial in sight.
One man has been in jail for 18 months on drug charges without an indictment and has no attorney to move his case along, according to court records reviewed by The Marshall Project – Jackson.
Mississippi is one of the few states where people can be jailed indefinitely without indictment, a critical step to send a case to a judge or a jury. This gap has deepened the overcrowding, violence and dysfunction that put Raymond Detention Center — the county’s primary jail — under federal control in the first place.
The lengthy detentions in Hinds County have been caused by multiple issues, including an increased Capitol Police force in Jackson, an overwhelmed state crime lab, and a shortage of prosecutors and public defenders to handle the backlog of cases. 
The federal receiver operating the Raymond Detention Center has warned the county district attorney that the jail cannot be fixed while people remain locked up without a way to get to court.
In a letter obtained by The Marshall Project – Jackson, federal receiver Wendell M. France wrote to Hinds County District Attorney Jody Owens telling him that holding so many people is costly for county taxpayers and is impeding France’s ability to fix the jail’s problems. France, who took over the jail on Oct. 1, asked Owens to address the delays in prosecution immediately. 
“Overcrowding affects housing, safety, and services,” France wrote. “Staff and funding that should be directed toward facility improvements are instead consumed managing extended pretrial stays.” 
As part of the court’s receivership agreement, France is barred from making public statements about his work. 
More than half of the unindicted detainees were arrested on violent crime charges, including rape, murder and aggravated assault. Others were charged with nonviolent offenses, including burglary and drug possession. 
One detainee, LaDarius Moore, was arrested more than six months ago and is being held on a $7.5 million bond, one of the highest in the county’s history. As of Dec. 1, he has not been indicted. 
In a handwritten note to Judge Debra Gibbs, Moore asked for his day in court. “I have lost my job after being in here for 6 months. My kids mother can’t afford to feed them without SNAP benefits on her own and they really need me to take care of them. I respectfully ask you to consider my family responsibilities.”
Moore faces charges of aggravated assault, being a felon in possession of a firearm, and 12 counts of armed robbery. His court file shows no response from the judge and no upcoming court date.
‘You’re risking life and limb in the Hinds County jail.’
Hinds County’s indictment delays reflect a statewide problem, said André de Gruy, the state public defender. The Marshall Project – Jackson previously reported on a case in Pike County, in which a man was incarcerated for nearly 18 months before being indicted.
A federal judge appointed France in 2022 after the county repeatedly failed to comply with a Justice Department agreement to address rampant violence, understaffing, a steady flow of drugs into the facility, and poor record-keeping that kept detainees there long past their court-ordered release dates. Appeals delayed France’s start until this October.
More than a decade after the Justice Department first brought its case, reports of inhumane conditions still abound. Detainees at Raymond reported living in darkness, being extorted to use the restrooms and sleeping on filthy floors. Earlier this year, a man was killed inside the jail and two others died of drug overdoses. In October, the Hinds County Board of Supervisors approved an emergency declaration because of overcrowding at the facility, which held about 450 people at the beginning of that month.
“You’re risking life and limb in the Hinds County jail. That is a serious proposition of someone who hasn’t been indicted of any crime, much less convicted,” said Hernandez D. Stroud, a senior fellow in the Justice Program at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University, who has studied jail receivership. “That’s scary.”
Typically, after a person is arrested, law enforcement turns the case over to the district attorney, who brings the case before a grand jury. If the grand jury returns an indictment — a formal criminal charge — the case moves to a judge and potentially a jury. 
Already burdened with a backlog of cases, the county’s legal system has been inundated with arrests since the Capitol Police began expanding in July 2021, in response to what Gov. Tate Reeves called a “never-ending cycle of violent crime.” The Capitol Police force previously guarded state property, but its jurisdiction, the Capitol Complex Improvement District, has since grown to more than 20 square miles in the city. The force has also grown from 81 officers in 2021 to more than 150. By the end of 2023, the number of indictments had risen 33% from the previous year.
A receiver is “not going to be able to address those problems until you reduce the population to be more in line with the staffing levels you have, and the bed capacity,” de Gruy said. “Trying to do that in an environment where you’re now seeing a lot more people being arrested, it just makes his job that much harder.” 
Lengthy waits for case files from arresting agencies and reports from an overwhelmed crime lab also drag cases out, said de Gruy. 
In response to France’s letter, Owens wrote that he had not received case files from law enforcement on more than 100 of the approximately 240 unindicted detainees, including those held for more than three months. He also cited delays in receiving final autopsy reports, a need for mental health evaluations of defendants and “the sheer volume of crime plaguing our community.” 
Owens’ office indicted 1,264 cases last year and resolved 1,135, leaving 129 open. The previous year, grand juries returned indictments in 1,696 cases and his office resolved just 989. Cases are resolved by guilty pleas, trials, dismissals or pretrial diversion programs. 
Owens also told France that the jail roster contained misspelled names and outdated information. In some cases, people listed as unindicted had already been indicted or released. 
“This just has layers of institutional incompetence and dysfunction, such that even when you have a receiver, it is hard to disentangle everything to get to the constitutional violations,” Stroud said. “It’s stunning.”
Hinds County Sheriff Tyree Jones, who used to run the jail and also serves as the Jackson Police chief, said he was not aware of any delays in forwarding cases to prosecutors. 
“When it comes to the jail, I think everybody has their own individual opinion, and everybody has their own professional responsibility,” Jones said. “There’s probably a little bit more room for correction on all levels.”
Owens and Hinds County Public Defender Gail Wright Lowery have asked the county Board of Supervisors for $700,000 in emergency funds, split between their offices, to fund six to eight staff members to focus on reducing the jail population. 
“The only way the system works is that … as many people are getting out of our system as fast as we’re bringing them in,” Owens said at the Nov. 3 board meeting. “Our current volume doesn’t allow us to do that.” 
Wright Lowery said five attorneys have recently left her office. She requested the funds to boost her staff’s salaries and to hire experienced attorneys to work part-time to help move cases through the system. 
“Every time I lose an attorney, you have an average of over 100 people in detention who lose their attorney,” she said. Her office is funded for 14 lawyers. 
Hinds County Board of Supervisors President Robert Graham said the board would consider the request for the $700,000.

(National Archives)L.A. and Gertrude Tapp knew their son was serving aboard the USS Arizona when they heard the big battleship had sunk in the surprise Japanese air attack that plunged the United States into World War II.
Gunner’s Mate Third Class Lambert Ray Tapp was 23 and aboard the USS Arizona on Dec. 7, 1941.
But for two agonizing weeks, the owners of Shakertown Fruit Farm in Mercer County didn’t know if 23-year-old Gunner’s Mate Third Class Lambert Ray Tapp was dead or alive.
The age of cell phones and instant communication was decades away on Dec. 7, 1941, the date President Franklin D. Roosevelt predicted “will live in infamy.” Thus, the Tapps—and other stateside families with loved ones in uniform in Hawaii—suffered agonizing uncertainty for days.
For the Tapps, the terrible wait turned into weeks.
All of the families hoped or prayed for the best, while fearing the worst. Some tried to convince themselves that “no news is good news.”
Relatives, especially mothers, fathers and spouses, dreaded the knock at the door that would announce the arrival of a Western Union messenger bringing the worst possible news.
“With limits on how many words a telegram could accommodate, the military adopted distinct standardized phrasing to convey the news; hence, the common chilling phrase ‘I regret to inform you…,’” wrote Megan Harris in a Library of Congress blog.
Between Dec. 21, 1941, and Jan. 9, 1942, a Western Union courier called at L.A. and Gertrude Tapp’s home three times.
The first Navy wire said Lambert Ray was reported missing. Some families took “missing” to mean “dead.” Others believed, or wanted to believe, that “missing” meant their relative might somehow be alive.
The second cable instantly turned the Tapps’ anxiety into joyous relief. He was alive. But their jubilation was short lived; the third telegram again said he was missing.
Stories in the Harrodsburg Herald and Lexington Herald-Leader are silent about the emotional roller coaster the Tapps must have endured. In the chaos and confusion following the Pearl Harbor attack, military authorities went with the best information they had.  As a result, some telegrams erroneously listed servicemembers as missing or killed in action, necessitating another cable saying the first one was a mistake.
But the triple telegrams sent to the Tapps seem rare, if not unique.
Lambert Ray Tapp was born in Webster County on Oct. 25, 1918, the same day his mother, Helen Callis Tapp, 19, died, evidently in childbirth. L.A. married Gertrude Dossett Tapp in 1919. They reared Lambert Ray and two children of their own.
Lambert Ray joined the Navy in Louisville on March 6, 1940, and ended up on the battleship Arizona, one of the largest and most powerful warships afloat.
When the air raid began, the Arizona was part of “Battleship Row,” a procession of seven capital ships moored alongside Ford Island in the middle of Pearl Harbor.
The attack sprang from a half-dozen aircraft carriers and included 350 fighters, torpedo-bombers, dive-bombers and horizontal bombers. While some Japanese planes also struck Army Air Force and Marine air bases on Oahu, the Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor was the main target.
The enemy appeared over Pearl Harbor at 7:55 a.m. Dec. 7 was a Sunday, and most of the sailors had the day off, “liberty” in Navy lingo.
About 8:10 a.m., a 1,763-pound naval shell converted into a bomb crashed through the Arizona’s forward deck, penetrated deep into the ship and ignited powder magazines and gasoline used to fuel the battleship’s scout planes.
The blast produced a huge fireball, heaved the 32,600-ton battlewagon’s bow nearly 50 feet into the air and broke the ship virtually in half, according to Craig Nelson’s book “Pearl Harbor: From Infamy to Greatness.” The bomb killed 1,177 sailors and marines. All told, the attack claimed the lives of 2,340 sailors, marines, soldiers and airmen and 49 civilians. The enemy sank seven ships and left several more damaged.
The initial telegram said Lambert Ray was “missing following action in the performance of his duty and in the service of his country.” A Jan. 6 wire provided the Tapps “a very happy new year,” according to the Harrodsburg Herald. Lambert Ray, the Navy assured his parents, was “now reported to be a survivor” and “will doubtless communicate with you at an early date informing you of his welfare and whereabouts.”
The Navy “deeply regretted ” any “anxiety caused by the previous message.”
Three more days passed with no word from their son. On Jan. 9, the third telegram destroyed L.A. and Gertrude Tapp’s dreams of a happy reunion with Lambert Ray.
The cable said Murray Leland Tapp, also a sailor on the Arizona but evidently not related to Lambert Ray, had survived, but L.A. and Gertrude’s son was “now reported missing upon the latest casualty lists.” The Navy “fully appreciated” the family’s “great anxiety” and promised: “Any report as to the fate of your son will be communicated to you promptly when received.”
Lambert Ray Tapp’s remains were never found. But his name is enshrined in stone in the Courts of the Missing, also known as the Gardens of the Missing, which are part of The National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Honolulu.
L.A. and Gertrude Tapp had grieved over the loss of a child 10 years before Lambert Ray’s life ended at Pearl Harbor. Their daughter, Ann Marie, died as a toddler in 1931.
Their son, John Bethel Tapp, grew up to follow his half-brother into the Navy where he earned the gold wings of a naval aviator and rose to the rank of lieutenant commander. His name is also carved in stone in the Honolulu cemetery.
On March 23, 1966, during the Vietnam War, the 32-year-old carrier-based pilot’s attack jet crashed in the South China sea. Like Lambert Ray’s, his body was not recovered.
A simple stone slab memorializes the siblings on the family plot at Shady Grove Cemetery in the Poole community in Webster County. “LOST AT SEA” is their common epitaph.
While L.A. died five years before Commander Tapp lost his life, Gertrude, who outlived a second husband, survived to age 93 in 1998. She and Ann Marie also are buried on the family plot in Shady Grove.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Arizonajpeg-1024x805.jpg,,,2025-12-05 05:57:05.869857

(Photo by Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)George Mason University officials said Thursday that no settlement agreement has been proposed with the federal government as it navigates four civil rights investigations, which began in July and are another issue that have shaped Virginia’s tumultuous higher education landscape this year.
Scrutiny of the institution and whether it would settle intensified after the University of Virginia signed an agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice to suspend multiple civil rights investigations. 
The George Mason investigations focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives at the school, its employment practices and treatment of students, as well as a separate probe into alleged antisemitism on campus. 
GMU President Gregory Washington said at Thursday’s Board of Visitors executive committee meeting that negotiations are still underway, but did not provide any timeline for a resolution. He also reiterated the institution’s plan to address the investigations head on.
“Wrong guy to throw these kinds of things at,” said Washington. “I’m not the guy that runs away from the fire. I’m the actual guy that runs into it.”
GMU Rector Charles Stimson, who faced criticism for holding a second executive committee meeting with only six voting members on the board, echoed Washington’s remarks and thanked him for his leadership during the ongoing process.
“I know these are tough times,” Stimson said. “You kept your chin up, and Mason is going to thrive when we come out the backside of this. We’re going to do the best we can for Mason because that’s our number one priority.”
Meanwhile, outside of the meeting, a group of faculty members protested against the board, accusing it of meeting improperly because it lacked the required members to form a quorum. Some also claimed that the institution has a draft settlement agreement in place. 
John Hollis, a spokesman for George Mason, told the Mercury that no draft settlement agreement exists.
“We must continue to send a very strong message to (President Washington) that there can be no settlement that compromises our academic freedom and our institutional autonomy,” said George Mason University-American Association of University President Bethany Letiecq.

Tim Gibson, president of the Virginia Conference of the American Association of University, also criticized the board for policies he said undermine academic freedom, including the IHRA definition of anti-Semitism and President Donald Trump administration’s diversity, equity, and inclusion redefinitions.
“The settlement agreement would force George Mason University to accept the Trump administration’s definitions of diversity, equity, inclusion programs,” Gibson said. “These programs would be redefined, not as what they are, which is a commitment to make George Mason University a welcoming environment for people from all walks of life, instead, these programs would be redefined as de facto discrimination against who? Against white people.”
Both educators said students, staff and university leaders should resist these policies and called for solidarity across institutions.
Earlier this week, UVA Interim President Paul Mahoney defended the university’s decision to enter into agreement with the DOPJ during a hearing with state senators.
UVA interim president to senators: Agreement with DOJ to pause probes was ‘best option available’

UVA will not have to invest any money to complete the agreement, like Cornell University will, nor repay any money to the federal government, which Northwestern University must do.
Mahoney called the decision “the best option available,” because it suspends costly and disruptive investigations and preserves institutional autonomy and academic freedom. Democratic lawmakers say the agreement would open the school up to potential conflict with existing law,and infringed on state sovereignty.
Both schools are also awaiting a court decision on the future of Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s appointments to their respective governing boards. The Virginia Military Institute’s board is also named in that legal challenge.
 Protest in Charlottesville

On Friday, professors and workers at the University of Virginia will hold a rally in Charlottesville protesting UVA’s Board of Visitors, which is facing claims it lacks the necessary representatives who are Virginia residents and alumni. 
UVA also recently launched a search for a new president to lead the institution.
Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger and Youngkin diverged on whether the university should continue its search, with Spanberger asking the board to halt the process until she takes office and Youngkin accusing her of inappropriately attempting to intervene in the process. 
Friday’s protest organizers will also weigh in on the issue.
“It is disturbing if not surprising that this illegitimate UVA Board of Visitors seeks to further its power grab by rushing to appoint a new University President who will be loyal the anti-democratic agenda of Trump, Youngkin, and allied monied interests,” said Harry Szabo, president of the United Campus Workers of Virginia, a labor union of higher education workers in Virginia and one of the protest’s organizers. 
Szabo said it’s the labor union’s “democratic duty” to oppose the board and to support a “university that serves the public good and promotes scholarship independent of the needs of billionaires or the ideologies of the powerful.”
“In other words,” Szabo added, “we need to defend the idea of a university of, by, and for the people.”

Gov.-elect Ghazala Hashmi unveils plan to reduce utility bill costs. (Photo by Shannon Heckt/Virginia Mercury)Ahead of the 2026 General Assembly legislative session, Lieutenant Gov.-elect Ghazala Hashmi on Thursday joined environmental advocates from the National Resource Defense Council and Evergreen Collaborative in Richmond to share policy ideas they believe will put money back in consumers’ pockets.
“Policies must shift so that the cost is not on the everyday rate payers,” Hashmi said.
Following rate hikes for Dominion and Appalachian Power Company, many consumers are looking for ways to ease the pressure. Research by Synapse Energy Economics found that requiring data centers to pay for energy production could be a way to reduce the amount put onto residential customers.
The groups said that tech companies should invest in renewable energy projects either near their data centers or allow them to purchase the power needed to fuel their power-hungry facilities. It would take legislative action to make those requirements, which would then have to be managed through the State Corporation Commission.
“Requiring these data centers to bring their own energy to the table helps insulate the market from the price shock that occurs when demand is so high,” said Charles Harper, senior power sector lead for Evergreen Collaborative.
The research also pushes for PJM, the regional grid operator, to add renewable energy projects onto the grid more quickly in order to help relieve power strains. While the state does not have the authority to force PJM to amp up connections, states have tried to get more representation in their decisions and called on the grid operator to speed up connections.
One challenge the commonwealth faces with trying to build up its energy profile is getting local permits to build mainly solar projects. Individual counties are left the authority to allow or deny energy projects to be built within their borders. Solar projects can often be controversial at local boards of supervisors meetings; the state is working to increase education about these projects to cut down on the spread of misinformation. 
The groups said there should be reforms to reduce the amount of widespread denials of these projects, however, local perspectives must be considered when determining where energy projects should be sited.
“We see these sort of more holistic statewide interests can sometimes trump local interests, but I think there is a balance to be struck, that there is a way to take into account local considerations and also harmonizing statewide interests,” said Walton Shepard, NRDC’s Virginia director.
Other proposed regulation changes laid out in the plan presented by Hashmi and the two groups call for adopting electric vehicle charging infrastructure, reforming utility business models that determine how much of a profit they make, and expanding energy efficiency programs to cut down on power waste.
Legislation has yet to be filed pertaining to the majority of the presented plan but there are bills to expand solar power and efficiency programs already on the docket for lawmakers to review. The legislative session begins on Jan. 14.

(Photo by Getty Images)An eviction diversion program Virginia piloted before making permanent this year is likely to be further revised in next year’s legislative session, lawmakers said at a Virginia Housing Commission meeting Thursday. 
The program — which was first tested in Richmond, Danville, Hampton and Petersburg — allows delinquent renters and landlords to negotiate before people are removed from their homes. It means that tenants who fell behind on rent may qualify for the diversion program, but certain criteria have still posed a barrier to the people who could benefit from it.
For instance, eligible people can’t have fallen behind on rent more than twice in the past six months or more than three times in the past year, can’t have previously utilized the eviction diversion program within the past year, and must be able to pay 25% of what they owe as they enter the program. They also can’t have used a right-of-redemption, when tenants pay their owed rent before an eviction court date to avoid the proceeding. 
But people who face a struggle to pay rent to the point that they need an eviction diversion program are likely to have been late on rent a few times in the months leading up to seeking the program, Housing Opportunities Made Equal policy director Laura Dobbs said.
“People have been trying to do the right thing, to catch up, and they haven’t been able to, so now they have this one last ditch program,” she said.  
Data presented to the Housing Commission on Thursday showed mixed success with the cities that have stood up eviction diversion programs as causes for evictions are often nuanced.
Richmond saw a dip in 2023 from pre-pandemic levels, but evictions rose again in 2024. Hampton saw a consistent drop while Danville was fairly level and Petersburg saw relatively static numbers before a small decrease last year. The commission reviewed pre-pandemic years along with 2023 onward; the period of 2020 through 2022 could be an outlier considering COVID-19-era protections. 
Rent in Virginia has risen by about 1% over the past year and Virginia is ranked the 12th most expensive state to rent in, according to data from Apartments.com — a leading housing search tool. 
Between inflation, rising rent and often stagnant wages, the consensus is that meeting the criteria may only become harder for people, Virginia Poverty Law Center policy director Chrstine Marra said. 
“We’re going to see fewer people take advantage (of the program),” she told members of the  commission Thursday. 
It’s why Del. Adele McClure, D-Arlington, said she plans to adjust the law in 2026. Del. David Bulova, D-Fairfax, and Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, emphasized that adjustments could mean a more successful program and how more people need it.
McClure, who is also a member of the commission, spearheaded making the program statewide and permanent in this year’s legislative session. 
In an interview after the meeting, she said that she wants to make the program “more expansive and more inclusive.” 
McClure recalled experiencing evictions herself when she was growing up, which gave her personal familiarity with how disruptive it can be. Those experiences have shaped her passion for housing policy since she became a state lawmaker. 
Addressing housing affordability and stability was a pillar of winning campaigns this year, from Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger’s race to many of Virginia’s House of Delegates candidates’ contests, setting the stage for it to become a prominent policy focus in the 2026 legislative session.
Dobbs, of HOME, noted that policies that perhaps needed more workshopping or which did pass the legislature in the past before being vetoed by outgoing Gov.Glenn Youngkin could fare better next year. 
Examples include a proposal that would extend Virginia’s five-day grace period to 14 days if someone is behind on rent and a proposal to prohibit landlords from denying housing to applicants that have an eviction proceeding on their record even if they won the legal battle. 
With holidays and the 2026 legislative session approaching, McClure said lawmakers will be fine-tuning their proposals and preparing to deliberate them. Housing, she said, is intrinsic to so many other things. 
“Housing is the foundation for access to child care, for access to education, to health care, to anything that is an essential need,” she said.

The state Court of Judicial Discipline, which hears and decides ethical misconduct charges against Pennsylvania judges, lifted an order suspending Judge Steven Stambaugh on Thursday. 
He was suspended without pay in October 2024 after a federal grand jury returned a 31-count indictment against him alleging wire fraud, mail fraud, witness tampering and related offenses.
Stambaugh entered a pretrial diversion agreement with federal prosecutors last month, which allows him to avoid a trial or a guilty plea, according to court records. Under the agreement, he will serve a period of supervised release, which is similar to probation.

U.S. District Judge Malachy E. Mannion dismissed the indictment Wednesday at the request of federal prosecutors. It was dismissed with prejudice, meaning that prosecutors cannot refile the charges. 
It’s unclear from court records why the U.S. Attorney’s Office agreed to the dismissal. Stambaugh’s lawyers argued last summer that the indictment should be dismissed because prosecutors withheld evidence that raised serious questions about the credibility of a key witness. Mannion denied that request, the York Daily Record reported.
The indictment accused Stambaugh of using fraudulent unemployment claims to pay employees of his York personal injury law firm, Stambaugh Law. According to the indictment, Stambaugh allegedly filed and instructed his employees to file unemployment claims to collect unemployment compensation payments even though they were still employed. 
The claims, during the spring of 2020, included $600-a-week Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation payments in addition to the weekly benefit the state pays those who are unemployed and unable to find work.
Stambaugh was also accused of pressuring an employee to lie in testimony before the grand jury and seeking a meeting with the witness to ensure they were “on the same page.”

(Photo by The Good Brigade/Getty Images)Starting Jan. 1, New Hampshire’s Medicaid program will stop covering GLP-1 drugs — Wegovy, Zepbound, and others — for weight loss, the Department of Health and Human Services told providers in October.
“We looked at the way that the state was supporting coverage for GLP-1 medicines and found that this was a fairly significant cost driver,” Gov. Kelly Ayotte told reporters on Wednesday. “And so we looked at the medically necessary reasons for it in terms of those who had pre-existing conditions and made the decision working with Health and Human Services to come up with a modified policy that will still allow medications in those circumstances, but then really make sure it is cost sustainable going forward.”
The Alliance for Women’s Health and Prevention wrote a letter to Ayotte Tuesday urging her to reconsider the decision. The organization noted that approximately 30% of women in New Hampshire — and a disproportionately large number of women of color — experience obesity and that obesity is associated with over 200 health complications, citing the American Medical Association and KFF.
Ayotte said Wednesday she would not reconsider the decision.
There are roughly 186,000 enrolled in Medicaid in New Hampshire, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. About 54% of them are women.
“When we’re talking about 180,000 enrollees, children and adults, that’s over 90,000 women who are Medicaid beneficiaries who may be living with obesity and could take advantage of receiving the obesity management medications basically to stem those comorbidities that are associated with living with obesity,” Millicent Gorham, CEO of the Alliance for Women’s Health and Prevention, said in a phone interview with the Bulletin Thursday. “We’re talking about diabetes and high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease and cancer. So if we can stem those diseases, then hopefully we can have more healthier people living in New Hampshire.”
Gorham said the change may provide short-term cost savings but will be more expensive in the long run.
“People are going to be living longer with obesity, which is going to lend to any number of the other 200 comorbidities that are aligned with living with obesity,” she said. “And clearly, when you’re talking about things like diabetes and cardiovascular disease and high blood pressure and cancer and fertility issues that are specific to women, they’re going to end up with higher costs specifically related to those diseases and also specifically related to higher hospitalization costs.”
Gorham pointed to the stigma surrounding obesity and weight loss drugs.
“People really may not understand that people living with obesity is not just about an alternative lifestyle,” she said. “It really is a chronic disease. That’s the first thing that they need to understand: It is a chronic disease, no different than high blood pressure, no different than diabetes, and we need to treat it like that. No other disease has to take on the kind of scrutiny that obesity takes on.”
The Alliance for Women’s Health and Prevention has launched a nationwide effort with a coalition of other health advocacy groups called Everybody Covered to push policymakers to improve coverage of GLP-1 drugs and other obesity treatments.
As of October, 16 states cover GLP-1 drugs, according to KFF. In addition to New Hampshire, California and South Carolina plan to end coverage of the drugs in January. North Carolina ended coverage last month while Michigan plans to limit coverage to people who are “morbidly obese.” The states say they can’t afford the drugs.
The Alliance for Women’s Health and Prevention has been lobbying several states to maintain coverage of the drugs. Gorham said New Hampshire’s response has been “pretty much kinda the same” as other states. 
GLP-1 drugs have been shown to be effective for weight loss, though they come with a number of side effects for some patients, including nausea, vomiting, headaches, diarrhea, and constipation, according to Harvard Medical School and the Cleveland Clinic. While some experts and researchers have concerns about the drugs’ long-term impact and safety, many argue the benefits outweigh the known risks.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/glp1drugs-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-05 05:57:05.869857

More than 10,000 Ohioans could return to homelessness due to a federal funding policy change for local homeless assistance programs, advocates warn. 
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development issued a new Notice of Funding Opportunity for the Continuum of Care program on Nov. 13 that would limit funding for programs for certain permanent housing programs to 30% of a community’s total Continuum of Care grant, instead of the current 87%. 
HUD’s Continuum of Care Program is the largest federal grant funding source for homelessness services and housing. 
It helps fund permanent supportive housing, repaid rehousing, and transitional housing, among other things.

“What’s the most critical part of this shift is that there are 10,000 people across the state of just Ohio that will potentially lose their housing because the supports will not be there any longer for them to remain in the place that they’ve called home,” said Amy Riegel, executive director of the Coalition on Homelessness and Housing in Ohio. 
Nationally, 170,000 people are at risk of going back to homelessness because of this policy change. 
“That is a lot of individuals at one time that none of our systems can absorb to be able to support them and the needs that they would then have,” Riegel said. 
The application for funds has to be submitted to HUD by Jan. 14, 2026, and funds are likely to be announced in May 2026, Riegel said. 
“On January 1, programs will start to be affected by these changes, and by May 1, almost every program receiving funding through the Continuum of Care process will be affected by the delays in funding and also then the shifts in the priorities of the program,” Riegel said. 
HUD announced $178 million in Continuum of Care funding for Ohio back in January and this federal policy change could take $80 million away from Ohio programs that house people experiencing homelessness. 
Ohio would be one of the most impacted states since it relies on federal funds for a majority of its permanent housing beds for people experiencing homelessness, according to the National Alliance to End Homelessness.  
“We were able to build great programs that are very effective and work well for people, but in this case we will be at greater risk than other states because of that,” Riegel said. 
“Because we’re doing well and because we meet the objectives of the program, we’ll actually lose out in this process.”
Louisiana was the only state that has more permanent housing beds funded by the Continuum of Care program with 75%. 
Twenty states sued the Trump administration over these cuts to federal funding for local homeless assistance programs, but Ohio was not one of them. 
Over the summer, President Donald Trump issued an executive order to get people experiencing homelessness off the streets by committing them to mental health institutions or drug treatment centers without their consent.
But Riegel said this HUD announcement runs counter to Trump’s executive order. 
“There is a mismatch in what the administration is saying and then the actual policy that they put forward that’s very confusing and makes it very difficult for communities to understand how to actually respond to the needs that they have at home,” she said.
The executive order goes against Housing First, a homeless assistance approach that was first adopted federally during the George W. Bush Administration, which prioritizes housing without any prerequisites, such as sobriety or participation in treatment. 
“Getting people access directly from streets into housing is what solves the housing crisis,” said Christopher Knestrick, executive director for the Northeast Ohio Coalition for the Homeless. 
“If we think about homelessness, the solution to homelessness is housing. We need to continue to give people access to housing and then provide wraparound services to them.”
Winter is a volatile time for those experiencing unsheltered homelessness, Riegel said. 
“These conditions are extreme, and it is very difficult for even a person who is healthy and has proper clothing and all of those items to spend any length of time outdoors,” she said. 
“It is also a time where people may seek shelter that is unstable or unfit for human habitability, and that also creates dangers for those individuals.”
Homelessness in the U.S. increased 18% last year with 771,480 people experiencing homelessness, according to HUD. 
There were 11,759 people experiencing homelessness in Ohio last year— about a 3% increase, according to the HUD. 
Nearly 80% of those experiencing homelessness in Ohio were sheltered while the rest were unsheltered. 
There were 2,556 people experiencing homelessness in Franklin County during January’s Point-in-Time Count — a 7.4% increase from last year, according to the Community Shelter Board. 
Ohioans need to be making at least $22.51 an hour working a full-time job to be able to afford a “modest” two-bedroom apartment, according to COHHIO and the National Low Income Housing Coalition’s 2025 Out of Reach report.

New rules from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development will sharply restrict how $3 billion in homelessness aid will be spent, allowing no more than 30% of federal grants to be used for permanent housing. (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)As the housing shortage pushes more Americans into homelessness for the first time, the Trump administration wants to focus federal housing aid on mental health treatment and enforcement against street homelessness, rather than on finding people permanent homes as quickly as possible.
The administration’s new plan to tie federal housing aid to work requirements and drug treatment could be a boon to states such as Alabama, Florida and Wyoming that already are pursuing that strategy. But for many other states — and nonprofit providers across the country — the rules represent a sudden pivot from past expectations. In California, the new federal funding priorities face a direct conflict with state law.
Under new rules announced last month, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development will place new restrictions on $3 billion in homelessness aid, allowing no more than 30% of federal grants to be used for permanent housing. That approach, known as Housing First, prioritizes getting people into safe, stable housing ahead of other treatment and enforcement, and had been a key focus for the federal government’s Continuum of Care Program for homelessness.
Now, HUD’s new rules — a shift to Treatment First policies — could result in a major reprioritization of who gets funding and for what purpose. Backlash from many nonprofits and homelessness service providers across the country has been swift, and 20 states and Washington, D.C., have filed suit to stop the rules, arguing they violate federal law. Several cities and counties across the country also have joined a lawsuit against the department.
Many more cities ban sleeping outside despite a lack of shelter space

While service providers point to success stories from permanent supportive housing, the Trump administration points to rising homelessness — and a perception of violent crime — as a reason to shift funding away from the long-standing approach.
But Martha Are, CEO of the Homeless Services Network of Central Florida, said the Trump administration is putting the onus on  nonprofits and service providers to fix a homelessness crisis that is propelled by a lack of housing that people can afford.
“If homelessness numbers go up, some assume the homeless-response system doesn’t work. But the real driver is the housing market, not the interventions,” Are said. “HUD is penalizing communities for following the rules they set in previous years. I’ve never seen them say, ‘You complied with our guidance, and now you lose points for it.’”
Easy transition for some states
An analysis of publicly available federal data by the National Alliance to End Homelessness found that 88% of federal Continuum of Care dollars flow to permanent supportive housing and rapid rehousing, the models with the strongest evidence of reducing chronic homelessness. The new HUD rules would force cuts large enough to cause roughly 170,000 people to lose that housing, according to the advocacy group’s projections.
But a handful of Continuum of Care programs already devote far less to permanent housing. According to the National Alliance to End Homelessness, that includes that includes certain county or state programs in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Tennessee, West Virginia and Wyoming.
These programs operate closer to HUD’s new funding requirements and are unlikely to face major disruption. Some even may become more competitive for federal funding, especially in states where policymakers have already adopted enforcement-heavy approaches to homelessness.
Such states — including Florida, Georgia, Missouri, Tennessee and Texas — may be better positioned under HUD’s new grant-funding criteria, which prioritize jurisdictions that criminalize public camping, expand law enforcement involvement or restrict low-barrier shelters, which may have more flexible policies than traditional shelters.
Since the U.S. Supreme Court’s City of Grants Pass v. Johnson ruling in June 2024 allowing localities to ban outdoor camping even if there is no homeless shelter space available, roughly 150 cities in 32 states have passed or strengthened such ordinances.
Can states, and a little bit of faith, convert church land into affordable housing?

The annual point-in-time count of people sleeping outside reported that homelessness reached an all-time high in 2024, the most recent data available from HUD. The count, taken during the last 10 days of January 2024, found that 771,480 people were experiencing homelessness, an 18% increase over the previous year and the largest one-year jump in the history of the count.
HUD told Stateline the administration is shifting its approach to emphasize “long-term self-sufficiency and recovery” rather than the number of housing units funded or filled.
The agency rejected advocates’ claims that the new rules will increase homelessness, arguing instead that “failed” Housing First policies have contributed to rising numbers. HUD said it hopes communities will convert many permanent supportive housing programs into transitional housing with stronger requirements around addiction and mental-health services.
Skepticism about Housing First
The impact of these cuts won’t be evenly distributed.
Some areas with the deepest investments in the Housing First approach — including Cleveland, Ohio; Los Angeles; and New York City — stand to lose thousands of units that currently serve older adults, those leaving domestic violence situations, people with disabilities, veterans and families.
Those in favor of HUD’s funding shift argue that long-standing as it may be, Housing First has failed to reduce homelessness.
HUD’s annual counts show national homelessness rising for most of the past decade, and the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service notes that while Housing First stabilizes individuals, it has not reduced the number of people experiencing homelessness.
A 2021 Harvard University study found that while most people in permanent supportive housing remained housed in the first year, retention dropped sharply over time — with only about 12% still housed after 10 years.
Conservative think tanks such as the Cicero Institute, American Enterprise Institute and the Manhattan Institute suggest that Housing First undervalues mental health and substance use treatment. They point to Oregon’s homelessness struggles after drug decriminalization as evidence that voluntary services alone cannot stabilize the most vulnerable residents.
They further argue that permanent housing grants crowd out shelter, detox and transitional programs, and that many nonprofits defending the model are financially invested in maintaining the status quo.
At a moment when tight housing markets are pushing record numbers of people into first-time homelessness, local providers, who stand to lose grants, warn that HUD’s policy reversal will function more like a mass eviction than a funding shift — sending tens of thousands of people back into shelters, onto waiting lists, or directly onto the streets.
As homeless people become more visible, some cities and states take a tougher line

Losing trust in the system
In Orlando, Florida, many residents are experiencing homelessness for the first time. Shelters are full and a recent law in Florida allows police to arrest people for sleeping outdoors.
Are, of the Homeless Services Network of Central Florida, said the proposed HUD changes would eliminate more than 500 permanent housing subsidies that her organization offers in the Orlando area alone.
For providers, these subsidies cover the rent for units where people already live. If HUD defunds them, tenants would lose support, landlords would stop receiving payments and people would be evicted unless local governments backfill the funds, she said. And most local governments can’t afford to, she added.
Central Florida has built a system that uses data to focus on high-need individuals and keep them housed — in long-term rental units paired with voluntary support services — at a lower cost than mandated hospitalizations or treatment, Are said. HUD’s abrupt policy reversal would unravel years of progress and leave communities with “no place to put people.”
“Our permanent supportive housing costs about one-twentieth of what inpatient institutional programs cost in this region, and the outcomes are far better,” she said.
Nashville, Tennessee, had expected stable homelessness funding until HUD overhauled the rules “out of [the] blue” and at a time when it would be hard for providers to plan for sudden changes, said Wally Dietz, legal director for the Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County.
When Congress approved a two-year cycle for fiscal years 2024 and 2025, localities were told they wouldn’t have to reapply for money, he said. That changed this fall.
“Nashville was given 60 days, spanning Thanksgiving and Christmas, to rewrite and resubmit its entire homelessness funding application, which is something the city typically prepares for a full year,” Dietz said.
If the changes to Nashville’s funding go through, not only will people lose their housing, he said, but a 20-year infrastructure will crumble and the164 landlords who partnered with the city will lose faith once rent aid stops flowing.
“Once evicted, people will not reengage with the system, and trust will be impossible to rebuild,” Dietz said.
Nashville is among a handful of localities, including Boston, San Francisco and Tucson, Arizona, that filed a joint lawsuit Monday to block the rule changes, accusing HUD of bypassing Congress. The suit, whose plaintiffs also include the National Alliance to End Homelessness and the National Low Income Housing Coalition, was filed in U.S. District Court in Rhode Island.
“If the administration wants to overhaul homelessness policy, it has to go through Congress,” Dietz said. “That gives cities time to prepare, to testify, to budget. But we didn’t get that chance.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-05 10:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"House version of Kids Online Safety Act ruffles Blumenthal, parents",Lisa Hagen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/05/kosa-blumenthal-house-version/,"Republicans on the House Energy and Commerce Committee removed a core part of the Senate KOSA bill: the ""duty of care"" section.","The latest version of the Kids Online Safety Act in the U.S. House is facing new opposition, this time from some parent advocate groups and U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, who is a co-author of the Senate bill.
Republicans on the House Energy and Commerce Committee removed a core part of the Senate bill: the “duty of care” section, which would require companies to “exercise reasonable care” when designing a platform to mitigate a defined list of potential harms to minors, including certain mental health disorders, substance use disorders and physical and sexual abuse. 
Targeted design features include infinite scroll, autoplay, notifications and other features that keep minors engaged in an app or site. 
The House draft requires platforms to create “reasonable policies, practices, and procedures” related only to threats of physical violence, sexual exploitation and abuse and the distribution of drugs. It would also prevent states from enacting or enforcing their own laws on similar issues.
House lawmakers said the changes were made to address lingering concerns over free speech and potential issues in court. 
The revision drew mixed reactions at this week’s congressional hearing on the bill. Some lawmakers and experts in the field were encouraged to see the duty of care removed, while others were disappointed about what they now view as a “watered-down” bill.
Without the duty of care provision, Blumenthal argued, lawmakers are enabling major tech companies and shying away from holding them accountable. But he remains hopeful the House and Senate can figure out a compromise bill and sees the renewed attention to the issue as progress.
“Totally caving on the duty of care is an abdication of responsibility to protect kids,” Blumenthal said. “There has to be some duty of care so Big Tech will recognize its responsibility, and the House surrendering is simply a sign of Big Tech’s power.”
“I would anticipate we’ll have negotiation once they’re done with those hearings,” he continued. “But we’re unwilling to accept a bill that weakens it so much that it fails to protect children.”
This week’s hearing illustrated the challenges that have plagued various pieces of tech legislation from the start: there’s broad consensus in Congress to better protect children and teenagers online but sharp disagreements remain in how to do so.
The revised Kids Online Safety Act was one of 19 bills up for consideration before a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on Tuesday. The committee also debated legislation that would require age verification on app stores, an updated version of the Children and Teens’ Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, and other bills on data privacy and parental controls.
But the Kids Online Safety Act, or KOSA, was a dominant focus of the hearing.
KOSA aims to put in place stricter settings by allowing children and parents to disable addictive features like infinite scroll and autoplay of videos, enable privacy settings and opt out of algorithmic recommendations. The types of platforms that would need to comply include social media, online video games, messaging sites and video streaming services.
The duty of care section, to hold platforms legally responsible for mitigating certain harms to minors, has come under scrutiny before, though it has been revised and narrowed in newer iterations of the Senate bill.
In the Senate version, platforms covered under the bill must “exercise reasonable care” in creating and implementing design features “to prevent and mitigate the following harms to minors where a reasonable and prudent person would agree that such harms were reasonably foreseeable.”
Some of those harms include eating disorders, substance use disorders, suicidal behaviors, and depressive and anxiety disorders with “objectively verifiable and clinically diagnosable symptoms” that relate to compulsive usage of the platform by a minor. Sexual exploitation and physical violence and online harassment that is “severe and pervasive” are also included.
The House GOP version instead seeks to adopt a more limited policy. It would require platforms likely to be used by minors to enforce “reasonable policies, practices, and procedures” regarding harms to minors related only to threats of physical violence, sexual exploitation and abuse, and the distribution of narcotic drugs.
A lead Republican sponsor, U.S. Rep. Gus Bilirakis, R-Fla., said changes were made to KOSA to make sure it’s “durable,” citing recent court cases of state-level child online safety legislation. And House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Brett Guthrie, R-Ky., said the revisions were meant to address concerns in both parties. 
“Don’t mistake durability for weakness, folks — this bill has teeth. By focusing on design features rather than protected speech, we will ensure it can withstand legal challenge while delivering real protections for kids online … and their families,” Bilirakis said.
Bilirakis also led last year’s House bill with U.S. Rep. Kathy Castor, D-Fla., which similarly contained a duty of care section like the Senate version. At the hearing, Castor called the new changes “a slap in the face” to parents and advocates pushing for KOSA.
Blumenthal rejected the characterizations from GOP House members, saying the bill is “content neutral.” He has said before it would not allow enforcers like the Federal Trade Commission or state attorneys general to sue over content or speech. And he called arguments that the bill wouldn’t hold up in a court because of First Amendment rights “totally bogus.”
“It’s not a bill about restricting content. It’s about the design of the intent so as to enable Big Tech itself to have responsibility,” he said. “So there’s nothing in our bill that restricts First Amendment free expression.”
ParentsSOS, a group representing families who have attributed the deaths of their children to harmful content viewed online, were disheartened by the changes to a bill they’ve been pushing Congress to pass for several years. The group took issue with the removal of the duty of care as well as the provision in the House bill that the federal regulation can preempt states’ own laws on children’s online safety.
They are encouraging House members to take up the Senate version crafted by Blumenthal and his Republican co-author, U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee.
“It needlessly delayed the House from advancing the wildly popular Senate version of the Kids Online Safety Act, which gives parents the tools they need to keep their children safe,” Joann Bogard, a member of ParentsSOS, said in a statement following the hearing. “If the Committee continues to advance a weak version of KOSA and preempt good state laws, we will have no choice but to vocally oppose the package.”
But some of the experts testifying at this week’s hearing were encouraged by the changes to the duty of care section.
“The tools that would be required under KOSA are definitely workable,” Paul Lekas, executive vice president of Software & Information Industry Association, said. “The requirements to establish procedures and processes and so forth seem really well-designed to address the constitutional concerns that have come up with respect to earlier drafts of this legislation.”
But there were some disagreements on the panel over broader preemption clauses in all of the bills before the House committee. Lekas said he supports a “strong and preemptive” federal regulation. But Kate Ruane, director of the Free Expression Project at the Center for Democracy & Technology, warned a preemptive federal law could override even stronger protections enacted by states on the same issues.
Critics on different sides of the political spectrum have also raised free speech issues. That was a primary concern for House Republicans when the bill was up for consideration in the last session, including for House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La.
Some LGBTQ+ groups, like Fight for the Future, have also flagged concerns that KOSA could lead to censoring or limiting access to resources like gender-affirming care and reproductive health for vulnerable minors, particularly for transgender kids.
At Tuesday’s hearing, Ruane said she worries platforms will play a guessing game of what type of content that may be harmful to minors.
That dovetailed with her concerns about the independence of the Federal Trade Commission under the Trump administration. President Donald Trump fired Democratic commissioners on the FTC. A federal district court judge said the firings were illegal, but the Supreme Court temporarily upheld it in an emergency order.
“If we do not have an independent FTC that is enforcing the law fairly as it applies to all children and protects all children, we have significant concerns about how these bills would operate in practice even if the way they are currently constituted as neutral and would protect everyone,” Ruane said.
When asked about the current FTC and its prospective role in enforcing KOSA, Blumenthal said he shared similar concerns.
“I’m not sure how we would exactly address it,” Blumenthal said, while adding that they could look into other possibilities of “enabling other enforcers and also safeguards against potential infringement on rights and liberties.”
“But I’m more worried about the absence of enforcement from an FTC that has no real regard for the law,” he added.
Blumenthal and Blackburn have brought up the Kids Online Safety Act in the past few sessions of Congress. The bill saw its biggest momentum last year, when it passed the Senate in a 91-3 vote.
But even after a last-ditch push by Elon Musk and other tech company executives to address GOP concerns over free speech, it stalled in the House without getting a floor vote before the end of last year.
Some major tech companies have endorsed the Senate version of KOSA. But NetChoice, a tech trade association representing members like Meta and Snap, has lobbied against passage in previous sessions of Congress. After Tuesday’s House hearing, the group was complimentary of House Republicans’ efforts on the 19 online safety bills before the committee and said it wants to work with the committee to “refine” the various tech proposals.
That could lead to an even bigger gulf between House and Senate lawmakers involved in trying to get children’s online safety protections signed into law.
On the Senate side, Blumenthal and Blackburn reintroduced KOSA earlier this year and are hoping for another vote in the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation. The bill has already advanced out of that committee several times in past sessions.
They still see a path for working out the differences in Congress and trying to get it through this time around.
“This bill has a dynamic that eventually will push it over the finish line. Whenever I talk to parents, the No. 1 concern on their mind is their kids’ safety on the internet,” Blumenthal said. “So it’s just a question of what we can get done and how quickly.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-02-at-1.14.04-PM.png,,,2025-12-05 05:57:05.869857

A resolution won’t come until at least next year for the case of Brittany Watts, a Warren resident who was criminally charged after she miscarried at her home, following multiple trips to the hospital.
She is suing the city of Warren, the hospital and law enforcement in U.S. District Court.
And, while an Ohio appeals court has heard the arguments on both sides of the state’s appeal on abortion regulations — originally stemming from a six-week abortion ban that was overturned — a decision as to whether parts of the law not related to the six-week ban will stand.
Brittany Watts
For Watts, it may be next September before she has an answer as to whether hospital staff and law enforcement in Warren County violated her rights by reporting a crime, resulting in charges of abuse of a corpse.
The charges that were rejected by a grand jury.
The lawsuit will be a year old as of January 2026, though it’s seen changes and activity throughout the year.
Watts wants compensation for what her attorneys argue are violations of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment, plus a federal law that gives anyone the right to emergency treatment regardless of insurance or ability to pay.
She’s suing St. Joseph Warren Hospital in Youngstown, the parent company Bon Secours Mercy Health, the city of Warren, and police officers from the city.
In the lawsuit, Watts said not only were her constitutional rights violated, but the staff “committed medical negligence, inflicted severe emotional distress and deprived her of her liberty without probable cause, among other misconduct.”

The story began when Watts said she went to the hospital for care during her pregnancy, where she waited a total of 18 hours over the course of two days, court documents state.
The first night she left after eight hours and “no meaningful treatment or guidance,” according to her attorneys.
The second day she was told her pregnancy was “doomed” and she was at risk of severe and life-threatening complications, but still was “effectively untreated.”
She left and suffered a miscarriage in her bathroom, before returning to the hospital.
It was at that point that she said hospital staff reported her and she was questioned by investigators who indicated that Watts had “birthed a live baby and hidden it ‘in a cabinet.’”
Since initially filing the lawsuit, attorneys have asked the court to add more hospital staff as parties to the lawsuit, including a staff member in risk management and a police officer, who Watts and her attorneys say advised a nurse, leading to her to “falsely report that (Watts) had committed a crime.”
The most recent documents in the case argue hospital staff and police officers knew Watts hadn’t committed a crime, but “saw to it that she would face criminal charges for having an experience shared by hundreds of thousands of women every year.”
All the parties named in the lawsuit have denied any wrongdoing, though the hospital has acknowledged to the court that Watts was told the fetus was “too early from a gestational age for any reasonable chance of survival,” that a doctor recommended that labor be induced, and that a delay could increase the risk of complications.
A jury trial has been scheduled in the case for Sept. 14, 2026, while document deadlines in the case range from Jan. 23 to June 1 of next year.
State abortion regulations
Meanwhile, an answer could come at any time in the case of an Ohio appeal fighting for regulations that were attached to a struck down six-week abortion ban.
The First District Court of Appeals heard oral arguments in the case in September, after a Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas Judge struck down the law that established the six-week abortion ban last October.
A key factor in the common pleas decision was a constitutional amendment passed by 57% of Ohio voters in 2023, that enshrined abortion care, including miscarriage care, into the Ohio Constitution.
The law at issue in the appeal was passed in 2019, eliminating abortions past six weeks of gestation.
It also included other provisions related to abortion record-keeping and specific punishments for failing to check for cardiac activity before an abortion.
Ohio Deputy Solicitor General Stephen Carney argued that the other provisions in the law outside of the ban on abortions at six weeks were “severable,” meaning they could act independently from the struck-down law.
He said if the appeals court struck down the entire law, including those provisions, it would be “doing something radical that no one has ever done before,” and consequences would ripple out to review of other laws.
Cassie Mitchell, who represented the women’s health clinics that sued the state to strike down the law, said the provisions are directly related to the six-week abortion ban, and therefore should go as well, as they exist to “clarify the scope of the ban.”

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images.)The Ohio Supreme Court has ruled police officers can be considered victims, and thus not subject to public disclosure, under Ohio’s Marsy’s Law privacy protections.
The case stems from a July 2023 incident in which three men robbed several car dealerships, banks, and even a GameStop before getting tracked down police.
A car chase on I-70 ended in a shootout. Two suspects fled on foot. But a third shot one officer five times and was approaching a second officer when he was shot and killed.
The fleeing suspects were caught, and in January of this year sentenced to 25 and 13 years respectively.
But the day of the shooting, reporters at the Columbus Dispatch filed a public records request for bodycam and dashcam footage.
Columbus Police eventually released redacted footage that shielded the identities of the officers claiming they were victims of a crime.
The Dispatch sued, claiming police officers acting in their official capacity can’t be considered victims because they’re representing the state.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Ohio Supreme Court Justice Patrick DeWine, writing for the court’s majority, disagreed — and he didn’t seem to think it was a hard call.
“Applying the plain text of the amendment, we have no difficulty concluding that an ordinary understanding of Marsy’s Law’s definition of victim encompasses the officers in this case,” he wrote.
To DeWine, it boils down to a simple equation: A victim under Marsy’s Law is a person against whom a criminal act is committed, and a police officer is definitely a person.
The court is not being asked “to determine whether an edge case fits within the scope of underdeterminative constitutional text,” DeWine continued. “This is a case in which the text is clear and determinative with respect to police officers.”
The police union was thrilled with the decision.
“This ruling is a bright light for common sense,” Fraternal Order of Police of Ohio President Jay McDonald said in a statement.
“Of course, Marsy’s Law protects police. When an officer is attacked, they are a victim like anyone else, and they deserve the same privacy and protections.”
But to some other justices on the bench, the case isn’t quite that simple — even if they agree police officers can meet the definition of victims.
Background
Marsy’s Law was first adopted as part of the California State Constitution in 2008.
The amendment provides several protections for victims of crime to ensure they’re heard in court, aware of developments in the case, and afforded privacy as proceedings play out.
Since its adoption in California, 13 states have adopted a version of the amendment. In Pennsylvania and Montana state courts later overturned the provisions.
Courts in Kentucky threw out that state’s version of Marsy’s Law, too. But voters approved a second version in 2020. The law is currently in effect in 12 states.
Since at least 2020, journalists have been raising alarms about law enforcement agencies use Marsy’s Law protections to shield the identity of officers involved in use of force incidents.
ProPublica noted it was particularly common in Florida, where voters approved Marsy’s Law in 2018.
But even some prominent law enforcement officials like Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri pushed back on that use of the law.
“A police officer who shoots and kills another is not a ‘victim’ of that shooting and cannot invoke Marsy’s Law to shroud his shooting in secrecy,” he wrote in an amicus brief.
In 2023, the Florida Supreme Court ruled Marsy’s Law doesn’t afford any victim, “police officer or otherwise — the categorical right to withhold his or her name from disclosure.”
The court determined that would be incompatible with the right to confront adverse witnesses in court and the state’s sunshine laws.
Ohio’s ruling, and its dissents
Among its arguments, The Columbus Dispatch said police officers, acting in their official capacity, need be treated differently under Marsy’s law because they’re treated differently under many other statutes.
“A person may commit many criminal offenses against a police officer that would not be criminal offenses if committed against a private individual,” the newspaper said.
That’s because offenses like false statements, resisting arrest, and failure to comply, are treated as offenses against the state, rather than the individual officer.
Just look at the two men charged with armed robbery in the underlying case.
The plaintiff wasn’t officer John Doe 1 or John Doe 2, as they’re identified in the Ohio Supreme Court case, and it wasn’t the businesses they robbed — it was the United States.
Granting police officers the right to shield their identity if they’re subject to any criminal offense would be a sweeping change.
It’s unlikely voters who approved Marsy’s Law, the newspaper said, “understood that they were granting state actors any rights that might result in their being deprived of their existing right to obtain information about police officers through public records requests.”
Justice DeWine brushed those arguments off.
“It may well be true that when a person has made a false report to a police officer or committed a similar crime, the police officer is not a victim of that crime under the constitutional definition,” he wrote. “But that is not the case in front of us.”
In a pair of dissents, Justices Patrick Fischer and Jennifer Brunner complicated DeWine’s straightforward interpretation.
Both agreed that officers can be victims under Marsy’s Law, but they still found fault with the police department’s stance.
Fischer said the facts of the case demonstrate Doe 1 and Doe 2 were in fact victims and the department was justified in redacting their identifying information under Marsy’s Law. But he stressed they weren’t the only officers on the scene.
“The evidence provided by CPD plainly shows that there are other records — specifically, body-worn-camera and dashboard-camera footage from other officers at the scene who were involved in the shooting — that are responsive to the Dispatch’s request and that were withheld by CPD under the victims’ rights exception,” he wrote.
Fischer noted the department conceded at oral argument that those other officers were not victims.
He contends the court should direct the department to release the remaining footage to The Dispatch.
Justice Brunner argued Ohioans have an understood constitutional right to access government records like body cam footage.
Instead of arguing a public official can never be a victim, she focused on the expectation of privacy.
Because police operate in public, with their name and badge number readily available, Marsy’s Law privacy protections shouldn’t extend to their conduct.
“Once the officers are on duty in public, they do not have an expectation of privacy in their names or identities,” she wrote.
Reactions
While the police union celebrated, Columbus City Attorney Zach Klein, who serves as legal advisor to the police department, sounded a more measured tone.
Although he respects the public’s desire for transparency, especially in use of force cases, he said city officials were simply trying to follow the law as written.
“Today’s ruling by the Ohio Supreme Court affirms that interpretation of Marsy’s Law,” he said. “If the Ohio legislature chooses to amend or clarify these important public record provisions in the future, we will of course follow those laws at that time.”
And the ACLU of Ohio, which opposed Marsy’s Law when it went before voters, is looking to the future as well.
In a statement Senior Policy Counsel Patrick Higgins wrote, “the ACLU of Ohio believes a transparent government can be an accountable government. In the wake of this decision, we stand ready and look forward to working with the state legislature to ensure that violent encounters between state actors and civilians are scrutinized under the daylight they deserve.”

(Photo by Maya Mitchell/New Hampshire Bulletin)New Hampshire’s Executive Council approved a contract to continue funding the “Get the Lead Out of Drinking Water” program for child care facilities on Wednesday.  
Since 2018, the state has required schools and licensed child care programs to test for lead in drinking water outlets, including fountains, classroom sinks, and kitchen fixtures. If lead levels in the water exceed 5 parts per billion, the system must be remediated, and the state will reimburse up to 100% of the remediation costs for the facility. 
The program allows the state to continue to enter into agreements with child care facilities to aid in remediation efforts. It is administered by the Department of Health and Human Services’ Division of Public Health, in partnership with the Department of Environmental Services. 
The program is funded by the Drinking Water and Groundwater Trust Fund, which initially allocated $400,000 in October 2024 under a 14-month agreement through December 2025. To date, over $62,000 has been awarded, according to Health and Human Services. The contract approved this week makes the remaining $337,553 of program funding available through September 2026. 
Remediation actions include replacing faucets and pipes, installing water filtration systems and stations, installing water treatment for corrosion control, and permanently removing drinking water outlets from service if necessary.
Iain Watt, director of the Division of Public Health, said on Wednesday that about half of the money will go to 10 facilities with active applications. According to Health and Human Services, another 150 facilities would qualify for funding if they applied. 
“This money was always intended as first come, first serve, and there’s no cap on an individual award,” he said. 
Watt added the agency anticipates working through all of the allocated money, and that “our intent is always to cover as many facilities as this money would allow for.” 
According to Watt, most of the awards have been for water filtration, faucet replacement, and other “fairly small-scale projects,” and the highest award was $23,000. To date, 21 facilities have had their remediation efforts funded. 
The program has been conducting “ongoing outreach” to raise its awareness of the program and will even work with individual providers to reduce application barriers. However, Watt said it is hard to test child care facilities because they are “kind of a moving target.” 
“Things start up and others shut down,” he said. “It’s a more transient universe [than schools] that we’re trying to capture.” 
By law, child care facilities and public schools are required to go through three rounds of lead testing compliance. Watt said that over 180 child care facilities had test levels at or above the allowed lead limit. 
Testing is free for licensed child care facilities that enroll in the “Get the Lead Out” program.

Abortion rights advocates are frustrated, but committed to fighting back.
Voters overwhelmingly chose to protect access to abortion in 2023.
Issue 1 passed 57-43%, enshrining reproductive rights into the state constitution.
It states Ohioans have the right to make their own decisions about abortion, contraception, fertility treatment, miscarriage care and continuing pregnancy.
The state is prohibited from interfering with or penalizing someone for exercising this right, as well as penalizing anyone else — including health care professionals — from assisting.
“We’re seeing bill after bill after bill trying to undo the will of the voters,” Abortion rights advocate Jaime Miracle said.
Despite the voters speaking, Miracle said this isn’t stopping Republican legislators from attempting to add barriers to access.
“We have the legislators, once again, proving why we went to the ballot, ignoring the will of the people, ignoring the pro-abortion majority in our state and trying to pass more abortion restrictions that the voters of Ohio do not want,” she said.
Republicans have introduced about a dozen bills that would impact reproductive rights.
State Sen. Kyle Koehler, R-Springfield, introduced S.B. 309, which could add steps to access the abortion pill mifepristone.
“[The bill] provides a framework for healthcare providers to educate a woman on the risks associated with a chemical abortion and makes her aware of her and her family’s rights to sue if the pill results in complications, injuries, a failed abortion, or her death,” Koehler said.
The legislation creates a speech for doctors to give patients about the dangers of Mifepristone, and requires the individual to sign an informed consent document.
It allows the patient, the father of the fetus, or grandparents if the patient is a minor, to sue if they feel the patient was uninformed when taking the pill.
In an interview on Wednesday, he said that he was focused on targeting online “mail-order” providers, not Ohio’s existing brick-and-mortar abortion clinics.
“We’re not trying to stop them, and we’re trying to stay within the Constitution,” Koehler said.
“Just [making] sure they know they have rights, and that there are unintended consequences that can and have reportedly happened to women who take mifepristone without ever seeing a doctor.
Miracle explains that the medication abortion is safe and highly regulated, which doctors are now having to defend at the Statehouse as another GOP bill tries to ban mail-order abortion pills.
“This is anti-abortion propaganda that is being forced upon providers and their patients,” Miracle said.
Another abortion-related bill that has passed the House is H.B. 485, which would require fifth graders and older to watch either “Meet Baby Olivia,” a GOP-supported fetal development animated video created by anti-abortion organization Live Action, or a very similar piece.
“Children are a gift, and we’re hoping that we can change the culture to be celebrating life instead of destroying life,” state Rep. Melanie Miller, R-Ashland, said.
The video teaches that life begins at conception and goes through each stage of growth. Miracle said that the video isn’t appropriate.
“It’s not scientifically accurate,” she said. “It is not even visually accurate.”
Kellie Copeland, who works with Miracle at Abortion Forward, explained further about the informational inconsistencies.
“It does not include the pregnant person; it includes idealized images of what fetal development looks like,” Copeland said.
“It doesn’t talk about complications, things that could go wrong. This is not about being medically accurate.”
The development cycle and graphics shown in the video conflict with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists’ research.
But Miller believes that it is accurate and can help provide insight into pregnancy since Ohio teaches abstinence-only sex ed.
“Visible, engaging tool to help them truly understand these early stages of life,” Miller said during debate on the floor before it passed.
Meanwhile, some activists are still pushing for a total abortion ban, but GOP leaders said that seems unlikely to go through.
However, when asked during the fall about abortion legislation, House Speaker Matt Huffman, R-Lima, addressed a bill that would reinstate the 24-hour waiting period for abortion services.
“Ohio did pass an extraordinarily expansive abortion rights in our Constitution,” he said, but noted that there are all types of regulations on constitutional rights.
“The 24-hour rule — is that prohibiting somebody from obtaining an abortion? Probably not,” Huffman said. “What if it was 12 hours? What if it was 1 hour? You know… at some point, absolutism can’t rule the day with whatever it says in the constitution.”
Still, all of these are bills that Miracle said continue to be unconstitutional.
“We will be fighting it every step of the way,” Miracle said.

Restrictions on solar and wind farms are proliferating around the country, with scores of local governments going as far as to forbid large-scale clean-energy developments.


Now, residents of an Ohio county are pushing back on one such ban on renewables — a move that could be a model for other places where clean energy faces severe restrictions.


Ohio has become a hot spot for anti-clean-energy rules. As of this fall, more than three dozen counties in the state have outlawed utility-scale solar in at least one of their townships.


In Richland County, the ban came this summer, when county commissioners voted to bar economically significant solar and wind projects in 11 of the county’s 18 townships. Almost immediately, residents formed a group called the Richland County Citizens for Property Rights and Job Development to try and reverse the stricture.


By September, they’d notched a crucial first victory, collecting enough signatures to put the issue on the ballot. Next May, when Ohioans head to the polls to vote in primary races, residents of Richland County will weigh in on a referendum that could ultimately reverse the ban. It’s the first time a county’s renewable-energy ban will be on the ballot in Ohio.


From the very beginning, ​“it was just a whirlwind,” said Christina O’Millian, a leader of the Richland County group. Like most others, she didn’t know a ban was under consideration until shortly before July 17, when the commission voted on it.


“We felt as constituents that we just hadn’t been heard,” O’Millian said. She views renewable energy as a way to attract more economic development to the county while reining in planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.


Brian McPeek, another of the group’s leaders and a manager for the local chapter of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, sees solar projects as huge job opportunities for the union’s members. ​“They provide a ton of work, a ton of man-hours.”


Many petition signers ​“didn’t want the commissioners to make that decision for them,” said Morgan Carroll, a county resident who helped gather signatures. ​“And there was a lot of respect for farmers having their own property rights” to decide whether to lease their land.


While the Ohio Power Siting Board retains general authority over where electricity generation is built, a 2021 state law known as Senate Bill 52 lets counties ban solar and wind farms in all or part of their territories. Meanwhile, Ohio law prevents local governments from blocking fossil-fuel or nuclear projects.


The Richland County community group is using a process under SB 52 to challenge the renewable-energy ban via referendum. Under that law, the organization had just 30 days from the commissioners’ vote to collect signatures in support of the ballot measure.


All told, more than 4,300 people signed the petition, though after the county Board of Elections rejected hundreds of signatures as invalid, the final count ended up at 3,380 — just 60 more than the required threshold of 8% of the number of votes in the last governor’s election.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE


 Deference to townships?

Although the Richland County ban came as a surprise to many, it was months in the making.


In late January, Sharon Township’s zoning committee asked the county to forbid large wind and solar projects there. After discussion at their Feb. 6 meeting, the county commissioners wrote to all 18 townships in Richland to see if their trustees also wanted a ban. A draft fill-in-the-blanks resolution accompanied the letter.


Signed resolutions came back from 11 townships. The commissioners then took up the issue again on July 17.


Roughly two dozen residents came to the July meeting, and a majority of those who spoke on the proposal were against it. Commissioners deferred to the township trustees.

“The township trustees who were in favor of the prohibition strongly believe that they were representing the wishes of their residents, who are farming communities, who are not fans of seeing potential farmland being taken up for large wind and solar,” Commissioner Tony Vero told Canary Media.


He pointed out that the ban doesn’t cover the seven remaining townships and all municipal areas. ​“I just thought it was a pretty good compromise,” he said.


The concerns over putting solar panels or wind turbines on potential farmland echo land-use arguments that have long dogged rural clean-energy developments — and which have been elevated into federal policy by the Trump administration this year. Groups linked to the fossil-fuel industry have pushed these arguments in Ohio and beyond.


“It’s a false narrative that they care about prime farmland,” said Bella Bogin, director of programs for Ohio Citizen Action, which helped the Richland County group collect signatures to petition for the referendum. Income from leasing some land for renewable energy can help farmers keep property in their families, and plenty of acreage currently goes to growing crops for fuel — not food. ​“We can’t eat ethanol corn,” she added.


Under Ohio’s SB 52, counties — not townships — have the authority to issue blanket prohibitions over large solar and wind farms, with limited exceptions for projects already in the grid manager’s queue.


In Richland County’s case, the commissioners decided to defer to townships even though they didn’t have to.


The choice shows how SB 52 has led to ​“an inconsistently applied, informal framework that has created confusion about the roles of counties, townships, and the Ohio Power Siting Board,” said Chris Tavenor, general counsel for the Ohio Environmental Council. Under the law, ​“county commissioners should be carefully considering all the factors at play,” rather than deferring to townships.


Even without a restriction in place, SB 52 lets counties nix new solar or wind farms on a case-by-case basis before they’re considered by the Ohio Power Siting Board. And when projects do go to the state regulator, counties and townships appoint two ad hoc decision-makers who vote on cases with the rest of the board.


As electricity prices continue to rise across Ohio, Tavenor hopes the state’s General Assembly will reconsider SB 52, which he and other advocates say is unfairly restrictive toward solar and wind — two of the cheapest and quickest energy sources to deploy.


“Lawmakers should be looking to repeal it and make a system that actually responds to the problems facing our electric grid right now,” he said.
Commissioner Vero, for his part, said he has mixed feelings about the referendum.


“It’s America, and if there’s enough signatures to get on the ballot, more power to people,” he said. However, he objects to the fact that SB 52 allows voters countywide to sign the petition, even if they don’t live in one of the townships with a ban, and said he hopes the legislature will amend the law to prevent that from happening elsewhere.


Yet referendum supporters say the ban matters for the entire county.


“It affects everybody, whether you live in a city, a township, or a village,” McPeek said. As he sees it, restrictions will deter investment from not only companies that build wind and solar but also those that want to be able to access renewable energy. ​“To me, it just is bad for the county — the whole county, not just one or two townships.”


Renewable-energy projects also provide substantial amounts of tax revenue or similar PILOT payments for counties, helping fund schools and other local needs. ​“I think it’s important for my children to have more clean electric [energy] and all the opportunities that go along with having wind and solar,” Carroll said.


Now that the referendum is on the ballot, the Richland County group will work to build more support and get out the vote next spring. ​“Education and outreach in the community is basically what we’re going to focus on for the campaign coming up in the next few months,” O’Millian said.


“So now it goes to a countywide vote, and the population of the county gets to make that decision, instead of three guys,” McPeek said.

Friday, Dec. 5, is the day we will find out. 
FIFA, the worldwide soccer cabal, is hosting the World Cup Draw in Washington, D.C. At the event, teams will be put into groups of four. Those groups will determine what nations play each other in the first round. 
It will also determine what nations come to Kansas City to compete, particularly in the initial games. 
We already know a few things about who won’t compete in these World Cup matches in Kansas City. The first four Kansas City games are part of the first round (or group stage, as FIFA calls it) of the tournament. The host nations — the United States, Canada and Mexico — have already been assigned to venues for the first round. Sorry, American Outlaws, Kansas City is not a venue for any of the three North American teams. 
For that reason, the host nations would only play at Arrowhead if they advanced to one of the matches that is part of the knock-out stage. (In other words, don’t hold your breath. Seeing the U.S. men’s national team in KC is very unlikely.)
If the host nations aren’t coming to Kansas City for any of the four first-round games, then who is? 
We won’t know that until later Friday. (If you read the fine print, we will likely need to wait one more day, until Saturday, to find out all of the pairings and locations.)
But that won’t prevent me from reckless speculation. How improbable are my predictions? There will be 48 teams in the tournament field, some who haven’t even been selected. Slotted into 12 groups, those dozens of teams will play at 16 venues. 
The odds of me getting the KC matches correct are the same as California Gov. Gavin Newsom winning a Republican primary in Goodland. 
Really, this is simply my dream list of match-ups that we might host in the heartland. In doing so, I hope to preview some of the best teams and storylines coming to the tournament in 2026. 
(I have also tried my best to obey the bonkers number of stipulations that FIFA creates in grouping teams, such as the number of neighboring countries that can be in the same group.) 
 
Dream game #1: Tuesday, June 16, 2026: Group J
I’ll get greedy right away: Argentina vs. Scotland. The defending champions feature Lionel Messi, a player so good that my son wore his jerseys to middle school virtually every day. A player so beloved that sports giant Adidas struggled to produce enough Messi jerseys when he signed to play at Inter Miami. 
If previous Argentina legend Diego Maradona played “like the ball was tied to his shoe,” Messi is said to play like “the ball is inside his shoe.” The best player ever, by my estimation, playing in Kansas City for a consecutive World Cup would be incredible.
Not delicious enough for you? I am matching them with Scotland, a team that qualified in one of the most entertaining games I have seen this year. Watch the highlights and marvel at the Scottish commentator losing his mind not just once but four times. 
Kansas City could not luck into two more entertainingly rabid fan bases. Could the bars, hotels and city handle it? I would love to find out. This game would electrify the city at any point in the tournament, but to have it played as the first game? Truly a dream.
 
Dream game #2: Saturday, June 20, 2026: Group E
Consider Spain vs. Japan. Spain, the world’s No. 1 ranked team, boasts superstar talent, especially Lamin Yamal, the nimble highlight reel who lines up as a right wing. Still only 18 when my fantasy game is played, Yamal might be the best player in the world. If not, he is among the most charismatic and promising. 
Why match Spain with Japan? First of all, the team from Japan features a playing style that would be interesting to see opposite Spain. The team works well in tight spaces with short passes and intricate footwork. Since they would have trouble matching Spain, I must have another reason. 
Here it is: I would love to host Japan in Kansas City. Their fans are known for their devotion to leaving stadiums and cities cleaner than they found them. In 2022 in Qatar, a story from the Associated Press noted that the Japanese soccer association supplied “8,000 trash bags to help fans pick up after matches with ‘thank you’ messages on the outside written in Arabic, Japanese, and English.”
Let’s be clear. I’m not asking the Japanese fans to come pick up after the Argentinians and Scots from my Fantasy Game #1. I just love the idea of hosting the most fantastic guest nation. 
 
Dream game #3: Thursday, June 25, 2026: Group F
This game is personal: England vs. Norway. 
If Kansans know a soccer league in the world, it’s the Premier League, the top soccer competition in England. The league is generally regarded as the best quality soccer, from top to bottom, especially this year, when “middle” teams in the league are anything but middling. 
U.S. fans watch Premier League games more than any other European league because of NBC’s broadcasts each weekend. Therefore, I know who Jørgen Strand Larsen is (a promising forward for Wolverhampton) and what nation he represents (Norway, if his name didn’t give it away). 
This fantasy game of mine would be a riot for all Premier League fans. Only the best domestic players in the league will earn a spot on the England roster: international superstars such as Bukayo Saka, Jude Bellingham and Harry Kane. 
Meanwhile, the best scorer in the Premier League would lead Norway into Arrowhead Stadium, the Norse goal-scoring goliath Erling Haaland. He has shattered Premier League records for his club team Manchester City. Many of his teammates feature for English teams as well, from Arsenal to Brentford. 
The familiarity of these players with one another would make the game unmistakably personal. Personally, it’s just a treat for me, a guy who checks on his fantasy team in the Premier League a bit too often. 
 
Dream game #4: Saturday, June 27: Group J
The fourth game dips into the same group as the first game: Group J. I’m rooting for two new teams in Kansas City for the sake of variety. 
However, that also means that I must select from lower-ranked teams, since I was so greedy at the start. (Greedy indeed! I selected three of the top four teams worldwide to play in KC.)
My fourth game might feel like a bit of a comedown: Paraguay vs. Cabo Verde. But hear me out. 
The exceptional team here is a nation you might have never heard of. The island nation of Cabo Verde, also known as Cape Verde, sits off the west coast of Africa with less than 500,000 people, meaning that Kansas City’s metro population is about four times as large. 
I promise that a “Kansas City National Team” would not qualify for the World Cup. 
The nation’s total land area? Roughly three Kansas counties. 
Readers, this is your underdog, if not by ranking. The squad is ranked No. 68 of 210 teams in FIFA’s current rankings. (That’s 18 slots above No. 86 New Zealand, which is the lowest-ranked team to qualify so far.)
Why pit them against Paraguay? Mostly because I had to find a relatively weak team from the South American federation to complete Group J. 
Two relatively unknown teams would also give Kansas City a gift for the final game: more reasonable ticket prices. As I have written before, FIFA is wringing every last dollar from ticket sales with dynamic pricing, so bargains will be rare. 
This match, however, would create the least demand on ticket prices, allowing Kansans a chance to enjoy the novelty of a lifetime: World Cup soccer in the heartland.

(Courtesy of the University of Nebraska)When the University of Nebraska-Lincoln’s Faculty Senate voted overwhelmingly in November on a resolution of no confidence in UNL Chancellor Rodney Bennett, it was not done lightly.
Grounded in evidence and in the governing policies of the university and NU Board of Regents alike, the vote called out serious concerns about the accuracy and fiduciary integrity of the financial claims being used to justify the proposed elimination of four academic departments.
Nebraskans and their elected regents are being sold a bill of goods. The numbers the administration is using do not hold up, and once the fuller financial picture is examined, the proposed eliminations produce no real savings. As the regents prepare to vote on Friday, the public deserves a fair accounting of the real cost of this elimination package.
Mythbusting: the financial illusion
The case of the Department of Educational Administration (EDAD) shows how the numbers fall apart under scrutiny. The chancellor claims the department’s elimination will save $1.69 million, but that figure counts only salaries, not the revenue its faculty generate, nor the costs that will persist.
EDAD estimates show $1.23 million a year in tuition from programs slated for elimination (including its Ph.D., Ed.D., and P–12 School Leadership master’s program), revenue that starts to vanish on Day One.
At the same time, the Higher Education master’s programs the chancellor plans to keep must still be staffed, at a reasonable estimate of $450,000 per year all told. Add those up, and the
alleged $1.69 million savings becomes a $27,000 net loss.
A similar picture holds up across targeted departments.
The true cost: sacrificing growth and prestige
The Chancellor’s proposed elimination of EDAD runs directly counter to NU President Jeffrey Gold’s aspiration to rejoin the Association of American Universities (AAU), an elite club of prestigious universities where research intensity is the core measure of membership. EDAD is already advancing that goal: its faculty productivity ranks in the 79th percentile nationally, ahead of seven current AAU universities.
At the same time, the department has designed new credential and online programs projected to generate $250,000–$450,000 annually— growth that vanishes the moment the unit is dissolved.
Even with conservative assumptions, the combined loss of revenue and the unavoidable instructional costs leave UNL with a net loss of roughly $275,000. Dismantling a healthy and nationally competitive program in Nebraska that trains scholars and leaders who are prepared to navigate a changing higher education landscape is the opposite of an “Odyssey to Extraordinary.”
Ceding a competitive niche to rivals
A major long-term consequence of these cuts is the loss of a competitive niche Nebraska had built in doctoral education. UNL’s Ph.D. program in Educational Administration, aside from being the only one in the state, was a pioneer: for decades virtually the only top-tier university offering a research-focused doctorate through hybrid and online delivery, providing access to professionals statewide and competing nationally for students.
Now that peer universities such as the University of Alabama, University of Kentucky, and University of Louisville are launching similar online Ph.D. programs, Nebraska is forfeiting its first-mover advantage and sending tuition revenue and talent to rival states. This forces Nebraska’s educators to pursue research-oriented doctorates elsewhere and leaves the state dependent on outside institutions to train its future education scholars.
Financial self-deception and strategic self-sabotage
The chancellor’s proposed slate of departmental eliminations is an exercise in financial self-deception and strategic self-sabotage. The faults in the data, analysis and procedures behind these cuts are now thoroughly documented, leaving the proposal without a credible foundation.
These kinds of failures carry serious consequences. As the Chronicle of Higher Education recently reported, Portland State University recently attempted a similar round of cuts while bypassing its shared-governance requirements. An independent arbitrator ruled that the administration had violated policy and ordered the university to reinstate the fired faculty and redo its entire budget-cutting process.
Nebraska is displaying the same warning signs: rushed decisions, procedural shortcuts, and error-laden analyses used to justify irreversible cuts. Advancing such a proposal invites external intervention and exposes the university to legal and financial liabilities that could readily outstrip any real savings.
The Board of Regents, charged with safeguarding fiscal integrity and public trust, must meet this moment with clear-eyed scrutiny. They should preserve the four departments, recognizing that the financial claims underlying the proposal have been discredited and that the plan as a whole would result in further costs and profound losses for Nebraska’s economy, workforce and academic standing.

Raelynn Franklin 
Raelynn Franklin is a marathon runner and certified yoga teacher.


Four years ago, I was drinking alone in my apartment, unable to imagine anything beyond survival. Today, I wake up before dawn to run toward a life I once thought was impossible. 
Recently I ran the New York City Marathon. It was my seventh marathon in the four years that I have been in recovery from alcoholism.
In traditional recovery programs there is a saying, “Fake it ‘til you make it.” I was great at faking it. But you can’t fake a 26.2-mile run.
Running is not a byproduct of my recovery; it is one of the main reasons I’ve stayed sober. 
Many people need clinical rehabilitation to stop drinking, but it wasn’t enough for me. Once my treatment ended, I was thrown back into the same lonely environment that caused me to drink in the first place. 
I needed something more, a community that provided support, accountability and goals.
In 2018 I was devoid of all three. That year my marriage ended abruptly, and I lost my job shortly after. Those back-to-back blows sent me into a spiral of addiction.
I would wake up, intending to apply for jobs, and make a drink that I told myself would help me get started. But it was never only one drink, and often I would end up passed out by the afternoon.  
I entered treatment in 2019, thinking I could learn to drink like a normal person — only socially, not when I was sad or angry. 
I didn’t yet understand that that’s not how addiction works. And while I may have learned new tools in treatment, I had no structure and no supportive community where I could practice them.
48 hours of sobriety
In 2020, a friend invited me to a hike with The Phoenix, a “sober active” nonprofit organization that provides connection-based activities and community to anyone sober for at least 48 hours. Activities might include yoga, weightlifting, rock climbing or coffee meet-ups. 
It was the first model that made sense to my goal-oriented brain. You become a member of a supportive team, put in the effort and see proof that you’re moving forward.
Still, I wasn’t ready to let go of drinking. 
I volunteered — rolling out yoga mats and helping set up events — while secretly scheduling my drinking around the group’s 48-hour sobriety rule. I’d stop drinking Sunday night to make it to a Tuesday class, drink afterward, and stop again for Thursday.
But, slowly, the model began to change me. I became intertwined with The Phoenix community. Char, who became my sponsor, relentlessly invited me to events and training sessions, and I became more involved. 
In early 2021, I resolved to truly get sober. A few months later, I committed to running the Long Beach Marathon. 
I wasn’t excited about it and thought it would be a one-time thing. But running took my recovery to another level. 
I had never liked running, but it gave me what I was missing: structure, purpose and accountability. It made me keep promises to myself. All my excuses were stripped away.
Nobody was making me get up at 5 a.m. or checking my miles. It was just me and the road. Each run built confidence I hadn’t felt in years. That discipline began to spill into the rest of my life. 
Since that first marathon, I’ve become a certified yoga instructor. I regularly lead classes through The Phoenix and help others find their footing in recovery. 
I’ll be featured in an upcoming documentary, SOBER, about how connection and physical activity can help people rebuild their lives. We filmed during my first year of sobriety, which I hope helps others taking their first steps into recovery. 
Now I live in a condo on the same stretch of beach where I used to train when I first started running. Most importantly, I’ve been able to help others in recovery. And I’ve found extraordinary friends who cheer me on in every aspect of my life.
I want the same success for the 5.6 million other Californians who struggle with a substance use disorder. The blueprint to aid them already exists — build and fund more communities where connection and self-belief replace despair. 
Individuals, nonprofits and community leaders can all play a role by supporting recovery programs that bring people together instead of isolating them. The solution can start with each of us: volunteer to lead a sober activity like yoga, invite sober friends to an open mic night or start a running club. 
Recovery begins when we create spaces that replace isolation with belonging, where people can rediscover the confidence to change their lives.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/112025-Raelynn-Still-SOBER-Film-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-05 08:57:20.342611

While policymakers assure work requirements will promote responsibility among able-bodied adults, one thing remains clear: many politicians do not know what disability actually looks like. 

Elizabeth Caldwell

At the free clinic where I used to volunteer, I met a patient who could barely stand due to severe diabetic neuropathy. He wasn’t “disabled enough” to receive benefits. Yet, he was too ill to fill any position requiring physical labor, accounting for most non-degree positions available. 
I know that reality too well. I have a physical disability, use a cane and wheelchair for mobility, and rely on a continuous glucose monitor for hypoglycemia management. With access to these interventions, I’ve been able to thrive while pursuing higher education. But I have seen others denied those opportunities. 
So I founded a Mobility Aid Program. My friends and I sold grilled cheeses late into the night in our college town to raise funds for essential medical equipment often deemed a “luxury.” Many university groups used these grilled cheese fundraisers for functions or travel.
We were the only group fundraising for someone’s right to healthcare.
That care made a difference. I saw improvement in the patient’s mobility and independence, ultimately allowing him to reenter the job market. However, under the BBB work requirements, many will lose Medicaid before ever getting the chance to heal, meaning I’ll have to sell a lot more grilled cheeses to fill the gap that our government has widened.
The BBB is advertised as a way to encourage self-sufficiency, with Republicans assuring that it will improve support for people with disabilities. In practice, it punishes people who fall through the cracks of how our government defines disability. The bill’s description of who counts as disabled or medically frail leaves room for subjectivity and access issues. These individuals are often capable of work under the right conditions, but the bureaucratic rigidity of disability classifications makes this lived experience invisible to policymakers. 
Work requirements frame health as an individual responsibility: if you can’t work, you must not be trying hard enough, overlooking many factors that shape health. Physical barriers and stigma prevent many people with disabilities from securing job placements. It also ignores that people with disabilities experience these social barriers at a higher rate, suffering more from the relentless cycle of poverty and social exclusion when compared to non-disabled peers. The BBB institutionalizes the belief that those who can’t work deserve less care, turning bias into law. 



We already know how this ends. When Arkansas imposed Medicaid work requirements in 2018, over 18,000 people lost coverage within four months without a significant increase in employment. Reports show that 64% Medicaid recipients already work at least part-time, often in low-wage jobs without benefits. For those unemployed, disability, caregiving, the job market, or school attendance were cited as barriers. The remaining group lost coverage due to bureaucratic hurdles or policy confusion. Despite claims that work requirements save money, they actually lead to higher rates of non-coverage, medical debt, and national healthcare costs.
Some supporters argue that work requirements ease system strain and shorten wait times. However, stripping people of care until they collapse does not reduce costs. It shifts people to emergency rooms, prisons, and morgues. The BBB would increase disparities for many with disabilities who fall outside the mold of what policymakers believe disability looks like. 
Instead of using work requirements as artificial disability allyship, policies should take an upstream approach to address factors preventing many Americans, disabled and non-disabled alike, from working. Health status, age, and educational level all predict employment. How can you work when your employer refuses accommodations? How can you secure a non-laboring job when you cannot afford the education required in the application? And if you believe the ADA would prevent this discrimination, I envy your naïveté. 
I also urge fellow disability advocates to consider: what if you are next? You may qualify for assistance today, but what if tomorrow the government decides that your disability is not “burdensome enough” for coverage? Then you’ll join the line at the free clinic, made longer by the BBB, where services rely on a student flipping grilled cheeses. 
The deeper issue is how the government defines “disabled enough.” It rarely captures reality, and the system demands proof of incapacity from people too sick to keep proving it. 
Health should never depend on a bureaucrat’s definition of “able to work.” The BBB doesn’t promote independence; it punishes vulnerability. It will deepen inequity by erasing agency, institutionalizing stigma, and redefining healthcare as something to be earned.
If I must, I’ll keep making grilled cheeses. But we deserve a country where a fundraiser doesn’t determine survival.

The update came a day after Pillen announced that just $44.5 million of the $405 million Nebraska was awarded through the federal Broadband Equity Access and Deployment (BEAD) program would be used to connect unserved Nebraskans.
Pillen said an additional $21 million in pledged private investments would support reaching the remaining 2% of Nebraska households and other properties still waiting to gain access to a broadband connection.
The Pillen administration plan has received initial approval for its approach, but approval of the actual spending requires an additional step of federal approval, a Pillen spokeswoman said Wednesday night.
“This is a tremendous victory for Nebraska,” Pillen said in a statement. “Reliable broadband is essential for daily life, from schoolwork and healthcare to running a business or managing a farm. With this approval, rural Nebraskans who have been left waiting will finally have access to the same online opportunities and services as everyone else.”
But some lawmakers and other Nebraskans viewed the governor’s announcement differently. In a social media post, Charles Herbster, a possible Republican challenger to Pillen’s gubernatorial re-election bid, criticized why only a small fraction of Nebraska’s initial BEAD allocation would be used, with no guarantees that the state would be allowed to hold onto the remaining funds.
“No amount of spin can hide the truth: Nebraska gave up,” Herbster said. “The Pillen administration failed our rural communities when given every opportunity to succeed. The only honest way forward is to admit it.”
Nebraska was awarded the $405 million under the Biden administration in 2023, money that prompted the creation of the Nebraska Broadband Office the same year. BEAD funding is the only revenue stream supporting the office, director Patrick Haggerty said.
The Nebraska Public Service Commission, the state’s catch-all elected regulator, had managed all broadband expansion efforts up to that point, using funds from the state’s Broadband Bridge Program and Universal Service Fund. The Legislature defunded the Broadband Bridge Program this year.
As the Broadband Office evaluated the first round of broadband project applications this summer, Haggerty said the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), now led by the Trump administration, announced significant changes to the BEAD program.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The changes, among other things, prioritized lower-cost plans and adjusted the eligibility requirements for existing unserved and underserved locations.
The changes cut the number of program-eligible locations in Nebraska still lacking broadband access in half, from about 29,600 to just over 14,000. Haggerty said the roughly 15,600 removed locations either already had internet connections through private investments or were covered by unlicensed fixed wireless access broadband.
While Haggerty argued unlicensed fixed wireless is a reliable form of internet connection, State Sen. Tom Brandt of Plymouth, who has led past broadband expansion efforts in the Legislature, disagreed. He compared the reliability to that of a cellphone hotspot.
Brandt also criticized the NTIA’s updated guidance for eliminating the program’s previous preference for fiber internet, which was described as the “gold standard” for internet connectivity at Thursday’s hearing. Brandt said Nebraska is limited to using just 10% of its current $44.5 million allocation for fiber.
In Nebraska, about 4,600 locations are proposed to be served by satellite internet, for about $1,000 per location or $4.7 million. By comparison, it would cost about $14,600 per location to service similar locations via fiber because of the cost of burying lines to remote locations. The cost for fixed wireless is about $2,200 per location.
Advocates say Nebraska missed golden opportunity to expand rural broadband

Because Nebraska had excess funds, it was able to propose awarding money for broadband at 54 so-called “community anchor institutions,” such as fire halls, hospitals and nursing homes. But advocates said the 54 were short of how many such institutions could have been served.
Haggerty, who previously worked in the fiber industry, vouched for the other forms of technology that can be used to establish broadband internet connections. Though most of the methods are newer than fiber, he said they are competitive both from a market and technological perspective.
Multiple committee members shared frustrations about the updated NTIA guidance and potential loss of federal funds, saying that they often hear complaints from their constituents about the lacking quality of their internet service.
Pillen’s statement said his administration is advocating for Nebraska to retain its unspent BEAD funds. Haggerty told the committee his office is “fighting like heck” to make that happen. A Pillen spokeswoman said the state hopes to hear around the end of the year whether it will be able to access those funds.
State Sen. Carolyn Bosn of Lincoln questioned what the remaining funds could be used for if Nebraska is able to keep it. Haggerty said his office kept alternate ideas broad in the state’s federal proposal but listed investment opportunities like precision agriculture and artificial intelligence.
Pillen vouched for similar measures in his statement.

(Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — The Omaha Inland Port Authority likely will get $2.3 million of the $11 million it expected from state coffers to boost its plans for housing and entrepreneurial programs, officials said Thursday.
The port authority, formed to spur and oversee economic development in a disenfranchised area of northeast Omaha, has been pressing state officials to release $11 million in state interest funds the port authority believed it was due under a previously passed state law.
Representatives of the port authority met Wednesday with new State Treasurer Joey Spellerberg. His predecessor, Tom Briese, had held up release of the funds, saying that a release at that time would not be “prudent” as the relevant law was vague.

Spellerberg, who just weeks ago assumed the treasurer post, said he had a positive and productive meeting with port authority officials. By then he had a better understanding of the issue and relayed that $2.3 million would be made available to the port authority once the group reapplied for the funds.
Neil Sullivan, state budget administrator, said that after the end of fiscal year 2025 reconciliation, the interest amounts in the applicable fund and available to the port authority was $2.3 million.
“It’s frustrating,” State Sen. Terrell McKinney of North Omaha, who also heads the nine-member mayoral-appointed port authority board, said in an interview after the group’s monthly meeting. 
At this point, he said, the port authority will reapply for the smaller amount but look into how it might still claim the larger amount of interest money the group believed it was due.
He said the housing and entrepreneurial efforts that the money is to be used for will move forward, perhaps in a modified way. 
The port authority oversees a separate $120 million investment from the state for a business park and an innovation district to be developed within the port authority boundaries.

Harris' House seat will soon be open, as he is moving up to the Senate, and Long may have competition for his seat next year. (Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)If you’re keeping score in legislative District 27, we hope you’re using a pencil and not a permanent marker.
The shakeup began when Democratic Sen. Michael Jackson left his seat to become superintendent of the Maryland State Police on Nov. 12, opening the Senate seat in the district that sprawls over Prince George’s, Charles and Calvert counties. A race between District 27A Del. Kevin Harris, District 27B Del. Jeffrie Long Jr. and District 27C resident Jason Fowler ended last week after the Democratic central committees for all three counties settled on Harris as their Senate nominee.
That means a new delegate for District 27A, representing Charles and Prince George’s counties, will need to selected. But Rachel Jones could stir things up even more.
Jones, who held the District 27B (Calvert and Prince George’s) before being unseated by Long in the 2022 primary election is looking f0r a rematch. Jones, who turns 41 on Dec. 18, will make a formal announcement Saturday, supported by Harris and by Del. Adrian Boafo (D-Prince George’s).
Former Del. Rachel Jones.
“I’m going to be 1,000% behind her. I’ve been in meetings with her in Calvert and Prince George’s and I’ve seen how she just delivers for her community,” Boafo said Thursday. “You need a representative who knows how to be a consensus builder in that district, and frankly that’s Rachel Jones.”
Jones, who currently works as government relations director for the Maryland Department of Agriculture, would give up that job if elected. She says her legislative priorities include protecting civil rights for all Marylanders, economic development and environment and agricultural policy.
Education is also a priority, with a personal connection: Her husband is a middle school teacher in Anne Arundel County.
“I have a passion for public service. I don’t take that lightly,” she said Thursday. “I don’t see no reason not to pursue what I know I’m good at and have a passion for just because someone else is in the seat.”
Before she arrived in Annapolis, Jones worked as a legislative aide to former state Sen. Nathaniel McFadden (D-Baltimore City), as a field representative and assistant to former U.S. Sen. Barbara Milkulski (D-Md.), and a field representative to former U.S. Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.).
While in Annapolis, Jones sponsored legislation in 2022 that would have required the Motor Vehicle Administration to include a notation on identification cards that a person had a disability. That initiative became law this year, named after Eric Carpenter-Grantham, that requires the MVA to add a butterfly logo above the words “hidden disability” on ID cards for those who request it.
Michael Bennett, a Coast Guard veteran and founder of Bennett Global Strategies, filed for the District 27B seat in September, but says that if Jones get in the race, “I will be withdrawing my candidacy application and throwing all my support and finances behind her. That’s how serious I am about Rachel.”
Vince Schiraldi is returning…
… to New York, where he will serve on one of the many transition committees set up by New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani.
Where did you think we meant?
Not Maryland, where Schiraldi spent several tumultuous years as secretary of Juvenile Services before resigning in June — or being encouraged to leave, according to the Moore administration at the time. Maryland Republicans, in particular, had long called for Schiraldi’s ouster, pointing to staff shortages, high rates of recidivism among youths released from the department’s care and high-profile shootings by juveniles who had been in the system, among other issues.

But Schiraldi, who was appointed to the job when Gov. Wes Moore was sworn in, said at the time of his departure that he was pleased with the department’s progress, noting gains in staffing and the success of a program aimed at gun-violence prevention, among others. When he left Maryland, Schiraldi said he planned to do some fishing and hiking while he figured out his next act.
Now comes word, first reported by the Baltimore Sun, that Schiraldi was one of more than 400 people appointed to 17 transition committees by Mamdani, the income democratic socialist mayor. Schiraldi was one of 20 people named to the Committee on the Criminal Legal System. He did not respond to a request for comment, but posted on his Linkedin profile that he was “honored” to be on the committee, where he will be “working alongside a stellar group of criminal justice leaders.”
Schiraldi is no stranger to New York. He previously worked as a senior criminal justice adviser to former New York Mayor Bill De Blasio (D) and was a leader of the New York City Department of Corrections, during which he tried to close the notorious Rikers Island jail complex and end solitary confinement. He also worked as a senior researcher at the Columbia School of Social Work in New York and, immediately before Maryland, was director of the Department of Youth Rehabilitation Services in Washington, D.C..
They are the Champions, my friend
The Chesapeake Conservancy last week announced its three newest Champions of the Chesapeake, the organization’s award to honor those “whose accomplishments have significantly advanced the protection and restoration of the Chesapeake Bay’s natural and cultural resources.”

The 2025 Champions include former National Park Service Director Robert G. “Bob” Stanton, who got the Lifetime Achievement Award; Maryland conservation advocate Ann Holmes Jones, honored as a Land Preservation Leader; and Lysle S. Sherwin, an advocate more than 50 years in wildlife conservation and watershed restoration, named a Watershed Stewardship Leader.
“From leading the National Park Service and ensuring the nation’s history is shared with future generations to protecting thousands of acres and restoring damaged waterways, these Champions prove how creative, committed and collaborative people can make a real difference for the Bay,” said Chesapeake Conservancy CEO Susan Shingledecker in a prepared statement. “Their decades of service inspire us and give hope for a healthier, more resilient Chesapeake in the years ahead.”
Stanton, the 15th director of the National Park Service and a former member of the Chesapeake Conservancy Board of Directors, has played a central role in national efforts to protect the Chesapeake Bay, in addition to decades of leadership in conservation, historic preservation and public service. The conservancy said he has also served with the National Parks Conservation Association, the Student Conservation Association and the Rosenwald Schools Park Campaign, among others.

Jones was recognized for more than four decades of leadership in land preservation and her advocacy for Maryland’s Program Open Space, monitoring and working with others to ensure full support for the program, which creates local and state parks, helps protect important habitat and preserve agricultural lands. A private consultant since 1987, Jones currently administers the Piney Run Rural Legacy Program in Baltimore County, a $48 million purchased easement program that has protected more than 8,700 acres, according to the conservancy release.
Sherwin, a retired Penn State University educator and former director of the Center for Watershed Stewardship, has led academic, nonprofit and federal initiatives to restore streams, protect wildlife habitat and improve water quality across the Chesapeake Bay watershed, the conservancy said. It said he works today as an affiliate biologist with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Partners Program, working with private landowners to enhance wildlife habitat and improve water quality in impaired streams.

Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) and Ron Halber, the CEO of the Jewish Community Relations Council of Greater Washington, have been trading barbs this week over their respective positions on Israel, a debate that has now spilled over into other organizations.
It began Wednesday, when Halber said Van Hollen has “dramatically lost his way” on Israel — a remark that led Van Hollen’s office to fire back that Halber has become “an apologist” for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Halber, speaking with reporters after the JCRC’s Lox and Legislators breakfast, defended two of the lawmakers who spoke at the event, Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.) and Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-8th), even though both had taken votes critical of Israel. But he then volunteered that Van Hollen has “become the leading senator agitating against Israel in the U.S. Senate.”
“It’s almost like he cannot wait for the next opportunity to jump down Israel’s throat,” said Halber, who said Van Hollen’s statements and social media postings are “filled with a lack of empathy for Israel’s strategic position.”
“I’m very upset about it, as are many people in this room,” Halber said. “Because that’s not the Sen. Van Hollen that so many people in this room worked hard to get elected. He’s really hurt himself with the Jewish community.”

Van Hollen’s office responded, in an exchange first reported Thursday by Jewish Insider, that the senator “holds our friends and our adversaries to the same standards. That’s why he continues to support the people of Israel, but the actions of the Netanyahu Government have increasingly not aligned with our values.” the spokesperson said in a statement.
The statement said Van Hollen has met with families of Hamas victims and “often speaks with Marylanders who hold varying perspectives here … Instead of representing the diversity of views that, in the Senator’s experience, are held by the Jewish community of Maryland, Ron Halber has become an apologist for the Netanyahu government.”
Halber said Thursday that he can handle criticism, but the Van Hollen comments were “a punch I didn’t see coming.”
“Nobody’s telling Chris he needs to be a cheerleader for Israel,” Halber said. “I just asked him to be a little bit more empathetic, more balanced.”
He rejected the suggestion that he’s not hearing a diversity of views from the community, noting that more than 100 institutions are affiliated with JCRC and they span the political spectrum.
Van Hollen’s office declined further comment Thursday, referring back to their Wednesday statement. But that didn’t stop others from weighing in.
The JCRC’s executive committee decried what it called “undignified, unwarranted and untrue” attacks on Halber, and linked to other statements of support like the Jewish Federation of Greater Washington. It said in a Facebook post that at a “time of extreme divisiveness in our society, our public officials should not be contributing to these divides through personal attacks.”
Hadar Susskind, president and CEO of the progressive New Jewish Narrative, defended Van Hollen in a series of social media posts that said the senator has always been there for his Jewish constituents and the people of Israel. But if he disagrees with Israeli policy, “he is 100% right to do so and to say so.”
For his part, Halber said he expects JCRC and Van Hollen’s office to continue to work together on issues of mutual interest, but, “We’ll agree to disagree, I suspect.”

(Maps data: Google, Airbus, CNES/Airbus, Landsat/Copernicus, Maxar Technologies)The massive Red Dog mine is grappling with a problem that’s spreading across the Arctic: thawing permafrost.
A glimpse of the mine’s challenges emerged in 2020, when its operator said efforts to address thaw-related impacts to wastewater management were costing some $19 million.
Five years later, permafrost is still thawing, and Red Dog’s problems appear to be getting more expensive. The mine’s operator, Teck Resources, now says permanent solutions could take a decade to develop and cost hundreds of millions of dollars, according to newly released permitting documents.
The problems stem from one of the more aesthetically jarring signs of climate change: Arctic streams are turning orange as thawing permafrost releases minerals once trapped in frozen ground.
The phenomenon, known as river rusting, is occurring across the Arctic, and scientists say it’s accelerated by global warming. It looks just like acid runoff from poorly managed mines — but it’s not caused by mining.
Nonetheless, it’s causing trouble for Red Dog. And it’s a potential preview of new obstacles to resource development more broadly in Alaska, as the Arctic warms three or four times faster than the rest of the planet.
Red Dog pumps treated wastewater into a nearby creek when levels of dissolved particles downstream are below specific limits set by state regulators. As permafrost thaw has accelerated in recent years, those levels have surged beyond the limits — even though levels in the mine’s discharge haven’t changed.
Regulators had temporarily adjusted Red Dog’s permit to allow the mine to keep discharging treated water while its operator studied long-term solutions.
But that temporary approval is set to expire soon. And Teck is now saying it could be forced to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on additional studies and upgrades over the next decade to return to compliance.
Such investments would come at a critical time for Red Dog.
The mine is set to run out of ore by 2032 if it doesn’t develop new deposits that it’s studying nearby. Teck, meanwhile, is in the middle of a pending merger deal with another major mining firm, Anglo American.
The permafrost-related challenges could pose an expensive complication for Red Dog: One idea Teck is considering is a wastewater pipeline that would run some 50 miles from the mine to the ocean. It could cost $279 million, according to Teck — more than half of the company’s gross profit from Red Dog last year.
The mine has invested “plenty of money and plenty of effort” to address the issue, said Tim Pilon, a regulator at the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation, which oversees Red Dog’s discharge permit.
“Their livelihood is at risk here,” he added.
Orange creeks “all over”
Scientists are still working to understand what, exactly, is making Arctic rivers turn orange. But a basic theory is that thawing permafrost releases water and other particles and minerals, which can create acid through chemical reactions. The acid, in turn, can leach metals, like iron, into streams.
In a paper published last year, researchers identified dozens of affected streams across Alaska’s Brooks Range.
Some of the creeks around Red Dog, at the western edge of the range, have long contained high naturally occurring levels of minerals, given their proximity to the mine’s zinc and lead deposit. But scientists started noticing stark changes six or seven years ago.
Some creeks “went from clear one year to very turbid and orange and kind of milky the following year,” said Chelsea Clawson, a biologist with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game who surveys streams near Red Dog each year.

“These changes are happening upstream of any particular mine influence as well as downstream — just kind of all over,” she added. “So it’s very clearly not being caused by the mine and the associated development.”
The rusting near Red Dog is just one example of how climate change is affecting infrastructure across the Arctic.
Thawing permafrost could cause as much as $51 billion in infrastructure damage in Alaska over the next four decades, scientists calculated in a paper published earlier this year in a Nature journal.
That figure is likely an underestimate, too: It excluded projected impacts to the oil and mining industries and from rusting rivers and streams, according to one of the paper’s authors, Anna Liljedahl.
“The assumption that things are going to function the way they have is not always a solid approach,” said Liljedahl, a Homer-based permafrost scientist who works with the Woodwell Climate Research Center.
The challenges at Red Dog show that permafrost thaw can affect infrastructure in unexpected or indirect ways, Liljedahl added.
Any impacts to Red Dog could be significant for the region: It’s one of the largest zinc mines in the world and an economic engine in Northwest Alaska, where high-paying work can be hard to find. The mine employs hundreds of people and accounts for more than 80% of the borough government’s revenue.
And it sits on land owned by the region’s Alaska Native corporation, NANA, which collects substantial royalty payments from Teck and shares a large portion of profits from Red Dog with Alaska Native corporations across the state.
A threatened waste pond
To prevent pollution, Red Dog collects water that comes into contact with the site and diverts it into a large pond, where other waste from processing ore, known as tailings, is also stored.
The mine then treats the water with lime and other compounds to get rid of potentially toxic metals and to balance acidity, and pipes the treated stuff into nearby Red Dog Creek.
A Clean Water Act permit regulates Red Dog’s discharge based in part on levels of dissolved particles in Red Dog Creek and a larger stream that it flows into, Ikalukrok Creek.
In 2019, thawing permafrost began boosting those levels beyond permit limits, hampering the mine’s ability to release water.

That caused a backup in the tailings pond, which was compounded by another symptom of climate change: increased precipitation
As global weather patterns shift, Red Dog has reported several years over the past decade with rain and snowfall above historic averages. Since heavy rain can cause the tailings pond to swell quickly, Teck has said relying on the reservoir to store excess water is an “increasingly risky strategy.”
Between 2017 and 2021, the volume of wastewater stored in the pond increased by some 60%, or 2 billion gallons, according to permitting documents.
In 2021, as the creeks’ rusting limited Red Dog’s discharge and the waste pond neared capacity, state regulators temporarily modified Teck’s permit. The move effectively allowed the company to continue discharging with a cap on the amount of dissolved particles in the treated mine water — even as natural levels in the creeks remained high.
That modification expires next year. Teck, in a request to regulators released by the state earlier this month, said it needs a 10-year extension to maintain “safe water management,” while it studies permanent solutions.
The capacity of Red Dog’s tailings pond “will be threatened again,” the company said, unless it can continue releasing water.
State regulators earlier this month proposed granting the extension. Doing so, they said in a recent notice, “prevents an increased discharge of any pollutants” and “ensures safe operation” of the tailings pond and the dam holding it back.
“The last thing anybody wants is for that dam to overtop,” said Pilon, with the Department of Environmental Conservation.
A “unique situation”
Teck is considering several possible responses to its wastewater predicament.
Among the priciest is the pipeline, which could carry treated wastewater to Red Dog’s mineral shipping port on the Chukchi Sea, more than 50 miles to the southwest.
Teck studied a similar concept more than a decade ago as part of a legal settlementwith several residents of the Iñupiaq village of Kivalina, downstream of the mine. Community leaders there have long worried about Red Dog’s wastewater affecting drinking water and fish.

Teck ultimately chose, in 2014, not to move forward with the pipeline, saying its benefits would be limited.
The company says it’s now revisiting the idea. But it’s also looking at other options to return to permit compliance, like proposing changes to permit regulations.
The company says it plan to study several possible upgrades at the mine, including expanded use of reverse osmosis, a filtration method that could reduce the amount of dissolved particles in the treated water that the mine pumps out.
If Teck gets renewed approval from the state and continues to discharge into Red Dog Creek, current data suggest it’s unlikely to significantly diminish the water quality downstream, since upstream levels are already high, according to Srijan Aggarwal, a professor and environmental engineer at University of Alaska Fairbanks.  The treated mine water has lower levels of metals than some of the rusting creeks, he noted.
Aggarwal said Teck’s request for an extension “seems reasonable” under the circumstances.
“It’s a very unique situation,” he added.
Some scientists say that Red Dog’s treated wastewater might even dilute the mineral-rich creek water and benefit fish, which biologists say are avoiding some of the rusting areas.
“The discharge — which is very clean water, without metals in it — is actually improving the water quality,” said Clawson, the state biologist.
Tribal leaders from Kivalina declined to comment on Teck’s request for an extension, saying they are still studying it.
Teck officials also declined an interview request. In an email, a corporate spokesperson, Dale Steeves, called Teck’s existing permit modification “minor” and said “there is no risk to human or aquatic health downstream of Red Dog” in relation to it.
“More work is needed to identify a permanent solution,” Steeves said.
The company’s “overall goal” still is to extend the mine’s life, he said.
Teck received a key federal approval late last year to build an access road to the new deposits that could keep Red Dog operating past 2032.
But the company is still studying whether they’d be profitable to dig up, and it says active mining there is several years away.

Miller, elected to the House in 2022 and reelected without opposition in 2024, prevailed in a vote Thursday among Senate precinct committee members. He defeated Tom Witt, a former executive director of Equality Kansas who retired from Statehouse lobbying in 2022, on a vote of 16-5.
Miller said he appreciated Ware as a political colleague and that he would have “big shoes to fill” while completing her unexpired term in the 25th District.
“Silas Miller is a forward-thinking leader who brings a wealth of life and legislative experience to the table,” said Senate Minority Leader Dinah Sykes, a Johnson County Democrat. “We’re grateful that he has decided to step into the Senate chamber in this new capacity.”
Miller serves on the House education, election and insurance committees. He’s been the ranking Democrat on the House Federal and State Affairs Committee. In 2024, Miller proposed an unsuccessful amendment to a bill that would have removed cannabis from a list of illegal drugs in Kansas.
Ware, a retail store owner, announced her decision to resign Nov. 13. In 2018, she replaced Sen. Lynn Rogers in a precinct committee election. Rogers had stepped down after elected lieutenant governor on a ticket with Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly.
Ware was elected to a full term in the Senate during 2020 and reelected 2024. Last November, she carried the district with 57% of the vote against Republican Keenen Smith. She served on tax, commerce and agriculture committees in the Senate.
“While my time in the Senate is at an end, I will remain an involved private citizen and an advocate for the people of Wichita in this next era of my life,” Ware said.
Kristi Kirk, chair of the Sedgwick County Democratic Party, said Ware was known for her involvement with the community and as a unifying force in the Democratic Party.
“Mary could always be counted on to support not only her constituents, but was a champion for creating a full and safe future for Kansas children since joining the Senate,” Kirk said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/P2130946-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-04 21:57:06.263480

Bob Ferguson has approved a 1,300-acre solar farm in south-central Washington, calling the project a “win for our state.”
The Carriger Solar project in Klickitat County is expected to generate enough power for thousands of homes. Ferguson informed the Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council on Tuesday that he was giving it the go-ahead. This is the first large-scale energy project Ferguson has acted on since taking office.
“Building more clean energy will provide affordable, carbon-free electricity to Washingtonians, create much needed construction jobs, boost economic development and keep our air clean,” Ferguson, a first-term Democrat, said in a statement.
Ferguson’s decision isn’t a surprise. When he turned down the council’s initial recommendation to proceed with the Carriger project in August, he made clear that he viewed the undertaking as “consistent with state policies.” 
And he stressed the importance of moving swiftly so developers could secure federal clean energy tax credits before they are ended by the Trump administration. Solar and wind projects must begin construction by July 4, 2026 to fully qualify for the credits.
But Ferguson told the council to talk further with Yakama Nation leaders about their concerns that protections for cultural resources were not strict enough. 
What emerged was the revised site certification agreement inked by Ferguson. It requires the developers provide $100,000 in one-time grant funding to the Yakama Nation Cultural Resources Program once the project is operational. Tribal access to traditional and cultural properties must be maintained during construction.
Even with the grant funding, the tribe remained opposed to the project, state officials said.
Ferguson, in his Dec. 2 letter to the Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council, said the final agreement “balances the need for affordable clean energy with mitigation requirements that protect Washington’s environment.”
He also reiterated the urgency of acting to take advantage of the federal credits.
“Our state already faces real challenges in building renewable electricity, and we now contend  with a federal government that is hostile to renewable electricity development,” he wrote. “All of these elements factored into my decision.”

Cypress Creek Renewables, based in Santa Monica, California, plans to build the solar farm north of State Route 142 along Knight Road, about two miles west of Goldendale in unincorporated Klickitat County. The firm applied for state approval for the project in February 2023.
The company is “grateful” for Ferguson’s support, a spokesperson said Thursday.
“We are proud to play a role in advancing the state’s clean energy goals,” Angeli Chandler, Cypress Creek’s director of communications, said in an email.
“We are moving with urgency to ensure we retain federal tax treatment, which is critical to keeping this project on track,” she said. The project is expected to begin delivering power in the summer of 2028, she said.
When completed, Carriger Solar will have 160 megawatts of solar generating potential, enough to power up to 32,500 homes, according to the company’s website. The project, which also includes a 63 megawatt battery energy storage system, will tie into the Bonneville Power Administration transmission system.

Jim Himes said, “what I saw in that room was one of the most troubling things I've seen in my time in public service.”","A Navy admiral commanding the U.S. military strikes on an alleged drug boat in the Caribbean told lawmakers Thursday that there was no “kill them all” order from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, but a stark video of the attack left grave questions as Congress scrutinizes the campaign that killed two survivors.
Adm. Frank “Mitch” Bradley appeared for a series of closed-door classified briefings at the Capitol as lawmakers conduct an investigation after a report that he ordered the follow-on attack that killed the survivors to comply with Hegesth’s demands. Legal experts have said such a strike could be a violation of the laws of military warfare.
“Bradley was very clear that he was given no such order, to give no quarter or to kill them all,” said Sen. Tom Cotton, who heads the Senate Intelligence Committee, as he exited a classified briefing.
While Cotton, R-Ark., defended the attack, Democrats who were also briefed and saw video of the survivors being killed questioned the Trump administration’s rationale and said the incident was deeply concerning.
“The order was basically: Destroy the drugs, kill the 11 people on the boat,” said Washington Rep. Adam Smith, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee.
Smith, who is demanding further investigation, said the survivors were “basically two shirtless people clinging to the bow of a capsized and inoperable boat, drifting in the water — until the missiles come and kill them.”
The classified sessions with Bradley, alongside the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine, provided fresh information at a crucial moment as Hegseth’s leadership comes under scrutiny. But they did little to resolve growing questions about the legal basis for President Donald Trump’s extraordinary campaign to use war powers against suspected drug smugglers. So far more than 80 people have been killed in some 20 strikes.
Late Thursday, U.S. Southern Command announced it had conducted another strike against a small boat in the eastern Pacific Ocean following a pause of almost three weeks. There were four casualties, according to the social media post.
Lawmakers have not yet specifically authorized the use of military force against the alleged drug boats, and the Republican-controlled Congress has turned back attempts to put a check on Trump’s power to engage in the missile campaign, which Hegseth has vowed will continue. Several Democrats have called for Hegseth to resign.
Congressional investigation gets underway
Lawmakers want a full accounting of the Sept. 2 strike, which was the first in what has become a monthslong series of U.S. military attacks on vessels near Venezuela believed to be ferrying drugs. The Washington Post had reported that Bradley ordered the follow-on attack on the survivors.
But lawmakers who lead the House and Senate’s national security committees in Congress came away with different descriptions of what the two survivors were doing when they were killed.
Cotton said he saw them “trying to flip a boat loaded with drugs bound for United States back over so they could stay in the fight.”
He said there were “several minutes” between the first and second attacks, which consisted of four missile strikes. He said it was “gratifying” that the U.S. military was taking “the battle” to cartels.
But Connecticut Rep. Jim Himes, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said, “what I saw in that room was one of the most troubling things I’ve seen in my time in public service.”
“You have two individuals in clear distress, without any means of locomotion, with a destroyed vessel,” he said, and who “were killed by the United States.”
The survivors did not issue any distress call or other communications, though lawmakers were told it appeared the people had a hand raised, “waving” at one point during the attacks, Smith said.
Smith acknowledged there was likely cocaine on the boat, but he objects to the Republican administration’s rationale for continued attacks on alleged drug runners who may or may not be heading to the United States. “That’s really the core of the problem with all of this,” he said. “That incredibly broad definition, I think, is what sets in motion all of these problems about using lethal force and using the military.”
Who is Adm. Bradley?
At the time of the attack, Bradley was the commander of Joint Special Operations Command, overseeing coordinated operations between the military’s elite special operations units out of Fort Bragg in North Carolina. About a month after the strike, he was promoted to commander of U.S. Special Operations Command.
His military career, spanning more than three decades, was mostly spent serving in the elite Navy SEALs and commanding joint operations. He was among the first special forces officers to deploy to Afghanistan after the Sept. 11 attacks. His latest promotion to admiral was approved by unanimous voice vote in the Senate this year, and Democratic and Republican senators praised his record.
Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., has described Bradley as among those who are “rock solid” and “the most extraordinary people that have ever served in the military.”
But lawmakers like Tillis have also made it clear they expect a reckoning if it is found that survivors were targeted. “Anybody in the chain of command that was responsible for it, that had vision of it, needs to be held accountable,” he said.
What else are lawmakers seeking?
Underpinning Trump’s campaign against suspected traffickers is his argument that drug cartels amount to armed combatants because their cargo poses a threat to American lives.
Democrats are demanding the release of the full video of the Sept. 2 attack, as well as written records of the orders and any directives about the mission from Hegseth. None of the written orders or audio of verbal commands was shared with the lawmakers.
A White House Office of Legal Counsel memo providing a rationale for the strikes was dated after the fact, on Sept. 5. That memo remains undisclosed, and Democrats want it released.
Obtaining further information, though, will largely depend on action from Republican lawmakers, who have majority control of the committees, a potentially painful prospect for them if it puts them at odds with the president.
Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, said that he and the Senate Armed Services Committee chair, GOP Sen. Roger Wicker, have formally requested the executive orders authorizing the operations and the complete videos from the strikes, among other items. The Trump administration has repeatedly denied their requests for basic information about the operation, Reed said.
Republican lawmakers who are close to Trump have largely stood by Hegseth and the administration’s decision to conduct the strikes.
Elsewhere, Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and others see the U.S. military operation as part of an effort to prompt a government change in the South American country. Maduro on Wednesday acknowledged speaking last month by phone with Trump, who confirmed the call days earlier.

(Photo by Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)RAPID CITY — No other place in the world incarcerates women at a higher rate than South Dakota, according to research by a prison-focused nonprofit, and the construction of a second women’s prison in the state could be viewed as a continuation of that trend.
The new leader of the state’s prison system said Thursday it’s the start of a turnaround.
“It’s not going to show overnight,” said Nick Lamb, “but it will show in a few years. You’ll see a substantial decrease.”

 The location of a women’s prison under construction in Rapid City.

The staff and space devoted to programming in the Rapid City women’s prison will help inmates turn their lives around, Lamb said. A task force on rehabilitation appointed by the governor is also developing ideas to help people stay out of trouble after their release.
Lamb began working as secretary of the Department of Corrections last month after his appointment by Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden. Lamb succeeded Kellie Wasko, who resigned after three and a half years in the job.
During a press conference at the construction site of the new women’s prison in northeast Rapid City, South Dakota Searchlight asked Lamb and Rhoden about a September report by the Prison Policy Initiative. It said South Dakota incarcerates 338 of every 100,000 women in the state, which is the highest rate in the nation and would be the highest in the world if South Dakota was a country.
Lamb’s prediction that the rate will come down was the only response to the question. Neither he nor Rhoden disputed the report’s findings.
In prepared remarks, Rhoden said 51% of imprisoned women in South Dakota have drug convictions, and more than 90% have substance use disorders. He was referring to incarcerated women in Pierre, where the state has a women’s prison that will continue to operate and a minimum-security facility that will close after the Rapid City prison opens. The state also contracts for extra space in the Hughes County Jail. The combined female inmate population among those three locations was 543 as of Thursday.
South Dakota locks up women at a higher rate than any other state, report says

The Rapid City prison, designed for minimum and medium-security inmates, will house up to 300 women.
“This is an area we have to do better,” Rhoden said, “and this facility will allow us to.”
The state is paying $87 million to construct the Rapid City prison, which is scheduled to open in July. Rhoden is asking lawmakers to budget $13 million for its first year of operations, plus $2.4 million in one-time funding for staff training.
The facility will need 139 employees, including 96 for security, 23 for health care and 20 for education, programming and administration.
One of the buildings on the campus will have space for services including a kitchen and laundry, and programming including behavioral health services, classes and spiritual activities. There are three housing units, plus a unit containing 12 beds for mothers with babies. Another building will house administrators and a visitation area.

But the truth is that both liberals and conservatives are failing our children. The village has eroded—and parents are being left to figure it out alone.,"AN OLD AFRICAN proverb says: “It takes a village to raise a child.” Yet America’s public education system is drifting away from shared responsibility. Federal policies and state reforms are shifting us from collective accountability to individual survival. Oversight of special education is weakening, graduation requirements are loosening, and student performance has fallen to historic lows.  
It’s tempting to blame one side of partisan politics. But the truth is that both liberals and conservatives are failing our children. The village has eroded—and parents are being left to figure it out alone.  
For decades, the federal government protected students with disabilities through the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). The Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services once served as a vital safeguard, ensuring every child had access to a free and appropriate public education. Now, staff cuts and potential transfers of oversight threaten that protection.  
To most, this might seem like just another headline from the Trump administration. But for families, it means those with resources will hire tutors or lawyers, while those without will lose out. At the same time, states are lowering expectations at the other end of the academic spectrum.  
In 2024, Massachusetts joined others in eliminating the requirement that students pass a standardized test to graduate. For over two decades, the MCAS served as a baseline for college or workforce readiness. Supporters say its removal promotes equity and reduces test anxiety; critics argue it devalues the diploma. Both reveal the same truth: The meaning of academic mastery is shifting.  
Parents can no longer assume that graduation equals readiness. The data confirm the crisis. The National Assessment of Educational Progress—the nation’s report card—shows only about one-third of fourth graders read at or above grade level. Math scores have dropped to their lowest levels in decades, particularly among middle and high school students.  
Behind those numbers are real children—students who will apply to college, seek employment, and navigate a world where literacy and numeracy determine opportunity. When young people cannot read fluently or think mathematically, their futures narrow before they begin.  
To be fair, Massachusetts is trying to respond. The House of Representatives recently passed a bill requiring evidence-based literacy instruction, and the K–12 Statewide Graduation Council, on which I serve as a member, has developed recommendations for new graduation standards to replace MCAS.  
Yet the uncomfortable reality remains: Parents cannot wait for systems to stabilize. The landscape has shifted, and families must act now to keep children on track.  
Start by engaging directly with your child’s education. Request concrete data on reading and math progress—fluency rates, writing samples, and problem-solving skills—not just report cards. If your child has an IEP or 504 plan, ensure services are delivered on time and are effective. Document everything.  
With federal oversight shrinking, parental vigilance becomes the new enforcement mechanism. In short, parents must rebuild the village from the ground up.  
If federal and state agencies retreat, local families and communities must fill the void. Trusting systems without demanding accountability has never worked—and the data prove it. When states loosen standards or districts cut back on progress monitoring, parents must ask:  
• How are schools ensuring literacy and math proficiency?  • What evidence-based curricula are being used?• How is progress being measured and reported?  
The stakes could not be higher. As government guardrails weaken, families must step in as stabilizers. Parents are not powerless. Our voices, questions, and insistence on excellence are the new infrastructure of accountability. When institutions falter, families must anchor. As oversight fades, advocacy must rise. 
In the end, children should not be simply socially promoted through school. They need skills, knowledge, and hope. Amid shifting systems, the parental voice remains their strongest protection.

Burt Jones’ $10 million loan to his gubernatorial campaign didn’t violate the law, the Georgia State Ethics Commission ruled on Thursday, effectively putting an end to a legal fight from rival Republican gubernatorial candidate Attorney General Chris Carr
Jones made the loan through a financial structure called a leadership committee, which was created by a 2021 state law. 
As lieutenant governor, Jones is one of a handful of legislative leaders who can form such a committee, which is allowed to collect unlimited contributions and raise cash during the annual legislative session, unlike the regulated limits of a standard campaign committee. Carr, as attorney general, does not have access to this powerful fundraising tool.
The commission’s position was that a personal loan from a candidate to a leadership committee is permitted because when the loan is repaid by the leadership committee, the candidate is simply receiving their own personal funds back, meaning no excessive or illegal contribution has occurred. The commission also stated that this analysis does not change if funds are loaned to the candidate committee during a primary election.
“The money in this scenario is, and always has been, the candidate’s personal funds, so there’s no liability for a candidate to loan the money,” said Steve Knittle, the commission’s deputy director and general counsel.

Carr and Jones, along with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, are set to face off in the May primaries for the Republican nomination.
This advisory opinion follows an earlier, separate ruling in which the Ethics Commission declined to investigate a complaint filed by Carr’s team regarding the source of a $10 million loan Jones made to his campaign in 2022, according to a July report from the Associated Press.
Carr’s campaign had questioned how Jones, whose 2022 financial disclosure showed a net worth of $12.4 million but only $700,000 in cash and securities, could instantly produce $10 million in cash. The complaint suggested Jones may have falsely reported his finances or the source of the cash.
Carr also filed a complaint in federal court, but U.S. District Court Judge Victoria Marie Calvert dismissed the case in August due to lack of standing, according to a Capitol Beat report.
Julia Mazzone, a spokesperson for Carr’s campaign, said the advisory opinion “raises more questions than it answers.”
“It’s troubling that the commission shows no interest in understanding how Burt Jones went from claiming a net worth of $700,000 to loaning himself $10 million. As governor, Chris Carr will bring true reform to address public corruption,” Mazzone said in a statement.
The Jones’ campaign did not address the commission’s opinion, instead taking a jab at the Carr campaign with a previously given statement.

(Photo: Wes Muller/LA Illuminator)Louisiana leaders have recently touted a string of major industrial projects with the promise of creating thousands of jobs, but critics say these business negotiations lack transparency and pose great risk to the health and prosperity of the communities where this investment is taking shape. 
They also believe state officials have shut them out of trade deals with businesses that stand to benefit far more than them.      
The critics included residents and community activists from across Louisiana who spoke out Wednesday at a state agency hearing, where they asked officials to stop secretly brokering trade deals that give taxpayer money to large industrial companies. 
Numbering around a dozen, the group aired their concerns at a Louisiana Economic Development rules hearing, which are normally sparsely-attended and mundane bureaucratic processes with just two staff members there to record public comments.  
Louisiana Economic Development had published a notice on Oct. 20 stating that it planned to “hold a public hearing for the purpose of receiving comments on any rule of the agency.” The notice contained no further details about the reason for the hearing and didn’t specify which rules the agency is reviewing. Staff members did not discuss any particular rules at the hearing.
The residents and activists — which included members of community and environmental groups such as the Louisiana Bucket Brigade, Rural Roots Louisiana, the Descendants Project, Inclusive Louisiana and Fishermen Involved in Sustaining Our Heritage — used the hearing as an opportunity to air a variety of complaints about the impacts industrial expansion has had on their neighborhoods. They all signed a letter that summarized their complaints and then took turns speaking at the hearing. 
In their letter submitted to Louisiana Economic Development, the group criticized the hearing notice as “vague” and wrote that it provided “no meaningful notice of what the agency is considering.”
They wrote and testified that the notice appeared to be part of a pattern of secrecy at the agency to fast-track industrial expansion in the state. They pointed to Gov. Jeff Landry’s Sept. 16 executive order, which he dubbed the “Louisiana Lightning Speed Initiative.” It directs Louisiana to push state agencies to fast-track permitting and regulatory processes to attract new businesses and spur industrial expansion, mentioning recent deals with Meta, Hyundai, Woodside Energy and CF Industries as examples.
In December 2024, the state announced that Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, was coming to Louisiana to build the world’s largest data center in Richland Parish. Construction of the facility began almost immediately.
Richland Parish residents Joe and Robin Williams also signed the letter submitted to LED. They live across the street from the Meta site and have reported rust-colored tap water and power outages at their home since construction activity began. 
While the rapidly approved Meta project came as a surprise to Williams and the public, a small circle of Louisiana politicians had known about it and kept it under wraps for nearly a year. Several top leaders — including the governor, House Speaker Phillip DeVillier, LED Secretary Susan Bourgeois and Revenue Secretary Richard Nelson — quietly collaborated with corporate executives and local officials on the project, holding closed-door talks and rewriting state laws for reasons they withheld from the public and most of the Louisiana Legislature. 
During the 2024 legislative session, Landry and DeVillier carried out plans to “hijack” another lawmaker’s bill, rewriting it in a way that would give a massive tax break to Meta without other legislators realizing it, as detailed in a Times-Picayune report. Bourgeois told the newspaper everyone involved in the negotiations signed “blank NDAs” (nondisclosure agreements) before the talks began. 
Louisiana Economic Development officials often sign nondisclosure agreements with local government leaders and corporate executives to keep negotiations secret. In a phone interview Thursday, Bourgeois said it’s a common practice at the agency whenever a company requests it. 
“It’s really just an industry standard,” Bourgeois said. “I understand there’s some people who don’t agree with it or like it, but go to any state and this is how it’s done.”
Companies often ask for the agreements so competitors don’t undercut or foil their plans, she said. For example, if a company knows about its rival’s plans to build at a certain location, they could rush to purchase the land out from under them, Bourgeois explained.
The Rev. Harry Joseph Sr., an Ascension Parish resident and church pastor, took part in Wednesday’s LED hearing. Speaking with the Illuminator before the meeting, he questioned the agency’s use of nondisclosure agreements and said his local elected officials routinely cite them as a reason they can’t answer questions about projects in his area.
“We elected them. We should be able to talk to them about anything,” Joseph said. “The secrecy has gotten out of hand. Enough is enough.”
Another example of secret negotiations, Joseph said, is the industrial RiverPlex MegaPark being built in the Modeste community of Ascension Parish. The area targeted for development had previously been zoned as a “conservation district” because it is “environmentally fragile” and lacked roads that can handle large traffic increases, according to the parish zoning code. Despite this, the state offered the MegaPark as a site for Hyundai’s new steel mill and two ammonia facilities.
Louisiana Economic Development signed nondisclosure agreements with Hyundai executives and Ascension Parish officials, preventing them from speaking about the projects, according to William Most, an attorney representing Rural Roots and the Louisiana Bucket Brigade. 
In an email, LED spokesperson Emma Wagner pushed back against the other criticisms lodged at Wednesday’s hearing, calling them part of an “ambush not based in the actual work of economic development” and job creation in Louisiana.
“This state has long suffered from a failure to diversify our economy,” Wagner wrote. “What we have done over the past 23 months is unprecedented and transformational economic growth that has finally turned the tide of losing our people.”  
State and local leaders have touted industrial expansion as a way to bring new jobs to economically depressed areas. In exchange for the jobs, the state and the parishes typically offer the companies lucrative tax breaks and grants.
Joy Banner, co-founder of the Descendants Project, called on the state to require objective data on job creation and wage claims before incentivizing companies with Louisiana tax dollars. 
Hyundai has said its steel mill will bring an estimated 1,300 jobs to Louisiana. In exchange, the state promised the company a $100 million grant and other incentives estimated to cost taxpayers $600 million, according to a Times-Picayune report. 
CF Industries estimates it will bring 103 new jobs to its proposed ammonia facility in Ascension Parish. In exchange, the state offered the company a $6 million grant for the proposed ammonia plant in Ascension Parish. The company is also expected to be exempt from paying most parish property taxes through the Industrial Tax Exemption Program and receive a payroll tax rebate from the state via the Quality Jobs program. 
In his Sept. 16 executive order, the governor pointed to low jobs numbers as the reason for his fast-tracking initiative while deflecting blame for Louisiana’s sluggish economy. He claimed the state lost 12,000 jobs from 2016-23. Although the figure is technically accurate, by framing the data between those years without context, Landry’s executive order implied his predecessor, Gov. John Bel Edwards, was responsible for the job losses. 
Louisiana actually gained about 7,000 jobs during Edwards’ first term and, like other states, suffered a sudden employment drop in March 2020 as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The state’s employment numbers rebounded during Edwards’ second term, though the job market didn’t fully recover to its pre-pandemic mark until this January.
Federal data shows Louisiana’s employment numbers under Landry have so far hovered around and slightly above peak figures during Edwards’ tenure at around 2 million jobs. The state has slowly but steadily added jobs from January 2024, when Landry took office, through at least August 2025. The jobs market has become murkier in recent months because the Bureau of Labor Statistics did not collect monthly employment data during the six week government shutdown that began Oct. 1. 
“I’m tired of hearing ‘jobs, jobs, jobs,’” Joseph told LED officials at Wednesday’s hearing. “We don’t get these jobs. They’re not for us.” 
Modeste resident Twila Collins, who works with Rural Roots, told the agency the jobs claims often don’t benefit long-time local residents. Instead, she said, they see the ill effects of heavy pollution that often comes with industrial facilities. 
Ascension Parish lies in an industrial corridor along the Mississippi River referred to as “Cancer Alley” for its high concentration of industrial pollution containing carcinogens. Scientific studies have linked cancer rates in its communities to the toxic pollution, though the state Department of Environmental Quality rejects such findings.
“I had to watch my child die in the same area,” Collins said at the hearing. In a later interview, she explained that her 9-year-old son, Denzel, died of an asthma attack more than two decades ago.  
Gramercy resident Gail LeBoeuf, who was diagnosed with liver cancer in 2022 and founded the activist group Inclusive Louisiana, told agency staff industrial expansion isn’t worth the risk it poses to the people. 
“Economic development has not happened for us,” LeBoeuf said. “These deals don’t do anything but give money back to the people that promised to bring economic development.” 
Anne Rolfes, executive director of the Louisiana Bucket Brigade, said the Louisiana Economic Development agency is “pretending” that Hyundai and CF Industries are the solutions to poverty. 
“This is destruction masquerading as economic development,” Rolfes said.
Wagner, the spokesperson for Louisiana Economic Development, said the Landry administration will “never apologize” for attracting jobs, wages and new opportunities to the state.
“The Governor and Secretary both firmly believe the absolute best way to lift people out of poverty is by giving them access to ever-growing wages,” Wagner said via email. “Anyone who would reject those opportunities clearly does not have the best interest of Louisiana citizens at heart.”

The substance of a revision ordered by the Trump administration remains under wraps, though changes will be confined to “special management areas.” It’s widely expected that the updated plans will deemphasize conservation.
The post BLM’s heated Rock Springs plan took 12 years to finish. Now the feds must redo it in one. appeared first on WyoFile .","ROCK SPRINGS—Two years ago, employees of the Bureau of Land Management’s Wyoming office encountered misinformation-fueled hysteria during public meetings about a conservation-heavy draft plan for managing a 3.6 million acre swath of southwest Wyoming.
Then, just nine months after the BLM’s especially controversial plan was finalized, the Trump administration ordered the agency to redo the process. On Wednesday, the BLM’s staff reconvened with the public in Sweetwater County’s largest city to hear what locals make of the revision. This time, however, tempers were noticeably cool. There was no likening federal land management planning to the tragedies of historical American wars — comparisons argued publicly in 2023. 
Instead, BLM-Wyoming Acting State Director Kris Kirby and her staff encountered a much more typical reception. There was some displeasure voiced, but mostly decorum in a room filled with a few dozen inquisitive locals, elected officials and advocacy representatives who wanted to know what was going on. And at this point in the process — an early stage known as “scoping” — there wasn’t a whole lot to report. 
“The intention here is not to have a proposal,” Kirby said from the Sweetwater Events Complex. “The intention here is to ask the public what we should be analyzing.”

The BLM has some parameters for changes to the resource management plan for the Rock Springs Field Office. Poster boards illustrated the various special management areas in the field office. There was one showing a dozen “areas of critical environmental concern” and another outlining a handful of special recreation management areas. Changes will be confined to these designations. 
“Areas with special protections and special designations, that’s what we’re analyzing,” Kirby said. “Really nothing in the checkerboard, because there’s not a lot of special management areas there.” 
Some aspects of the ongoing revision are more ironclad. The tool that BLM is going to complete is an “environmental assessment,” which is less exhaustive than the “environmental impact statement” the agency published ahead of the 2024 revision. And the timing has already been decided. The BLM will have a signed record of decision on the amended plans by Oct. 2, 2026, to comply with updated National Environmental Policy Act guidelines, Kirby said.

Although the Bureau of Land Management hasn’t shown its hand on specifics, it’s reasonable to expect that the agency will seek to scale back the size and/or number of special designations in the Rock Springs Field Office. While protesting the final plan, several state agencies urged BLM to reduce the areas of critical environmental concern, which increased from 226,000 acres to 935,000 acres during the 2024 update. 
Some locals who attended Wednesday’s public meeting want BLM to slash those conserved landscapes. 
“Some of them just need to go away,” Sweetwater County Commissioner Mary Thoman said. The Golden Triangle area, which is protected by the South Wind River ACEC, is an example of a protected landscape that ought to go away, she said. 
“It’s got to be multi-use for sustained yield,” Thoman said. “They totally diverged and made it one use: conservation. That’s the biggest issue.”

Rock Springs resident Glenn Lehar, a retired Jim Bridger Power Plant mechanic, also believed that the BLM’s 2024 plan tilted too far toward conservation at the expense of the economy. 
“The people who decided on this, they don’t even live here,” Lehar said. “They don’t even got a clue what goes on out here.” 
But not everyone wanted to see federal land managers roll back special protections and move the needle toward oil and gas drilling, mining and other forms of industrial development.

Duane Kerr, a retired game warden, took issue with a BLM proposal to lease out portions of the Golden Triangle for oil and gas drilling, including near the world’s largest sage grouse lek. Under the existing management plan, leasing and drilling aren’t allowed in the area, but those activities could be permitted if the South Wind River area of critical environmental concern goes away. 
“That’s a horrible thing, in my opinion,” Kerr said. “If you care about wildlife, you can’t do that.”

 Other parties who attended the Rock Springs meeting will be pushing BLM to maintain the status quo. Joey Faigl, who presides over the Muley Fanatic Foundation alone after co-founder Josh Coursey’s Trump administration appointment, said that he doesn’t want to see federal land managers mess with special designations in the Greater Little Mountain Ecosystem — there is both an area of critical concern and a special recreation management area in that area.
“The way it sits now, we’re supportive of it,” Faigl said. “It came to where we wanted it, and we’re all good with where it sits.”
Faigl has been engaged in the resource management plan revision since its onset, he said. He partook in his first related field trip back in 2008.
The Rock Springs resident offered one more thought. 
 “I want it over,” he said.

(Screenshot of Idaho Secretary of State's website) Idaho is seeing more money, and more out-of-state money in lobbying than it likely ever has. 
Secretary of State Phil McGrane told attendees at the Annual Associated Taxpayers of Idaho Conference Wednesday that more than $2.5 million was spent on lobbying in 2025. 
McGrane highlighted new data visualization tools available online at voteidaho.gov, including to track lobbyist spending. 
During the 2025 session, lawmakers approved changes to lobbying reporting that now require “indirect lobbying” to be reported, which would capture activity like social media or texting campaigns during the legislative session to encourage residents to support or oppose certain bills. The new bill also requires monthly reporting year-round, instead of just during the three-month legislative session. Around $700,000 has been spent on lobbying since the 2025 legislative session ended in April, McGrane said. 
There are 392 registered in-state organizations that lobby in Idaho, and there are 300 out-of-state organizations registered to lobby in Idaho.  
The new data visualization runs through each month of 2025, as the lobbying money gets spent. The state legislative session this year ran January through April 4. By the end of the year, the top spender was Modern Ag Alliance, based out of St. Louis, Missouri. The group spent over $620,000 lobbying on one bill, House Bill 303, which would have largely granted legal immunity to pesticide manufacturers. The bill never advanced out of the committee. 
“Most of the spending comes right at the end of February into March,” McGrane said Wednesday. “So in the heat of the session is when money starts to really trickle in. It starts off slow, and then comes in strong.”
The second-highest spender of the year was the American Federation for Children, a Washington D.C.-based organization that advocates for public subsidies for private school education. The entity has spent more than $200,000 in Idaho, with a large focus on House Bill 93 — a private school choice tax credit that provides a total of $50 million for families to go toward private school tuition or other educational expenses. The governor signed HB 93 into law on Feb. 27. 
There are around 400 lobbyists registered in Idaho, McGrane said. 
“For all of you legislators, that means there’s four of them for each one of you,” he said. 
The second new data visualization dashboard available online depicts the close legislative races the state has seen since 2018. All 105 seats in the Legislature are up for election every two years. 
There have been 49 legislative primary races decided by 435 — the number of attendees registered for Wednesday’s conference — or fewer votes since 2018. 
“Fifty races were determined by just the people here,” McGrane said. “So if we can get more people to participate, more people to show up, they can have a big impact.”

Josh Shapiro’s cabinet to serve as executive director of the Pennsylvania School Employees Retirement System (PSERS).
Monson, who is a longtime associate of Shapiro, will bring broad experience in public finance to the agency, which manages nearly $80 billion in investments for the pensions of more than 500,000 teachers, school staff and retirees, PSERS said in a statement.
“We chose Uri Monson as our next executive director because of his extensive public sector financial experience, which is well-suited to guide PSERS in the years ahead,” Board Chair Richard Vague said.
The PSERS board selected Monson after a nationwide search to succeed interim Executive Director Ben Cotton after former Executive Director Terrill Sanchez retired in June.

Monson said he is honored to be selected and have the board’s trust to lead PSERS.
“I have spent my career managing public finances with care and accountability, and I look forward to working with the board, staff and stakeholders to ensure the system continues to deliver on its promise of retirement security for Pennsylvania’s public school employees,” Monson said
Monson earns about $211,000 as budget secretary. Sanchez earned $317,000 before his retirement.
Shapiro will appoint Zachary Reber, who currently serves as deputy secretary for fiscal policy and program coordination, to become budget secretary, the governor’s office said. The PSERS board is expected to finalize its selection of Monson at its Dec. 12 meeting.

Shapiro’s office highlighted Monson’s work with the Budget Office through three budget cycles during which Shapiro’s team negotiated with Republicans in the divided legislature to fund cash strapped public transit agencies, school vouchers and other policy goals, amid a process that extended beyond the deadline each year.
Monson presided over the debut of the commonwealth’s first ever debt management plan, which clarified guidelines for debt authorization and repayment. He also oversaw a bond refinancing that will save taxpayers $193 million, according to the governor’s office.
Before joining Shapiro’s administration, Monson served as deputy superintendent and as chief financial officer for the School District of Philadelphia. Before that, he was CFO for Montgomery County, where Shapiro once served as commissioner.
Shapiro said Monson helped him as he inherited a deficit as commissioner. Together, they balanced the county’s budget, returned it to financial stability and restored the county’s bond rating to AAA status, the highest available.
Monson also served as assistant budget director for Philadelphia where he was responsible for policy analysis for the finance director and Mayor Ed Rendell’s cabinet. 
A graduate of Columbia University, Monson holds a bachelor’s degree in political science and a masters degree in public policy from Columbia’s School of International and Public Affairs. Monson also earned a bachelor’s degree in Midrash from the Jewish Theological Seminary of America.
Reber has worked for the state for nearly a decade, serving in multiple senior roles in the governor’s office and the Department of Community and Economic Development. As a deputy secretary in the budget office, Reber manages coordination with the governor’s office and plays a key role in shaping the commonwealth’s annual budget, Shapiro’s office said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Uri-Munson-1024x896.jpeg,,,2025-12-04 18:58:34.398665

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — For the first time in Epic Charter School’s history, its next superintendent will be a newcomer hired from outside the virtual charter school.
Epic’s governing board, with four of its five members present, unanimously voted Thursday to hire Shaun Ross from Oklahoma City Public Schools, where he is senior executive director of student support and accountability.
Ross, who wasn’t present for the vote, will earn an annual salary of $250,000. He will start at Epic “as soon as possible,” but the date of his first day on the job is still uncertain, board chairperson Trevor Hammons said.
In a news release issued an hour after the board made its decision, Ross said it’s an “honor” to be selected. He plans to lead the long-embattled school system into a new era of stability, continuity and academic excellence, according to the announcement.
“Epic has been through what it’s been through and learned so many valuable lessons,” Ross said. “It’s time to move forward, leave the past behind and double down on our commitment to student success.”

The Oklahoma City district didn’t immediately return a request for comment Thursday afternoon. Ross formerly worked as an instructional leadership director and a principal in the district before stepping into its senior administration this year.
Interim Superintendent Justin Hunt will continue leading Epic until Ross arrives. The board voted Thursday to award Hunt a $15,000 stipend, set his salary at $235,000 a year and gave him a new title of assistant superintendent.
Hunt, Epic’s deputy superintendent of instruction, took on the interim role in June after Superintendent Bart Banfield resigned amid mass layoffs at the school. Banfield became Epic’s second-ever superintendent when he was promoted into the role in 2019, succeeding school co-founder David Chaney.
The $15,000 stipend rewards Hunt for “doing two jobs” for the past six months, Hammons said. He’s been leading the school system while continuing the duties of his original position.
“Justin has done an incredible job as the interim, keeping the ship afloat,” Hammons said after the board meeting. “And as you saw today, we still have a lot of confidence in Justin and want him to stay on and continue helping Epic into the future.”

Epic, with nearly 30,000 students, is Oklahoma’s third-largest public school district and the biggest of the state’s virtual charter schools, which use primarily online instruction. 
Its open superintendent position attracted 54 candidates from 17 states, said Erin Hatfield, the school’s director of public relations. The “exhaustive” six-month search involved three rounds of interviews that culminated in the board’s decision Thursday between three finalists, she said.
Hammons declined to confirm any of the finalists’ names besides Ross, nor would he say whether Hunt was one of them.
The board wasn’t expressly searching for a superintendent from outside the organization, Hammons said. Rather, Ross impressed the board in each of his three interviews as “incredibly qualified” and “really personable.”
“Shaun just happened to be from the outside and happened to be the best candidate, as the board voted,” Hammons said. “It’s going to be a challenge. We’re a school unlike any other in the state, maybe in the nation, but his background and his willingness and his attitude and also the people that are here that are going to help him, it’ll bring a new perspective to Epic, and hopefully that will really help us grow and just kind of move forward and get back to doing what we do best, which is educate the students.”

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Florida Phoenix)Anti-abortion activists have the right to hand leaflets to women in the driveway of a Clearwater abortion clinic, a federal appeals court ruled Thursday.
In a 2-to-1 decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit tossed a trial judge’s decision preventing the Florida Preborn Rescue organization from entering within five feet of the Bread and Roses Women’s Health Center’s driveway. 
Instead, the lower court must pause the Clearwater ordinance preventing the group — and any other pedestrians — from entering the center’s “buffer zone” — a 38-foot stretch of public sidewalk, 28 feet of which cross the clinic’s driveway.
“The Ordinance seriously burdens Florida Preborn’s speech … by restricting the sidewalk counselors’ ability to distribute leaflets to patients as they arrive at the clinic,” the majority opinion reads. 
“The controlling question is whether the challenged buffer zone — be it five, 10, or 35 feet—burdens substantially more speech than necessary to achieve the government’s asserted interests,” it continues. 
“We think it likely that Clearwater’s buffer zone does so.”
Although abortion-related topics have divided the nation for decades, the conversation reached a fever-pitch in 2022 when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. 
This turned abortion regulation over to the states, sparking dramatically different pro-choice or anti-abortion laws from state to state. Since then, states like New Jersey, Colorado, and Kentucky have all seen their “buffer zone” ordinances contested.
What happened?
The case centers on a 2023 city ordinance passed to prevent anti-abortion protesters impeding vehicles’ and patients’ access to the clinic. 
According to the Clearwater Police Department — which backed the ordinance — it received 73 calls in one year from the clinic to handle “continuing and recently escalating confrontation.”
The ordinance banned all pedestrians from crossing within five feet of the clinic’s driveway, exempting emergency services and clinic staff escorting women into the building, as part of a buffer zone.
Florida Preborn Rescue soon after asked a federal district judge for a preliminary injunction, alleging a free-speech violation and noting that its ability to hand out leaflets and have “close, personal conversations” had been dramatically chilled.
U.S. District Judge Mary Scriven denied their request that October. 
Now, as ordered by the appellate court, Scriven will have to dissolve the buffer zone while litigation continues on the underlying merits of the case. 
‘Herculean efforts’
The appellate decision was not unanimous. Judge Nancy Abudu, a joe Biden appointee, disagreed with judges Kevin Newsom and Britt Grant, both appointed by Trump. 
“The First Amendment does not demand that patients at a medical facility undertake Herculean efforts to escape the cacophony of political [messages],” she wrote, citing federal precedent. “The right to be let alone is one of the most comprehensive of rights and the right most valued by civilized men.”
Abudu argued that FPR can still speak with patients driving into the clinic because their counselors are just five feet away from the driveway. 
“It is diﬃcult to even visualize how a distance of five feet seriously burdens FPR’s ability to leaflet and otherwise communicate with those entering the clinic,” she added, arguing patients interested in speaking with FPR could always walk over and accept a leaflet.
This conflicts with Newsom and Grant’s reading of the ordinance. 
Because the measure bans all pedestrians except for clinic staff and emergency management, they said, this technically means patients intrigued by FPR’s message wouldn’t be allowed to walk through the buffer zone to accept a leaflet.
Moreover, they argued, that the ordinance is unnecessary and over-burdensome because Florida already has a statute preventing the obstruction of traffic ways.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2022_may24_protesters2-1024x585.jpg,,,2025-12-04 18:58:34.398665

(Photo: Senate.gov)The U.S. Senate confirmed four of President Donald Trump’s nominees to North Carolina federal courts this week, twice as many as in his entire first term.
Senators voted to approve Lindsey Freeman and David Bragdon to serve the Middle District of North Carolina on Tuesday, and Matthew Orso and Susan Courtwright Rodriguez to serve the Western District of North Carolina on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively.
Though Trump had an outsized influence on the federal courts in other states during his first term, he appointed just two federal judges for North Carolina.
However, Trump entered office for his second term with twice as many vacancies to fill in North Carolina because Republican senators Thom Tillis and Ted Budd refused to negotiate with President Joe Biden on vacancies that opened in the state during his presidency.
Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) blocked President Joe Biden from appointing judges in North Carolina in 2024, allowing Trump to enter office with four vacancies on the state’s federal bench. (Photo: Senate.gov)
That standoff began when Biden nominated North Carolina Solicitor General Ryan Park for the Fourth Circuit. Tillis and Budd were staunchly opposed to Park’s nomination, and vowed to withhold their “blue slips” for any nominees in the state afterward. (Senate protocol requires the support of at least one senator for district judge nominees in their home state.)
After losing the 2024 election, Biden ultimately rescinded Park’s nomination in a deal to advance several district court judges in other states.
With this week’s confirmation of the four Trump nominees, all active judges in the Middle District of North Carolina are Republican appointees, as are all but one in the Western District.
Each of the new judges has prior experience with the federal judiciary, either as clerks or through litigation, with Orso and Rodriguez succeeding judges they clerked for. All but Bragdon were able to win the support of several Democratic senators in addition to the unanimous support of Republicans.
Orso and Rodriguez, both approved with 57 votes, received the backing of five Democratic senators: Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-Az.), Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), and Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.).
Freeman’s 60-39 vote was the most bipartisan, with eight senators who caucus with Democrats supporting her: Durbin, Kaine, Shaheen, Whitehouse, Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), Sen. Gary Peters (D-Mich.), Sen. Angus King (I-Maine), and Sen. Jackie Rosen (D-Nevada).
Bragdon was confirmed in a 53-45 vote with only Republicans in favor.
Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond and an expert on the federal courts, said North Carolina will benefit from having a full complement of judges after more than a year of vacancies.

“It’s good for the courts. It’s good for the judges,” Tobias said. “It was important to get them filled. It’s just unfortunate that Democrats didn’t get to put any through because they made it all contingent on [Park’s nomination].”
He added that Democrats should “feel pretty good” that three of the four nominees received bipartisan support in the Senate, and that their backgrounds reflect the level of experience of traditional judicial nominees. “They’re probably more like establishment conservatives.”
Bragdon, a former clerk for Justice Clarence Thomas, faced progressive backlash on reproductive rights and capital punishment. The progressive nonprofit Alliance For Justice wrote to the Judiciary Committee to condemn Bragdon’s hardline positions on both issues in online writings as a law student, which contributed to his lack of Democratic support.
In a Dec. 2 statement, Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) and Sen. Ted Budd (R-N.C.) praised the Senate for swiftly confirming Bragdon and Freeman.
“Throughout this process, I’ve remained committed to advancing judges who uphold the Constitution, apply the law fairly, and serve with integrity,” Tillis said. “I appreciate the White House’s partnership in identifying strong candidates, and I look forward to seeing both Judge Bragdon and Judge Freeman bring their experience and dedication to the federal bench.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Senate-NC-Judges-Hearing-e1758222170242-1024x767.png,,,2025-12-04 18:58:34.398665

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)A Senate panel unanimously advanced legislation Thursday that would expand the definition of motorized bikes, despite staunch opposition from cyclists and hesitation from some of the lawmakers themselves.
Sen. Pat Diegnan (D-Middlesex), chair of the Senate’s transportation committee, voted in favor of the bill while conceding he does not think it is the solution to what some officials have said is a rise in dangerous use of e-bikes.
“But we have to do something. It’s absolutely scary,” Diegnan said.
https://newjerseymonitor.com/2025/11/27/hudson-river-rail-tunnels/
The bill would remove all existing classifications of electric bikes and redefine and expand the classification of motorized bicycles to include pedal bikes with electric motors that assist the rider. By redesignating low-speed electric bikes as motorized bikes, people would be required to license, register, and insure them to use them in New Jersey.
Bill Senate President Nicholas Scutari (D-Union) said in October he planned to propose legislation to overhaul e-bike laws soon after a 13-year-old boy riding an electric bike in Scotch Plains was killed when a truck crashed into him and a 22-year-old man on an e-bike died after a car struck him in Orange. At the time, Scutari said he wanted to create another class for bikes that can exceed 28 miles per hour, reclassify some bikes that can get up to 18 miles per hour, and mandate licensing and insurance for bikes not classified as low-speed electric bicycles.
Under current state law, low-speed e-bikes that go up to 20 miles per hour — classified as Class 1 or Class 2 — require no license or registration. Class 3 e-bikes, which have a maximum speed of 28 miles per hour, are treated as a motorized bicycle, and already come with some regulations, like registration, a driver’s license, and insurance.
Critics who testified to the committee Thursday said the bill Scutari introduced in November is completely different than what he first suggested. They said they support the version of the bill as he originally described it, but oppose jettisoning bike classification.
“Putting aside the legal and procedural issues, merging these classes is just a bad idea on its face,” said Corey Hannigan of the Tri-State Transportation Campaign.
He raised concerns about whether New York cyclists crossing the George Washington Bridge could face citations for lacking registration or insurance. He also noted a major incentive of low-speed e-bikes is their accessibility compared to higher-speed bikes that require training, licensing, and registration.
Karen Manovich uses an electric bike with a 200-watt motor that doesn’t hold a charge for more than an hour. Manovich said the legislation would conflate her bike with one that has a 2,000-watt motor and can exceed 25 miles per hour.
“That’s what you guys need to go after. Not after my little bike that I really need to get up that hill in Jersey City,” she said.
She has no license, and noted that obtaining a license requires six points of identification, an additional hurdle for some cyclists. Licensing and insurance requirements would put serious limits on who can ride an electric bike in New Jersey, she added.
Bruce Fletcher, a retired state corrections officer who regularly rides his electric bike along the Delaware canal, said the bill would make New Jersey an outlier, with most states following the three-class e-bike system. He also said his insurance company told him they would not insure his e-bike.
“No insurance company wants to do this,” he said. “If you combine it with electric, moto, moped, along with the rest, you’ll be hurting everybody.”
Hannigan said he’d prefer lawmakers increase enforcement of existing laws requiring registration, educate vendors and parents of teens on requirements, and crack down on illegally modified devices.
Attorney Richard Albuquerque supports the bill, citing pedestrians who are being “severely injured.” With no insurance requirements for e-bikes, families are stuck with significant medical bills and little recourse, Albuquerque said.
“If the bikes had liability insurance, there’d be an opportunity for them not to be so personally devastated and impacted by these accidents,” he said.
Nationally, e-bike injuries rose by 293% from 2019 to 2022, according to Columbia University researchers.
The bill is scheduled for a hearing in the Senate Budget Committee Monday. It does not have a companion in the Assembly.

(Photo by Janie Osborne/Getty Images)The Montana Environmental Quality Council at its Dec. 2 meeting, approved a letter requesting federal funding for projects aimed at extracting rare earth and critical minerals from legacy mining sites in the state. 
The letter, addressed to Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, asked for funding through the Army’s Research, Development, Test and Evaluation account for the Montana Mining Association’s Rare Earth and Critical Minerals Extraction Demonstration project.
While the letter was approved 14-1, some legislators sought to put limits on the projects included in the funding request. 
As part of the federal push to secure domestic critical and rare earth mineral supply chains, the federal government has pushed to fund mining projects and technological advancements to maximize extraction in the U.S. 
In Montana, a state built on a history of mining, there has been a recent push to revitalize old legacy mines to extract high-priority minerals from waste sites, including the iconic Berkeley Pit in Butte. 
“There’s billions of gallons of metals lying in the water in the Berkeley Pit and hundreds of millions of tons of smelter waste (near Anaconda) all bearing appreciable levels of metals with many of those being critical in those two sites,” said Montana Mining Association director Matt Vincent said during a presentation at the EQC’s October meeting.
Vincent highlighted some of the critical elements on the federal priority list, including zinc, germanium, copper, cobalt, tungsten, manganese, nickel, bismuth, antimony and others. 
Recent studies by Montana Tech University and other geological research entities have focused on extracting rare earth elements from coal waste, mining wastewater, and specifically, the Berkeley Pit, where it’s estimated extraction processes could produce 40 tons of rare earths annually. 
The Montana Mining Association is working on extraction projects at existing mines and waste sites, including the Berkeley Pit, the Anaconda smelter waste complex, the Sibanye-Sillwater mine, Black Butte mine and Antonioli-Contact mine.
“The sites that we select are based on legacy sites and operating permit sites where they have conducted initial sampling that’s identified, what the critical elements are, that they’re appreciable amounts of that would lend themselves to being priority target sites,” Vincent told the EQC on Tuesday. 
Rep. Josh Seckinger, D-Bozeman, raised some concerns that the letter did not list the specific sites Vincent discussed, and leaving it open-ended could lead to misunderstandings as to what kinds of mining the EQC was supporting. 
Several conservation organizations provided public comment at the meeting, and said while they supported projects repurposing existing mines, they also were concerned about any new mining operations. 
“We too think that looking at critical minerals and rare earth elements in places such as the Berkeley Pit and the Anaconda smelter site makes sense,” said Julia DalSoglio, representing the Montana Sierra Club. 
DalSoglio and a representative of the Montana Environmental Information Center did point to recent opposition to a new exploratory mining operation in the Bitterroot Valley that drew hundreds of members of the public in a meeting this week and led to Montana’s federal delegation going on the record about not supporting a fast-tracked mining project.  
“It’s quite easy to leap to conclusions and by inference as to what sort of projects they might be pointing towards,” Ben Cotton with MEIC said. “Some of the language at the end of the letter talking about other shovel-ready projects. I’m really reassured hearing these comments about what this is actually targeting and and fully support that, but think that the letter could be drafted in a way that’s more specific.”
The letter was ultimately approved with an added line listing out the five priority projects of the Montana Mining Association as well as “future legacy sites.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GettyImages-811976670-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-04 18:58:34.398665

Over the past few months, VTDigger and Vermont Public reporter Carly Berlin has been looking into the changing landscape of transitional housing in Vermont. We’re excited to be able to share the results of that reporting in this podcast, produced by the Brave Little State team at Vermont Public.
Note: Brave Little State is made for the ear. We recommend listening to the audio. We’ve also provided a transcript. Transcripts are generated using a combination of robots and human transcribers, and they may contain errors.

Josh Crane: From Vermont Public and the NPR Network, this is Brave Little State. I’m Josh Crane.
Every episode of this show begins with a question asked by a listener. Sometimes people submit those questions online — you can do that at bravelittlestate.org — other people ask them in person at one of our live events. But for this episode, we did something different.
Reporter Carly Berlin covers housing for Vermont Public and VTDigger. You might remember the BLS episode she did last year about the state’s motel voucher program. In that episode, she addressed, and ultimately disproved the idea that Vermont’s recent spike in homelessness is caused by out-of-staters coming here for a motel room.
That story was driven by questions she was hearing from readers and listeners who have housing about people who don’t. And the whole time she worked on that piece, she wondered: What if we went directly to people experiencing homelessness and asked what they thought we should investigate? Where might that lead us?
So, for this episode, that’s exactly what we did. Carly takes it from here.
What are you curious about?
Carly Berlin: It’s kind of unusual as a news reporter with regular deadlines to begin a story with a simple, open-ended question: What are you curious about?
I made that pitch with Brave Little State producer Burgess Brown at a Burlington homeless shelter and at a daytime resource center that gives food and supplies to people who live outside.
We held office hours. And we repurposed a suggestion box for people to submit their ideas to us after we left.
Burgess Brown: And we’ve got these notecards that says, “What’s a question you have about housing and homelessness in Vermont? And why’s that question important to you?“
Carly Berlin: On one of those question-gathering days, I spent a few hours at the resource center cafeteria during the morning breakfast rush.
I pulled up a chair at a crowded table, and made my ask: What are you curious about?
The people at the table started batting around their questions — questions about lengthy housing waitlists and city policies around encampments in public parks. And then the man sitting next to me, who introduced himself as Manny, asked me this one: “Why are there no halfway houses anymore?”
Halfway houses. Not a term that gets used a whole lot these days. But historically, these were places for people leaving prison or rehab to live half way on their path back to society and independence.
I spend a lot of time covering Vermont’s response to homelessness. And sometimes I think about that response as links in a chain. There are all of these links in our housing system, in a person’s life, where things can fall apart that can land someone sleeping in a tent, or in a shelter or motel.
Manny’s question struck me because I didn’t know a lot about this particular link in that chain, when someone’s just gotten clean, or served their time, and now it’s their moment to start piecing together a new life.
Manny was in this moment when we met. He had been released from prison just two weeks before. He was looking for housing, and he wanted to find somewhere he could stay sober. He was worried about overdosing. A halfway house, he seemed to imply, would be the right place for him to get back on track. Or at least to have a place to sleep inside.
There’s an implication in Manny’s question that halfway houses in Vermont have disappeared altogether. Spoiler: That’s not quite true. What I learned is a lot of group homes for people leaving prison or drug treatment have closed up, just in the last couple years.
But soon after that wave of closures crested, an effort to open up more of these homes is picking up momentum.
So there’s some yo-yoing happening. And that’s because there’s not a clear consensus about the best way to get people back on their feet — people who are experiencing homelessness and addiction, who’ve committed crimes. The debate centers around priorities: whether sobriety is priority number one, or getting people into housing.
Looking at the story of halfway houses in Vermont, and particularly in Burlington, is a way of examining how we’ve sorted through those priorities in the past and how we’re trying to do that now, in the middle of a historic housing shortage and an opioid epidemic. It’s a way of looking at how we try to balance accountability, and compassion, and giving people choice.
A mirror to the present
(Public access TV intro music)
Carly Berlin: Burlington in the 1980s feels like a mirror to the present.
Bernie Sanders: There is a housing crisis in Burlington. People can’t afford new housing. People can’t afford skyrocketing rent. People are sleeping out on the streets.
Carly Berlin: That is then-Burlington mayor, Bernie Sanders, speaking on public access TV in 1987.
Burlington was experiencing a housing crunch that would feel very familiar to residents today. And it’s critical to understanding why halfway houses started springing up all across town.
Erhard Mahnke: Burlington was making its name on the map. People were excited to come move to Burlington.
Carly Berlin: Erhard Mahnke is a longtime affordable housing advocate. He says this was a time of intense real estate speculation. People were buying old houses, fixing them up and flipping them. Lower income residents were getting displaced. Rents doubled over the course of the decade.
Erhard Mahnke: The 80s were, you know, a time of rapidly rising rents, much as we’ve seen over the last few years.
Carly Berlin: And at the same time, then-President Ronald Reagan slashed funding for public housing across the country. Here’s Bernie again.
Bernie Sanders: They are stopping federal aid for low-income housing. They are stopping federal aid for Section Eight. So the bottom line is that in terms of future housing programs, the situation regarding Washington is totally dismal.
Carly Berlin: Erhard says it didn’t take long for more and more people to become homeless.
Erhard Mahnke: What we look upon and consider as modern-day homelessness was basically created under the Reagan administration. 
Carly Berlin: Newspaper stories started to note the existence of, quote, “street people” in Burlington — people who were sometimes drinking and using drugs, who were sometimes mentally ill.
And business owners on Church Street were not happy. A few of them got fed up with the homeless people who they said harassed their customers and staff. So, they decided to get rid of the problem themselves.
They started a nonprofit called “Westward Ho!,” which gave unhoused people in Burlington a one-way ticket out of town. Erhard says the business owners were roundly criticized.

In 1988, Burlington business owners started a group called Westward Ho! that provided unhoused people with one way tickets out of town. Image from Burlington Free Press, December 30, 1988.

Erhard Mahnke: It was a lot of outrage around that. It’s like, oh yeah. Let’s ship our problems somewhere else. No, we should deal with it here.

Carly Berlin: And Burlington did decide to deal with it here. The city’s first homeless shelters opened during this time. Its leaders came up with new ways to fund affordable housing that relied less on the feds.
And organizations started opening up group homes for people who were leaving prison, or recovering from addiction. These were different than the shelters popping up. Their purpose was not just to put a roof over people’s heads, but to rehabilitate people back into public life. Recovery meetings were often required. Sometimes prayer. Volunteering.
These places were often called “halfway houses.”

CCTV video: (music) While I was locked up, one of my biggest fears was where I would go and what would happen to me when I got out. And I don’t know what would’ve happened to me if I hadn’t come to Dismas House. It scares me to think about it.
Carly Berlin: That’s from a video made by Dismas House, a home for people without a place to stay after being released from prison. It opened up in Burlington in 1986.
And then in ‘89, a homeless shelter announced plans to open, quote, “northern Vermont’s first halfway house for alcoholics and drug abusers,” claiming it would be a place to, quote, “confront the causes of their homelessness.”

The Burlington Emergency Shelter set out plans to open “northern Vermont’s first halfway house for alcoholics and drug abusers.” Image from Burlington Free Press, February 14, 1989.

The same year, Burlington got its first Oxford House, a recovery home run democratically by residents. By the early 90s, there were seven of these in town. Similar houses popped up around the state too.
But it was hard to keep these houses open. They faced budget shortfalls and pushback from neighbors. Even when some of them closed, though, new houses sprouted up in their place to meet demand.
And then, just a couple years ago — another spate of closures happened. A big one, centered in Burlington, just as a new homelessness and substance use crisis was beginning to reach a boiling point.
WCAX: An update to a home for mothers and babies in crisis facing financial troubles. Today, the Lund Center announced Independence Place will be closing after 20 years…
WCAX: Two homes in Brattleboro and this one here in Burlington will be closing after losing a majority of their funding. Now, residents tell me that this is disappointing … There’s nothing out there, there’s no vacancy anywhere. All the programs are full or overcrowded. So, basically, they’re on the streets. 
Carly Berlin: There’s no comprehensive count of halfway houses in Vermont — and the term itself has fallen out of favor. But based on our research, as recently as 2019, there were about 30 group transitional houses for adults across the state — the vast majority of them clustered in Burlington. By 2025, of those 33 homes, more than a third have closed.
We’re going to come back to why this string of closures happened a few years ago. But first, I want to take you to Buell Street in Burlington. Because, in the face of all sorts of pressure from NIMBYs and tenuous funding, one of the original transitional homes from the ‘80s is still welcoming new residents.

Dismas House
It’s one of those November nights that started in the afternoon. Snow is already blanketing everything. I walk up to a big Victorian house and knock on the door. Inside, there are deep, comfortable couches and the table is set for dinner.
This is the Burlington Dismas House. Since the mid-80s, its mission has been to reconcile former prisoners with society, and society with former prisoners.
Every weeknight, volunteers bring a meal here to share with the residents, all recently incarcerated men.
Tonight, one of them — Ryan Laflin — is acting as our host.

Ryan Laflin: Thank you for coming to Tuesday night dinner everyone. I’m your host, Ryan. I’d like to thank the cooks, Dean and Valerie. (Clapping)
We can go around and introduce each other. I’m Ryan…
Valerie: I’m Valerie …
Carly Berlin: There are about a dozen people sitting around the table. Ryan serves us plates full of chicken, potatoes and squash.
Ryan Laflin: Now we’ll go around and whoever has gratitude they could share it. I’ll go first. I’d like to thank the house, the program, everyone here, the guys. Salt for the roads.
Other resident: I’m grateful for the house, for second chances, getting out of jail and all that stuff. You know, it’s good to be here.
Carly Berlin: Living here comes with a lot of structure. Residents pay $85 a week to stay here. They’re expected to come to group dinner three nights a week. They all have assigned chores. Staff help them find jobs. They volunteer in the community.
When I ask what volunteering has been most meaningful for them, Ryan pipes up.
Ryan Laflin: I don’t know. Probably the laundromat. I like the laundromat. 
Carly Berlin: Every Wednesday, the laundromat has a free laundry day geared toward people experiencing homelessness.
Ryan Laflin: It’s pretty nice, you know, everyone was like, so happy, you know, excited to do it, you know, to be there to get their laundry done.
Other resident: When you don’t have anything, it’s amazing the little things that make you happy, right?
Ryan Laflin: Put a smile on my face, just watching them be happy.
Carly Berlin: I ask how many of the guys have been homeless before, and hands fly up around the dinner table.
And they know many other people in prison who are waiting to be released but don’t have a home to go back to, they say.
According to Department of Corrections data, as of late October, 72 people were held past their minimum release date because they lack appropriate housing to move into.
Other resident: It’s crazy the amount of people that sit there on lack of residence. 
Ryan Laflin: Yeah. There’s a lot of them. 
Carly Berlin: When someone’s leaving prison, they might have a home to go back to with a parent, or a spouse. But other times, there’s nowhere for them to land. In those cases, the state helps fund two routes.
One are group homes like Dismas. The other are subsidized apartments. Both routes are just temporary places to live – for a couple months, or a couple years, before people move on to, hopefully, a permanent home.
Many of the guys say Dismas was just convenient, that it had a shorter waitlist than the apartments.
But it’s clearly more than just a way to avoid sitting in prison longer. Ryan says there’s a lot of support baked into living here.
Ryan Laflin: We all have each other’s backs, you know. Someone needs something, or, you know, whether it’s emotional or whatever, physical, we’re there to support everyone. It’s kind of nice. 
Carly Berlin: After eating hearty slices of carrot cake, I sit down with Ryan on the deep couches in the living room. I ask him to tell me the story of how he ended up here. Around twenty years ago, he says he got into a snowmobile accident.
Ryan Laflin: I was holding up the back of it and the track broke. And a chunk of it took me in, the leg broke in, ripped out a bunch of muscle and tendons and stuff. So they gave me a lot of painkillers, and then when they stopped giving them to me, that was, you know, because I was abusing them. I found the next best thing. You know, it was cheap and everywhere. And I did that, I did heroin for probably a year, and then got on Suboxone. 
Carly Berlin: He was clean for a while. He got married, had two kids. Then his dad died. He fell into a depression, and one day he decided to get high again. Things went downhill fast.
Ryan Laflin: We lost our house. You know, we ended up losing our kids. 
Carly Berlin: He was sentenced for a burglary he committed in 2019, among other charges. In prison, Ryan says he realized he’d chosen drugs over his children. He says he got sober. And when it was time to figure out where to go after prison he heard about Dismas from someone inside.
Ryan Laflin: I looked into it and, you know, realized how good of a program this really is, you know, and if you put your mind to it, you really want to do it, you can succeed. You know, you could stay clean in here, you know, they help you, and they have all the tools. 
Carly Berlin: Staying sober is one of the rules at Dismas House, though using drugs or drinking doesn’t automatically get someone kicked out. Dismas staff say they work through options with residents.
Ryan says every once in a while, someone moves into the house who’s just not ready to be clean.
Ryan Laflin: You just got to, you know, avoid it, go to your room, or, you know, go for a walk or something, just to, you know, clear your head and you know, so it doesn’t trigger you.

From zero tolerance to ‘Housing First’
Carly Berlin: This conundrum — what to do when someone relapses while living in sober housing — it played a big role in why many of these homes closed their doors a few years ago.
The Vermont Department of Corrections was seeing a pattern. People were being released from prison into these sober houses. And then they’d relapse, violating the zero tolerance policies that many of these homes had towards substance use, says Jill Moore, the housing program administrator for the Department of Corrections.
Jill Moore: Zero tolerance, in plain language, looks like: You’re given a drug test, and even if you test dirty for something like marijuana, you were kicked out of the program.

Carly Berlin: After someone was kicked out — or ran off — they’d often be homeless. That would mean they violated the conditions of their release from prison, which stipulated that they have housing. That violation would often land them back in prison.
One study found that those sorts of violations were the main reason people on furlough — who were finishing their sentences outside prison, in the community — were put back behind bars, rather than people committing new crimes.
So in 2021, the department decided that the zero tolerance stance in transitional housing was not working. Officials made a decision that caught a lot of people off guard. They decided to drastically reduce the number of beds the state funded in these group homes and put the money toward that other route — transitional apartments.
The theory here was the top priority for people leaving prison should be stable housing. Meaning, having housing shouldn’t be a condition of staying sober.
Jill Moore: Really as a department, as a whole, we shifted to harm reduction, right? And saying, like, we understand that relapse is a part of the process.
Carly Berlin: This philosophy — that getting access to housing should come before sorting through other problems, like drug use — it’s a major idea that’s guided the response to homelessness and addiction across the country over the last two decades. It’s called “Housing First.”
When the Vermont Department of Corrections embraced “Housing First”, and pulled funding for many groups homes in favor of individual apartments, the dominoes started to fall.
Phoenix House, a Rhode Island based nonprofit that had been the largest sober living provider in Vermont, closed all five of its homes in the state following the funding cut in 2021.
So did Northern Lights, a transitional housing program in downtown Burlington for women struggling with substance use.
And, right around this same time, as housing prices were starting to soar, some owners of other sober houses in Burlington shuttered because it was just too expensive to keep them running.
The Department’s pivot away from sober houses wasn’t absolute. It kept funding Dismas House. The DOC’s shift on zero tolerance pushed Dismas to change how it handled relapse and drug use in its houses, the Dismas of Vermont director told me. The homes have a less punitive stance now. They give residents more options for treatment, more second chances — and third and fourth ones.
By some metrics, this big shake up at the Department of Corrections brought success. The number of people landing back in prison because of violations like loss of housing has dropped over the last few years.
But just avoiding prison isn’t the only goal of transitional housing. It’s also to find permanent housing. And by that measure, not a lot has changed. The share of people who’ve been able to move out of transitional housing into permanent homes has held steady.
Right now, this push and pull between “Housing First” and zero tolerance — between prioritizing housing, and prioritizing sobriety — it’s playing out at the policy level.
Meanwhile, people are caught in this balance. People who are navigating the reality of relapsing in the early stages of recovery.
Relapse in sober houses
One person I spoke to for this story used to live in a sober house. We agreed to keep his identity anonymous because he’s still under state supervision and fears getting re-incarcerated.
He told me that when he first moved in there, after leaving prison, his roommate was actively using drugs. He claimed substance use was common in the house, despite the rules.
This person said he’d struggled with substance use since he was a teenager, but he’d gotten clean again while in prison.
Within a week of living at this house, though, he relapsed. He started to spiral. He was sent to inpatient treatment for a couple days, but when he came back to the house, all the same problems remained.
He felt stuck. Between keeping a roof over his head and staying sober.
Tom Dalton: People very commonly say that when they go to a recovery residence that they immediately encounter multiple people who are using in the house. 
Carly Berlin: Tom Dalton is the director of Vermonters for Criminal Justice Reform.
Tom Dalton: You know, we have to understand what the real context is, and what risks we’re putting people in if we don’t make sure that there are mechanisms in place to keep them safe. 
Carly Berlin: As part of his advocacy work, Tom regularly meets with people who are looking for help while living in sober houses — or “recovery residences,” the current term of art.
Some have struggled to maintain their recovery when they’re living under the same roof as people who are still using when, Tom says, there should be a more robust system to stabilize people and keep the house environment safe. Other people have been kicked out after a relapse — or because they were simply told they weren’t a good fit for the house, he says.
Tom Dalton: We need to make sure that there’s adequate oversight so that if decisions are being made in unfair ways, people have real recourse, because what’s at stake for them is very, very high. Often somebody, if they lose their housing, might lose the ability to parent. They might be forced into a setting where they have to return to an abusive partner. They might have to sleep outside. They might be returned to incarceration.
Carly Berlin: Tom thinks the “Housing First” model is often the better option for people. He was happy to see the Department of Corrections make its big shift a few years ago, toward individual apartments and away from zero tolerance in the recovery houses that remained.
He still sees a lot of room for improvement, though. And now, he’s watching as officials in other realms of state government are pouring resources into opening new recovery residences.
About ten of them have opened up in the last couple years, and more are in the works. They’re spread across the state, not concentrated in Burlington like the earlier era of sober homes — something many recovery residence advocates say is a good thing, even if it leaves fewer options available in the state’s most populous city than there once were.
David Riegel: The power of recovery residences is in the peer to peer connections.
Carly Berlin: That’s David Riegel. He’s the executive director of one of the biggest recovery residence organizations in the state, called the Vermont Foundation of Recovery.
Today’s recovery homes are different than the ones David looked at back when he was leaving treatment and looking for a sober house in Burlington, in 2007.
This newer crop of recovery residences, they’re generally not zero tolerance. They tend to have some fallback systems in place for when relapse happens.
But David says that doesn’t mean handling those situations is straightforward.
David Riegel: Yeah, it’s not easy. It’s not black and white. It’s very nuanced and complicated.
Carly Berlin: Dealing with someone relapsing in one of these houses takes balancing the needs of the individual struggling — with that of their housemates. And some recovery residence operators have pushed for legal loopholes they say are aimed at protecting the housemates, though not everyone thinks those loopholes are best for protecting the individual.
David says all of this is like walking a tight rope.
David Riegel: It’s not terribly dissimilar from the tightrope you know that Burlington has pretty publicly been struggling with for a period of years now, right, where they’re trying to say, how do we have policies that, you know, are not stigmatizing, they, you know, respect individuals as they are experiencing homelessness, as experiencing substance use disorders, experiencing, you know, mental health challenges. How do we also acknowledge and understand the impact that that has on our community as a whole?
Carly Berlin: To David, offering people choice is the key. For some, the structure of a group house might be exactly what they need. Others might be ready for an apartment of their own.
David Riegel: We owe it to our citizens to have as many different smaller steps as possible, to have as many different “Choose Your Own Adventure” paths as we possibly can.
Carly Berlin: Offering real options can be really challenging when our whole housing system in Vermont is as gridlocked as it is now. When David tells me this, I think about Manny, our question-asker, trying to find a place to live after coming out of prison, and wondering if a halfway house would be a good option.
And I think about someone else I met on my question-asking search, who told me he’d recently been offered an apartment — a ticket out of the shelter where he was living — but he was so worried about slipping into alcoholism due to the isolation of living alone that he turned it down.
David says not seeing a way out of your circumstances, that can lead to despair. But presenting people with actual options — it’s the basis for giving people hope.
David Riegel: I’m a firm believer that hope is the most powerful thing that we have, and that hope is contingent on seeing a linear path between where we are now and what our dreams are. Like, this belief that I am able to grow, my life is capable of improving, there are tangible actions that I can take. And if I do these things, it is a logical outcome that I’m going to achieve my goals.

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana House Republicans on Thursday almost unanimously rejected a slate of Democratic revisions to the contentious mid-decade redistricting bill.
House Bill 1032 would disassemble the state’s two Democratic-held congressional districts to create an 9-0 Republican map ahead of the 2026 midterm elections — as sought by President Donald Trump.
House Democrats labeled the legislation an “extraordinary unfunded mandate,” noting it doesn’t grant state or county election administrators any financial help to make the changes by this spring.
They offered a pair of amendments to reimburse county clerks for costs, like updating election processes and materials. Republicans defeated both on procedural grounds.

“The majority is gonna come up and say the reason this isn’t germane is because it has an appropriation in it,” said Rep. Blake Johnson, D-Indianapolis. “But this … is not in our rule book. It is based solely on precedent. But I think we can all agree … this is an unprecedented moment.”
Johnson said the funding is relevant because, without it, “counties cannot perform the duties” required.
Rep. Alex Zimmerman, R-North Vernon, argued the bill “has nothing to do with an appropriation” and is focused on redistricting.
In the current congressional maps, drawn in 2021, Republicans maintained a 7-2 GOP advantage. Democratic Rep. Frank Mrvan holds the 1st District in northwest Indiana, while Democratic Rep. André Carson holds the 7th District in Indianapolis.
The House Republican proposal would break up the Lake Michigan shoreline area into two districts and splinter Indianapolis across four wide-reaching districts. Of the districts receiving slices of the capital — Indiana’s most populous city — one would extend west to Illinois and two would reach the Ohio River.
The expansive changes are intended to maximize the GOP’s political advantage, said bill author Rep. Ben Smaltz, R-Auburn.
Democrats unsuccessfully offered several other amendments designed to track spending.
One would’ve required the Secretary of State’s Office — which houses the Indiana Election Division — to tally the total amount of money and staff hours spent to implement the redistricting and list projects “delayed or abandoned … as a result of redirecting resources” to those efforts. The report would’ve been made to the State Budget Committee.
Another would have urged lawmakers to study the costs following the 2026 legislative session.
Minor and major changes suggested
Democrats also proposed tweaks to the process — alongside wholesale transformations.
All failed, largely along party lines.
One amendment would’ve required public hearings in each congressional district. Several Democrats noted just 43 Hoosiers made it to the single Indianapolis meeting, held with less than a day’s notice on a snowy Tuesday.
Smaltz said the bill gets one public hearing in the House and Senate, like “any other bill.”
“Respectfully, Rep. Smaltz, this is not the same,” said Rep. Carolyn Jackson, D-Hammond. She noted that during 2021 redistricting, hearings were held across the state.
“They had ample enough time; it was warm outside,” Jackson said. “They were able to come, bring their neighbors, to engage in constructive conversation. There was no threat of flipping off the highway and ending up in a fatality.”
Another amendment would’ve mandated that the people or groups involved in drawing the maps be identified.
Smaltz said the House and Senate GOP worked with the National Republican Redistricting Trust. He didn’t want to set a precedent by adopting the amendment, arguing that people who work on other bills don’t have to identify themselves.
“Who are these people?” pressed Rep. Ed DeLaney, D-Indianapolis. “… Tell us who’s doing this to us!”
Democrats also suggested putting redistricting on a statewide ballot, reviving a longstanding effort to put more decisions directly before voters.
“They want a voice. They want a vote, and frankly, they deserve one,” said Rep. Mitch Gore, D-Indianapolis. “If you’re confident in this map, if you believe this is good for Indiana, then you should have no objection to letting the people confirm.”
Smaltz said Indiana is not a public question state, except in narrow categories provided for in the state’s constitution.
“You are the voice,” he told lawmakers. “You are the vote.”
A proposed amendment to ban mid-census redistricting — which also deleted the bill’s redistricting language — received support from two Republicans: Reps. Ed Clere of New Albany and Danny Lopez of Carmel. The proposal included a plea for Congress to prohibit partisan gerrymandering. Clere joined Democrats to support several other amendments as well.
Bill winds its way through Legislature
Indiana lawmakers returned to the Statehouse this month under heavy public pressure from Trump and Gov. Mike Braun, who have attacked GOP holdouts and threatened to help primary them.
House Republicans released the proposed maps Monday morning. On Tuesday, the election committee held its single public hearing and advanced the legislation — with one Republican “no” vote — to the House floor for amendments Thursday.
The House is expected to approve the maps Friday, and move to the Senate next week.
It’s unclear how the legislation will fare in the Senate, which initially declined to meet for redistricting before reversing. Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray has repeatedly said his caucus doesn’t have enough supportive votes.

Andy Beshear. (Kentucky Lantern photos by Liam Niemeyer)With a little over a month before the GOP-controlled Kentucky legislature begins deciding whether to again reduce the state’s income tax rate, Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear is warning lawmakers against disregarding fiscal “guardrails” that they previously established. 
A big decision facing lawmakers when they convene on Jan. 6 for a 60-day session is whether to continue to reduce the state’s income tax rate, which provides billions of dollars in revenue to support state services.
Republican lawmakers, through a landmark law passed in 2022, created a system of fiscal triggers based on state revenues and the size of the “rainy day” fund to determine when the state can afford to lower the income tax rate by a half-percentage point. Since then the Republican-controlled legislature has lowered the personal income tax rate from 5% to 3.5%, working toward a goal of eventually eliminating it.  
The benchmarks for another half-percentage point reduction were barely missed in the most recent fiscal year, but some Republican lawmakers are expected to press for another income tax cut nonetheless.
Beshear during a Thursday press conference appeared to warn Republicans against disregarding the fiscal guardrails that are part of the 2022 law. “We’re going to figure out if our Republican state legislators are people of their word or not,” Beshear said. 
The governor also cautioned that state revenues are expected to rise little while costs will be up. 
“What we’re going to see in this next budget is that revenue is flat or just up a little bit, but the costs are up a lot more than that. That would further exacerbate that situation,” Beshear said. 
“We need balanced sources of revenue because we have programs that are so important.”
Beshear at his Thursday press conference renewed calls for the legislature to expand pre-kindergarten education to more Kentucky children. 
Republican Senate President Robert Stivers, R-Mancester, told reporters that his caucus is discussing the possibility of approving another income tax cut in 2026 this week.
Stivers noted that in this year’s session the legislature changed the fiscal trigger system to allow for more incremental cuts. The changes allow lawmakers to potentially reduce the income tax rate by less than a half-percentage point. 
But Stivers also said the legislature should follow the “policy and process” it established for deciding when to further reduce the income tax.
“We just want to keep following our policy. If we hit it, we hit it. If we don’t, we don’t. But we follow the policy we set,” Stivers said. 
Stivers spoke alongside other GOP senators in Bardstown where the Senate Republican caucus was meeting. 
House Majority Floor Whip Jason Nemes, R-Louisville, who argued last month that the fiscal triggers were actually met, has said the legislature should move forward with another income tax reduction in 2026, saying state revenues were measured at the wrong time.
Beshear has a history of mixed support for income tax cuts. He signed into law this year the latest half point reduction, going against some Democratic lawmakers who worried it would hamper the state’s ability to offer services in the future. The Democratic governor also signed into a law another reduction in 2023 as he was running for reelection. But he vetoed the  2022 reducing the income tax rate.
The safeguards in the 2022 law were intended to prevent state revenues from quickly plunging and creating a financial crisis — similar to what happened in Kansas when state lawmakers there slashed income taxes  — and instead allow for a more gradual decrease in the income tax rate to zero. 
The state legislature will likely be grappling with less tax revenue to allocate next year in the state budget.
Sen. Chris McDaniel, R-Ryland Heights, the chair of the Senate Appropriations and Revenue Committee, said last month the state will take on a $180 million “hit” because of increased costs for federal food assistance shifted to the state. Congress’ passage of the Republican-backed One Big Beautiful Bill Act this summer shifted more administrative costs for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, which provides nearly 593,000 low-income Kentuckians with funding for food. The amount of SNAP program costs shared with states will also change depending on how often a state makes an error in allocating SNAP benefits for a recipient. 
The Consensus Forecasting Group, a group of economists charged with creating state government revenue forecasts, during its meeting in September projected state revenues would fall over $300 million short of what is budgeted for the new fiscal year that began in July. 
That projected shortfall amounted to approximately a 2% decrease of the more than $15 billion budget for the fiscal year. The chairman of the forecasting group cited uncertainty with trade and tariffs for the revised revenue projection, while Beshear also pointed to decreases in income tax revenue.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Untitled-design-1-1024x576.png,,,2025-12-04 18:58:34.398665

Tim Walz addresses reporters after a budget forecast presentation on Dec. 4, 2025. (Photo by Michelle Griffith/Minnesota Reformer)Minnesota’s finances look good for now, but lawmakers will need to address a future multi-billion dollar budget shortfall, Minnesota budget officials announced Thursday.
The state is currently sitting on a $2.5 billion surplus through June 2027, but could end up nearly $3 billion in the red in the following two years. Minnesota is spending more than it generates in revenue, and slow economic growth and increased special education and health care spending are driving up costs.
Minnesota still has a massive rainy day fund, so policymakers aren’t sounding the most severe alarms about Minnesota budget outlook.
The outlook has improved in the nine months since the state projected a $6 billion deficit in 2028 through 2029, as federal policies so far haven’t greatly impacted the state’s finances.
“Policy changes at the federal level, while concerning and even devastating for some Minnesotans, so far have not had as large an impact on Minnesota’s state budget as we worried that they could’ve back in February,” Minnesota Management and Budget Commissioner Erin Campbell said after a budget presentation.
Minnesota lawmakers last year passed a biennium budget, and they aren’t required to do anything budget-related when they return to the Capitol in February. But lawmakers in off-budget years typically make amendments to the two-year budget in what’s known as a “supplemental budget.”
Gov. Tim Walz told reporters to expect budget adjustments in the upcoming session that include similar cuts made in the last budget, when he tried to curb spending on disability services. Lawmakers will have to make some cuts or raise taxes if they want to make a dent in the projected deficit. The Minnesota House is expected to be 67-67 at the beginning of the session, so any deal would have to be bipartisan.
Although federal prosecutors say scammers have likely been defrauding Minnesota public programs for years, this was the first time fraud was discussed extensively during a budget forecast.
Fraud has captured the attention of President Donald Trump, who has been unleashing anti-Somali bigotry this week while his administration is launching an “intensive immigration enforcement operation” targeting the Somali-American community in Minnesota.
Trump’s renewed focus on Somali immigrants comes following the publication of an article claiming — with little evidence — that Somali-American immigrants accused of defrauding Minnesota’s public programs are providing the money to the terrorist group al-Shaabab.


Rising Medicaid costs drove up spending forecasts
Officials predict Minnesota will spend more on health care and human services in the next four years than previously expected. In 2024 and 2025, the state spent a total of around $21 billion on health and human services. In 2026 and 2027, that number is forecasted to jump to $25.8 billion and then $27.6 billion in the two years after that.
Underscoring Minnesota’s worrisome demographic trends, health and human services is on track to surpass education spending in a few years.
The cost is driven largely by the state’s Medicaid program. Minnesota pays around 36% of Medicaid costs, while the federal government covers the rest. Minnesota is grappling with an aging population in need of more care — Medicaid covers the poor and disabled but also nursing home care for the elderly — as well as rapidly increasing health care costs.
Campbell said that human services fraud or actions from the government on fraud do not factor into their budgeting process at all. In other words, they do not account for the possibility that current efforts to crack down on fraud could help decrease future spending.
She added that Minnesota’s rising costs aren’t because of fraudulent activity: “I would not attribute it to fraud.”
How much Medicaid state money has been defrauded is an open question, though the answer seems to be, at minimum, millions.
Walz said that he expects that a third-party audit of 14 Medicaid programs will give a better picture of how much fraud has affected the state’s finances. He seems to have misunderstood how the audit — first announced via confusingly worded press release — actually works, though.
Optum, a third-party auditor, will review, beginning this month, claims as they are submitted and pause them — for up to 90 days — only if “an anomaly is detected” and needs review, Minnesota’s Department of Human Services has said. Walz indicated incorrectly that the audit shuts down the 14 programs for 90 days, after which, he said, “We’ll get the audits back.”
“We have third-party auditors out there,” said Walz. “We shut the program down for 90 days. We will have the first clear picture, I would argue, in Minnesota history of exactly what the extent of this is.”
The drive in Medicaid spending forecasts is largely from higher costs in direct basic care — think: going to the doctor’s for an injury or illness — which leads to higher fees that governments pay to insurance companies to cover Medicaid recipients.
The other culprit of higher health care spending is long-term care waivers — programs that allow the elderly and disabled to live at home or in group homes and get assistance instead of being institutionalized. DHS is addressing fraud and waste in long-term care by pausing payments for Integrated Community Supports providers, a Medicaid waiver program for disabled adults, as well as hiring Optum to review payments for the 14 Medicaid programs.


Walz vs. Demuth
Officials quickly pointed fingers at who was to blame for a potential future budget deficit. Walz and Democrats, unsurprisingly, blamed Trump. GOP House Speaker Lisa Demuth and Republicans, unsurprisingly, blamed fraud, and, by extension, Walz.
The public received its first glimpse of what is likely to be a combative relationship in the upcoming session between Walz and Demuth. Both are running for governor next year and they both hold high-level positions that will influence the legislative session. Walz and Demuth, even though they won’t admit it, will be using their elected positions to campaign against one another.
Walz said Trump’s policies are to blame for Minnesota’s projected deficit.
“The uncertainty that’s being reflected, the chaos that’s coming out of Washington, the things that are happening there — we can’t control that. But in Minnesota, we can control the ability to do what we do every single year: create good, solid budgets based on factual data,” Walz said.
The governor, who is running for a third, four-year term, began his budget remarks by condemning Trump’s xenophobic remarks about Somali-Americans, whom he called  “garbage.”
Walz then challenged Minnesota Republicans to condemn Trump’s remarks.
Demuth didn’t condemn Trump’s comments about Somali-Americans, but said that “there is not an entire community that is bad and there is not an entire community that is good.” She emphasized that the state needs to hold people defrauding Minnesota’s programs accountable and laid the failure to do that at Walz’s feet.
She also blamed the deficit on the DFL’s 2023-2024 trifecta, when they spent down a $17 billion budget surplus.
“We are, as it has been said by the governor, a very generous state. That doesn’t mean, though, that we should sit back and turn a blind eye when people are taking advantage of Minnesota’s generosity,” Demuth said. “We have, again, both a spending problem and a fraud problem.”
Federal uncertainty puts budget predictions at risk
Federal policies are fleeting, which puts Minnesota’s budget predictions at risk of error. Officials said that uncertainties around trade, tariffs and immigration could impact Minnesota’s economic outlook.
MMB said that even though trade uncertainty has improved since April, tariff levels have frequently shifted. The overall tariff rate is about 18%, and this can create uncertainty for consumer prices and inflation.
The Trump administration’s immigration policies also affect Minnesota’s economy. The state’s unemployment rate rose to 3.6% in August. Without an in-flow of migrants internationally or domestically, Minnesota’s employers might struggle to fill jobs. Some industries are highly dependent on migrants, and costs for employers may go up due to labor shortages.

Relatives still traveled home. Dozens still set up grills and canopies at games. Mississippi Today produced a collection of stories of homecoming events in the Delta, where traditions have evolved over time.
INDIANOLA — Local law enforcement tended to a newly installed checkpoint at Perry S. Price Memorial Stadium. Even with the added security for the Gentry High School homecoming, the line out front of the stadium paled in comparison to the one at the concession stand.
Across the stadium from the field house, which boasts air conditioning, the concessions shack was equipped with an electronic fan whose blades sluggishly propelled air toward the candies and cashier. Familiar candy and hot chip brands were available, but the crowd-pleasers were mostly homemade: popcorn, nachos and, especially, the pickles soaked in Kool-Aid. Kids as young as six clutched cash in one hand and a superhero backpack in the other in a line that stretched to the chain link fence that lined the field’s perimeter. Other parents and teachers stood parallel to the concession line with relatives on the phone, calling their orders from the road. It was a majority of attendees’ first stop during a day of festivities.
Gloria McDuffy Jimison has been making Kool-Aid pickles, also called Koolickles, for Gentry High School homecomings for over two decades. She sometimes makes bucketfuls, at $34 each, for one Chicago family that makes the homecoming trip each year. One repeat customer is a mother who buys 10 bags at most games. 
“They say, ‘Let me taste one.’ And then they’re hooked,” McDuffy Jimison said.
McDuffy Jimison has perfected the recipe. She experimented with adding sugar from Sno Balls snack cakes.

To try a quality Kool-Aid pickle is to taste its slippery sweetness and not be turned off by the vinegar aftertaste. It should be both refreshing and hearty, like a more flavorful, firmer and slippier gummy.
McDuffy Jimison first tasted a Kool-Aid pickle at a homecoming game in Greenville in the early 1990s. At first intrigued by the fare, she soon resolved to make it better. Back then the concession stand offered two longtime Kool-Aid flavors: tropical punch and cherry. McDuffy Jimison serves two clear favorites: cherry and grape.
Kool-Aid pickles originated in the Mississippi Delta. They grew so popular that gas station chain Double Quick, which started in the Delta, began to sell Koolickles in stores. Kool-Aid pickles are most commonly found as pickle spears, but McDuffy Jimison’s version uses hamburger slices. She said they absorb the Kool-Aid sweetness more completely.
“If you don’t want to buy candy, it’s the quickest way to get a sugar rush,” she said, citing customers. 
As the stadium filled up with fans and families, guards moved from the security checkpoint to the bleachers, guns and tactical gear in tow. The crowd of students, faculty and families split as the men in black and navy took their posts around the stadium.

An armed sheriff’s deputy wearing an armored vest stood outside the concession stand. Other deputies with bigger guns and more tactical gear patrolled the grounds. Their presence was a new feature of the homecoming this year. The previous weekend, multiple shootings marred homecoming events across the state. That included a mass shooting after Leland High School’s homecoming.
Officials moved the Gentry High homecoming game from 7 p.m. to 2 p.m., which made for a sweatier experience. Many spectators strode in with umbrellas to shield them from the sun. Others pulled foldable chairs beneath the bleachers. Under the canopies of tents, alumni were happy to be home around familiar faces. The additional security and earlier kickoff time didn’t seem to bother them.
Qua Hollins traveled from Fort Worth, Texas, for homecoming. He hadn’t been back since he graduated from Gentry High seven years ago. Hollins said it was both surreal and rewarding to cheer for the players who once chanted his name and jersey number when he was a Gentry Ram.

“They were little kids,” he said, looking toward the field.
Hollins’ grandmother raised him in a house on a street populated by abandoned homes in a “rough” part of town, he said. Football kept him on campus most of the week.
Hollins’ commute looks different these days. In Fort Worth, he sees high rises and skyscrapers. His work as an engineer puts him in rooms with people from around the world. 
“I used to tell my teammates, especially the younger ones, to look at their surroundings. Remember where you come from. Think bigger,” Hollins said.
Hollins visited his aunt and reconnected with former classmates. He said he now plans to return home more frequently.
“It hasn’t changed at all,” he said of the Delta. “There’s not many places left like that.”",https://mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_3501-1.jpg,,,2025-12-04 18:58:34.398665

Free.,Federal appeals court extends National Guard presence in D.C.,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/federal-appeals-court-extends-national-guard-presence-dc,,"WASHINGTON — A federal appeals court Thursday paused a lower court’s order to remove the National Guard from the streets of Washington, D.C., eight days after two members were attacked in broad daylight in the district.The three-judge panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit granted the Trump administration’s request that the Nov. 20 decision finding the Guard presence illegal to be stayed “pending further order of this court.” “The purpose of this administrative stay is to give the court sufficient opportunity to consider the motion for stay pending appeal and should not be construed in any way as a ruling on the merits of that motion,” wrote Judges Patricia Millett, Gregory Katsas and Neomi Rao.Millett was appointed by former President Barack Obama, and Katsas and Rao were appointed during President Donald Trump’s first term.Roughly 2,000 National Guard troops in D.C. were originally expected to remain in the district through February, according to the lower court’s order.Appeal considered after shootingThe stay comes just over a week after two West Virginia National Guard members were shot on Nov. 26 just blocks from the White House. U.S. Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom, 20, died from her injuries the following day, Thanksgiving. U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, underwent surgery for critical injuries and remains hospitalized.The suspected shooter, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, a 29-year-old Afghan national who was living in Washington state, pleaded not guilty from his hospital bed during a virtual hearing in D.C. Superior Court Tuesday. Lakanwal is charged with first-degree murder while armed,  possession of a firearm, and assault with the intent to kill. The Trump administration filed the emergency motion to stay the lower judge’s order on the day of the shooting. The administration requested the circuit court issue a decision by Dec. 4.Judge Jia Cobb, for the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, found the administration’s deployment of more than 2,000 guard troops in the city illegal but stayed her Nov. 20 decision until Dec. 11 to give the administration time to appeal and remove the guard members from the district’s streets.Guard armedTrump initially mobilized 800 National Guard troops to the nation’s capital in August after claiming a “crime emergency” in the district, despite a documented three-decade low in crime.Many were instructed they would be carrying service weapons, The Wall Street Journal reported on Aug. 17. The White House effort was accompanied by a heightened U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement presence in the district.Trump also federalized the district's police force for 30 days as part of a district-wide crackdown. While the federalization of the police force expired, Trump has kept the National Guard in the district.Since then, Republican governors from Louisiana, Ohio, South Carolina and West Virginia, among others, have agreed to send their own Guard members to the district. The mobilization had been tied up in court for months.",,,,2025-12-04 18:58:34.398665

The ruling by Judge Shane Vannatta said that the a minor, known […]","A sample of a Montana driver's license on the MVD website. A Missoula County District Court ruled that the state’s refusal to issue a driver’s license to a nonbinary minor violates the Montana Constitution and that attorneys for the Montana Attorney General’s Office also misinterpreted state law by refusing the license based on sex.
The ruling by Judge Shane Vannatta said that the a minor, known as “M.B.,” has a birth certificate that says “nonbinary,” but state officials refused to issue a license — forcing M.B., to declare either “male” or “female,” which they refuse.
The judge said the state had the ability to issue a driver’s license to M.B., but instead refused to do so because it wouldn’t accommodate the nonbinary status, therefore discriminating against the minor, solely based on sex. M.B. had otherwise completed all the requirements to obtain a license, according to court records.
In his ruling, Vannatta said the Department of Motor Vehicles (and its parent division, the Montana Department of Justice) is prohibited from denying driver’s licenses to residents based upon their legal sex.
Originally, attorneys for the state had argued M.B. had failed to complete the application, and therefore it couldn’t process it because M.B., would not choose between male and female. Moreover, the state had also argued the software system would only produce a license if one of the two options was selected.
The case began as a Montana Human Rights Bureau complaint. During the investigation conducted by it, a hearing officer determined that the state had indeed discriminated against M.B, but attorneys for the state appealed to the Montana Human Rights Commission, five members of the public selected by the governor, in this case, Gov. Greg Gianforte, a Republican. That commission ruled in favor of the state, overturning the hearing officer, because it stated M.B. had not completed the application in full.
However, Vannatta ruled members had misconstrued the statutes regarding licensing drivers in Montana which requires the legal name, date of birth, and sex. The judge said the birth certificate listed M.B. as nonbinary and is the document that gives the legal name and date of birth.
“The DOJ does not cite to law that only an applicant that can indicate that they are either male or female is a ‘qualified’ applicant,” Vannatta said.
Furthermore, Montana law defines who may not be issued a driver’s license, and nonbinary is not included, court documents said.
“Whether the Motor Vehicles Division could enter M.B.’s ‘sex’ information of nonbinary into the (software system) is not determinative of M.B’s qualification as an applicant,” the court ruling said. “M.B. accurately completed the form. It was the MVD that did not accept the nonbinary designation (M.B.’s legal sex) and that did not enter the information in the system.”
Vannatta said the case raised constitutional issues as well, namely equal protection of the law.
“The equal protection clause requires that ‘all persons be treated alike under like circumstances,’” Vannatta said. “…The State of Montana issued M.B., a birth certificate with designation of nonbinary. Then the DMV denied M.B., the ability to obtain a driver’s license when they listed their legal sex as nonbinary while, at the same time allowing applicants who list their legal sex as either male or female to obtain a driver’s license.
“This is arbitrary and discriminatory state action that does not treat all applicants for a driver’s license under like circumstances and therefore it is unlawful under Montana’s equal protection clause.”
Vannatta also cited Montana law which said a government agency cannot deny a license or charter due to a person’s sex.
“The plain language of the statutes is that it is unlawful discriminatory practice for the state to deny a person privileges because of sex unless based on reasonable grounds,” Vannatta said.
The judge said the state has no reasonable grounds for denying a driver license based on sex, and indeed, having different options — male and female — proves that sex is not a reasonable ground to deny a license.
Subsequently, the state argued that changing the software would cost an estimated $50,000 to add other options. Vannatta’s order noted that since the case began, Montana had switched software systems. During the bidding process, it had the option of making the change, but still declined. It now said it would cost between $30,000 and $40,000 to make the change to the sex category, even though the entire software system was reported at $100,000.
Vannatta also awarded M.B., and their parents, attorney’s fees and costs as part of the lawsuit.
The Montana Attorney General’s Office did not respond to requests for comment before publication, including whether it planned to appeal the decision to the Montana Supreme Court, the state’s only appellate court.
“Transgender and nonbinary people should not be forced to choose choose inaccurate gender markers, while cisgender residents face no such barriers,” said American Civil Liberties Union Executive Director Akilah Deernose. “Today, the court agreed that the practice of gender identity discrimination violates our constitution and our state Human Rights Act by unlawfully singling out transgender and nonbinary Montanans for unequal treatment.”

Border Patrol sweeps began this week Southeast Louisiana as part of the Trump administration’s Operation Catahoula Crunch. (Photo by Christiana Botic/Verite News and Catchlight Local/Report for America)NEW ORLEANS — The Louisiana Attorney General’s office and Louisiana State Police say a new state law that criminalizes any act intended to “hinder, delay, prevent, or otherwise interfere with or thwart federal immigration enforcement efforts” will not be used to prosecute speech, such as guidance on how to respond to immigration enforcement agents during raids and arrests.
The assertion came in response to a lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana on behalf of the Immigration Services and Legal Advocacy, which argued that the law, passed earlier this year, is overly vague and could be used to criminalize protected speech, such as “know-your-rights” trainings and presentations, in violation of the First Amendment. Civil rights groups and, as of this week, even the New Orleans City Council, have offered such guidance in response to operation “Catahoula Crunch,” the stepped-up immigration enforcement action that began on Wednesday.
As written, Act 399 of 2025 does not specify which acts could be interpreted as interfering with immigration enforcement. It purports to criminalize “any act” that could “hinder, delay, prevent, or otherwise interfere with or thwart federal immigration enforcement efforts” with penalties of as much as $5,000 in fines and a year behind bars.
“This case is about the State of Louisiana’s unlawful attempts to use the threat of vague and overbroad felony charges to silence the residents of New Orleans, Louisiana, from speaking out about the rights of immigrants during the federal operation dubbed ‘Catahoula Crunch’ or ‘Operation Swamp Sweep,’” the ACLU’s complaint said.
When news broke last month that hundreds of Border Patrol agents would be deployed to the New Orleans area, ISLA — which provides pro bono legal services to people in immigration detention — began receiving a large number of requests for know-your-rights training sessions. Such sessions typically offer legal guidance on how to assert your constitutional rights, including the right to remain silent or to demand a search warrant, in the event that a federal immigration officer stops you or comes knocking at your door.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
But the group recently stopped providing such trainings, according to the suit, out of fear that they could face arrest — or that their advice could make others vulnerable to criminal prosecution — under the new obstruction law.
The group cited a series of statements from Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill in recent weeks warning that the law could be used against people who oppose or challenge immigration enforcement agents.
However, in a Thursday court filing Murrill’s office said that the law does not cover “pure speech” such as know-your-rights presentations. According to the filing, the law was intended to prevent “violent scenes where defendants have physically inhibited a law-enforcement officer from carrying out his duties.”
“There’s an understanding and agreement as to how this statute will be applied and that it will not be applied to violate your client’s constitutional rights,” U.S. District Judge Nanette Jolivette Brown said on Thursday, at the end of a court hearing.
The subject of the hearing was a request from ISLA and the ACLU for the judge to issue a temporary restraining order prohibiting the defendants — Murill’s office, the Orleans Parish District Attorney’s Office, the New Orleans Police Department and the Louisiana State Police — from using the law to prosecute know-your-rights trainings.
Jolivette Brown did not rule on the motion on Thursday, but the plaintiffs said Murrill’s assurances constituted a victory.
“ This is a win today,” said Nora Ahmed, the legal director of the ACLU of Louisiana. “That filing that is now in the record is a win. No matter what happens to this case, that filing sits there, that filing now becomes the manner in which this law is going to be used, and it provides necessary clarity to so many people.”
According to Ahmed, a number of community organizations submitted a letter to Murrill’s office last week asking for clarity on how the state law would be used. According to Ahmed, that clarity wasn’t offered until the state’s filing on Thursday.
“What we ended seeing this morning was something you don’t see often … which was that the Attorney General as a defendant in this case, and also defendant Hodges, who is the head of the Louisiana State Police, ultimately agreed that the law would not be used to prosecute ISLA in any way as it relates to their trainings and presentations,” Ahmed said.
“Importantly, they went even further than that and they actually provided some very important and critical parameters around the law,” Ahmed added. “And those parameters included that the law was ultimately, apparently conceived for addressing violent conduct. And that particular understanding on the part of the people of New Orleans and the state of Louisiana is critical because now they can engage freely in protest activities.”
Asked for comment, a spokesperson for the Louisiana Attorney General’s Office referred Verite News to a social media post from Murrill. In the post, Murrill said that the ACLU of Louisiana had “filed a lawsuit over nothing—there is no First Amendment problem with Act 399” and that her office was grateful that the court had declined to issue a temporary restraining order, as initially requested.

(Photo by Caity Coyne/West Virginia Watch)Proceedings wrapped Thursday for a hearing regarding a requested appeal of the Department of Environmental Protection’s Air Quality Board’s decision to grant a permit to Fundamental Data for the construction of a natural gas power plant in Tucker County.
The request for an appeal came from the three organizations — the West Virginia Highlands Conservancy, the Sierra Club and Tucker United, a grassroots organization that formed in Tucker County earlier this year to fight against the power plant as well as the proposed data center that it could one day power.
The citizen groups — represented by Mike Becher, a senior attorney with Appalachian Mountain Advocates — requested the appeal in September. In filings to the board, they allege generally that the permit granted to Fundamental Data in August fails to meet standards set by the state’s Air Pollution Control Act. 
The citizens cited numerous specific objections to the permit. The most pressing objection questions the DEP’s determination that the proposed project qualifies as a “minor” source of pollution, which means it would be subject to laxer regulations regarding emissions. In filings, the organizations question whether this designation from the Air Quality Board was “arbitrary, capricious or otherwise contrary to the law given the ability (and likelihood) of the facility to operate well above the limits established …” Other similarly sized and operated power plants, they continue, are “typically” permitted as “major sources.”
The proposed power plant would use gas-fueled turbines with heat recovery steam generators to operate, according to Fundamental Data’s permit application. Diesel would be kept on site in three 10 million gallon storage tanks as a backup power source in case of gas line interruptions. Those tanks would be 66 feet tall and 180 feet in diameter. Leaks from pumps and valves, among other pieces of equipment, are to be expected per the application. Operations for the facility should begin by 2028.
Annually, the facility would have the potential to emit 99 tons of nitrogen oxides, 56 tons of carbon monoxide and 44 tons of volatile organic compounds.
And aside from the emissions, the complex — once completed — could take up more than 10,000 acres between the outdoor tourism-dependent towns of Thomas and Davis.
The citizen groups have argued that heavy redactions within the permit application used to calculate potential annual emissions make it impossible for the public to understand the “practical effect” of the actual emissions.
Fundamental Data — which acted as an intervenor in the appeal case — has said these redactions are necessary due to the information being “confidential business information.” Earlier this year, the DEP agreed that the company met standards that allow it to keep that information secret.
Last month, the Air Quality Board  — a type of judicial panel responsible for ruling in these kinds of cases — issued a protective order allowing some of the redacted information to be made available to parties in the appeal case. Anyone who was allowed access to the information, per the order, was required to destroy it upon completion of the hearing. That order came after a previous board hearing was held in the case in November. 
This week, discussion of the redacted information was kept under seal during the proceedings, meaning the public still was not able to hear any arguments or testimony regarding its contents. Redacted information in the case includes emissions data, the number and size of the turbines that will be on site and details regarding the make and model of some equipment.
In their appeal, the citizen groups are essentially asking the board  to revoke Fundamental Data’s permit and make information that was used to grant the permit in the first place available to the public.
The hearing took place from Wednesday into Thursday morning, with numerous witnesses ranging from Tucker County residents and local political leaders to engineers familiar with the technical aspects of the proposed project.
‘We deserve to know those basic things’: Residents speak out against permit
Taking the stand Wednesday morning, Canaan Valley resident Amy Margolies told members of the board she lives about an eight minute drive from where the proposed power plant would be located. She said she moved to West Virginia — and specifically the Canaan Valley region — in June 2016 to be closer to nature.
“I moved here to be in the outdoors, in this great area and in a small community with tight relationships, a place where you don’t have to lock your car,” Margolies said. “… I think anyone who has been to Canaan Valley or Blackwater Falls, Davis or Thomas knows how much of a gem this area is. It’s really special in the United States and even with the state of West Virginia.”
A mother of two and with a background in public health, Margolies said she’s acutely concerned about her family’s health and what could happen if this power plant is built less than two miles from her 5-year-old son’s school, where she coaches his soccer team.
“There is information in my brain from my education and my experience that makes me legitimately concerned for my children, for my family,” Margolies said. “… I have health issues in my family that provide certain vulnerabilities. We all know that comorbidities can be a concern for many people. For children, the elderly — air quality is a huge part of that, and exposure over a period of time is really a concern.”
Recently, she said, her husband who is in his early 40s suffered a pulmonary embolism. Since chronic exposure to air pollution — specifically from fine particulate matter and nitrogen oxides — has been linked to increased risks of blood clots, she said she’s concerned about what having those emissions in the air around their home would mean for him.
“That’s something I can’t stop thinking about,” she said. 
Margolies, in response to questions from Becher, told the board that the redactions in the air quality permit application have made it difficult for her and her neighbors to gauge the real risk that could come with this power plant. Essentially, she said, they’ve been asked to trust a company — Fundamental Data — that has refused to work with or hear directly from concerned residents.
“… Basically what we’re being told here as the public is that we should take someone else’s word [that this is safe],” Margolies said. “I don’t even know this person. We’ve invited this person to our community, and they won’t come and I’m just really concerned. Why should I take someone else’s word for it, when they won’t even tell us, in plain words, with basic information, how tall will smokestacks be?”
She said that if the power plant becomes reality and if no effort is made to allow community members to know more about its operations, she will have to strongly reconsider moving her family.
“It would break my heart, but I can’t allow my children to be exposed to that risk,” Margolies said. “… I think, as a mom, we deserve to know those basic things, because I coach soccer right there [and] I moved here for my child to play soccer in front of a forest, not in the shadow of a smoke stack. I think we deserve the minimum amount of information to understand how that will impact our lives.”
Davis Mayor Alan Tomson took the stand following Margolies. Tomson told the board that he did have concerns over the proposed power plant and was put off by the way the project came to be. The decisions and actions by Fundamental Data, he said, made it difficult to fully trust the company or understand how his community could change if the power plant and data center complex were built.
Tomson said he only learned of the project when a resident called to inform him of a notice in the local newspaper. From there, he said, it was difficult to get further information and the redactions in the air quality permit application made the true scope of the project hard to grasp.
He told the board that he would have felt more confident without those redactions. It’s not right, he said, that worries from residents aren’t being treated seriously and he himself holds grave concerns over how the operation could impact his town’s tourism revenue, quality of life and more.
Marilyn Shoenfeld, a Davis resident who serves as board president for the West Virginia Highlands Conservancy, echoed the concerns of Tomson and Margolies. Shoenfeld said she’s lived in Tucker County since 2007. Now, almost two decades later, she still greatly enjoys and takes advantage of the outdoor recreation opportunities around her.
“We moved here because of clean air, the healthy environment, the natural resources, the protected public lands, the availability of hiking, of access to Dolly Sods and the wonderful small towns of Davis and Thomas,” Shoenfeld said. “My concern is that the air quality will be deteriorated, and that it will affect the various habitats and environments, including the Canaan Valley National Wildlife refuge … as well as the towns of Davis and Thomas.”
She also worries that emissions — even if they don’t exceed the levels listed in the air quality permit application — will impact her health. Further, she said, it’s been impossible to accurately gauge what the effect will be from the development since critical information is redacted.
“The permit was so thoroughly redacted that you really could not tell what was going on,” Shoenfeld said. 
In an effort to learn more, Shoenfeld said the Highlands Conservancy offered to hold a meeting with Fundamental Data in Canaan Valley. The company, she said, refused. The organization then proposed to produce and pay for dispersion modeling to learn more about how the emissions and potential haze from the facility would spread. Again, she said, they were turned down.
Without knowing more, Shoenfeld said she would feel better seeing the project dedicated as a major source so it would be subject to higher regulations and testing standards.
The efficacy of potential annual emissions
Ron Sahu, a mechanical engineer with a Ph.D. in coal combustion from Caltech, was next to testify in the hearing, taking the stand as an expert witness.
Sahu told the board that he’s consulted on many air quality permits nationwide and was surprised to see that the application from Fundamental Data was for a “minor” pollution source. He said that while he understands that’s the preference of the company, it’s difficult for him to understand how that would work in practice, especially given the size and scope of the power plant.
Sahu also said he’s dealt with hundreds of air quality permits in his line of work and had never seen redactions allowed to the extent that they have been in this application. While Sahu was allowed to view and testify upon redacted information in a closed session for the hearing, the information was not able to be discussed publicly.
Based on his own scaling and calculations, Sahu testified publicly that it’s unlikely the emissions from the power plant would remain within the limits provided on Fundamental Data’s permit application.
There is too much variability, he continued, to say with any confidence that emissions would not exceed the standards that define a “minor” or “major” source. He used examples of how weather could impact how hot fuel is burnt, changes to emissions during start-up and shut-downs of a cycle and the kind of gas — methane or diesel — that would be used at different times. 
Without more specifics, he said, there’s no guarantee that emissions would be capped where they need to be.
“So this is a permit by algebra, and it means nothing because the variability can overwhelm you,” Sahu said. 
Sahu said the decision to treat this plant as a minor source and not doing major source modeling — especially without having continuous emissions monitoring, which is not required of the project — is giving misleading results. 
“You are pretending here that you can actually demonstrate that you will be below the major source threshold, but even under the best of times, even if you had continuous monitoring — and here you don’t even have that — you’re truly flying blind,” Sahu said.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced that its operation is targeting “criminal illegal aliens.”
The Associated Press initially reported in November that 250 Border Patrol agents would conduct immigration sweeps in Louisiana and Mississippi starting Dec. 1. The operation will last two months and DHS plans to arrest 5,000 people, according to the AP.
The threat of increased immigration enforcement has created unease for New Orleans’ service industry, which relies on immigrant workers. Restaurants and other hospitality businesses are facing the possibility that they might be targeted by federal agents in raids and other enforcement operations. For hospitality workers who are vulnerable, going to work poses the risk of being arrested.
“I can’t even imagine the [question] of, ‘Do I go to work and risk being taken, or do I stay home and not make money and then my family suffers.’ That is such a crazy choice to have to make,” said Jolie Gautreau, a bartender at Blue Oak BBQ.

Immigration sweeps in Chicago created staffing shortages and safety concerns, according to reporting from Block Club Chicago. In Charlotte, it brought widespread fear among restaurant employees and patrons, the Charlotte Observer reported.
“I’m just hoping it’s not as bad as we’re all concerned about. I don’t have high hopes for that, though, based on what we’ve already seen elsewhere,” Gautreau said.
At least one restaurant has closed its doors in response to the heightened enforcement in New Orleans when Taqueria Guerrero, a Mexican restaurant in Mid-City, announced on Sunday (Nov. 30) that it would temporarily close as to not put anyone at risk.

“I think it’s fair to say that what makes the New Orleans dining scene as a whole so incredibly unique is being threatened,” said Kristin Sparks, co-owner of Annunciation Restaurant.
Latino communities have been most targeted by federal immigration sweeps in other cities. The same is expected in New Orleans.
In 2024, 14% of the population in metro New Orleans was Hispanic, according to census data cited in a report from The Data Center. Nine percent of New Orleans’ population was Hispanic, and Jefferson Parish had the highest Hispanic population at 20%. Hispanics accounted for the vast majority of growth in the metro area from 2010-20, according to the report.
Hispanic workers made up 15.7% of workers in greater New Orleans’ service industry in 2024, according to the Louisiana Workforce Commission.
“New Orleans is basically a melting pot, and so the contributions that they lend to our community, whether it’s, you know, in the workforce or in our culture and our food. I mean, they play a vital role in that,” Sparks said.
Sparks said she hasn’t received much guidance from elected officials, the New Orleans Police Department, or hospitality industry leaders on how to prepare for law enforcement potentially targeting restaurants.
New Orleans & Company, the city’s marketing arm for tourism, sent a statement to its hospitality members on Nov. 19 addressing the impending crackdown. The statement emphasized that New Orleans is accustomed to local, state and federal law enforcement coordinating their efforts.
“New Orleans is committed to being a safe and welcoming city for our residents and visitors.  Many crime statistics are at record lows and we applaud the ongoing efforts of the NOPD, Louisiana State Police and all the other local, regional, state and federal partners that support their efforts,” New Orleans & Company President and CEO Walt Leger said in the statement.
“Local businesses and organizations are required to comply with the lawful requests of law enforcement officials, including CBP and ICE agents, but it is ok to ask what agency they represent and validate their credentials,” Leger added.
Restaurants are preparing for the possibility that federal agents could enter their establishment to conduct an audit of its employees or carry out a raid.
When Caitlin Carney, owner at Porgy’s Seafood Market, first heard reports about federal agents coming to the city, she was initially uncertain how to prepare and protect her employees who could be vulnerable.
She considered joining other businesses by putting signs in the windows saying that ICE and other federal agents aren’t welcome inside, or that immigrants are safe in their restaurants.

“At first I was like, I didn’t want to put anything up outside because, like, I didn’t want to be encouraging any entry [by agents]. I wasn’t really sure, and so I was just putting up ‘do not enter’ signs and making sure everybody had protocol in their pockets,” Carney said.
But she was encouraged to post signs as a show of unity. She also received guidance from the Immigrant Legal Resource Center on how to prepare for a visit from federal agents.
“They gave me a lot of facts about what’s legal and what’s not, and what’s working in other cities and what’s not, and also I was then able to have them tell my Spanish speaking employees exactly what they told me, so that it was very, very clear,” Carney said.
Others have taken a tougher stance against federal agents potentially entering their establishments.
“We’re instructed not to let them in the building, not to serve them any food. They’re not allowed in here, they’re not welcome in here,” said Shawn Clark, a manager at Toups’ Meatery.
The Louisiana Restaurant Association published a news release addressing potential immigration enforcement at businesses. The release said that federal agents can legally enter public areas such as dining rooms, but cannot enter back-of-house areas like kitchens without a judicial warrant. LRA says agents will likely request I-9 forms and employers should be prepared to present them upon request.
“Business owners and managers should know their rights and be prepared to document any interactions with enforcement agents,” the news release said.
Guidelines published in January by the National Restaurant Association’s Law Center outline how hospitality establishments can prepare for heightened immigration enforcement, specifically from Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
The organization encouraged employers to be in I-9 compliance and establish a rapid response plan in the event of an ICE visit. It said that if enforcement occurs, it’s likely that law enforcement will only initiate an audit of employees. In this case, it said employers should contact legal counsel immediately and gather and verify documents.
If a raid occurs, the organization suggests that employers request a warrant from agents, and to monitor but not interfere with the raid.
Protests in opposition to the operation have already begun in New Orleans. Mass ICE arrests have recently occurred in New Orleans at the Lowe’s on Elysian Field on Dec. 3, at a Home Depot in Gretna on Nov. 26 and at a boat launch in Kenner on Nov. 8.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — A member of a governing board said Thursday he won’t recuse himself after a utility company complained he was biased against them. 
Corporation Commissioner Todd Hiett said he was simply doing his job and that his fellow, and future, commissioners should be concerned if a utility is trying to silence a member of the board. 
Oklahoma Gas & Electric Company, or OG&E, requested that Hiett recuse himself from a case that would allow the company to expand its power generation sites because of “unacceptable bias” against the utility.
The Oklahoma Corporation Commission is a three-person statewide elected board that regulates the state’s oil and gas, utility and transportation industries.
In a November filing, OG&E attorney Chase Snodgrass said Hiett called OG&E “evil” and a monopoly spreading “propaganda.”
At a Corporation Commission meeting Thursday, Hiett said he won’t apologize for “doing his job.”
“I find it to be very disturbing that a regulated utility would take action to intimidate and squelch the voice of one of its regulators, for simply doing his job,” Hiett said. “I think rate payers will be outraged, and rightly so, to find out that a monopoly utility of which they are captive customers is using bullying tactics in an effort to cut off the voice of the regulators charged with ensuring reasonable cost of electricity.”
He said OG&E sent out mailers with “propaganda” to ratepayers. OG&E has denied sending mailers. 
“I’ve done my job and I cannot, I will not, apologize for doing what my oath of office and the state Constitution requires of us, and that is to provide oversight of regulated monopoly rates,” Hiett said.
Snodgrass attempted to respond to Hiett’s comments twice at Thursday’s meeting, but was denied. Hiett said the agenda item was “his posting” so OG&E’s attorney would not be recognized. 
Kim David, chair of the commission, told Snodgrass that OG&E could file a written response.
OG&E attorneys declined to comment after the meeting, instead referring questions to their communications division. 
Christi Woodworth, vice president of marketing and communications for OG&E, said in a statement that the company has “confidence” that the other commissioners will support the projects for “much-needed generation capacity.” 
“Commissioner Hiett’s attacks even today clearly demonstrate an unacceptable bias against and hostility towards the company, which is why OG&E was forced to request his recusal,” she said. “Commissioner Hiett did not deny any allegations made against him.”

DemasTwo days out from their next scheduled meeting, members of Michigan’s energy regulatory body held an online comment session regarding a set of proposed contracts between one of the state’s largest energy companies and a massive data center slated for construction in Washtenaw County. 
Shortly after the announcement that the controversial project – spearheaded by ChatGPT creator OpenAI, tech giant Oracle and developer Related Digital – would move forward in Saline Township, DTE Energy filed a request with the Michigan Public Service Commission seeking approval of two contracts to supply 1.4 gigawatts of power to the facility.
The utility requested ex parte approval of both contracts, which would allow the deal to move forward without public hearing requirements. However, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel filed a request to intervene in the case, as did several environmental and consumer advocacy groups, asking the public safety commission to treat the matter as a contested case, allowing different parties to intervene, request discovery and file testimony for the commission to review before making a decision on the contracts.
While DTE argues its request would not increase rates for existing customers, making it eligible for expedited approval, Nessel along with several other intervenors have called that claim into question, demanding an opportunity to further review the proposal and ensure DTE ratepayers will not face extra  costs as the company supplies power to the facility.
Though the commission has yet to make a decision on whether to allow a contested case, it did host an online public comment period Wednesday evening. While Nessel criticized the move noting that without a contested case declaration the forum would “amount to little more than performative listening” she noted in a statement following the forum that the commission can consider comments offered at the forum and online in its decision on whether to open the case up to scrutiny – but not in approving or denying the contracts. 
“It is overwhelmingly clear from both the comments shared tonight and the majority of the nearly 5,000 public comments submitted online that Michigan’s residents share in our concerns and demand transparency,” Nessel said. “I again urge the [commission] to listen to the people of this State, to whom they should feel dutybound to represent and defend, to do the right thing and deny DTE’s request to approve these special contracts without a full, contested hearing.”
Ahead of the meeting, a group of 23 Democratic lawmakers sent a letter to Commission Chair Dan Scripps opposing DTE’s request to fast track approval while asking Scripps to move forward with a hearing on the matter.
“Expert witness testimony is necessary to ensure that information provided to the [commission] is accurate and that the proposed contracts do not harm ratepayers and the people of this state,” the letter reads. “The [commission] cannot make an informed and fair decision in this matter without conducting a contested proceeding.”
Among the comments submitted to the commission – many of which are in opposition to DTE’s approval request, or the data center in general – Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer submitted her own comments in support of the multibillion dollar project, which her office has touted as the “largest investment in Michigan history.”
“Right now, time is of the essence. There is a shortage of global computing capacity, and China is moving aggressively to build their own centers and get a leg up on America. At the same time, other states are moving fast too, competing against Michigan to land similar projects with far less oversight,” Whitmer said in her comment. “This is a matter of national security and economic competitiveness, and if we do not act, it will cost us thousands of jobs and billions of dollars of investment in our economy.”
According to DTE’s application, the project will create 2,500 construction jobs and 450 permanent jobs on-site. 
DTE has asked the commission to make a decision on its requests by Dec. 5. Though the Commission is slated to meet on Friday, the agenda it shared Thursday afternoon does not list the special contracts as an item for consideration.
With another large energy company, Consumers Energy, recently receiving approval from the commission to adjust its rate structure for facilities demanding large amounts of energy – like data centers – DTE’s attorneys argue regulators do not need to engage in another contested case as the terms of its contracts are “equally protective” as those laid out in the Consumers case. 
Nessel, however, remains skeptical, arguing the company fails to implement terms required by the Consumers Energy case, while criticizing its application for offering “insufficient explanation of ratepayer impacts.” She also slammed the company for heavy redactions in the publicly available version of the contract.
“DTE continues to push for a rubber-stamp approval of a secret deal, but time and again, my office has contested their filings – and time after time, the utility has shown it is not a trustworthy partner, routinely filling cases with unjustified costs,” Nessel said. “We must be able to scrutinize DTE’s ability to sell this massive amount of electricity without negatively impacting residents. No matter how DTE tries to explain it away, this case – involving hundreds of millions of dollars in costs just to connect the data center to DTE’s power grid – should be treated as contested like any other.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/IMG_3478-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-04 17:59:39.308220

(Photo by Kenneth Zirkel/Courtesy of Brown University)Dr. Ashish Jha — one of the most recognizable public health experts during the COVID-19 pandemic, and at one point a leader of the federal response to the virus — is leaving his post at Brown University’s School of Public Health. 
Jha will step down at the end of December to spearhead “an initiative that aims to bolster the nation’s defenses against emerging pandemic and biological threats,” the school announced Thursday. The unnamed initiative will continue the work Jha started in April 2022 as the White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator.
But that was all the information available Thursday about Jha’s new venture.
“At this time there are no additional details to be shared on what he is doing next,” Rob Hancock, a spokesperson for the School of Public Health, said in an email.
Jha said in emailed comments Thursday evening that his new venture will be informed by his time at Brown and as a face of the federal response to COVID — experiences which taught him how to communicate public health challenges to non-scientists.
“That starts with recognizing that communication is a two way street,” Jha said. “It’s easy to think about what we want to say but it’s more important to understand what questions people have and how we can meet their needs with clear, reliable information.”

In the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, Jha was among the most public-facing health experts. Jha told STAT News in 2021 that at his busiest, he was making between 10 and 12 TV appearances a day, which amounted to thousands of appearances overall.  
Jha took temporary leave from Brown to work at the White House. Jha was the third coronavirus response coordinator, following Jeff Zients, who was also appointed by Biden, and Deborah Birx, who was appointed by President Donald Trump in his first term.
Jha has continued to think about health care in a federal context, especially during the second iteration of the Trump administration. In recent months, Jha has published opinion pieces in the Boston Globe and he continues to write A Moment in Health, a blog on Substack about public health issues. Posts have explored issues like “What Should We Learn from an Anti-Vaccine Conference?” and “The real danger isn’t Tylenol, it’s bad information.”
Jha’s essay on the latter was meant to counter U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s comments linking over-the-counter pain relievers to autism. Jha joined the chorus of scientists and medical professionals who discredited Kennedy’s comments, and added that Kennedy’s “insinuation” was “false and profoundly cruel.”
In another piece he criticized Kennedy for “openly and consistently disregard[ing] scientific evidence.” 
The pandemic’s successes in public policy, Jha wrote, “came from effectively and respectfully pursuing the scientific process.” 
“Even the pandemic’s most controversial policy — vaccine mandates — was reasonable in April 2021, when health experts believed that vaccination would prevent most infections and transmission, but certainly did not make sense by April 2023, when we knew that vaccinations had only a modest impact on transmission,” Jha wrote.
Still, Jha remains an advocate for vaccines as a necessary instrument for public health, especially mRNA vaccines, which he described in an August essay as “the technology best positioned to defend its people against future biological threats.”
Jha’s new gig comes amid changes in national Health and Human Services policy initiatives under Kennedy, changes that often directly contrast Jha’s own public assertions about health policy. The most recent example is an attempt to tweak hepatitis vaccine guidance for infants by rolling back universal shots for newborns. A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention committee meeting Thursday to decide whether to change the guidance postponed the vote until Friday. 
Kennedy’s office has also tried to limit COVID-19 vaccine recommendations and mRNA vaccine development by cancelling contracts and solicitations.  
Contemporaneous with Jha’s pandemic experience was his five-year tenure at Brown. Jha arrived right around the same time that COVID hit, and in the subsequent years, Jha oversaw growth in enrollment and the launch of a new School of Public Health space in Providence plus a satellite location in Washington, D.C. 
“His legacy at Brown will be his cultivation of high-impact initiatives that improve the health and lives of millions of people around the world,” Brown President Christina H. Paxson said in a statement Thursday. “We have strengthened our reputation for leveraging data and science to develop solutions to complex public health challenges.”
Graduate student enrollment at the School of Public Health has more than doubled since 2020 under Jha’s tenure, according to Brown.
Dr. Francesca L. Beaudoin, a professor of epidemiology and emergency medicine, will serve as the public health school’s interim dean starting Jan. 1, according to Brown. The School of Public Health includes 150 faculty, 800 graduate and undergrad students, and 13 research centers. It receives about $90 million in outside funding annually.

(Photo by Tim Lambert/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)An automatic cost of living adjustment bumped state lawmakers’ salaries to $113,000 per year, for rank and file members. 
According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, Pennsylvania legislators are among the highest paid in the country. The average pay for a state lawmaker nationally is $47,904, but that includes part-time legislatures.
The commonwealth’s legislature is full-time, convening in Harrisburg throughout the year. This year, there were 75 scheduled session days for House members, with three more on the calendar for later this month. The Senate met for 51 days, and has two more scheduled for before the year ends.
The raises are doled out automatically each year based on consumer price metrics. Legislation enacting the cost-of-living raises was enacted in 1995 and, as it stands, the pay bumps do not require a vote by lawmakers. Though some would like to change the practice.

In a now-infamous episode, lawmakers voted on a raise for themselves in 2005, during a 2 a.m. session. Legislators would have received raises of between 16% and 34%, depending on their position. However, the law was ultimately repealed. There was significant backlash from the public, and it resulted in a tidal wave of resignations and reelection losses.
A number of bills have been introduced over the years that would get rid of the automatic raise, including several this year. One introduced this session is sponsored by Rep. Stephanie Borowicz (R-Clinton).
Another introduced by Sen. Lisa Baker (R-Luzerne) in January would allow lawmakers to refuse their cost-of-living wage.
Rep. Jeremy Shaffer (R-Allegheny) introduced a bill that would suspend automatic pay raises for legislators, the governor and the lieutenant governor any year that a budget is not passed by the constitutional deadline.
This year’s budget, which was due on June 30, was passed on Nov. 12.
“I think it’s completely unacceptable that it’s become the norm that our budget is late,” Shaffer said. “There needs to be some consequences”

Shaffer, who was elected on a reform platform that included support for term limits, also opposes the automatic raises more broadly. Moreover, he would like to see the legislature changed a full-time one to a part-time. 
As it stands, state lawmakers have a handful of session days scheduled every month, and often spend the rest of their time performing constituent outreach. Generally, a part-time legislature meets for one fixed block of time, spending weeks or months in the capital each year, to pass a budget and any new policies. The pay, too, is reflective of a part-time job, and many lawmakers hold other jobs.
“It helps people stay more focused,” Shaffer said. “And it helps when they return to their districts, they have a regular job and have to interact with their community more.” 
One lawmaker, Rep. Perry Stambaugh (R-Perry), introduced a resolution directing the Legislative Budget and Finance Committee to conduct a study on the possibility of such a change. Shaffer was a co-sponsor.
“In the private industry, pay is tied to performance, and right now there’s no such linkage for the state legislature,” Shaffer added. “Tying pay raises to actually delivering a budget on time seems like a very simple first step to try to tie pay to performance.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0878-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-04 17:59:39.308220

The state comptroller’s office, which manages financial transactions and long-term investments, confirmed the transaction to The Dallas Morning News. The purchase followed bipartisan legislation that passed this year creating a state cryptocurrency investment fund. 
Similar legislation has been approved in several red and blue states, according to tracking from the National Conference of State Legislatures. This year, at least 40 states saw legislation proposed regarding cryptocurrency, digital currencies and other digital assets.
While other states, including Michigan and Wisconsin, have made pension fund investments in cryptocurrency, Texas became the first to invest state dollars, according to The Dallas Morning News.
“The industry is maturing and growing — it’ll continue to become more mainstream, and I think Texas staking out a leadership position will be very beneficial to Texans over time, similar to what the oil and gas industry has done over the last century,” Lee Bratcher, president of the Texas Blockchain Council that championed the legislation, told the Dallas newspaper. In a social media post, Bratcher said the transaction occurred late last month.
Citing potential for fraud, blue and red states pass new crypto ATM laws

Cryptocurrencies are digital assets, including bitcoin, that offer an alternative payment method without control of a central bank or government like other currencies. As with other assets, cryptocurrencies are purchased by governments, individuals and institutional investors in hopes that their value will rise over time. But the still-emerging market can be more volatile than traditional investments such as stocks and bonds.
New Hampshire officials recently celebrated the creation of the first municipal bond offering backed by bitcoin. State leaders there already created a cryptocurrency investment fund, though the state has not purchased any of those assets.
“We continue to evaluate our options regarding cryptocurrencies, but we are not ready to move in that direction at this time,” State Treasurer Monica Mezzapelle, told NHPR last month.
In Texas, the sponsor of this year’s legislation said the new crypto fund would help diversify state investments and provide a hedge against inflation and economic volatility.
This year, Texas lawmakers dedicated $10 million to the new fund. In a fiscal note on the legislation, the Legislative Budget Board noted the new fund would be created outside of the state treasury. The fiscal note says that “may limit the Legislature’s ability to make appropriation decisions concerning these funds in the future.”
States Debate Whether to Restrict — Or Invite — Crypto Mining

State interest in crypto comes as federal leaders are increasingly embracing the market.
This summer, President Donald Trump signed into law the GENIUS Act, the first major law governing digital currency. In establishing a regulatory framework for the industry, the president said he hoped the measure would instill more confidence in the industry that spent heavily to lobby federal leaders, according to the Associated Press. 
“This signing is a massive validation of your hard work and your pioneering spirit,” the president told crypto executives.

(Photo by Getty Images)Senate lawmakers are mulling legislation that would require county executive superintendents to consolidate small school districts in their jurisdiction, but the fate of mandatory consolidation appeared unclear after the measure’s sponsor indicated Thursday he may require voter approval for the mergers.
The bill sponsored by Sen. Vin Gopal (D-Monmouth), who chairs his chamber’s education committee, would require executive county superintendents to create plans to merge districts with fewer than 500 students who live in the district and establish or grow regional districts.
“We have a lot of government in New Jersey, and I’m hoping this is going to be the start of that conversation on how we can do this humanely and at the same time improve the quality of life and education and also make life better for taxpayers financially,” Gopal said.
School board member sues NJ officials, alleging they stifle free speech

Officials have long considered school consolidation as a means of lowering the cost of public education by eliminating duplicative services and aligning disparate curricula from elementary or middle schools that send older students into combined regional districts. 
But the state’s long-running efforts at voluntary consolidation — including financial incentives and state support for feasibility studies — have created only a handful of mergers, while school expenses continue to drive property tax growth.
School taxes accounted for 52% of local property taxes collected in 2024, according to state data, and the roughly $15 billion in school aid in the current state budget accounts for more than a quarter of all state spending approved for the current fiscal year.
Numerous witnesses who spoke before the education committee Thursday about the bill, called S4861, raised concerns about how mandatory consolidation could cut local officials and parents out of decisions about schooling.
“While the goals of S4861 are understandable, its mandates — particularly the removal of voter approval and the prescriptive consolidation requirements — can produce significant disruption without guaranteed cost savings for education improvement,” said Melanie Schulz, director of government relations for the New Jersey Association of School Administrators.
Backing voluntary mergers, incentivizing shared service agreements, and offering state-funded efficiency audits to districts would be a better path, she said.

The current version of Gopal’s bill would see county executive superintendents draft consolidation plans, which the state education commissioner would approve or deny. If those plans are approved, the bill would require the county superintendent to commission a state-funded feasibility study.
If that study finds a merger would not increase school segregation or create overlarge separations between districts and bring potential for cost savings, a better learning environment, and better-coordinated curricula, the participating schools would merge after five years.
Gopal said he shares concerns about a lack of local approval for school mergers and indicated the bill’s requirement for small districts to merge could change.
“I’m all with you on the voter approval,” he said. “My hope is a county executive [superintendent] or someone is going to show a scenario or a neutral figure: This is what your taxes will be if you do consolidation, this will not. If folks in that community say ‘OK, x, y, and z are going to happen, we want to pay more,’ that’s up to them.”
Some who cautioned against mandatory mergers acknowledged that New Jersey’s non-operating school districts — typically small districts that have a school board but send students to schools in other districts because they do not have any of their own — are ripe for mandatory consolidation.
New Jersey had 16 non-operating school districts in the 2024-2025 school year, according to the Department of Education, out of 695 local education agencies, including 89 charter and renaissance schools.
“It seems like it should be pursued, and I think that was the intent of the law that was passed back in 2007 to start to phase them out. We probably should take another look at that,” said Jonathan Pushman, senior director of advocacy for the New Jersey School Boards Association.
Some others warned that the cost savings from mergers could be overstated, citing state law that requires consolidated districts to use salary guides from the most populous of the districts that would be combined unless each district agrees on another framework.
Salaries in more populous districts tend to be highest, Pushman said.
“Any savings are often offset by necessary investments in existing positions that have to take on more responsibility and new positions to serve the regional,” he said. “It should be noted that 70 to 80% of a school district’s budget is wrapped up in those labor costs, and they won’t go down due to regionalizations.”
Officials from some of the state’s consolidated districts gave a more favorable view of mergers.
The Henry Hudson Regional School District, which absorbed districts in Highlands and Atlantic Highlands following a 2023 referendum, saw improved curriculum continuity, greater purchasing power, increased grant access, and lower costs following the merger, said Tara Beams, the district’s superintendent.
Bob Morrison, a member of the Watchung Hills Regional High School District’s board, cautioned against allowing individual districts to disrupt regionalization studies, warning they have too much ability to slow or complicate the process under the current system.
Watchung Hills last month released a study on the feasibility of merging with nearby districts in Watchung, Long Hill, and Green Brook. Morrison said delayed data reporting, uneven engagement, inconsistent messaging, and leaked draft communications complicated the study process.
“To be direct, I have never seen so many grown adults afraid of what may be revealed in a study, ever,” he said. “The incentive today is to do nothing, to keep the status quo, to do things the way they’ve always been done, and that should be unacceptable when improving our students’ education is at stake.”
The bill did not see a vote Thursday, and Gopal indicated he intends to pass the measure — which is expected to see changes — next year.
Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill, who takes office on Jan. 20, has said she favors incentivizing mergers but views compulsory consolidation as an option.
“I’d start by offering the carrot to help the areas that want to consolidate, but when there are areas that are not putting enough money into students, into educators, into the buildings, and then they are taking a lot of money in property taxes and from the state level, then we’ll have to start to look at compulsory movements,” Sherrill said during a debate in September.",https://newjerseymonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/studentsinclassroom-1024x686.jpeg,,,2025-12-04 17:59:39.308220

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma higher education officials allocated $3.4 million in grants to seven colleges and universities to fund artificial intelligence innovation. 
The grants provide “seed money” to implement artificial intelligence technology across Oklahoma higher education institutions. The funding for the Innovations with AI Program comes from the State Regents’ System Innovation Fund, which is appropriated dollars. 
The program aligns with the long-term goals of the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education, according to a meeting agenda. The State Regents received 20 proposals from higher education institutions. 
“Providing these ‘seed money’ grants for comprehensive AI-driven projects represents a bold step to position state system colleges and universities to maximize the impact and sustainability of AI applications in higher education,” said Courtney Warmington, chair of the State Regents. “By investing in technology innovations today, we are preparing our campuses and the students they serve for new workplace frontiers tomorrow.”
Southeastern Oklahoma State University is the recipient of nearly half a million dollars and representatives for the school spoke to the Regents at a meeting Thursday about their proposal. 
“This fund will be a game changer for Southeastern,” said Eric Kennedy, a professor at the university. “These types of dollars for an institution like us don’t come along every day.” 
The funds approved for the school will fund the creation of an AI tool for a “learning management system” to evaluate online classes and professors as well as physical AI workstations and tools available to students, he said. 
“The whole goal of this is to make our students better agents for their employers when they get out of Southeastern and they enter the workforce,” Kennedy said. 
The University of Science and Arts of Oklahoma, University of Central Oklahoma, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center and Rose State College each received a $500,000 grant. 
Murray State College and Oklahoma State University each received grants just under $500,000. 
Other proposals include projects “AI agents” for admissions support and student guidance, integrating “realtime” market analytics into curriculum, training secure artificial intelligence models with patient data for “clinical research and professional training,” and to use the technology to automate “low-level tasks.” One proposal would use AI to extract, validate and transfer information from documents like transcripts, applications and other forms. 
Nick Hathaway, vice chancellor for budget and finance, said the program has encouraged institutions to innovate with AI to “enhance the student experience” and monitor online instruction. 
“What we received through these proposals, as I’ve heard the chancellor say, is evidence that Oklahoma’s colleges and universities are leading the way in deploying artificial intelligence to achieve efficiencies and answering the call to educate our state workforce about artificial intelligence,” he said.

(Photo courtesy Magdalena Public Library)Six of New Mexico’s rural public libraries recently received grant funding to expand programming and services offered to children.
The New Mexico libraries were six of the 39 small libraries that received a combined total of $220,050 in grant funds through the Ohio-based John Henry Eldred Jr. Foundation. Awardees are located in states across the country. The New Mexico libraries include the Magdalena Public Library; Truchas Library; Silver City Public Library; Moise Memorial Library in Santa Rosa; the Lordsburg Hidalgo Library; and Socorro Public Library.
According to a news release from the foundation, grant requests ranged from books and educational tools to expanded access to technology and opportunities to engage with youth.
“Rural libraries are more than buildings with books. They are lifelines for their communities,” Mike Deetsch, executive director of the John Henry Eldred Jr. Foundation, said in a statement. “We are proud to invest in the innovative ways these libraries foster belonging, literacy, and opportunity.”
Grant awards were between $1,500 to $10,000, based on the scope of each library’s project description. The Magdalena Public Library received $5,500, Director Jerri Hurd told Source New Mexico. She said the funding will go toward expanding the library’s juvenile, youth and young adult collection; expanding the section of Navajo-English publications; partnering with the local public school district to promote early literacy through story time; and launching gardening programs to help meet nutrition needs in the community.
“By applying for the grant, it really helps you focus on what you want to do and get really specific about it,” Hurd said. “Most of our budget goes towards just keeping things going. You know, building the collection, bringing in a few authors. So this [grant] lets us really help expand our programming.”
Lisa Shepard, treasurer for the Truchas Services Center, which includes the community’s library, told Source that the Rio Arriba County library received more than $5,000 through the grant. She explained that the funds will be used to create the capacity to offer e-books for youth and adults.
“Because we’re a rural library, we’re totally reliant on grants and some funding [from the state],” Shepard said, adding that the board wants to grow other aspects of the library’s programming as well. “We kind of want to expand our youth section of our library a little bit. And we also are…trying to figure out how we can maybe get some ability to do 3D printing here and have that available for our youth to learn how.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/magdalena-library-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-12-04 17:59:39.308220
,DC,2025-12-04 22:22:52+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,U.S. work authorizations for legal immigrants slashed from 5 years to 18 months,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-work-authorizations-legal-immigrants-slashed-5-years-18-months,,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration Thursday announced new restrictions for immigrants, reducing the work authorization periods from five years to 18 months, the latest crackdown on legal immigration.The new policy follows the shooting of two West Virginia National Guard members by an Afghan national granted asylum earlier this year. The shift will not only affect hundreds of thousands of immigrants, but the shortened period for work authorization could create massive backlogs at the agency responsible for processing legal immigration requests, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. “Reducing the maximum validity period for employment authorization will ensure that those seeking to work in the United States do not threaten public safety or promote harmful anti-American ideologies,” USCIS Director Joseph Edlow said in a statement.“After the attack on National Guard service members in our nation’s capital by an alien who was admitted into this country by the previous administration, it’s even more clear that USCIS must conduct frequent vetting of aliens,” he continued. Immigrants affected by the new changes include refugees; those granted asylum; those with a withholding of removal; those with pending applications for asylum or withholding of removal; those adjusting their status, for example by gaining a green card; and those who fall under the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act of 1997.That act applies to certain Nicaraguans, Cubans, Salvadorans, Guatemalans, nationals of former Soviet bloc countries and their dependents who in the 1990s had applied for asylum and were systematically denied.Additionally, USCIS fees for applying for permits and other paperwork increased as a result of the massive tax and spending passage that Republicans passed over the summer and President Donald Trump signed into law. For initial employment authorization, fees are now $550 and $275 to renew. Following the shooting, U.S. Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom, 20, died. A second guard member, U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, remains critically wounded but hospitalized in stable condition. In response, the Trump administration has ramped up its crackdown on legal immigration and highlighted the need for its mass deportation campaign. The suspect, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, pleaded not guilty to several charges in court on Tuesday. This week, all immigration applications from 19 countries listed on Trump’s “high-risk” countries or travel ban from earlier this year, were paused — a move that freezes processing for green card holders and citizenship applications.",,,,2025-12-04 17:59:39.308220

The Milken Foundation is honoring 30 U.S. educators in the 2025-2026 academic year. (Submitted)TOPEKA — Turner Elementary School teacher Lexcee Oddo is recognized as a highly skilled, family-focused and whole-brain educator who taught second-graders before focusing on students learning English as a second language.
Those traits of educational devotion made her Kansas’ latest recipient of a $25,000 Milken Educator Award, which was presented Thursday during a surprise schoolwide assembly in Kansas City, Kansas.
“Drawing from her curriculum knowledge and classroom experience, Lexcee helps students shine by building confidence, a passion for learning and a determination to achieve their goals. She is a valued teacher leader, mentor and trainer, and we are so proud to honor her,” said Jennifer Fuller, vice president of the Milken Educator Awards program and a Texas recipient of the honor in 2017.
Fuller said Oddo’s approach to driving excellence among Turner Elementary’s English language learners incorporated both compassion and kindness.
Oddo earned a bachelor’s degree in elementary education at Kansas State University in 2018. Two years ago, she completed a master’s degree in education administration at Emporia State University.

Oddo was the sole Kansas recipient of a Milken Educator Award in 2025-2026. She was the state’s 74th since Kansas joined the program in 1992.
Nationally, Oddo and 29 other educators coast-to-coast were selected to be honored this academic year. They join a group of more than 3,000 K-12 teachers, principals and specialists singled out for recognition through a program established in 1987 by philanthropist Lowell Milken.
“Talented educators play a critical role in preparing students to move successfully to the next stage of learning and life,” Milken said. “For  39 years, the Milken Educator Awards have been calling attention in a very public way to the essential work of educators — all in an effort to attract and retain high-quality talent to the teaching profession.”
The objective has been to highlight educators while in early- or mid-career for what they achieved and for the promise each possessed. Nominated educators don’t receive notice of their candidacy, and awards are presented at events organized to surprise winners. No mandate for a winner’s use of the $25,000 prize existed, but some spend money on their children’s or their own education, to finance dream field trips or establish scholarships.


The Milken Foundation said Oddo was known for creating a learning environment where multilingual learners were empowered to grow in reading, writing, listening and speaking. Her prescription for student success blended high expectations, individualized support and a sense of purpose, the foundation said.

Oddo, who serves as a first-year buddy to new teachers, relied on student assessments to refine instruction and provide real-time interventions. She performed this work with a “culture of joy and collective efficacy” that led to consistent student advances, the foundation said.
The foundation said Oddo was regarded as a whole-brain teacher who valued academic strength and social-emotional development of students. She hosted student recognition assemblies and an after-school tutoring designed to support students’ academic goals, the foundation said.
“Lexcee represents the best of Kansas education,” said Randy Watson, commissioner at the Kansas State Department of Education. “She believes every child can learn and creates a classroom where high expectations and meaningful support help students thrive. Her leadership strengthens her colleagues, and the trust she builds with families reflects her deep commitment to every student’s success.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Lexcee-Oddo-milken-recipient.png,,,2025-12-04 17:59:39.308220
