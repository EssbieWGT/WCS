Photo by Tiffany Tan/VTDiggerBennington College has finalized its collective bargaining agreements with the three groups that make up the college’s union, according to a June 5 press release.The agreements come after a unionization process that began in 2023, after 150 faculty, staff and campus safety workers formed Bennington College United. The union — which is backed by AFT Vermont, an umbrella labor union for higher education and health care workers — cited concerns about high staff turnover, a lack of policy surrounding raises and a lack of transparency about the college’s finances. The agreements, sent to VTDigger by AFT Vermont, detail improved working conditions for union members, including increased wages and bonuses, guaranteed tuition exchange and benefits for family of staff and transparency on the finances of bargaining unit employees.The Bennington College United bargaining team wrote in a statement that they were proud of the improvements they gained in negotiations, and that their next step was to “fight for a better retirement contribution,” on July 1, 2026.READ MORE
“This agreement reflects what is possible when institutions and labor come together with mutual respect and a commitment to mission,” Bennington College President Laura Walker said in a press release. “I am grateful to the members of BCU for their dedication to Bennington, and to the College’s negotiating teams for their tireless and thoughtful work.”“We’re stronger together, always have been and always will be,” Bennington faculty and union member David Bond told VTDigger in a written statement. “With DC missives attacking the public purpose of higher education and many university administrators bending to the bully, it is more important than ever to secure faculty and staff a seat at the table.”Bennington College United originally planned to negotiate as a collective whole but after discussions with the administration, organizers agreed to split into three different bargaining units. In exchange, the university voluntarily acknowledged the union. Although this is Bennington College’s first official union, the school’s dining hall workers are already unionized under the Service Employees International Union, and a “faculty forum” once served as an informal union for faculty members, according to Bennington’s student newspaper, the Bennington Lens.The collective bargaining agreements come amid a wave of unionization in higher education. The number of unionized faculty in the United States grew by 7.5% between 2012 and 2024, according to research from The City University of New York. Read the story on VTDigger here:  Bennington College finalizes collective bargaining agreements with union .",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Bennington-College-sign-1024x750.jpg,,,2025-06-06 20:07:34.932182

On May 30, NorthWestern Energy said it planned an increase of $9.04 on a typical residential electric bill as part of a quarterly adjustment on electric supply.
Earlier last month, the monopoly utility announced it was pushing up rates 17% without regulatory approval, effective May 23. The earlier increase amounts to $17.07 a month on top of a typical residential bill of $101.14, according to NorthWestern Energy.
If the Montana Public Service Commission signs off on the most recent increase, the average residential customer will be paying $127.16 in July, according to information from the agency.
Altogether, that would be a more than 25% increase from May 1 to July of this year.
NorthWestern Energy spokesperson Jo Dee Black said the latest change reflects dollars for electric supply costs generally passed through to customers and adjusted quarterly since 2023.
“This approach helps avoid large, once-a-year adjustments,” Black said in an email.
However, an engineer for the Montana Environmental Information Center said the increase shows NorthWestern’s argument the large gas plant it built in Laurel isn’t offsetting bills as the company promised.
Nick Fitzmaurice, energy transition engineer for the energy watchdog, also said customers will be paying 39.4% more a month this July than they did in August 2022.
“NorthWestern’ subversive tactics unfairly hide the truth from Montanans, who are now paying the price with skyrocketing electric bills,” Fitzmaurice said in an email.
PSC spokesperson Alana Lake said the agency routinely examines a utility’s accounting to ensure accuracy, and the Commission had questions about this recent increase, so it has yet to sign off on it.
However, Lake also said the increase will be implemented unless the PSC finds an error in NorthWestern’s calculations.
“It is important to note that these rates will only be in effect until September 2025,” Lake said, if they are approved. “At that point, (NorthWestern) must file an application with justification for final approval of these adjustments, which will need to be reviewed and approved by the Commission.”
The 17% hike is separate, already in effect, and part of an upcoming hearing on an application for rate increases NorthWestern Energy filed with the PSC in July 2024.
NorthWestern earlier defended the increase it implemented prior to approval by the Montana Public Service Commission — and the PSC confirmed the utility acted legally.
The monopoly energy company said regulators didn’t act on its application for a rate increase in a timely fashion, so it used a law that allows it to implement one on its own in the meantime, after nine months have passed.
However, PSC President Brad Molnar earlier said NorthWestern is responsible for delays in the case, and its customers are going to feel pain as a result of the increase, which he characterized as “crushing.”
A hearing on the rate case will take place starting Monday, June 9, and run possibly through June 20.
If the PSC decides NorthWestern erred in the increase, the company will return the extra money to customers, plus 10%.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/electricity-2048x1366-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-06 20:07:34.932182

(Provided by the Flathead Lake Biological Station of the University of Montana)Flathead Lake is not expected to reach its full pool this summer and may end up more than a foot lower than normal within a month, due to abnormally hot and dry conditions in the region. 
That’s according to Energy Keepers Inc., the corporation operating the Se̓liš Ksanka Qĺispe̓ (SKQ) Dam on behalf of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes. 
“Unseasonably warm and dry conditions have significantly decreased water supply in the Flathead River Basin, and spring runoff is quickly receding, bringing river flows to extremely low levels,” according to an Energy Keepers press release.
Current forecasts show the lake will reach a maximum of around 2,892.3 feet by June 19, and then begin to slowly recede. Full pool for the lake is 2,893 feet. 
With expectations of a potentially low water year, SKQ dam operators worked with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers this spring to raise the maximum water level required for flood control in order to capture as much spring runoff in the lake as possible. But despite the change, “the melted snow remaining will not get Flathead Lake to full pool.” 
“Our goal was to coordinate actions to increase the chance of refill as early as possible while balancing needs for flood risk management; however, it’s also important to understand how much weather influences refill Pacific Northwest Lakes and reservoirs,” said Leah Hamilton, Northwestern Division Reservoir Control Center water regulator with the U.S. Army Corps. “Every water year is different, and there is a lot of uncertainty in trying to accurately predict runoff several months into the future.”  
Dam operators have maintained the minimum flows allowed in the dam’s Federal Energy Regulatory Commission operating license since May 26.
According to a water supply forecast for Montana published this week by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Natural Resource Conservation Science, warmer than normal temperatures throughout May “spurred rapid snowmelt across the state,” a drastic shift from what forecasters were predicting earlier this year.
“Fast snowmelt and earlier than normal runoff in the month of May rapidly decreased snowpack statewide. This potentially corresponds to less available water later in the summer,” said Florence Miller, a hydrologist with NRCS. “Water supply forecasts decreased from 70%-110% of normal streamflow forecasted for most of the state on May 1, to 50%-100% of streamflow forecasted on June 1.” 
In the Flathead River Basin, snow water equivalent — the measure of how much water is contained in a snowpack — is just 59% of average for the beginning of June, compared to 83% at this time last year. The Kootenai River Basin is at 49%, the Upper Clark Fork at 65%, the Jefferson at 66% and the Upper Yellowstone at 63%. 
The Bitterroot Basin is at just 27% of normal, also due to a rapidly melting snowpack. 
“While much of our winter’s snowpack has rapidly melted, a transition to cooler weather could help prolong the remaining snowpack and improve summer streamflow later in the season. Alternatively, a continuation of the hot, dry weather would continue the rapid runoff of this season’s snowpack and further reduce summer streamflow outlooks,” the report states. 
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, conditions have worsened across much of the state over the last month. Compared to 2024, when 56% of the state was classified as experiencing drought, this year 82% of the state is experiencing drought conditions.
“Above normal precipitation during June is needed across the entire state,” the report states. 
Brian Lipscomb, CEO of Energy Keepers, said the forecasted drought conditions for the remainder of the year, combined with several years of hot and dry weather, will bring cumulative impacts to Flathead Lake and those reliant on it — including Energy Keepers. 
“These unprecedented dry conditions are not only taxing on resources, they are also extremely impactful to generation of energy from the SKQ facility,” said Lipscomb in a press release. “Electricity generation from the SKQ facility will be 10 percent below normal for this year, add that to the two years that we have just experienced, and this will put us at 393 GWh of electricity generation below normal.”
That is enough electricity to power a city the size of Missoula for a year, according to Lipscomb. 
Low water conditions are expected throughout the region. 
Lake Koocanusa, formed by the Libby Dam on the Kootenai River, is currently forecast to have a water supply around 72% of average this summer, while Hungry Horse Reservoir, south of Glacier National Park, is forecasting a water supply around 75% of normal. 
“It’s a larger system, it’s not just us,” said Rob McDonald, spokesperson for Energy Keepers and the CSKT. “But (Flathead Lake) is what people care about, which we understand … The lake is the center of the community.”
  Data by USDA NRCS
Since severe drought conditions in 2023 led to record-low levels of Flathead Lake, Energy Keepers has worked to provide more frequent communications on weather and water forecasts and how they may impact dam operations and lake levels. 
“Our goal is to push out information as quickly as possible so people can respond accordingly and manage what they need to manage,” McDonald said. “But we are in year three of the warmest, driest three consecutive years on record. Let that sink in. Three driest, warmest years ever recorded.”
The 2023 drought led to conversations at the local, state and federal level about management of water resources in Montana. 
During the 2025 Legislature, Senate President Matt Regier, R-Kalispell, who represents a portion of the Flathead Valley, introduced a resolution supporting recreation on Flathead Lake, and encouraging decision makers to consider that aspect of use in management actions. 
Regier said hearing about drought conditions and the potential lower lake levels early in the year makes a difference. He said many people felt caught off guard in 2023, raising questions of whether mismanagement of the lake was part of the equation. 
An investigation by FERC found no problems with management of SKQ dam in 2023. 
“I get it, if water is scarce, I get that,” Regier told the Daily Montanan.  “If this is a year that’s more drought than usual, we have to talk about how do we balance tourism, economics, and recreation of Flathead Lake in the whole conversation.”
“When there’s just no water, snowpack’s down, it’s a drought year, I think more people can understand that,” he said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Flathead_Lake_boater-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-06-06 20:07:34.932182

Kelly Armstrong speaks during a meeting of the Senate Appropriations Committee on March 27, 2025. (Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)Legal staff for North Dakota’s legislative branch concluded the “prudent remedy” to correct an error with Gov. Kelly Armstrong’s line-item veto would be for the governor to call a special session, according to a memo issued Friday.
But Attorney General Drew Wrigley, who is working on a separate opinion, maintains that Legislative Council has no role in determining the execution of the governor’s veto.
Armstrong announced May 22 a “markup error” with a line-item veto that crossed out $35 million for a state housing development fund. The red X over the funding did not match what Armstrong indicated in his veto message that explained his reasoning.
North Dakota governor unintentionally vetoes $35 million for housing programs

A Legislative Council memo distributed to lawmakers Friday concluded that legal precedent supports the marked-up bill as the official veto document. “Engaging in interpretive gymnastics” to disregard the markings on the bill could lead to unintended consequences in the future, Legislative Council concluded.
Emily Thompson, legal division director for Legislative Council, said the Legislature needs to have an objective document to clearly illustrate what was vetoed, such as the specific veto markings on the bill, so lawmakers can exercise their veto override authority effectively. 
Lawmakers have six days remaining in their 80-day limit and could call themselves back into session to address the veto. However, the memo cautions that the Legislature may need those days to reconvene to respond to federal funding issues or other unforeseen reasons. Legislative Council recommends the governor call a special session, which would not count against the 80-day limit. 
A special session of the Legislature costs about $65,000 per day, according to Legislative Council.

Armstrong is waiting for an attorney general’s opinion to determine the next steps, according to a statement from his office. He previously said he would call a special session if necessary.
Wrigley said Friday it’s up to his office to assess the situation and issue an opinion on the governor’s question. 
“The power in question is strictly the governor’s power and it has to be in compliance with the constitution and laws of North Dakota,” Wrigley said. “That’s the only assessment here. There’s no role for this in Legislative Council. They have no authority in this regard.”
Armstrong on May 19 issued two line-item vetoes in Senate Bill 2014, the budget for the state Industrial Commission. His veto message explained his reasons for objecting to a $150,000 one-time grant for a Native American-focused organization to fund a homelessness liaison position. But the marking also crossed out $25 million for housing projects and programs and $10 million to combat homelessness, which he later said he did not intend to veto.
Chris Joseph, general counsel for Armstrong, wrote in a request for an attorney general’s opinion that the markings served as a “color-coded visual aid,” and the veto message should control the extent of the veto. 
Wrigley said his office is working on the opinion and aware that resolution of the issue is time sensitive. 
Bills passed by the Legislature with appropriations attached to them, such as the Industrial Commission budget, go into effect July 1.
“I look forward to publishing my opinion on that at the earliest possible time,” he said.
The Legislative Council memo states, “It would not be appropriate to allow the governor and attorney general to resolve the ambiguity by agreement.”

In addition, Legislative Council concluded that if the governor’s veto message is to be considered the controlling document for vetoes in the future, more ambiguities would likely be “inevitable and frequent” and require resolution through the courts.
The memo cites a 2018 North Dakota Supreme Court opinion involving a case between the Legislature and then-Gov. Doug Burgum that ruled “a veto is complete and irrevocable upon return of the vetoed bill to the originating house,” and further stated the governor does not have the power to “withdraw a veto.”
“Setting a precedent of the attorney general issuing a letter saying we can just go ahead and interpret the governor’s veto message to mean what was, or was not, vetoed, that’s a really concerning precedent to set,” Thompson said in an interview. 
Wrigley said any issues resulting from the opinion could be addressed by the courts.
“I sincerely hope that they (Legislative Council) are not trying to somehow publicly advocate, or attempt to influence a process for which they have no role,” Wrigley said.

The order is “blatantly racist, and rooted in unfounded fear and political posturing,” said Molly Gray, executive director of the Afghan Alliance in Burlington, in a statement this week.

Seen on Feb. 20, 2025. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerThe Trump administration late Wednesday announced a total ban on entry to the United States for citizens of 12 countries, including family members of refugees. The ban includes partial restrictions on seven other countries in a sweeping move that’s much more restrictive than the travel ban implemented on Muslim-majority countries during President Donald Trump’s first term.Expected to go into effect this coming Monday, the executive order targets mostly Muslim, African nations by fully suspending immigration and nonimmigrant visas for citizens of Afghanistan, Burma, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen who do not already have legal status in the U.S. The ban allows exceptions for permanent residents or green card holders and those with valid visas.The ban imposes further restrictions on residents of Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela to protect U.S. citizens “from aliens who intend to commit terrorist attacks, threaten our national security, espouse hateful ideology, or otherwise exploit the immigration laws for malevolent purposes,” according to the order.Advocates said the ban is particularly cruel for more than 600 displaced Afghans who supported the U.S. in the war in Afghanistan and fled their home country in hopes of safe refuge in Vermont after the Taliban took control in August 2021. The majority of them have joined the workforce and contribute to society and the local economy in positive ways, advocates said.The order is “blatantly racist, and rooted in unfounded fear and political posturing,” Molly Gray, executive director of the Afghan Alliance in Burlington, said in a statement this week.“It is hard to put into words the absolute horror of this travel ban for Afghan refugees hoping for relocation to the United States from Pakistan pursuant to recent court orders,” she wrote. “It is hard to quantify the depravity, bigotry and short-sightedness of such a brazen abandonment of those individuals who risked their lives, over a 21 year period, for the United States in Afghanistan.”The Afghan Alliance recently announced a partnership with No One Left Behind, a Virginia-based nonprofit, to help expedite the evacuation and resettlement of vulnerable Afghan Special Immigrant Visa holders ahead of the anticipated travel ban.U.S. Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., last week joined his colleagues to demand answers from the Department of Homeland Security and Department of State on its “devastating” decision to terminate temporary protected status for Afghan nationals living in the U.S..“The grave conditions that forced Afghan nationals to flee and seek refuge in the U.S. following the return of the Taliban to power remain,” states the letter signed by 100 legislators. “Because of this harsh reality, forcing Afghan nationals in the U.S. to return to Afghanistan would be reckless and inhumane, and would threaten the safety and well-being of thousands of individuals and families, especially women and girls.”At least two new Afghans and several hundred asylum seekers from Cuba, Venezuela, Haiti and Ukraine who resettled in Vermont were set to lose their humanitarian parole protections due to recent federal orders. Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court lifted a stay on the order, ending the Biden-era program.A previous order froze federal funding for refugee support affecting local relocation agency efforts. It further tried to deport Venezuelan migrants under the war-time Alien Enemies Act of 1798, an effort a federal judge last month struck down as unlawful.While many of the administration’s recent efforts remain tied up in court, they are a reflection of Trump’s campaign promise to potentially carry out “the largest deportation program in American history.”Advocates said these orders neither secure the future of the legal residents who passed the strongest checks nor improve the security, stabilization and sustainability of the nations targeted in Trump’s travel ban.READ MORE
The ban makes life “more problematic” for citizens of those countries in the U.S. and abroad, said Yvonne Lodico, executive director of the Grace Initiative Global, a nonprofit that provides services to several refugee groups including Haitians and Afghans living in Vermont. “Persons seeking asylum by international law are being refused entry to the U.S., or asylum status not granted. Families are kept apart. The inherent right of each human being to dignity and respect is being replaced by an atmosphere of threat and fear. Immigrant support groups are being eviscerated by funding cuts,”Lodico said. “Our hope remains in the warmth and humanity of individuals rallying to counter this bad news.”Grace Initiative Global is planning a program at the United Nations on June 20, World Refugee Day, to focus on the security and stabilization of Haiti, she said.Kristen Connors, a lawyer who has been working with clients in Vermont with pending asylum cases, said she continues to be shocked at how “flippant, cruel, and arbitrary” the restrictions are and called the language used in the latest order “racist and xenophobic.”“I’m saddened because I do not think that this proclamation will make us safer as a country, I think it will make us less safe, and less prosperous,” she said. “I hope this spurs more people in Vermont to learn about our current immigration laws, and about systems of global migration, and I hope this prompts people to step up and support real, humane, and meaningful immigration reform.” Two of her Afghan clients erroneously received federal letters telling them they had seven days to leave the United States and their work authorizations would be terminated. This happened despite them having employment authorization based on their humanitarian parole status, Connors said. Both were paroled in the spring of 2024 with the cases pending in court. They can lawfully remain in the country until their cases have been adjudicated, but the letters were nerve-wracking for them, she saidThe orders suspending long-standing refugee programs and funding have been hard to digest and adds to the uncertainty resettled groups already live with, said Nathan Virag, immigration lawyer for Association of Africans Living in Vermont, based in Burlington. He said the organization, which helps an average of 800 people annually across the state, has been fielding increased calls from Afghans, people from  African countries, India, Nepal, Venezuelans and Ecuadorians on how they can protect themselves, especially in interactions with immigration authorities.“There’s a lot of fear going around,” Virag said. “The unique thing is, even people who were lawfully admitted here — refugees, green card holders and people who have applied for asylum — they’re scared and wonder what’s going to happen to them.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Trump’s most sweeping travel ban yet draws anxiety, criticism in Vermont.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/afghans-2-20240812-1024x676.jpg,,,2025-06-06 19:05:29.063780

These two deaths in infants, whose mothers were also not vaccinated against pertussis, are the first whooping cough deaths in Kentucky since 2018, the department said. 
Whooping cough is a highly contagious respiratory illness that can be life threatening. It is most dangerous for babies, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It can, however, affect people of any age. 



Kentucky health officials emphasized the importance of maternal immunization during pregnancy and for all infants beginning promptly at 2 months of age.



“Anyone can get whooping cough, but infants are at greatest risk for life-threatening illness,” Dr. Steven Stack, the state’s public health commissioner, said in a statement. “Fortunately, when vaccinations are administered to pregnant women, it provides protection to both the mother and the baby.” 
The state’s public health department says there have been 247 cases of whooping cough so far in 2025. In 2024, there were 543 cases, the most since 2012. 
“Health officials anticipate that whooping cough will continue to increase during the summer and fall, based on historic trends,” the department said.
Vaccines are available to children as young as 2 months old and can help prevent it, the CDC says. The recommended vaccines are DTaP for children and Tdap for preteens. Concerned parents can call their primary care providers to ask about vaccines. 
Symptoms of whooping cough include, according to the Kentucky Department of Public Health: 

Runny or stuffy nose
Uncontrollable coughing
Vomiting from coughing 
Fever below 100.4 Fahrenheit

Opponents say they would have limited consumers’ choices and driven up costs, while supporters say they are critical for healthy air.","In summary
The new rules would have set increasing targets for sales of zero-emission products in the 4-county L.A. region over the next decade. Opponents say they would have limited consumers’ choices and driven up costs, while supporters say they are critical for healthy air.



After a contentious, five-hour hearing, Southern California air quality regulators rejected measures that would have phased out residential gas-powered water heaters and furnaces in the Los Angeles basin. 
The two rules, designed to clean up one of the biggest sources of the region’s severe smog, would have set increasing targets for sales of zero-emission products in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties over the next decade — beginning with 30% in 2027. The targets would not have been mandatory, although manufacturers would pay fees for each natural gas water heater or furnace they sell.
The South Coast Air Quality Management District board in a 7-5 vote rejected its boldest smog-fighting proposal in years. The decision, driven mostly by concerns about affordability, was a rare rebuke of measures proposed by the agency’s staff, which came after years of compromise and efforts to scale back what originally was a mandate phasing out the polluting heaters.
The board voted 7-4 to send the two proposed rules back to a committee, which means any new version likely won’t be considered until next year.  
An overflow crowd of several hundred people attended today’s hearing, with more than 200 people testifying. In addition, the agency received more than 30,000 written comments, fueled by an aggressive push of opposition from the gas and building industries. 
“Despite not being called a mandate, the rules would force on consumers electric units that are more expensive upfront to purchase, may require costly panel upgrades and are more costly to operate with rate increases being sought by providers,” Chino Mayor Pro Tem Chris Burton told the board, adding that the electric heat pumps also would add demand to an already stressed grid.
The Trump administration’s Justice Department warned the air district in a letter Thursday that it would sue to block the rules.
“California regulators are on notice: if you pass illegal bans or penalties on gas appliances, we’ll see you in court. The law is clear—feds set energy policy, not unelected climate bureaucrats,” U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli. a former California state Assemblymember, said on X.
Chis Chavez, deputy policy director with the environmental group Coalition for Clean Air, gave impassioned comments to the board after the vote. 
“Simply put, you have failed,” Chavez said, raising his voice to the board. “For this failure you are now inviting federal sanctions, limits on industry, limits on economic activity, and those are consequences you will have brought on yourself.”
Opponents criticized the measures as governmental overreach that will limit consumers’ choices and drive up costs for residents, businesses and landlords. 
The South Coast district’s 12-member governing board — made up largely of city and county elected officials — was heavily divided.
“What struck me today is a singular focus on housing costs and overall costs and the reality is in the state of California, health care costs are increasing at a greater rate than housing increases,” said board member Holly Mitchell, a Los Angeles County supervisor. “We do have to make tough decisions on behalf of the greater good every day. We have a responsibility…to get us on a path to cleaner air.”

All  six representatives from Orange County and the Inland Empire voted against the measures, along with the board member representing western Los Angeles County cities. Members representing the state Senate, Assembly, city of Los Angeles, Los Angeles County eastern cities and Los Angeles County Supervisors voted in favor.
“I think this mandate hits really hard for disadvantaged and fixed income residents,” said board member Janet Nguyen, an Orange County supervisor, saying it could cost residents tens of thousands of dollars to buy the electric heaters and rewire their homes. “I think we also need to be diligent given the (Justice Department’s) formal warning.”
The measures wouldn’t have required people to get rid of old heaters and would not have banned new natural gas ones. Instead, they were designed to allow consumers to choose between electric heat pumps or natural gas appliances while penalizing manufacturers for selling ones that pollute the air.

Fernando Gaytan, an attorney with the environmental group Earthjustice, urged the board to approve the measures despite what he called the U.S. attorney general’s “grandstanding” in his letter to the board.  
“Failing to adopt this standard because of the Trump administration’s bullying will only encourage efforts to ignore the law,” Gaytan said. “It will only embolden oil and gas industry interests to ramp up the misinformation campaign to derail lifesaving regulations. Let’s be clear, this rule is not a ban. It’s not even a mandate.”
Under the rules’ sales targets, 30% of residential and commercial water heaters and furnaces sold in 2027 would be zero-emissions, ramping up to 50% in 2029, 75% in 2033 and 90% in 2036. Manufacturers would pay fees between $500 and $50 for each natural gas one sold in the region. The fees would be used to help low-income households purchase the zero emission appliances. 
Air board member and Los Angeles City Council Member Nithya Raman said the early targets would essentially match where the market already is in terms of selling zero-emission heat pumps.
“I know this is a period of uncertainty but there is time built into the structure of the rule. I think it would be a grave error not to move this forward with the commitment that we will always come back to it and review our work, ” she said.
Based on the lifetime of these appliances — 25 years for heating systems and 15 years for water heaters — about half a million would have been replaced annually in the region, according to the air district. The district expects 90% of all water heaters and furnaces in the region will be zero emissions by 2061. 
The cost of buying and installing an electric heat pump to replace natural gas appliances varies, depending on what people need: Replacing an entire HVAC system with a heat pump would cost consumers about the same or even less than a natural gas system, according to the South Coast district’s estimate. But installing a heat pump instead of a natural gas water heater would cost $2,000 more, and replacing just a furnace would cost $8,000 more.
Air quality officials say consumers would save money by switching to electric heaters. Between 2027 and 2061, residents in the four-county region would have collectively saved an annual average of between $191 million and $250 million on utility bill costs by switching from natural gas to electricity, according to the district’s estimate.
Residential heaters emit as much pollution as oil refineries and power plants
The region’s 10 million water heaters and furnaces are among the largest sources of smog-causing gases in the L.A. basin, emitting almost 7 tons a day of nitrogen oxides.
The measures would have eliminated 2.2 tons of nitrogen oxides a day by 2037 and 6 tons a day by 2061, according to the district’s data. In comparison, in 2037, oil refineries will emit 2 to 3 tons per day, utilities 4 tons per day and vehicles 7 tons per day, based on projections by the air district. Vehicles, oil facilities, power plants and other industrial sources have already been regulated for decades.
Nitrogen oxides react with other gases in the air and bake in the sun to form ozone, the main ingredient of smog, which causes asthma attacks and other health effects. The appliances also pollute indoor air, raising the risk of respiratory problems, and emit fine particles linked to heart attacks and other health effects.

The reduction in pollution would prevent about 2,500 premature deaths, 2,500 emergency room visits and 10,000 cases of asthma, and save $25 billion in health costs, according to the district’s data. 
“I’ve seen firsthand how families in my community are forced to live with the health consequences of dirty air. Our children grow up with asthma, our elders struggle with respiratory illness, and too many lives are cut short,” Lynwood City Councilmember Juan Muñoz-Guevara told the board today. “Gas appliances in our home are one of the largest sources of smog-forming pollution in the region. We cannot meet clean air goals without tackling this.”
“I’ve seen firsthand how families in my community are forced to live with the health consequences of dirty air. Our children grow up with asthma, our elders struggle with respiratory illness, and too many lives are cut short.”LYNWOOD CITY COUNCILMEMBER JUAN MUNOZ-GUEVARA
Luz Perez, a Fontana resident who attended the hearing holding her young daughter at her hip, said she supports the rules and hopes it will mean cleaner air for her family.
“I had air monitors installed in our mobile home and I was surprised to see how polluted the inside air was,” she told the board. “It took me a while to recognize it was because of the gas stove and that made me really nervous. I figured it was important for me to come talk about it because we need to be able to transition to safer air.”
Despite decades of efforts to clean the air, the L.A. basin still has the worst air quality in the country and has consistently failed to meet federal health standards for smog and soot.
Gas companies, businesses, developers and other groups aggressively campaigned against the regulations, arguing that it would effectively mandate manufacturers to sell zero-emission appliances and increase costs for consumers. 
“Over time, the public will be forced to pay hundreds of dollars more to replace their gas appliances,” wrote Kevin Barker, a senior manager for SoCal Gas’s energy and environmental policy, in a letter to the district. “It is not in the public interest, especially at a time when consumers are demanding affordable energy solutions, to raise upfront costs of the most affordable options.” 
Environmental groups criticized the rules as failing to be aggressive enough. The air district’s original plan would have mandated manufacturers to sell all zero emission appliances in 2031. 
The Bay Area already has similar rules, enacted in 2023, that mandate zero-emission water heaters in 2027, furnaces in 2029 and large commercial water heaters in 2031. However, they are being amended to allow more flexibility for manufacturers to comply.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/051925-Water-Heaters-Lowes-LV-CM-02.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-06 19:05:29.063780

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Candidates and outside groups have spent more than $122.5 million on this year’s gubernatorial primary, a total greater than any other in state history and one that stands to rise in the race’s closing days, the New Jersey Election Law Commission said Friday.
The spending total includes $54.9 million from the candidates themselves and $67.7 million from outside groups. Between them, $14 million remained unspent, and that number could swell from late-arriving donations to independent expenditure groups, which face no contribution limits. Voting is underway and ends Tuesday.
Spending totals for this campaign have already more than doubled those in every gubernatorial primary since at least the turn of the millennium and have outpaced even the most expensive gubernatorial general election. That November 2005 race between Democrat Jon Corzine and Republican Doug Forrester cost about $98 million after adjustments to inflation, the commission said.
This year’s 11 gubernatorial candidates had about $6.7 million left in reserves on May 27, the last date covered by regular pre-election campaign finance disclosures.
The commission credited the number of candidacies and a larger gubernatorial fund match for the increase.
Candidates who meet fundraising and spending thresholds can receive up to $5.5 million in matching public dollars for the primary in exchange for observing an $8.7 million primary spending cap and participating in debates hosted by the commission.
Five of the eight candidates have maxed out or nearly maxed out their matching funds.
Of the $54.9 million spent by the candidates, Democrats Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop and Rep. Mikie Sherrill lead the pack, with Fulop spending nearly $8.7 million and Sherrill shelling out $8.5 million as of May 27. Republican Jack Ciattarelli, who unsuccessfully ran for governor in 2017 and 2021, spent $8 million, followed by Rep. Josh Gottheimer, a Democrat, at $7.9 million. 
Spending by outside groups is dominated by Working New Jersey, a super PAC funded by an independent expenditure group linked to statewide teachers union the New Jersey Education Association. It is responsible for more than half of the outside spending in the race, with at least $37.5 million boosting Democrat Sean Spiller, the union’s president. Spiller’s own campaign has spent only $342,059.
Spiller’s Democratic rivals have seen less but still sizable support from independent expenditure groups. They have boosted Rep. Josh Gottheimer to the tune of $11.6 million; Fulop, $7.4 million; former state Sen. Steve Sweeney, $4.3 million; and Sherrill, $3.8 million. A group run in part by Trump ally Kellyanne Conway has spent $1.3 million supporting Ciattarelli’s campaign.
Gubernatorial totals far exceed fundraising and spending on this year’s Assembly races (all 80 seats in the chamber are on the ballot this year). Not counting independent expenditures, Assembly candidates have raised nearly $26.3 million and spent about $15.4 million, the commission said.
Most of that money, $20.8 million, has flowed to incumbents. Collectively, challengers have raised just under $5.5 million.
The ratio is similarly split along party lines. Democratic candidates account for $21.6 million of the funds raised, while only $4.7 million went to Republicans.

June 6, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska Secretary of State Bob Evnen is seeking reelection as the state’s chief elections officer. 
In his campaign kick-off event Friday, the secretary of state touted the state’s elections as the nation’s most “secure or accurate.” But he said he wonders whether any non-citizens might have gotten on the voter rolls. 
Evnen appeared to be trying to balance defending the state’s elections his office administers and echoing the concerns of some Republicans and President Donald Trump over election integrity since the 2020 presidential election, national framing that some election experts have warned could undermine trust in elections. 
“There is more work to be done, and we must continue to focus on being proactive in the future,” Evnen said. “Threats to election security are not static.”

U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb., and Lt. Gov. Joe Kelly joined Evnen’s reelection announcement, as well as a handful of Nebraska state senators. Evnen is running for his third term as secretary of state, but this race follows his closest contest to date, a 2022 GOP primary in which he faced two populist Republican challengers who combined to hold him under 50% of the vote. He won the general election without any major party opponent. His office, in addition to overseeing elections, also handles business registrations and international relations. 
Kelly emphasized that the country has seen “some very poorly orchestrated elections,” but “not in Nebraska.” 
“We’ve been so lucky to have Bob Evnen,” Kelly said. 
Kelly and other speakers praised Evnen for how he has represented Nebraska when speaking to other counties about trade opportunities with the state, and for his handling of elections. 
Nebraskans passed a state constitutional amendment in 2022 requiring the Legislature to implement voter ID in Nebraska. Nonpartisan poll watchers have praised Evnen’s office for its implementation of the law, and Fewer voters were turned away under the law than in other states with similar laws. 
Evnen, in talking about the voter rolls and what he described as the risks of non-citizens voting, said years of the U.S. having an “open border” left him questioning “whether some of those people ended up on voter rolls.” 
Election watchdogs have said that framing from some Republicans is based on the “myth” of widespread voting by non-citizens. The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, analyzed election conduct from 2003 to 2024 and found 24 instances nationally of noncitizens voting out of millions of votes cast.
Evnen also reemphasized his support for Trump’s executive order overhauling the administration of U.S. elections. The secretary signed on to a joint letter with 19 other Republican secretaries of state this year that requested more access to federal immigration data to help verify voter registrations. 
Evnen told KETV earlier this year that he would like to investigate whether 46 Nebraskans who have voted over the past several elections are U.S. citizens. 
When the Nebraska Examiner asked the Secretary of State’s Office earlier this year how many non-citizens had been removed from voter rolls or voted in past elections, a spokesperson said the agency has not “removed anyone due to their status as a non-citizen, nor do we believe that there are many such people registered to vote.” 
Evnen’s office, in the regular course of business, removed 13,550 voters from the voter rolls after the November 2024 election – most due to death or relocation from the state. Such removals are routine and required by federal and state law. Evnen said Friday that his office is working with the Nebraska Attorney General’s Office to establish a process to confirm the citizenship of people registered to vote in Nebraska.
Current Federal law doesn’t require proof of citizenship to register — but it bans noncitizens from voting in elections. Other states, such as Wyoming and Louisiana, have passed state laws requiring anyone registering to vote to provide proof of citizenship. Those bills align with the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act, which the U.S. House passed in April. The SAVE Act would require proof of citizenship in federal elections.
If the SAVE Act passes the Senate and becomes law, it would codify parts of the Trump executive order that Evnen calls a “new and hopeful chapter.”
“The President’s executive order all but points to Nebraska as the model for how free and fair elections should be conducted,” Evnen said. 
Evnen has talked about potentially requesting more time from the Legislature to verify signatures on petition drives for ballot measures after questions were raised about the validity of some signatures gathered for recent petitions, including ones targeted in a lawsuit aimed at stopping medical marijuana. Legislation seeking to provide more time fell short this year.
Evnen also said Friday that he is “proudly pro-life and pro-Second Amendment” — topics beyond the scope of his office that could signal that the Secretary of State has bigger aspirations. 
He said he expected a challenger in 2026, whether from his right flank, a Democrat or both.
“If one is going to run for office, the only safe assumption to make is that one will have an opponent,” Evnen said.

(Obtained from AOGC filing)Arkansas oil and gas regulators are working to replug a century-old oil well in Ouachita County that began leaking in May, after the state Oil and Gas Commission approved an emergency request to pay for the work.
A commission inspector wrote in a May 12 report that the leak had affected large trees that “are browning and losing leaves.” Department of Energy and Environment spokesperson Melony Martinez wrote in an email that there was no risk of further environmental contamination.
“The leak is not near any private [water] wells of record or any municipal water systems. It is located in a remote area and is not near a town. … Once plugging is completed and weather conditions are conducive, surface abatement and cleanup measures will begin,” Martinez said. The department’s Division of Environmental Quality “is aware of the response but is not actively involved in plugging operations,” she said.
The commission has spent a little over $400,000 so far and expects to spend around $500,000, Martinez said. However, she emphasized it was difficult to estimate exact costs.
According to commission staff at a hearing last week, the state was notified of the leak in mid-May. Martinez said they estimated the well had been leaking for three to four days prior to the state becoming aware of it.

The well was still actively leaking as of June 3, but the leak is contained, Martinez said. Oil and Gas Commission records show the leaking fluid was diverted to a “pit.” Contractors “removed 9 loads” out of the pit on May 14. 
“The Commission expects the well will be plugged over the next few days, which would mean it is no longer leaking,” Martinez said.
While Martinez said there were no estimates for the amount of fluid that has leaked from the well, images included in the commission’s filings last week show large areas of pooled fluids around dying trees and vegetation.
The well was last operated by “The Texas Company,” and was likely plugged around 1940, commission staff said in their request for emergency spending authority to address the leak. Commission attorneys said last week that they were unable to track down “the original permit holder,” necessitating the commission to expend funds.
Commissioners voted unanimously to grant staff the authority to use money from the Arkansas Abandoned and Orphaned Well Plugging Fund to address the leak.
The number of active and producing oil and gas wells in Arkansas have been steadily decreasing. Thousands of wells have been abandoned, either plugged or unplugged, or orphaned in the century since Arkansas’ first oil boom.

Kim Reynolds, seen here in a file photo from May 2023, signed two dozen bills Friday. (Photo by Kathie Obradovich/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Gov. Kim Reynolds signed more than 20 bills into law Friday, including funding for the state’s Opioid Settlement Fund and state-level Medicaid work requirements.
The governor has a little more than a week, until June 14, to sign the remaining bills passed during the 2025 legislative session into law. This week, the governor has held events signing multiple measures into law — including the reduction in Iowa’s unemployment insurance tax system. On Friday, she signed into law House File 969, a bill expanding the disability and death benefits for first responders like firefighters, emergency medical services responders and law enforcement officer to cover all forms of cancer.
This was not the only measure Reynolds signed into law Friday. She released a list of 24 new laws, which include some state spending provisions and other high-profile policies sent to her desk earlier this year.
Here are some of the bills signed into law:
Medicaid work requirements
As discussions — and conflicts — continue over the federal work requirement proposal for Medicaid coverage included in the GOP budget reconciliation bill, Reynolds signed Senate File 615, into law, a measure setting similar work requirements for the Iowa Medicaid program.
The requirements for at least 80 hours of work each month would apply to people receiving health coverage through the Iowa Health and Wellness Plan. IHAWP is the state’s expanded Medicaid program for low-income people between ages 19 to 64. There are exemptions to these work and reporting requirements for people with disabilities, serious illnesses or injuries, as well as those with children under age 6.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The law directs the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services to seek a waiver to implement these requirements from the federal government. Iowa HHS has already submitted a waiver with a slightly different work requirement plan for IHAWP — one that sets a 100-hour per month work requirement, or for a person to be earn the equivalent in wages to working 100 hours a month at $7.25 per hour, or be enrolled in education or job skills programs to retain coverage.
Reynolds said in a statement on the bill signing, “it is priority of mine to ensure our government programs reflect a culture of work.”
“If you are an able-bodied adult who can work, you should work,” the governor said. “We need to return Medicaid back to its intended purpose—to provide coverage to the people who truly need it.”
Democrats and others critics have said the legislation will cut off health care coverage for eligible Iowans due to additional red tape, leading to a financial hit for rural hospitals and other health care centers.
The measure also contains a component that could have lasting impacts for Iowa’s expanded Medicaid program: If the federal government allows Iowa to implement work requirements, then later revokes approval, HHS would be directed to end IHAWP. The move to discontinue the program would require federal approval, and if the decision is not approved, Iowa HHS would be asked to pursue implementing an “alternative plan” under federal Medicaid administration guidelines.
Opioid Settlement Fund
After several years of stalled action, Reynolds approved the Legislature’s agreement on how to spend money from opioid lawsuit settlements.
House File 1038 distributes $29 million from the fund, money obtained in settlements for lawsuits by states against opioid manufacturers, distributors and pharmacies for their roles in the opioid epidemic. For several years, lawmakers in the Senate and House have failed to reach an agreement on how to spend the funds, which are obligated to go to opioid addiction treatment and prevention. But in the final hours of the 2025 legislative session, lawmakers agreed to a system that provides funding for specific organizations and programs that focus on addition treatment, recovery and prevention in fiscal year 2026.
In future years, money in the settlement fund will go to Iowa HHS and the Attorney General’s office — entities that will then decide how to allocate the money to organizations in the state. HHS will receive 75% of the funding each year and the AG’s office will receive 25%. While some lawmakers said they were frustrated with the money going to these state entities instead of being distributed directly by the Legislature, the bill passed with broad bipartisan support as get the funding into Iowa communities.
The governor thanked the Legislature for sending the bill to her desk in 2025.
“The opioid crisis continues to impact Iowa families,” Reynolds said in a statement. “I’m thankful the legislature reached an opioid settlement fund agreement this session to immediately distribute $29 million to providers and appropriate ongoing available funds to support early intervention, prevention, treatment, and recovery.”
Open records, meetings
The governor also signed House File 706, the bill setting higher penalties for violations of open meetings laws and requiring public officials t9 receive training on open meetings and records laws.
The bill was brought forward this year after a similar measure was vetoed in 2024 after a last-minute amendment was added that public records advocates had said would lead to unintended consequences. But Rep. Gary Mohr, R-Bettendorf, said adding heightened penalties and more training was still an important measure to pass as a means of addressing violations of these laws in Davenport related to the collapse of a six-story apartment building and alleged violations of open meeting laws in 2023.
The bill was also amended in 2025 by the Iowa Senate to include language add two types of records to the state’s list of confidential records — security camera footage from the Iowa Capitol and information from state employee identification card access systems.
Fetal development videos in Iowa classrooms
Senate File 175, also signed into law Friday, is a measure modeled after “Meet Baby Olivia” laws passed in other states. Though Iowa’s law does not reference the “Meet Baby Olivia” video developed by the anti-abortion group Live Action by name, it requires students in 5th through 12th grade human growth and development classes be shown ultrasound video and computer-generated rendering or animations depicting “the humanity of the unborn child by showing prenatal human development, starting at fertilization.”
The bill was amended by the House to include a provision banning materials in school classrooms on fetal development that come from an entity that performs or “promotes” abortion, or that contracts, affiliates, or makes referrals to organizations that perform or promote abortions.
Democratic lawmakers said this ban would mean material coming from reputable organizations and health care providers, like the Mayo Clinic or the University of Iowa Health System, could be excluded, as the ban would not exclude organizations that perform abortions in cases necessary to save the life of the mother.

(Photo by Eesha Pendharkar/Maine Morning Star)Lawmakers in both chambers of the Maine Legislature advanced legislation Thursday expanding access to needle exchange programs and funding proper disposal of syringe litter.
Syringe service programs are nonprofits or municipalities certified by the state to hand out clean syringes in exchange for used ones as a method of harm reduction for those impacted with substance use disorder. The two bills — LD 1078 and LD 1738 — would allow the programs to expand their locations within the county they are certified to operate in and create a biohazard waste disposal program within the Maine Department of Health and Human Services that would offer grants to community organizations that incentivize proper disposal of used syringes. 
Both passed the House of Representatives after some debate with critics questioning the need to expand these programs, which are often blamed for creating excessive syringe litter. 
“The potential for improperly discarded needles in parks, on sidewalks or in public bathrooms is not hypothetical. It is a reality in cities that have expanded similar programs without adequate controls,” said Rep. Kathy Javner (R-Chester).
Proponents of the bills pointed to support among medical providers and harm reduction experts, who have vouched for the programs’ effectiveness in preventing disease transmission. They also said the proposed grant program would incentivize safe needle disposal and allow communities to come up with their own solutions to syringe litter disposal, with partial funding from the state.
“We know that when people have access to safe disposal, we all benefit with the right tools, we can reduce the risk of disease transmission, protect public spaces and build trust across divides,” said Rep. Julie McCabe (D-Lewiston). “We do not need to choose between the health of our communities and the health of individuals. We can have both.”
Rep. Ambureen Rana (D-Bangor) pointed to Portland’s needle buyback program, which the city estimates has helped reduce syringe litter by 76% and resulted in a 58% increase in used syringe return. Participants can earn 10 cents per used needle they turn in, with a weekly cap of 200 syringes per person.
The Senate also passed both bills without discussion. The grant program would cost the state roughly $120,000 for the first two years for a new position to oversee the program, in addition to an annual allocation of $500 to establish the fund. 
The syringe service expansion is estimated to cost roughly $426,000 a year, which would go to the Department of Health and Human Services.
Though both bills won the support of the Legislature, funding may still prove to be an obstacle as the budget committee is wrestling with how to address a significant deficit.
Earlier this session, lawmakers on the health committee rejected a bill that would have severely limited the number of clean syringes that certified programs can hand out, backing the state’s current, more flexible policy. 
In 2022, Maine adopted new rules that allow participants to bring in just one used syringe to receive 100 clean ones. The state health department also allows participants to receive up to 100 syringes, even if they don’t bring any used ones in, at the discretion of the provider.

Frederick Leon Newell was the first person ever to be convicted of felony wage theft in Minnesota in April, more than five years after state lawmakers enacted criminal penalties for wage theft. Newell was also convicted of felony theft by swindle.
Newell must also complete 200 hours of community service and pay more than $42,000 as part of the sentencing, and he may not bid on new public contracts.
“Mr. Newell was entrusted with public funds to pay his employees for their labor on a public works project. Instead, he siphoned the money they earned for himself,” Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty said in a statement. “I am proud of our prosecutors’ efforts in securing the first wage theft criminal conviction in Minnesota history; it is a major step toward greater protection for workers.”
Integrated Painting Solutions was hired for painting and cleaning work in 2020 on the Redwell, an affordable apartment complex in Minneapolis.
Newell’s company received more than $320,000 for the work on the development, which required that he pay a prevailing minimum wage of $36 per hour for painters and $36.41 per hour for general laborers plus benefits because it received public funding through tax increment financing.
Newell paid his workers far less than required — from $15 to $25 per hour — and submitted falsified payroll records to cover up the underpayments. All told, Newell stole more than $35,000 in wages from five workers, with one employee underpaid by nearly $14,000 over just three months in 2020, according to the criminal conviction.
The case came to light after the workers filed complaints with the city of Minneapolis’s Civil Rights Division, with the help of the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades union.
The city investigated their claims and in June 2021 issued a violation letter to Integrated Painting Solutions. Newell signed a settlement agreement with the city to pay $43,166 in restitution but never did.
Greiner Construction, the general contractor for the Redwell, voluntarily made Newell’s workers whole beyond what they had already paid to Newell’s company.
In 2022, the previous Hennepin County attorney, Mike Freeman, filed charges against Newell after receiving a referral from the city of Minneapolis.
Last week, Moriarty announced felony wage theft and theft by swindle charges against Bishop Harding Smith, the head of the violence intervention nonprofit Minnesota Acts Now, for allegedly shorting workers $150,000 from a county contract.

(Getty Images)Idaho kids in residential treatment facilities are under less government oversight for abuse investigations than children in traditional foster homes, a new watchdog state government report finds. 
The Idaho Office of Performance Evaluations, a nonpartisan state agency, found that the state lacks several accountability measures in children residential treatment facilities.
Idaho investigators repeatedly found kids in danger. Treatment programs faced few consequences.

“Children’s residential care facilities serve some of Idaho’s most vulnerable children and youth,” who are “almost three times as likely to be diagnosed with mental health disorders, behavioral challenges, or other disabilities,” the report said.
A panel of Idaho lawmakers on Friday officially released the report to the public. The report was spurred by news reporting that uncovered abuse allegations at Idaho residential treatment facilities published by the news outlet InvestigateWest.
Presenting the report to the Idaho Legislature’s Joint Legislative Oversight Committee on Friday, Office of Performance Evaluations Director Ryan Langrill called the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare’s response — which noted ongoing progress to work toward child welfare shortcomings — promising. 
“The state lacks a formal process for investigating abuse in facilities, unlike the clear process that exists for investigating abuse in homes,” Langrill wrote in a letter summarizing the report. “When abuse of a child in a facility in foster care is reported, case workers are not required to respond as quickly as for other children in foster care.”

 What the OPE report found — and reforms it recommended

Residential care facilities house children with round-the-clock care. Some kids even go to school at the facilities. 
Some kids are placed in facilities by their parents, or by the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare as part of the state’s foster care system.
Idaho has 31 children’s residential care facilities, including two that provide psychiatric care.

In children’s residential care facilities, Idaho doesn’t have an established process to investigate abuse, doesn’t require unannounced visits to facilities, and doesn’t have a formal process to register staff found to have committed abuse in a statewide registry, the report found. 
The state agency’s watchdog report recommended a range of reform efforts — including making an entity responsible to investigate abuse in facilities, requiring at least once a year unannounced visits, establishing a child’s bill of rights in facilities, tracking ideal placement settings for children, and developing a process to include abuse perpetrators in a statewide registry.
“We found that while the (Department of Health and Welfare) shared oversight responsibilities of children in facilities, it lacks protocol to define communication or issue escalation across division,” the report found. “As a result, safety-related information may be passed from one staff member to another without timely action or clear accountability.”
 How state officials, agency responded

In a letter responding to the report, Idaho Gov. Brad Little wrote Thursday that he was pleased with the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare’s progress — and that he and the agency want to improve more.
Idaho governor signs bill investing $23M in state’s foster care system

“We have more work to do, but these improvements and current momentum have us on the right track,” Little wrote. The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare “team and I are committed to continuing this work and meeting the needs to best serve Idaho’s children and families.”
Soon after Idaho Department of Health and Welfare Director Alex Adams took over heading the agency in June 2024, he announced child welfare as a top priority for the agency. That was “largely due” to past watchdog work by the Office of Performance Evaluations into child welfare issues, Adams wrote in a May 21 letter responding to the report.
And he outlined over a dozen changes within the agency that were in response to the watchdog’s agency’s findings, including the agency’s licensing division started in May 2024 to visit facilities one time a year for an unannounced survey, expanded clinical reviews to find the best placement for kids, and visits every two months to kids in out-of-state facilities by case workers or clinicians.
“While these improvements have been occurring over the past year, we recognize that there is much work to do to improve child welfare in Idaho, and particularly to support Idaho youth living in residential care facilities,” Adams wrote. “… Ultimately, it takes strong public policy, cooperation from the courts, support of law enforcement, assistance of guardians ad litem, and collaboration with the Health and Social Services Ombudsman to ensure the safety of Idaho’s children.”
 Idaho state agencies to report back on progress

State Rep. Steve Berch, a Boise Democrat, pressed a state health official on whether the Department of Health and Welfare needs more staff to implement recommendations from the new report. 
It’s probably too early to tell, replied Idaho Deputy Director for Child, Youth & Family Services Monty Prow. 
He referenced a new investment from the Idaho Legislature this year. That new budget law approved 63 new staff for Health and Welfare targeted at preventing kids from entering the foster system — by providing resources to keep them safely with their biological families. 
“It’s probably too early to tell, because those 63 folks are going to be dedicated to prevention — to keep those kids in their homes. And then I don’t need any of this back-end support, because I’m pushing it all to the front-end to do more and more prevention to keep kids safe in their home,” Prow said.

Berch quickly replied, encouraging the department to ask for the funding it actually needs, rather than shorting the request based on political calculations. 
“The Legislature needs to know what the need is financially to deliver the kind of quality service …  not just now, but for the needs of a fast-growing state,” Berch said. “Before the Legislature decides to cut taxes, they need to understand what the needs are first. And people like you in your position and other departments need to make sure that information is available to the Legislature so they can make a fully informed decision.”
In the fall, the committee plans to hear from the Department and Health and Welfare and Idaho’s new Health and Social Services Ombudsman Trevor Sparrow about progress in responding to the report’s recommendations. 
That can give lawmakers a sense of what issues state agencies can address themselves, and whether legislation is needed, said state Sen. Melissa Wintrow, D-Boise, who requested the update.

But for some people present during the 3 a.m. June 1 raid at the Alamo, that simply was not the case. For Alejandra De La Vega, the venue located just outside the town of Summerville, right along the Charleston and Dorchester county line, was a place to dance with friends.

(Photo by Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)
“I went to Alamo to enjoy the night, just like many others,” she told reporters Friday. “But instead of fun, it turned into fear and humiliation.”
De La Vega had just stepped out of the restroom when she said police stormed in, guns drawn. Patrons were running and screaming, she said, as more officers streamed in and ordered people to the ground.
“It was chaos,” she said at the news conference outside the Lonnie Hamilton Public Services Building in North Charleston.
County, state and federal law enforcement held and questioned the more than 200 people present at the club during the raid, dubbed “Operation Last Stand,” for two hours, De La Vega said.
The S.C. State Law Enforcement Division began investigating Alamo in November 2024 after receiving a tip about potential human trafficking at the venue, agency spokeswoman Renée Wunderlich told the SC Daily Gazette Friday.
The Department of Homeland Security also got involved in the investigation at that time, she said.
Later Friday, SLED announced criminal charges against two people, the club’s 59-year-old owner, Benjamin Reyna-Flores of Hanahan, and a 44-year-old security guard at the club, Terone Lavince Lawson of North Charleston.
Reyna-Flores faces multiple charges related to unlawful sale of alcohol. The club had no alcohol license.
Lawson faces illegal gun and drug possession charges. According to warrants from SLED, Lawson had 2 grams of meth, an eight ball of cocaine, and less than a gram of psychedelic mushrooms in his van. Police also found a pair of handguns in the van, which Lawson cannot legally possess due to past convictions for burglary in 2008 and assault in 2003.
Those arrested include two unidentified “high-level cartel members” associated with the Mexico-based Los Zetas cartel and the Venezuela-based Tren de Aragua gang and one person wanted by Interpol for murder in Honduras, said U.S. Department of Homeland Security agent Cardell Morant.
Ten juveniles as young as 13 — including one reported as missing — as well as an unidentified number of potential human trafficking victims were at the club at the time of the raid. Law enforcement also reported seizing guns, cocaine and cash.

In her retelling of events, De La Vega said police separated anyone with visible tattoos and photographed them.
De La Vega, a transgender Latina woman who has lived in the United States since 2001, said officers questioned the validity of her state-issued I.D. card, as well as that of the transgender woman she was there with.
De La Vega has legal residency status in the U.S. She was not arrested.
But 80% of those arrested Sunday did not have legal status to be in the country. The vast majority were arrested on civil immigration charges, not criminal violations.
Five people were arrested for criminal offenses, Morant said.
Homeland Security confirmed to The Post & Courier that Sergio Joel Galo-Baca is the Honduran man wanted for international homicide. Beyond SLED’s announcement Friday, no other names or list of charges have been released.
Homeland Security officials have not responded to emails sent by the SC Daily Gazette.
“The narrative that’s been put out by the sheriff, by the governor, by the attorney general, is that they are just trying to stop violent criminals, stop trafficking,” said Will McCorkle, a member of the Charleston Immigrant Coalition. “But what they quickly overlook are the many innocent people that were detained and are now in the process of deportation for no real purpose.”
Now, according to the American Civil Liberties Union of South Carolina, several families do not know where their family members are.
They have searched their names online using Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s database that people can use to locate the state and center where detainees are being held. But their family members’ names have not shown up in the search, said Dulce Lopez, immigrant rights advocacy strategist for the ACLU.
They can only assume, based on news reports, that their family members are at an ICE holding facility in Folkston, Georgia.

“That made me realize, how easily everything can be taken away,” De La Vega said. “I keep thinking, what if I didn’t have a legal status? What if I were detained and ripped away from my family?”
“My mom is my hero,” De La Vega continued. “She came to this country and gave me and my siblings a better life. She raised us with love and sacrifice and with so much strength. We’re really close, and I don’t know what I would do if I was taken from her. No one should have lived with that fear.”
Charleston County Sheriff Carl Ritchie, during a news conference Monday, cited noise complaints at the club and reports of assaults in the parking lot.
Outside of Sunday’s raid, the sheriff’s department responded to the club 13 other times since 2020 for calls including “suspicious circumstances,” vandalism and one armed robbery, according to a call log provided by the department.
Area business owners said their biggest issue in the last several months had been club goers parking on the side of the highway and in their parking lots after the club’s lot filled up, leaving behind excessive trash and beer bottles after nearly every weekend.
The nightclub did not have a license to sell alcohol.
A group of faith and immigrant community leaders stressed that they do not condone criminal activity.
“But no one deserves to be treated as guilty by association,” said Lopez, of the ACLU.
People have reason to be afraid, McCorckle said, citing the recent case of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported in March to a notorious prison in El Salvador. Living in Maryland, Garcia had been protected from deportation by a 2019 judge’s ruling that he likely faced gang persecution in his home country.
The Trump administration has insisted Garcia is an MS-13 gang member, which Garcia denied. On Friday, Attorney General Pam Bondi announced Garcia was back in U.S. custody to face criminal charges in Tennessee related to human smuggling.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/img_3721-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-06 18:07:18.238668

(Photo by Patrick Lohmann / Source NM)The U.S. government this week set aside environmental protection laws in order to speed up border wall construction along approximately 20 miles of New Mexico’s border with Mexico.
U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Tuesday signed a waiver of various federal laws to expedite border wall construction in southwestern New Mexico. She also signed two similar waivers for areas in neighboring Arizona on Tuesday and Thursday.
Taken together, the waivers allow the federal government to speed up construction of physical barriers and roads along approximately 36 miles of the U.S.-Mexico border, the agency said in a news release on Thursday.
The waivers “ensure the expeditious construction of physical barriers and roads, by minimizing the risk of administrative delays,” DHS said.
The New Mexico waiver lifts the legal requirements of 24 separate federal statutes, including the National Environmental Policy Act, the Endangered Species Act, the Clean Water Act and the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, just to name a few.
“Trump is recklessly casting aside the foundational laws that protect endangered species and clean air and water to build a wildlife-killing wall through pristine wilderness,” Laiken Jordahl, Southwest conservation advocate at the Center for Biological Diversity, told Source NM on Friday.
New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham told Source NM on Friday in a statement that she has serious concerns about the waivers, saying they bypass protections for endangered species, cultural heritage sites and Native American artifacts.
“New Mexico’s archaeological resources and sensitive ecosystems could face permanent damage without proper environmental review,” Lujan Grisham said. “While we understand border security concerns, the federal government should engage with state officials before waiving decades of established environmental protections.”
The New Mexico waiver designates an area in southwestern New Mexico as “an area of high illegal entry,” divided into three sections.
The DHS news release states that the sections of the border where the laws have been waived total approximately 8.5 miles, but that figure is inaccurate, according to Jordahl, who has traveled to every part of the U.S.-Mexico border as part of his work.
“It is extremely frustrating how difficult they make these waivers to track,” he said. “Instead of using simple [latitude and longitude] coordinates, they pick landmarks that are almost impossible for the public to map. I believe they may have made an error in their locations in the waiver.”
One section starts at a point on the border just south of Antelope Wells in Hidalgo County and extends one-tenth of a mile east, according to International Boundary and Water Commission data. Jordahl told Source NM he found the same measurements using his own map of the border. This section is already walled off, and so DHS is likely adding another layer of wall, he said.
Another section begins at a point on the border just south of Wamels Draw, a valley in Luna County, and extends approximately 7.5 miles east. This section of the border already has vehicle barriers, but is not walled off yet, Jordahl said.
Building a border wall along this particular stretch would be the most environmentally damaging by far, Jordahl said, because it would threaten the movement and migration of Mexican gray wolves.
“We’ve seen Mexican gray wolves in this area; we’ve seen them cross the border,” he said. “We’ve also seen them push up against the border wall in New Mexico, wander along it for days and then ultimately have to turn around, being unable to cross.”
Jordahl said his organization’s focus lies on Arizona’s two waivers and potential wall construction, which would also threaten wildlife.
“Throwing taxpayer money away to wall off the Santa Cruz River and San Rafael Valley would be a death sentence for jaguars, ocelots and other wildlife in the Arizona-Sonora borderlands,” he said. “This is happening while border crossings are at the lowest level in decades. We’ll fight this disastrous project with everything we’ve got.”
The third section starts at a point on the border west of Santa Teresa and extends approximately 12.4 miles, over Mount Cristo Rey, to the Rio Grande near El Paso. This section already has older mesh border walls, and DHS may be installing newer walls there, Jordahl said.
The sections of the border described in the waiver lie in the same general area as the New Mexico National Defense Area, a newly created military buffer zone which the U.S. government is trying to use — along with novel criminal charges — to discourage people from crossing the border.
Gov. Lujan Grisham, in the statement provided to Source, urged meaningful consultation with state and local officials before the federal government begins construction that “could cause lasting harm to our communities and environment.”
“New Mexico’s natural and cultural resources deserve consideration in this process,” she said.

(Courtesy of the Office of Secretary of State)The Washington State Library in Tumwater and the Washington Talking Book and Braille Library in Seattle will close to the public on July 1 due to a lack of state funding.
State libraries will also eliminate 12 jobs due to the financial pressure. 
Shuttering the facilities will curb access to the state’s trove of historical and governmental collections and force cancellation of an array of services and programs, the secretary of state’s office announced Friday.
“Libraries are cornerstones of civic life and education in many areas of our state. The impact of the closures will risk denying communities access to the information, literacy tools, and resources they depend on,” Secretary of State Steve Hobbs said in a statement.
The move comes after lawmakers and Gov. Bob Ferguson didn’t provide $6.7 million in the budget to cover a shortfall created largely by a decline in revenue from fees paid on real estate transactions.
At the Tumwater library, those who dial up Ask A Librarian or the main switchboard, or send an inquiry by email, can expect to wait up to a week for a response. Additionally, subscriptions to newspaper and genealogy databases will be discontinued, and the acquisition of new materials will be drastically limited.
When the Talking Book and Braille Library closes to the public, responses to voicemail messages will take longer. Circulation and registration services will be slowed as well.
Programming such as multisensory story time and the Low Vision and Touch of Braille workshops will be canceled. Production of braille and audio materials could also be reduced at the state’s only accessible library service for people who are blind or have other disabilities.
“These disruptions jeopardize equitable access to information for some of Washington’s most underserved residents unable to read standard print,” said Washington State Librarian Sara Jones. “While a newly signed bill will provide some funds in the future, the current funding gap is affecting our employees and important services now.”
A bill signed by Ferguson on May 19 will impose a new $50 surcharge on all filings handled by superior court clerks, of which $20 would go to the secretary of state’s office for the library, archives and state legacy projects. This would generate up to $6 million in a full biennium, according to a fiscal analysis.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/6264508415_47e9637024_o.jpg,,,2025-06-06 18:07:18.238668

(Photo by Alex Baumhardt / Oregon Capital Chronicle)While Democratic members of Oregon’s congressional delegation expressed alarm at the sudden resignation of the leader of the state’s only national park, the Republican who has the park in his district declined to take a position Friday.
Kevin Heatley, the new superintendent of Crater Lake National Park, resigned from his post May 30 over staffing concerns after just five months on the job.
Heatley, who had previously worked at the Bureau of Land Management, told Oregon Public Broadcasting, KGW, The Washington Post and several other news organizations that staffing was already lean at Crater Lake, and layoffs of probationary employees President Donald Trump ordered, followed by hiring freezes, mandates to leave vacant positions unfilled and new federal incentives from the Office of Personnel Management and the office known as the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to resign or retire were making it worse.
Oregon’s congressional delegation met the news with differing levels of concern.
U.S. Rep. Maxine Dexter, representing Oregon’s 3rd Congressional District, wrote Wednesday to Doug Burgum, secretary of the Department of the Interior, demanding to know if he or the agency had undertaken any analysis of what staffing levels were like there or how bad it had gotten. Dexter is also a member of the House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations.
On X, formerly known as Twitter, Oregon’s U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat, said it is clear to him that Trump is “hellbent on destroying natural treasures like Crater Lake.”
U.S. Rep. Cliff Bentz, who represents Oregon’s 2nd District —his district includes southern Oregon’s Crater Lake — said on the phone Friday he’d “look into it.”
“The person’s (Heatley) concern may be well founded. It may not. Until I know the facts better, I’m not going to take a position on it, but now that you’ve raised an issue, we’ll look into it,” he said.
The national park in southern Oregon, famous for its vibrant and translucent volcanic lake that is among the deepest in the world, typically sees about half-a-million visitors each year. But this summer, 60 to 65 seasonal positions will need to be filled, Heatley told journalists in several reports, and just eight ranger positions have so far been filled to keep visitors in the 286-square-mile park safe.
“I mean, the train is still running on the tracks, but it’s not heading in the right direction,” Heatley told OPB on June 2. “I cannot, in good conscience, manage an operation that I know is moving in the wrong direction.”
Spokespeople for Crater Lake did not respond to Capital Chronicle requests for staffing and hiring data.
The federal jobs portal USA Jobs does not list any current vacancies at Crater Lake. The Kansas-based company running Crater Lake’s lodging, concessions, retail and boating operations had 18 vacant positions listed on its site as of June 5.
The National Parks Conservation Association, a Washington D.C.-based nonprofit conservation group, called the staffing issues at the 63 National Parks a “full-blown staffing crisis.”
They report that the Department of the Interior’s own workforce database shows that as of May 13, the Park Service had just over 18,000 employees across all parks, a more than 16% drop from 2023, the previous fiscal year — a decrease equal to that of the previous ten years combined. The association said the recent sharp drop was driven by Trump-incentivized buyouts, early retirements, deferred resignations and leaving vacancies unfilled.
Interior Department data also shows 39% of seasonal and temporary staff at the national parks have been hired so far — about 3,300 employees. That’s less than half the number of seasonal employees Park Service officials said they’d hire in a February memo.
In her letter to Burgum, Dexter called Heatley’s resignation a “flashing red warning sign that something is very wrong,” in a news release Wednesday.

According to a letter from Vice President for Student Affairs Lori McDonald, the university will not consider applications to recognize the Sigma Nu – Epsilon Lambda fraternity until 2031. 
The letter, signed in May, details a number of hazing allegations that occurred during fall 2024 and spring 2025 semesters, pointing to “a pattern of misbehavior over the past six years, including hazing, alcohol-related violations, and destruction of property.”

In January, the university was alerted to possible violations of student code from the fraternity. It launched an investigation that was completed in May. 
That investigation, according to a report released by the university, found at least 13 incidents of “subtle, harassment and violent” hazing. That included:

An event where new members were forced to drink large quantities of beer, vodka and whiskey.
Requiring new members to complete chores as early as 3 a.m. or risk facing humiliating sexualized punishment by active members.
Blindfolding, kidnapping and bringing new members to an “exotic dance club.”
Telling new members to participate in an interview while using marijuana, or risk removal.
Giving members “derogatory” nicknames.
Hosting expensive and unsanctioned parties where alcohol was provided.  
Requiring new members to carry “pledge packs” at all times, which included items like tobacco, condoms, a golf tee, gum, Zyns and a marijuana pen.

The investigation report also detailed a tradition where new members were forced to stay in the basement of the fraternity building. 
“During this timeframe, limited food was provided, new members slept on the basement floor, and they were required to clean the facility and sing songs while actives and alumni were present,” the document reads. 
“I do not have confidence the Sigma Nu chapter will follow the University’s directions, policies, or the terms of a suspension, and therefore, termination of the University’s recognition of the chapter is warranted,” McDonald wrote to the fraternity in the May 19 letter. 
In a statement issued on Tuesday, the university’s Greek Council Executive Board said hazing is “harmful, unacceptable, and has no place in our community.” 
“The actions that led to this decision, do not reflect the values or true purpose of Greek life. Greek organizations should stand for leadership, service, friendship, and personal growth,” the board said.
According to the university, three fraternities have lost their official recognition since 2002.

File photo by J. Scott Applewhite/Associated PressVermont Attorney General Charity Clark celebrated a court order Thursday that paused some of the Trump administration’s cuts to AmeriCorps programming. The federal agency facilitates national volunteer service through grants and job placement in six areas: education, environment, disaster preparedness, health, economic opportunity, veterans and military families.In April, President Donald Trump’s administration terminated nearly $400 million in AmeriCorps grants and ordered the reduction of its professional workforce. The agency placed 85% of its federal workforce on leave and informed its professional employees their contracts would be terminated on June 24. In Vermont, the terminated grants accounted for $2.4 million in funding, impacting 200 AmeriCorps volunteer positions related to housing services, food security, school programming, flood recovery and more. Also, the administration dismissed volunteers with the National Civilian Community Corps, which impacted work at a Habitat for Humanity project in Bennington. The cuts prompted Clark to join a coalition of attorneys general from 22 other states and the governors of Kentucky and Pennsylvania in a lawsuit, arguing that the Trump administration acted unlawfully.U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman of Maryland temporarily blocked the termination of grants and ordered the agency to restore AmeriCorps and VISTA volunteers, who work to alleviate poverty by supporting local organizations, within all the states that brought the lawsuit. The judge also stated that the agency must follow legal requirements to provide the public advance notice and the opportunity to comment before major service changes are made.“I am pleased that the Court affirmed our argument that the Trump administration lacks the authority to unilaterally cut AmeriCorps programs. This is a win for the rule of law as well as for Vermont communities, which have been well served by AmeriCorps volunteers for decades,” Clark wrote in a statement.READ MORE
The judge required that AmeriCorps notify award recipients of the order by the end of Friday.Boardman did not provide all the relief that the states sought in their lawsuit. Her order did not affect the Trump administration’s order to put the AmeriCorps’ professional workforce on forced leave or the planned cuts to those federal positions. Also, the court ordered the Trump administration to restore one group — National Civilian Community Corps volunteers, who focus on disaster relief — “to the status quo” prior to April 15. But the order limited the restoration of grants and volunteers through other AmeriCorps programs to those in states that are parties to the lawsuit. In 2024, AmeriCorps volunteers served at over 300 locations across the state, including homeless shelters, youth centers, food banks, schools, veterans’ facilities and other organizations.SerVermont, the State Service Commission for Vermont that oversees the bulk of AmeriCorps programs in the state, declined to further comment Friday.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Federal judge protects AmeriCorps volunteers in Vermont and 22 other states from Trump cuts.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Americorps-generic-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-06 18:07:18.238668

The bills were moved forward by the Senate Judiciary Committee following additional testimony on the reintroduced package – but not before the panel heard emotional testimony from gun violence prevention and safety advocates and gun rights groups, the latter of whom opposed the bills.
Senate Bill 224 would ban bump stocks, devices that let users essentially convert their semi-automatic weapons into rapid firing weapons. A bump stock was one of the primary tools used in the 2017 Las Vegas mass shooting, the deadliest in American history. The U.S. Supreme Court in 2024 struck down federal rules created after the shooting that defined a semi-automatic weapon equipped with a bump stock as an automatic weapon, which was already banned under law.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXThe federal high court’s decision, however, has not deterred Michigan Democrats from seeking ways to ban them at the state level. Michigan would join 17 others in adopting a similar policy.
Sponsored by Sen. Dayna Polehanki (D-Livonia), Senate Bill 224 would add bump stocks to a list of disallowed firearms equipment in Michigan.
“Destructive weapons of war should never have a place in our communities, yet devices that allow individuals to convert a rifle into a functioning machine gun remain legal in our state,” Polehanki said. “And let me be clear: these are not tools for sport or self-defense. Bump stocks are used to inflict maximum harm in seconds, and their continued availability puts every one of our communities at risk. That’s unacceptable, and it’s time for a change.”
Senate Bills 331 and 332, both sponsored by Sen. Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak), would prohibit the purchase, possession and distribution of firearms without valid serial numbers, which are commonly referred as ghost guns because they are untraceable in federal and state firearms registries.
McMorrow’s bill would make a first offense a misdemeanor with a penalty up to a $5,000 fine and one year in prison. Successive offenses would be considered felonies with up to five years in prison and a $10,000 fine.
A member of McMorrow’s staff delivered testimony on Thursday, but in a statement issued following the committee hearing, the senator said ghost guns were designed to deliberately evade accountability, requiring no background checks, no serial numbers and no way to trace them if used to commit a crime.
“As we see law enforcement officers recovering these untraceable firearms at an alarming rate, Michigan can’t afford to wait,” McMorrow said. “Just as rapidly as new weapon production methods emerge and evolve, so too must our laws and public safety efforts. Our communities deserve nothing less.”
Polenaki also sponsored Senate Bills 225 and 226 along with Sen. Rosemary Bayer (D-West Bloomfield).
The bills would make the Michigan Capitol Commission’s open and concealed carry bans law, and would also apply to the Anderson House Office Building and the Binsfeld Senate Office Building.
At least 26 other states have a similar ban in place to maintain the safety of their Capitol grounds.
Bayer during testimony on Thursday recounted the fear she felt when armed protesters stormed Michigan’s Capitol and remained in the Senate chamber’s gallery, which several senators said made them feel intimidated as they voted on important legislation.
“Those types of threats and intimidation have no place in any work environment, especially not one where the work of the people is being done,” Bayer said. “Every day, we have students and teachers, parents and public servants walk the halls of our Capitol. It’s our responsibility to make sure they feel safe doing so, and this legislation will help ensure all people feel safe freely participating in our state’s democracy.” 
Members of Moms Demand Action, Students Demand Action and various other gun safety groups, like Brady and Giffords, testified Thursday in support of the measures, hoping they would keep firearms out of the Capitol and keep ghost guns and bump stocks out of the hands of future mass shooters.
Linda Danders with Moms Demand Action said from the very first time armed extremists showed up at the Capitol to intimidate lawmakers, her group knew there was a real and imminent threat to the safety of Michiganders and the state’s democracy. 
“That’s why we’ve been urging Michigan lawmakers to prohibit guns in the Capitol,” Danders said. “Thanks to the efforts of many in this room, open carry of firearms in the Capitol Building is now prohibited, but there is still a dangerous loophole left for individuals to carry concealed, loaded handguns into and on Capitol grounds, including in this building.”
Tom Lambert, legislative director for Michigan Open Carry, said he was opposed to the package, calling it another episode in the continuing series of “people who hate guns, don’t know what they’re talking about and they don’t care,” referring to Senate Democrats’ push for greater gun control.
“You have serious Second Amendment issues, you also have serious Fifth Amendment issues. Not only are you taking lawfully possessed property that people acquire lawfully and possess lawfully today and you’re prohibiting it, you’re in the alternative requiring them to deface these items that, again, lawfully, do not have a serial number on them,” Lambert said of the ghost guns bill. “If you put one of these federally regulated serial numbers on them, you will decrease the value of those items, some of which are worth a significant amount, which constitutes a Fifth Amendment taking.”

Lambert insinuated that could lead to legal consequences for the state that could cost a lot. 
“I hope we put [that] in the budget to pay for all that stuff,” he said.
In response to emotional testimony from a student, Sen. Sue Shink (D-Northland Township) said no young person should have to worry about the threat of gun violence.
“Quite frankly, at my age, it’s not something I should have to worry about either,” Shink said. “And I’ll just tell you, and also so that the people who are from those gun organizations know that, yeah, it’s scary to know that they’re out there pushing violence and pushing fear on people who just want to live in peace, who just want to be left alone to pursue their life, liberty and happiness. It’s bullshit. You shouldn’t have to put up with it.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Facetune_22-04-2025-13-44-27-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-06-06 18:07:18.238668

However, an expanded state water contact advisory for the river from elevated bacteria levels, issued on Thursday, remains in effect.
The new warning extends an already-existing advisory for the Pearl River — which since 2019 has ranged from the northern tip of Hinds County to Byram — to the Na Sandifer Memorial Highway Bridge just north of Monticello, in total stretching over 60 miles. The Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality cautions against contact with the river — such as swimming, wading and fishing — in the affected areas until further notice. 
“This expansion of the advisory is based on test results showing the potential for human health risk well beyond the original advisory zone,” said MDEQ Executive Director Chris Wells in a Thursday press release. “We continue monitoring the situation and conducting additional testing to determine the full extent of the impact.”

MDEQ told Mississippi Today on Friday that, based on JXN Water’s information, between 10 millionto 20 million gallons of untreated sewage entered the Pearl River per day during the malfunction. Over nine days, that would equal 90 millionto 180 million gallons total. For reference, there were 41 sanitary sewer overflows (or SSOs) at the West Bank Interceptor between the start of the year and March 31, according to JXN Water’s quarterly report, totaling around 5 million gallons.
“While this is one of the most extensive water contact advisories we’ve issued in recent years, we do not anticipate that the expanded advisory will remain in place long-term,” said MDEQ Communications Director Jan Schaefer. “The release has been stopped, and we expect bacteria levels to begin to normalize through natural biological processes and dilution.”
According to JXN Water, the city’s third-party utility in charge of its sewer and drinking water infrastructure, its contractors discovered a “catastrophic failure” at the West Bank Interceptor where it crosses Hanging Moss Creek on May 28. The city has long struggled with that facility, which is the main transmission line to the Savanna Street Wastewater Treatment Plant, dating back at least to its 2012 consent decree with the Environmental Protection Agency. JXN Water also attributed the recent issue in part to “severe and rapid erosion” along the river’s banks near the interceptor because of heavy rain this spring.
As a temporary fix, the utility’s contracted crews put in four bypass pumps to redirect wastewater through nearly 4,000 feet of piping. JXN Water said the long term fix requires repairs to two damaged interceptors, estimating a cost of over $7.5 million. The cost of the temporary measures, including diesel for the pumps and rental equipment, will be around $300,000 a month, the utility said.

JXN Water spokesperson Aisha Carson said the utility will use its operations budget to pay those costs, as the large infusion of federal funding it received is largely reserved for drinking water repairs. The utility is working with the EPA to secure emergency funding, Carson added.
U.S. District Court Judge Henry Wingate placed control of the sewer system under JXN Water in 2023. One of the priority projects included in the order is to rehabilitate the West Bank Interceptor.

According to state records, the facility has been fined $2,750 due to the staff being unable to demonstrate the skills and techniques necessary to manage residents’ behavior, and failing to provide residents with nursing services required to meet their needs.
In one incident, a resident who had complained of acute abdominal pain in March was sent to the emergency room of a hospital where it was discovered he had swallowed a plastic spoon. An endoscopy was then performed to remove the spoon.

State inspectors allege Woodward officials investigated the matter and reviewed video footage that showed the resident, who was to receive one-on-one monitoring from the staff, sitting at the dining room table and putting a spoon in his mouth and down his throat. The footage allegedly showed the worker assigned to watch him left the area at least once.
Inspectors reported, without elaborating, that the video footage was “unavailable” for them to review.
The resident suffered from pica – the practice of eating inedible objects – and had previously swallowed batteries, coins and rocks. A Ziploc bag containing plastic straws and spoons was found in his bedroom after the incident involving the spoon.
In the second incident, a resident of the home was transported to the hospital the evening of March 17, 2025, a day and a half after the staff had noticed one knee was bruised, swollen and unable to bear weight.
The home’s administrator of nursing later confirmed the staff should have notified Woodward’s physician on the morning of March 16, 2025, when they first became aware of the injury.

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)Her career is ending amid legislative attacks on her profession, but Jodi Fick still thinks “the sky’s the limit” for libraries.
Fick has been working in libraries since 1983 and has led Siouxland Libraries’ 13 branch locations in Sioux Falls and the surrounding area since 2017. She’s retiring on June 20.
South Dakota lawmakers nearly passed a bill earlier this year that would have subjected librarians to criminal prosecution for disseminating obscene books to children. The failed proposal was replaced with a requirement that school and public libraries allow appeals of their obscenity determinations.

State law says material is obscene if it “appeals to the prurient interest,” is patently offensive because it affronts contemporary community standards relating to the description or representation of sado-masochistic abuse or sexual conduct, and lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.
Fick expressed faith that libraries will survive the scrutiny. “The pressures on libraries ebb and flow, depending on what’s going on in society,” she said, adding that the public’s right to access a broad variety of information usually prevails. 
Fick grew up in Mobridge. She earned a bachelor’s degree from Augustana University in Sioux Falls and a master’s in library science from Emporia State University in Kansas. Her library career began with a work-study position at Augustana’s Mikkelsen Library.
After completing her education, she joined the Minnehaha County Rural Public Library as assistant director in 1990, a role she held until a 1995 merger. That year, the Sioux Falls city library system merged with the county library system to form what is now Siouxland Libraries.
When Siouxland Libraries was created, Fick transitioned into the new system as a senior librarian. In 2007, she was promoted to assistant director, and in 2017, she was appointed as the director.
The area served by Siouxland Libraries grew in population from 124,915 in 1995 to 250,551 in 2024. The annual circulation — the number of times materials are checked out — rose from 1.1 million to 2.1 million over that period.
The following conversation with Fick has been edited for length and clarity.
How has the function of a library in a community changed since you started? 
How our libraries function has evolved somewhat. Before the internet, we had huge reference collections. Just ranges and ranges of books that provided valuable information, but it wasn’t like something you’d take home and read. It was, you come, we help you find the information you need, and you go on. Well, once we had the internet, that information became readily available. Of course, you still want to ensure the source can be trusted, and that’s another skill we still provide – knowing how to know if the source is reliable. Is it vetted? Has it been edited? Libraries also have searchable databases of reliable information. 
What is the future of libraries?
The sky’s the limit. When I started, we barely had computers. I was hired originally to automate the library, and we were still using the old card catalog system. The ability for you to even know what books existed was next to nothing, which was a very different library from today. You would come to the library, browse the collection, and go home with things. 
Now, you can sit at home on your phone, browse, and you can even check it out through your local library app and start consuming the information.
I think that books and knowledge will continue to be the core of what libraries are, because we are the gatherers of that knowledge, and make it available to our community to consume. 
But I also see that we hold an important part in being that “third place.”
So, you have places you’re at where you can simply be:  home, work or that “third place,” where you’re not required to buy a meal or pay for something. This is a spot where you can come to, and you can gather with others, you can use meeting room space, or you can just be, that is outside of your home and your workplace, because the community has created these branches that are a spot for you to come to. So, we’re that “third place.” 
There’s a sociologist who calls libraries “palaces for the people.” And I like that image. Libraries are living, breathing things.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
I think over the years, what I have seen is that librarians are staying in tune with the community, trying to understand what the needs are, and then adapting our services to what that community needs at that time. Of course, within our range. At one time, we were the spot to get your IRS tax warrants. Other times, we are helping people find jobs.
I think as long as libraries are reflective of what their community needs, they will continue to be successful. But that also means that what a public library is in South Dakota is, well, there are hundreds of different variations. The answer depends on what the community needs and is.
What did you make of the recent legislative proposal that would have criminalized librarians who check out obscene materials to minors? 
What was interesting was that, as a library, we don’t collect obscene materials. Why was this deemed necessary at all? I don’t know. I wasn’t asked about it. But we don’t collect materials that fit the legal definition of obscenity.
Let’s say we did have obscene materials – which, of course, we don’t – that law would have said that if my job required me to check out this material upon request, and I did it, I would no longer have the protection of “I was just doing my job.” 
Now, the risk to us is slim, but I honestly don’t understand where it was coming from. 
My concern, as the director of the public library, is that it created a picture that library staff are here trying to cause harm to our children in our community, which is so far from what librarians are doing. 
How do you approach the balance between community standards and the library’s role in providing access to a wide range of information, particularly when facing pressures to restrict certain content?
We lean back on the policies that have been set by the library boards. 
Since our inception, we’ve had policies that tell us what we are supposed to collect. So, everything that we do is based on policies that have been developed over the years, not just as practices, but how we provide collections for our communities. Specifically, we have a collection development policy. It defines who selects, who’s responsible for it, what are the criteria we use when we’re selecting, and both for adding and removing materials, or if we find that there’s things in our collections that aren’t appropriate for our collection. So that’s all laid out.

For Siouxland Libraries, the policies are all set by the Siouxland Libraries Board of Trustees. And they are basing a lot of it on freedom of speech rights. So, the First Amendment rights for people to have access to a wide variety of thoughts. 
When we’re selecting, we also do a lot of analysis of what people are using. And we pay attention to the high-use items, low-use items, and also what people are asking us questions about and try to build a collection that’s based on that. 
And there are just certain subjects that are also going to be more sensitive. One in particular is human reproduction, especially when you get into children’s non-fiction. We recognize that can be a very sensitive topic for people. But we have families who come to us wanting resources that can help them when they’re trying to have those conversations with their children. And different families have different expectations for what types of information is appropriate, because parents know their own children best. 
I’m a parent. I have two children. They’re now adults, but I very much remember when it came time to “have the talk,” and make sure that they understood their bodies, and what was going on. 
What I did not want was children living their lives with a lack of knowledge, or misinformed, or ashamed. Most of our families who come in, they want to be able to present information to their children accurately. How that information is presented will vary. Some want details, others want the birds and the bees analogies. So, we have materials that present a variety of viewpoints.
Do you think it’s important that libraries provide access to books that include sexual content that some find offensive? Why?
Look, there will be books that have difficult scenes. Is this obscenity or not obscenity? Well, the term has a pretty narrow legal definition. 
But why are these books important? Often, you’ll see this in teen books or “coming-of-age” books.
A coming-of-age book has a teen dealing with a specific issue, and they grow through the experience, and there’s a resolution. The books are designed to help teens navigate something. Now, why are they navigating things that they’re not going through? Because those things are happening within their communities. It might not be to them specifically, but how much more important is it that they’ve thought about a situation before they’re in the middle of it – they see someone resolve through it? The person in the book may or may not have done what you’d want them to do, but they’re learning from that experience. 
Teens grow into adults. They go through difficult things, and those types of books help them learn about the environment around them. You learn how to deal with situations without actually experiencing that situation. You have a chance to consider things in your head before you’re put into situations that you’re not prepared to handle. 
The pressures on libraries ebb and flow, depending on what’s going on in society. I have files of other times when there have been similar things. In the late ’90s, it was movies. Our library has movies that are G-rated to R-rated. A child might take that home and watch it.
Well, we have been very much supported by our community and by the parents in our community saying, “What a child checks out is to be regulated by the parent.” A child can’t get a library card without a parent’s permission. A parent has full access to what their child is checking out. We very much encourage coming with your child to the library. We support parents’ rights to be the parent.
What are you most proud of?
I’m most proud of how many people continue to use the library.
People are coming, and they’re coming in more and more. The compliments that we receive, the numbers of people who say, “I love the library, I don’t know what my life would be like without access to this.”

Free.,Wrongly deported Maryland man Abrego Garcia returned to U.S.,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/wrongly-deported-maryland-man-abrego-garcia-returned-us,,"WASHINGTON — Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man wrongly deported to his native El Salvador three months ago, was brought back to the U.S. on Friday and will face federal charges, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said.Abrego Garcia’s case had become a flashpoint in a debate over what due process rights protect immigrants from deportation after federal officials conceded he was sent to a notorious El Salvador mega-prison because of an administrative error. Still, President Donald Trump, El Salvador President Nayib Bukele, Bondi and other administration officials said for months Abrego Garcia could not be released because of criminal conduct they had not publicly produced evidence of.Bondi said Friday a federal warrant for Abrego Garcia’s arrest on human trafficking charges compelled his release from the Salvadoran prison system.“Abrego Garcia has landed in the United States to face justice,” Bondi said at a Department of Justice news conference Friday afternoon. “He was a smuggler of humans and women and children.”The 10-page indictment filed in the Middle District of Tennessee comes after a federal grand jury indicted him on May 21 for allegedly transporting migrants in the U.S. without legal authorization within the country.Chris Newman, an attorney representing the Abrego Garcia family said at a virtual press event Friday that he remained skeptical of the federal charges lodged at Abrego Garcia.“I can tell you that we should all treat whatever charges that are being leveled against him with a high degree of suspicion,” Newman said. “We should make sure that he gets a fair (trial) in court because he’s clearly not getting a fair hearing in the court of public opinion.”Bondi did not detail when the investigation in Abrego Garcia began, but said the federal indictment charges contained “recently found facts.”“This is what American justice looks like upon completion of his sentence, we anticipate he will be returned to his home country of El Salvador,” Bondi said.Outcry over due processAbrego Garcia’s wrongful deportation to the notorious mega-prison Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT, drew national outcry as the Trump administration clashed with a federal court that ordered the return of the Beltsville man and resisted the U.S. Supreme Court’s order to “facilitate” his return.Despite the orders, Trump administration officials did not appear to take any public steps to secure Abrego Garcia’s release, and at times seemed to relish their defiance of the courts.Bondi thanked El Salvador’s government Friday for releasing Abrego Garcia in compliance with the warrant.The Trump administration has argued in federal court in Maryland for months that Abrego Garcia is in the custody of El Salvador and therefore cannot be returned, despite a $15 million agreement between the U.S. and the Salvadoran government to keep roughly 300 men removed from the U.S. and detained at CECOT. Abrego Garcia had been moved to a different El Salvador prison prior to his release.Abrego Gacia had deportation protections to his home country of El Salvador since 2019.He was pulled over by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in March and informed that his immigration status had changed. He was later placed on one of three deportation flights on March 15 to CECOT.The Trump administration admitted his removal was an “administrative error” but has since alleged that Abrego Garcia was a leader in the MS-13 gang without producing evidence in the federal civil court overseeing the suit challenging his removal.Maryland U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen, who traveled to El Salvador to press for Abrego Garcia’s release and return to the U.S., welcomed the news as a victory for due process rights.“As I have repeatedly said, this is not about the man, it’s about his constitutional rights – and the rights of all,” the Maryland Democrat said in a statement. “The Administration will now have to make its case in the court of law, as it should have all along.”William J.

The region is among the areas meant to benefit from the BEAD program for rural broadband access. (Photo by Melissa Sue Gerrits/Getty Images)The Trump administration on Friday released revised rules for a federal program meant to widely expand broadband access, stripping the Biden-era effort of many key requirements and making it easier for Elon Musk’s company to win grants.
Under the revised guidelines, the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment Program, known as BEAD, will take a technology-neutral approach to expanding broadband access rather than focusing on fiber internet. The original program favored fiber because of its speed, reliability and ability to reach remote locations.
The change opens the door for more internet providers to use BEAD grants for technologies including satellite internet service, which is provided by Elon Musk’s Starlink. Under the new rules, Starlink could receive $10 billion to $20 billion in BEAD money, up from $4.1 billion the company would have received under the original rules, according to The Wall Street Journal.
Groups applying for BEAD funding also will no longer be required to offer a low-cost service option for internet users in locations they are serving. Some states had proposed services as low as $30 a month.
Instead, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration now encourages internet providers to propose their “existing, market driven low-cost plans” to meet the cost requirement.
A lagging broadband program faces more delays as Trump plans changes

As part of the Trump administration’s push to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives within the government, the new guidelines also remove provisions that encouraged states to work with companies and representatives from minority communities. Requirements related to labor, the environment and climate change also were cut.
And the agency eliminated a provision of the original program that encouraged states to seek out non-traditional providers, including municipalities or political subdivisions that provide internet service.
Louisiana’s, Nevada’s and Delaware’s proposals, which had been approved, will be rescinded.
U.S. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick promised to launch a rigorous review of the BEAD program in March, saying in a statement that because of “woke mandates, favoritism towards certain technologies and burdensome regulations, the program has not connected a single person to the internet and is in dire need of a readjustment.”
In April, the Trump administration gave states an additional 90 days to submit their final plans for the $42.45 billion program in anticipation of the changes, further delaying an effort that’s set to go back to the planning phase after more than three years.
Evan Feinman, the former director of the BEAD program, said states will now have to rework their proposals again.
“For some reason, [Secretary] Lutnick, who said the program was going too slowly, wants to slow the program down much more, force states and the private sector to do a ton of extra work and spend a bunch of extra taxpayer money all so we can get worse connections to people that will cost them more every month,” he said.
The Internet & Television Association, a trade association representing the broadband and cable industries, praised the new guidelines in a statement, saying, “We welcome changes to the BEAD program that will make the program more efficient and eliminate onerous requirements, which add unnecessary costs that impede broadband deployment efforts.”
But Drew Garner, the director of policy engagement at the Benton Institute for Broadband & Society, said in a statement that the changes will “cement the digital divide for decades.” The Benton Institute is a nonprofit organization championing digital access for all.
“[Lutnick] is hurting our economic competitiveness, our healthcare and education, and our ability to work and stay connected with loved ones,” Garner said in the statement. “He is denying rural Americans access to the modern economy and our increasingly connected world.”

After a pandemic-era pause, repayments on defaulted student loans restarted last month, and many borrowers are running into barriers. (Seth Wenig/The Associated Press)Over the past few months, Celina Damian’s phone has been ringing off the hook with one bewildered, anxious question after another: “What kind of loan is this?” “Am I in default?” “Will the government really take my wages?”
“Sometimes they just don’t know where to start,” said Damian, California’s student loan servicing ombudsperson.
“I’m talking to borrowers from all ages, from new borrowers to — I have 80-, 90-year-old borrowers,” she said.
The federal government last month restarted collections on defaulted loans. State student loan ombudspersons such as Damian have become some of the only sources of contact for worried borrowers lost in a tangle of conflicting information at the federal level about their loan status and repayment options.
The U.S. Department of Education began collecting on defaulted student loans in May for the first time since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020.
Federal student loans issued by the U.S. Department of Education come with fixed rates, set repayment plans and borrower protections. Private servicers handle billing, repayment-plan enrollments and defaults.
More than 5 million borrowers are in delinquency, and nearly 10 million — about 25% of the federal student loan portfolio — are at risk of default within months, according to data from the U.S. Department of Education.
States can’t cancel that debt, but they do register and oversee servicers operating in their states, run ombuds offices, tweak tax rules and offer outreach or limited grants — actions aimed at reducing defaults and the economic fallout.
Universities try 3-year degrees to save students time, money

When borrowers default, states will likely feel the economic impact. They might lose tax revenue as homebuying stalls. They could end up paying more for Medicaid and social services if borrowers need to rely on them. And students with loan debt may be reluctant to go into lower-paying public-sector work, leading to staffing shortages at state agencies.
A borrower is considered delinquent after missing a payment to the servicing companies that handle billing, repayment plan enrollments, and defaults.
Damian’s office, established under California’s Student Borrower Bill of Rights, began as a narrow statutory role but now serves as a hub for outreach, “Student Loan 101” workshops and escalated complaints to federal agencies.
Roughly 16 states plus the District of Columbia have followed suit, creating ombuds offices to guide borrowers through confusing paperwork and misinformation. Damian believes these ombuds offices should be in every state, as borrowers across the country will likely have similar questions and little help at the federal level.
“If you don’t have an ombudsperson or even just a person at the state level who can educate borrowers, that will make a difference,” Damian told Stateline. “These borrowers are trying to pay, but the system is broken. No other financial product works this way.”
Student loans became a key issue during last year’s election race, with President Joe Biden blocked by the U.S. Supreme Court in his effort to offer relief to 40 million Americans. In its waning days, his administration did forgive loans for some 150,000 borrowers under previous programs.
But President Donald Trump opposes most loan forgiveness programs, and in May, the U.S. Education Department issued a “Dear Colleague” letter to higher education institutions, reminding them of their legal obligations to help former students understand repayment responsibilities and access support.










These borrowers are trying to pay, but the system is broken. No other financial product works this way.


– Celina Damian, California student loan servicing ombudsperson


Some conservative economists say that federal loan forgiveness and financial aid hurt all students, offering colleges an incentive to raise tuition or lower their own institutional aid.
Winston Berkman-Breen, the legal director at the Student Borrower Protection Center, a nonprofit aimed at protecting borrowers and improving the repayment system, said that more than 2 million borrowers are stuck in a backlog of unprocessed applications for income-driven repayment (IDR) plans — calculated pay structures meant to keep payments affordable based on a borrower’s income.
Other borrowers have called federal agencies for help only to find that U.S. Education Department staff, including servicer-oversight teams, have been laid off as the Trump administration works toward dismantling the department entirely.
“There was an expectation to repay,” Berkman-Breen said. “But there was also an expectation that people would have access to affordable plans. That promise has broken down.”
States now have three primary tools to address student loan debt, Berkman-Breen said: enforcement actions to protect consumers, such as the 39-state lawsuit against servicer Navient; legal oversight by suing to uphold or challenge federal policy; and direct outreach to help public servants access Public Service Loan Forgiveness and similar programs.
Nineteen states now require registration for companies that service student loans, he said. And more than a dozen states align with federal policy to exempt forgiven loan balances from state income taxes.
 ‘Can’t wait for Washington’

Connecticut state Rep. Eleni Kavros DeGraw, a Democrat, calls student debt “a drag on the economy,” and said states can’t afford to wait for Congress — mired in partisan gridlock over student loan forgiveness — to find common ground.
“[Student debt] is stopping people from buying homes, starting families and fully participating in the economy,” she told Stateline. “That hurts us as a state, as a city, and we can’t wait for Washington to figure it out.”
Last year, Connecticut created a bipartisan reimbursement program that provides up to $20,000 for graduates of local colleges who make payments and complete community service. The state has distributed more than $2 million so far.
More public colleges admit high schoolers even before they’ve applied

Kavros DeGraw hopes the program can serve as a model, and has already talked with lawmakers in other states on possibly developing their own versions of it.
“These were people who were already paying,” Kavros DeGraw said. “It just made sense. I think it’s something that other states could explore this session, and it would provide an immense deal of relief.”
Lawmakers in other states also have considered student loan legislation. This year, New Jersey introduced bills to register education lenders and cap interest rates. Lawmakers in New Mexico, New York and North Carolina have proposed Borrower Bill of Rights legislation. Arizona has a registration bill for private servicers. None of these measures has advanced far.
According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, more than 20 states have enacted laws expanding loan forgiveness, repayment programs and servicer oversight in recent years.
Several states are also investing directly in workforce-aligned loan forgiveness: Georgia expanded its service-cancelable loan program to cover dental students working in rural areas. Idaho created a loan repayment incentive for rural nurses. Kentucky now offers $5,000 stipends to attract new teachers. Maryland authorized Anne Arundel County to launch a local forgiveness program for public school educators.
 Repayment

Student loan stress is not evenly distributed. Seven states, all with Republican‐controlled legislatures, report delinquency rates above 30% among borrowers required to make payments.
Mississippi leads the nation with a conditional delinquency rate of nearly 45% — meaning borrowers who should be making payments are late. That’s just ahead of Alabama, West Virginia, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana, all of which have rates above 31%, according to recent data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
By contrast, Illinois, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Vermont and New Hampshire maintain delinquency rates below 15%.
Experts say this chasm reflects deeper systemic differences, such as lower median incomes in higher delinquency states, along with weaker consumer protections and a higher share of students attending for-profit institutions or leaving college without a degree.
States also have promoted the federal Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, established in 2007, that offers help to public service professionals. New Mexico has an outreach campaign that includes prospective teachers and health care workers. Maine has provided guidance to public defenders on how they can take advantage of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program and touts a related state tax credit on a marketing site to lure new residents.
Transparency bills seek to reveal the true costs of college

“States can regulate and enforce, but they can’t fix the structural problems in how repayment is administered,” said Michele Zampini, senior director of college affordability at The Institute for College Access & Success, a research organization that advocates for students. “They’re helping around the edges, but the core system is still broken.”
A November report from the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau found at least 3.9 million borrowers received misleading or inaccurate bills from servicing companies.
“The repayment system is not in a good place to provide the services and repayment options borrowers are legally entitled to,” Zampini said.
The Student Loan Borrower Survey, conducted between October 2023 and January 2024, found that 61% of borrowers who received debt relief made a beneficial life change earlier than they otherwise could have. Yet borrower awareness remains dangerously low: Nearly 42% of federal borrowers have only been on the standard repayment plan, and 31% of those didn’t know other options, such as an income-based plan, existed.
In California, a major part of Damian’s job in the past few months has been to help borrowers access existing forgiveness programs.
Meanwhile, new federal policy proposals could reshape repayment entirely. The Trump-backed One Big Beautiful Bill Act would consolidate existing IDR plans into a single tiered structure, with lower-income borrowers paying flat monthly rates and higher earners contributing 8% of their income. The bill also proposes extending standard repayment terms to 30 years — raising concerns it could delay forgiveness and inflate total interest costs.
The bill passed the U.S. House and is pending in the Senate.
 ‘Incentive to hike prices’

Andrew Gillen, a Cato Institute research fellow who recently testified before Congress, argues that any meaningful fix must address the incentives driving rising tuition — namely, federal aid being tied directly to college sticker prices.
“The link between rising tuition and increasing aid is what drives the Bennett Hypothesis, where federal student aid, in the form of loans, can lead to higher tuition costs at colleges and universities,” Gillen said in an interview. “If we instead use the median cost of attendance to calculate aid eligibility, we remove colleges’ incentive to hike prices just to capture more aid.”
Even without agreement on blanket forgiveness, experts agree on smaller bipartisan steps: streamlined repayment, stronger servicer oversight and targeted help for borrowers with the greatest need.
“We don’t want people defaulting. We don’t want payments that are too high for people just out of school. That should be the bipartisan starting point,” Zampini said.

The first batch of Missouri’s summer food benefits for children were issued on Thursday night, a spokesperson for the Department of Social Services told The Independent Friday. Each eligible child will receive a one-time benefit of $120, loaded onto a card that can be used like a debit card to buy groceries.
The program is designed to help low-income families pay for food during summer months. States pay 50% of the administrative costs and the federal government pays 100% of the benefits. 
It’s part of a permanent federal program in its second year of existence called Summer Electronic Benefits Transfer, or SUN Bucks. The program aims to help kids who receive subsidized school meals avoid a summer drop-off in nutrition.
The state in years past has struggled to get the benefits out to cover the summer months. Last year they didn’t begin going out until September, due to technical issues, the state said at the time. 
Food security advocates in the state were relieved when Missouri opted into the program after weighing factors like technology issues and staffing.
There were 11 Republican-led states that opted not to offer the program this year, and a 12th, Oklahoma, will offer it only to tribal nations. 
Most eligible families in Missouri will receive the benefits automatically. 
The following groups of kids are automatically eligible, and their families will not need to apply for benefits: 

Students who are eligible for free or reduced-price lunch during the school year,
Households already enrolled in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) or temporary assistance,
And children between ages 7 and 17 in foster care, who are experiencing homelessness or are migrants.

Those benefits will be issued on an existing card if the family is enrolled in SNAP benefits or temporary assistance, or on a new mailed card if they are not. Families who need a new EBT card can request one by phone or the ebtEDGE mobile app.
Families who are not automatically eligible must submit an application online by Aug. 31. The state’s eligibility navigator will tell families whether they must apply.
Benefits will expire 122 days after they are issued, regardless of usage, so families must act quickly once the benefits are distributed. They should also keep the cards for next summer’s program, the state’s website advises.
An estimated 475,000 Missouri kids could receive the benefits, according to a letter to the state from the federal Food and Nutrition Service earlier this year.

Employees and the health center are continuing to spar about who exactly has the right to join the newly formed Hospice United.

Hospice staff at another University of Vermont Health Network subsidiary have voted to unionize, also becoming a part of AFT-Vermont. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerHospice staff at the University of Vermont Health Network Home Health & Hospice voted overwhelmingly in favor of formalizing their union on Thursday after roughly six months of organizing.The vote came as hospice employees and management at the nonprofit subsidiary of the UVM Health Network have continued to spar before the National Labor Relations Board over who exactly has the right to join Hospice United, which will operate under the umbrella of AFT-Vermont. “Hospice care is unique in the fact that the team model is interdisciplinary, so it’s only natural to all of us that our bargaining unit would represent all of the voices of the team,” said Nell Smith, who works as a volunteer coordinator for UVMHN Home Health & Hospice. “I have trust that that will happen.” UVM Health Network Home Health & Hospice provides long-term care for people with severe health needs, as well as palliative and hospice care for people with terminal illnesses. Hospice United will only represent employees who contribute to the hospice side of the organization’s operations.Organizers maintain that the union should encompass roughly 85 hospice employees, including nurses, social workers, chaplains and bereavement coordinators, among other staff members. Management, meanwhile, contends that about 15 of those employees should be excluded from the union, arguing that some of those positions — such as chaplains and bereavement coordinators — do not have the right to collectively bargain with the rest of the unit.According to Emma Galvin, an organizer with AFT-Vermont, 56 staff members voted 49-7 to formalize the union. Also, 13 additional employees voted “under challenge,” meaning that, because the hospital administration is currently challenging their right to be in the unit, their votes would have only been tallied in the case of a close vote. As employees and administrators at UVMHN Home Health & Hospice continue to dispute the scope of the union, both groups will begin to look toward negotiating their first bargaining agreement. “Throughout this process, HHH has focused on ensuring hospice staff had an opportunity to have their voices heard,” said a statement released by the UVMHN Home Health & Hospice. “We believe the election administered on-site by the National Labor Relations Board met that goal and expect to be in contact with the union soon to begin negotiating in good faith a collective bargaining agreement.”AFT-Vermont currently represents over 11,000 health care and higher education workers in Vermont, a number that has grown sharply in recent years as large swaths of the state’s health care workforce have sought to organize for better wages and working conditions. Over 100 nurses at the Northwest Medical Center in St. Albans unionized in February as a part of AFT-Vermont.The union now represents all seven locations within the University of Vermont Health Network, which includes three hospitals in Vermont and three hospitals in New York as well as the home health and hospice organization. In 2023, over 2,000 support and technical staff at the UVM Medical Center joined the Vermont Federation of Nurses and Health Professionals, nearly doubling the size of Vermont’s largest health care union, which falls under the penumbra of AFT-Vermont. Later that year, over 300 nurses and technical staff at Central Vermont Medical Center voted to join AFT-Vermont as well.In March 2024, a similar number of support and technical staff at Porter Medical Center, the third Vermont hospital in the health network, also joined the union.Read the story on VTDigger here:  UVM Health Network hospice employees vote to unionize.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/uvmmc-nurses-strike-4-20240702-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-06-06 18:07:18.238668

(Photo by Patrick Lohmann / Source NM)Antonio Chairez Rios stepped out from behind a gate enclosing the local Immigration and Customs Enforcement office south of Albuquerque on Friday, prompting cheers from several dozen activists who had been waiting three hours to learn whether he would be detained and eventually deported.  
His release late Friday morning meant the grandfather of two — if only for a few more days  — would not be sent away from the country he’s lived in for at least 20 years. 
For the last nine years, Chairez Rios, an immigrant from Mexico, has dutifully attended every annual check-in appointment with Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, each time securing a stay of deportation, according to his attorney Rebecca Kitson.
His next check-in had been scheduled for September, but authorities abruptly re-scheduled it a few days ago for 9 a.m. on Friday, Kitson said. That was not a good sign, she said. 
She assumed the check-in really served as a way for ICE agents to rack up another deportation without having to go through the trouble of arresting someone at their home or in public. 
News reports elsewhere and reports from her colleagues suggest ICE is increasingly arresting people at annual check-ins, with agents no longer allowed or willing to use discretion or consider the details of individual cases when deciding whether to arrest and deport someone, she said.

“From the indications that we received, we were pretty clear that their intent is to arrest everyone now,” she said. “It’s really just easier to arrest people who show up.”
Chairez Rios was deported in 2006 but then re-entered the country after he received photos showing that his two young daughters were living on the streets of Albuquerque with their mother, who was addicted to drugs, Kitson said.
“In his mind there was no other choice” but to return, Kitson said. “Eventually, he got here and was granted full custody of his children because there was no one else, because they were in severe danger.”
Since returning to take care of his kids, a judge issued a stay of deportation repeatedly, allowing him to raise his daughters and work. He took a tough construction job and suffered a traumatic brain injury after falling 20 feet onto concrete, Kitson said. He was briefly in a coma from the injury, she said.
ICE ‘disappeared’ 48 New Mexico residents, attorneys say

The exploitation he suffered as an undocumented immigrant in the construction industry prompted Kitson to seek what’s known as a “T visa” on his behalf, which are temporary visas for victims of human trafficking.
The fact that the visa application remains pending marks one reason she hoped Chairez Rios and the attorney who accompanied him to the check-in could argue he be allowed to stay in the United States a little bit longer, she said. 
Soon after Kitson learned that Chairez Rios’s check-in had been re-scheduled, she sounded the alarm to various immigration advocacy groups. Despite the short notice, nearly 100 people showed up at the ICE office, chanting and picketing for several hours. 
Chairez Rios arrived with his daughters and two grand-kids about half an hour before the check-in, smiling and wiping tears from his eyes as he saw the crowd gathered with signs that said “Keep Antonio here!” 
He walked into the HSI office holding a grandson in his arms, taking a final look back at the crowd before what could be his last time in the U.S. According to Kitson, deportation would mean he’d have to stay in Mexico for at least 10 years before he had any legal way of returning.

According to Kitson, the events that unfolded over the next two and a half hours in a nondescript government office provided an increasingly rare reprieve from President Donald Trump’s new mass deportation push.
Chairez Rios’s legal team fought against an apparent detention order, Kitson said, which she described as an informal appeal that made its way up through several supervisors stationed outside of Albuquerque, Kitson said. 
ICE supervisors were still considering the appeal by 11:30 a.m. or so. That’s about the time they gave Chairez Rios the choice of leaving the office with an ankle monitor on or staying and waiting for a decision. 
Kitson’s best guess is that Chairez Rios will still be arrested and deported, she said. And she said he’ll be paranoid in the coming weeks about when agents could come to arrest him. But that didn’t happen Friday, she said, which is a win by itself.

Chairez Rios spoke briefly to reporters and activists, gesturing to the device on his ankle and offering gratitude to the people who waited and chanted and prayed for him. 
“They don’t have a decision yet, but I do feel powerless because it seems unfair to me that one who is not a criminal is waiting after 20 years working here,” he said in Spanish. “I would like to have a chance, because all my family is from here, my daughters, my grandchildren.”
He said agents scheduled another check-in for September, but they told him that he could be arrested at any time between now and then.

,Mississippi Today,2025-06-06 21:18:16+00:00,Mississippi Today,Jackson State alums demand open dialogue with Mississippi college board,Candice Wilder,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/06/06/jackson-state-alums-demand-open-dialogue-with-mississippi-college-board/,A group of Jackson State alumni has launched a letter-writing campaign seeking accountability and transparency in the president search process.,"Jackson State University alums are blowing up Mississippi lawmakers and the state’s college board inboxes with one clear message: Give us a fair and transparent president search. 
Thee 1877 Project launched an email campaign “For a Better JSU” this week asking faculty, students and supporters of the historically Black university to send e-letters to hold the Institutions of Higher Learning board responsible for the school’s last three picks for president and what it calls its failure to create an open and inclusive search for school leadership. The group is not affiliated with the JSU National Alumni Association. 
The effort comes after the announcement of former president Marcus Thompson’s resignation with no explanation. The news was a disappointment to many state lawmakers and alumni last month who felt whiplash from his departure, a familiar situation experienced with his predecessor, Thomas Hudson, who also resigned without explanation. Thompson’s resignation marked the university’s third leadership turnover in less than a decade. Thompson’s predecessor, William Bynum, also resigned following his arrest on a prostitution solicitation charge.
“For too long the leadership selection process at JSU has failed the institution and its stakeholders. It has bred instability, eroded public trust, damaged our university’s reputation and squandered taxpayer dollars,” the campaign’s website states. “These are not minor missteps— they are systemic failures. The process has lacked transparency, inclusivity and consistency that any respected academic institution should demand.” 
In a personalized email sent to IHL Commissioner Al Rankins and board members, Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves and several state House and Senate lawmakers including Chris Bell, Greg Holloway, Sollie Norwood, Grace Butler Washington, Rob Roberson and Dennis DeBar, the group urges the following:  

A public acknowledgement and statement from board members addressing its failures of previous president search processes and lessons they have learned before the next national search 
A national search of the university leadership of the “highest caliber” 
A transparent president search and process that includes input from students, faculty, alumni and community members 

The group said its goal is to get 1,000 individuals to participate in the campaign before IHL’s next board meeting, June 19. As of June 6, 500 emails have been sent according to Mark Dawson, a spokesperson for the group. He said the group plans to expand its campaign in the coming weeks to include additional emails to officials such as State Auditor Shad White and Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann. 
“We need to let them know this process they have in place is not good,” Dawson said. 
The campaign is also filling a void for alumni who are frustrated by JSUNAA’s silence and inaction. Many have begun to question the association’s role and its leadership when it comes to advocating for the university’s future. 
Last month, JSUNAA President Patrease Edwards, shared a statement asking alumni to refrain from public comment and speak positively about the university after Thompson’s departure. 
When rumors circulated that IHL had selected a new president and Edwards was asked to send a letter to alumni on the selection and reasons the board did not open up a candidate search this week, Edwards responded to those claims on social media. Her response was the first time alumni had heard from since her statement. She subsequently deleted her comment.
“Processes and procedures [for them to advocate or hold account] can be challenging for JSUNAA right now. It is not for us,” Dawson said. “We don’t want to brush things under the rug, you can’t fix anything that way. Now is the time to raise our voice, organize and partner with IHL to have an open dialogue so we can get this right.” 
Edwards told Mississippi Today the role of JSUNAA is to support the university and its students. She said she does not speak on personnel issues because that is beyond the association’s purview. 
When asked if the association had considered expanding its mission to acknowledge the questions alumni have posed of her leadership and inaction, Edwards said the association does advocate but alumni should join the national group as a way to support the university. By joining the association, it shows a true representation of the school’s alumni base “and speaks more volume than anything.” 
“We can be vocal on social media all we want but if we are not showing our financial support of our university through active membership in the National Alumni Association through ongoing consistent gifts to the university and to students and student programs, we will never be able to have a voice,” Edwards said. 
Despite what he described as the “aggressive silence and inaction” from the national association, Dawson said the group doesn’t see itself as overstepping. Rather it’s providing a true account to the history of the university and a platform for alumni and supporters’ demands. 
“[Jackson State] was founded twelve years after bondage. We have weathered through a long and troubled history of people trying to knock us down and we have survived despite the odds ,” he said. “Being quiet is not in our DNA. We’re rising  up yet again.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/06171242/JSU18-mobile.jpg,,,2025-06-06 18:07:18.238668

Legislation to reform Pennsylvania’s quarter-century-old cyber charter school law and return to taxpayers hundreds of millions in excessive tuition payments passed in the state House on Wednesday with bipartisan support.
The bill now heads to the state Senate where a favorable vote would ratify one of Gov. Josh Shapiro’s budget priorities by capping cyber charter tuition at $8,000 per student next year. It would also establish a statewide formula for special education tuition.
That would save school districts an estimated $616 million a year according to a House analysis of the bill’s fiscal impact. 
The upper chamber, however, is moving forward with bipartisan legislation that would allow parents in poorly performing school districts to spend tax dollars on private school tuition. That’s the solution Republicans prefer — and that Shapiro, a Democrat, has previously endorsed — to give students an alternative to traditional public schools.
As lawmakers in Harrisburg buckled down this week for the month-long push to negotiate the state budget by the June 30 deadline, education funding, as always, will be a subject of prolific debate.
The General Assembly must decide how much to spend on the second installment of a $4.5 billion multi-year commitment to fair education funding. That’s in response to a state court ruling that said students in less wealthy communities have suffered a disadvantage for decades because of the state’s reliance on property taxes to pay for education.
Layered on that is the debate over whether and how much taxpayers should spend to provide educational alternatives for students in poorly performing schools or for whom the traditional public school setting is not working.
“It is not a conversation any longer about Ds versus Rs or conservatives, moderates or progressives. It’s not a conversation any longer about who has and who hasn’t,” state Sen. Anthony Williams (D-Philadelphia) said last month. “This is simply the divide in America that says we’re all in the same boat, and if we don’t educate our children … we are in big trouble.” 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Shapiro’s proposed $51.5 billion spending plan calls for $1.5 billion more for education including $526 million in fair funding. But in his budget address, Shapiro said controlling how much cyber charter schools are paid by students’ home school districts would maximize the impact of education funding increases.
Sponsored by Rep. MaryLouise Isaacson (D-Philadelphia), House Bill 1500 would amend the charter school law that was first passed in 1997 and amended in 2002 to allow cyber charter schools. It passed with a 104-98 vote, including the support of Republican Reps. Thomas Mehaffie of Dauphin County and Kathleen Tomlinson of Bucks County.
In response to the House vote on cyber charter reform Wednesday, the CEOs of five public cyber charter schools said the reduction in funding would be debilitating.
“Every member of the PA House Democratic Caucus voted today in support of the largest proposed cut to public education in nearly 15 years — a cut that would further disenfranchise some of our Commonwealth’s most vulnerable children,” the leaders of Esperanza Cyber Charter School, Reach Cyber Charter School, PA Virtual Charter School, PA Cyber Charter School, PA Distance Learning Charter School said.
Marcus Hite, executive director of the Pennsylvania Association of Public Cyber Charter Schools, described the tuition cap as “arbitrary and unrealistic.” He added that it does not take into account the real costs of educating students, particularly those with disabilities and unique learning needs.
“This bill is not about fairness or accountability—it’s about eliminating school choice for thousands of families,” Hite said. “H.B. 1500 is rooted in the dangerous belief that if we just throw more money at failing school districts and take options away from families, everything will magically improve. That’s not how education works, and it’s not what families want.”
Shapiro made news in 2022 as a candidate for governor by saying he supported private school tuition vouchers. Such programs have been a goal of conservative lawmakers across the country and one is outlined in President Donald Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” that the U.S. House passed last month. It includes $5 billion for a national school voucher program. 
Shapiro  proposed a $100 million scholarship fund 2023 that passed the Republican-controlled Senate, but it was shot down by House Democrats. He endorsed the proposal again in his 2024 budget proposal, and although rapper Jay-Z joined in support of the program, it wasn’t in the final budget. Shapiro hasn’t said one way or the other if he still backs the idea, but it wasn’t part of this year’s proposal. 
Pennsylvania already has two programs that allow individuals and businesses to contribute to private school scholarship programs in lieu of state personal income and corporate net income, and other taxes. The programs provided $340 million such tax credits in 2022-2023, according to watchdog group Education Voters PA. The group has criticized the program, claiming it funds schools that are free to discriminate on the basis of religion, disability and LGBTQ status in their admissions policies.   
Senate Bill 10 nonetheless resurrects the Pennsylvania Award for Student Success (PASS) scholarship proposal from 2023. It would allow parents of students in the bottom 5% lowest performing school districts to apply for scholarships ranging from $2,500 for half-day kindergarten to $10,000 for high school students each year. The bill passed the Senate Education Committee 8-3 last month to be considered by the full Senate.
Isaacson said her bill, which also passed the House last session, is the result of “repeated and urgent calls” to update the law that remained unchanged as the number of cyber charter schools grew and enrollment swelled to 65,000.
“This proposal is about fiscal responsibilities and aligning tuition to the actual cost of providing cyber education,” she said. 
Republicans who opposed it said it denied a voice for families that choose cyber charters.
“It will close real schools, displace real students, strip families of the very choices that they depend on to give their children a chance at success,” Rep. Martina White (R-Philadelphia) said.
School districts must pay tuition for each student who chooses to attend a cyber charter school instead of their local public school. For regular education students, it’s based on the district’s per-pupil spending minus costs that don’t exist for cyber students, such as transportation and facilities.
For special education students, the tuition is calculated based on the district’s overall special education spending divided by 16%, the presumed proportion of students requiring special ed service. Critics say that formula is flawed because it underestimates the number of special education students and skews tuition toward the cost of services for students with the most intensive needs. And students with individualized education plans are 27% more likely to attend cyber charter schools, according to the Pennsylvania School Boards Association.
Education watchdog groups say that results in a windfall for cyber charter organizations because the tuition they get has little relation to the actual cost of providing an online education. It also opens the door to waste and abuse, according to Education Voters PA, which catalogued spending by the state’s largest cyber charter, Commonwealth Charter Academy (CCA), that included a posh social club membership and the purchase of a luxury SUV.
Republican Auditor General Timothy DeFoor released a report in February during House and Senate budget hearings that examined the finances of five cyber charters and found they had amassed excessive budget surpluses. The five charters’ fund balances grew 144% from 2020 to 2023, when they held a combined $619 million in unencumbered funds.
DeFoor’s report also highlighted “uncommon” spending practices such as purchasing gift cards, paying bonuses to teachers and the acquisition of 21 physical properties by the state’s largest cyber school.
House Education Committee Chairperson Peter Schweyer (D-Lehigh) listed claims from those reports as reasons to reign in payments to cyber charter schools. Majority Leader Matt Bradford (D-Montgomery) called it a “damning indictment” of the institutions.
“We would all get in trouble if we were taking gift cards as part of our compensation … that’s a pro tip for anybody who’s in the room, don’t do that,” House Education Committee Chairperson Peter Schweyer (D-Lehigh) said.
In addition to capping tuition, HB 1500 would establish the Cyber Charter School Funding and Policy Council to recommend changes in how cyber charter schools are funded and how they operate.
Isaacson’s bill would also require cyber charters to return money to the state, if its general fund surplus is more than half of what it spent in the previous year or its capital fund surplus is more than 20% of what it spent in the previous year. That money would be available through the Commonwealth Financing Authority for public school building improvements, with 25% earmarked for the Solar for Schools program that lawmakers and Shapiro created last year.
“We’ve all heard stories about asbestos, mold. We had a school district that had a high school that was completely flooded out. It would be great to be able to reinvest those dollars in the children and the teachers that we see each and every day in our actual physical public school buildings,” Schweyer said.
Cyber charter schools have also drawn scrutiny for poor student proficiency rates. Schweyer noted only 4.7% of CCA students scored proficient in math on state assessments.
“If any of your public schools had a 95% failure rate for math proficiency, would you be satisfied?” he asked. “Better question, would we be getting what we’re paying for?”
HB 1500 would limit increases in enrollment for cyber charters that face “significant challenges related to academic achievement, student growth, graduation rate and other areas.” And it would place a moratorium on new cyber charter applications through 2030.
Republican Leader Jesse Topper (R-Bedford) argued passing the bill would amount to eliminating lifelines for students who are unable to thrive in traditional public schools. 
“Outcomes and statistics can be tricky,” Topper, who shared that his parents chose to homeschool him when the noise and disorder of public school proved to be too much. 
“Many of the students who are falling through the cracks and who are attending these cyber charter schools are doing so because they are struggling,” he said, adding that success for some might be simply earning a high school diploma. The COVID-19 pandemic showed the value of cyber schools to the point that most school districts have added their own cyber programs, Topper noted.
“We need to continue to talk about how we can do better in all aspects of public education, including funding, including formulas,” Topper said. “But the toxic nature of this conversation must end, and we must look at ways to move forward together as an entire system.”

Rogers U.S. Courthouse in downtown Denver is pictured on Jan. 21, 2021. (Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)The man accused of injuring more than a dozen people in a firebombing attack on Boulder’s Pearl Street Mall appeared on Friday in Denver for the first time in federal court, where he faces a hate crime charge.
Mohamed Sabry Soliman, a 45-year-old Egyptian citizen, has been charged in connection with the attack on participants in the Boulder chapter of Run For Their Lives, a group that aims to raise awareness of hostages still held by Hamas in Gaza. An arrest warrant alleges that he told investigators after the attack that he had targeted the group because he wanted to “kill all Zionist people.”
The federal hearing came one day after the defendant was formally charged on 118 criminal counts in state court in Boulder County, including dozens of charges of attempted murder and the use of incendiary devices. If convicted on those state-level charges, he faces a combined sentence of hundreds of years in prison.

The U.S. attorney’s office in Denver separately charged the suspect with one count of “a hate crime offense involving the actual or perceived race, religion, or national origin,” as part of what acting U.S. Attorney J. Bishop Grewell called a “message to the community that no acts of anti-Semitism are going to be tolerated.” Grewell suggested earlier this week that additional federal charges may be forthcoming.
The suspect was escorted into the courtroom Friday afternoon by U.S. marshals for an administrative hearing that lasted less than 10 minutes. Speaking through an Arabic-language interpreter, he gave short affirmative answers to a series of questions from Magistrate Judge Timothy P. O’Hara regarding his rights as a criminal defendant. He will be represented by an attorney from the Office of the Federal Public Defender.
O’Hara set a preliminary hearing in the federal case for June 18.
Federal authorities say the suspect, a Colorado Springs resident, was living in the U.S. unlawfully after overstaying a visa that expired in 2023. A federal judge in Denver has temporarily blocked the deportation of his wife, Hayam El Gamal, and their five children, after the Department of Homeland Security announced that it had taken them into custody and was “processing (them) for removal proceedings from the U.S.”

The lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas by a group of voters and the Christian Ministerial Alliance. It claimed boundaries for Arkansas’ 2nd Congressional District were racially gerrymandered and diluted the votes of Black Arkansans. 
Congressional and state legislative districts are redrawn after the U.S. Census each decade in a process known as redistricting. The goal is to create districts that contain roughly the same population. 
The Ministerial Alliance’s lawsuit was one of four filed to challenge Arkansas’ 2021 redistricting process and the only one that hadn’t been dismissed. 
On Friday, U.S. Circuit Judge David Stras, U.S. District Judge D.P. Marshall Jr. and U.S. District Judge James Moody Jr. granted the state’s motion for summary judgment, saying there was not enough evidence to support the plaintiffs’ racial discrimination claims.
“Multiple Arkansas citizens challenge how the General Assembly redrew the state’s congressional district lines,” Friday’s order states. “Although their allegations were plausible enough to survive a motion to dismiss [Docs. 35, 42], the evidence does not back up their claims of racial discrimination. For that reason, we grant summary judgment to Secretary of State John Thurston.”
Thurston, who was secretary of state when the lawsuit was filed in 2023, was elected state treasurer in 2024 during a special election. The governor appointed Cole Jester to succeed Thurston. 
Previously, the entirety of Pulaski County was included in Arkansas’ Second Congressional District, which is represented by Republican U.S. Rep. French Hill. During the 2021 redistricting process, Pulaski County was split between three congressional districts.
Plaintiffs alleged the General Assembly considered racial data when redrawing district lines and unconstitutionally “cracked” the Black voting bloc in southeast Pulaski County. 


Let us know what you think...


 

The state’s attorneys submitted a motion for summary judgment in favor of the state last October. 
According to Friday’s order, the original complaint alleged two constitutional claims —  one for racial gerrymandering under the Fourteenth Amendment and one for vote dilution under the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. 
The federal panel said race needed to be “the predominant factor” motivating the General Assembly’s decision and that awareness or acceptance of a “racially disparate impact is not enough.”
Three-judge panel hears arguments but doesn’t rule in Arkansas redistricting lawsuit

Creating “an alternative map” is one way to prove redrawn boundaries were racially motivated, the panel said. However, that only works if the alternative map still accomplishes the Legislature’s partisan goals.
“If it does not, then it just highlights how the pursuit of a nonracial aim — like retention, partisanship, or geography — could have led to an unintended racial disparity,” the panel wrote. “All three of the plaintiffs’ alternatives fall short in exactly this way.” 
Citing a U.S. Supreme Court reversal of a decision by a three-judge panel that found South Carolina had discriminated against Black voters in a 2023 redistricting lawsuit, Stras and his counterparts noted the high court emphasized that the courts must “start with the presumption that the legislature acted in good faith.”
“Absent direct evidence of racial discrimination and with only weak circumstantial evidence supporting the plaintiffs’ case, the presumption of legislative good faith tips the balance,” Stras wrote. 
That coupled with the fact that no alternative map achieves the General Assembly’s goals with “significantly greater racial balance,” meant the judges could not reasonably find that the plaintiffs had proved enough for their claim of racial gerrymandering to survive summary judgment, according to the ruling.
The primary obstacle of the presumption of good faith holds true for the plaintiffs’ vote-dilution claim, according to Friday’s order. While the vote-dilution claim requires race to be a “motivating factor” instead of the predominant one, the panel argued “the plaintiffs do not have enough evidence to get there.”
“Most of what the plaintiffs offer are the materials we have already discussed: maps, statistics, and legislative history, none of which are enough to infer a racial motivation,” the panel wrote. 
The federal judges acknowledged as evidence a report from a university doctoral candidate that describes Arkansas’ “long history” with racism and resistance to Black voters, but wrote that much of that predates the passage of the 1964 Voting Rights Act. 
“Even if he identifies a few scattered examples since then, none are ‘reasonably contemporaneous with the challenged decision,’ giving us little insight into what the General Assembly may have been thinking four years ago,” the panel wrote.

More than 200 wildfires burning across Canada have churned acrid air across the U.S. this week.

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerSmoke from Canadian wildfires continued to obscure Vermont skies on Friday as the Department of Environmental Conservation issued another air quality alert for the northwest portion of the state. The alert, which includes the counties of Chittenden, Franklin and Grand Isle, is set to end at midnight. An expanded alert will be issued by the agency Saturday, according to the National Weather Service office in Burlington. The air quality alert will last from 8 a.m. to 11 p.m. and cover the counties of Caledonia, Chitteden, Essex, Franklin, Grand Isle, Lamoille, Orleans and Washington. “It’s a moderate level of pollutants, so it’s not going to affect everybody, but it’s mainly for sensitive groups like people with heart or lung disease, older adults, and children,” said Peter Banacos, science and operations officer at the National Weather Service’s office in Burlington. While rain is helping to drown out the particulates, smoke that’s hovering over the St. Lawrence Valley could move into northern Vermont over the weekend, according to Banacos.Those tiny particles within the smoke, known as fine particulate matter or PM 2.5, can get trapped in people’s lungs before entering their bloodstream, causing possible health problems. The wildfire smoke brings elevated concentrations of those particles that can be unhealthy for sensitive groups like older adults and children, pregnant people, outdoor workers and people living outside.People with asthma should keep their relief medicine nearby, and if residents experience scratchy eyes or throat, a headache or coughing, they’re encouraged to move indoors, according to a media release from the Department of Environmental Conservation on Friday.READ MORE
On Friday afternoon, the air quality for much of the state was good, and residents could enjoy outdoor activities. But in Burlington and St. Albans, the Environmental Protection Agency’s fire and smoke map indicated that the levels of PM 2.5 were above 100 on the air quality index, meaning the air was unhealthy for those sensitive groups.The smoke has migrated from more than 200 wildfires churning through Canada, with six new fires starting Friday. Canada faces an especially severe and early start to its fire season, as more severe wildfires become more common under climate change, which is primarily driven by the burning of fossil fuels. While 69 fires are burning in British Columbia, more than 100 have consumed the country’s less fire-prone prairie provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba.“With these wildfires so far removed from Vermont, we’re not expecting real significant issues,” Banacos said. He recalled worse conditions in 2022, when wildfires raging in Quebec brought thick, low-level smoke to Vermont that reduced visibility and increased air quality issues. “If we get fires that are closer, that could change,” Banacos said.The worst effects are across the Great Lakes, where smoke has settled over major cities like Detroit and Toronto, but unhealthy air has traveled as far south as Florida this week.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Wildfire smoke brings air quality alert to northwest Vermont.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/hazy-skies-1-20250606-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-06-06 17:10:17.519373

Jeff Irwin (D-Ann Arbor) broke down a new package of ""polluter pay"" bills at an Oct. 25, 2023 press conference. | Kyle DavidsonDemocratic lawmakers in both the Michigan House and Senate announced Friday they would be taking another stab at legislation to hold polluters accountable for cleaning up contamination. 
For years, Michigan Democrats have introduced “polluter pay” legislation seeking to alter the current regulations on polluter responsibilities, which lawmakers and environmentalists argue have left taxpayers holding the bag.
Michigan is home to tens of thousands of contaminated sites, many of which are “orphan sites” where the responsible party is either no longer in business, or cannot be identified.
Sen. Jeff Irwin (D-Ann Arbor), a longtime advocate for polluter pay policies, said in a statement that the bills would put liability where it belongs: with the polluters.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX“It’s shocking that Michigan law doesn’t require polluters to actually clean up their mess or even report all spills,” Irwin said, noting the reintroduced package of bills aims to ensure more thorough cleanups and comprehensive spill reporting.
During the previous legislative session, Irwin, alongside Rep. Jason Morgan (D-Ann Arbor), led the introduction of renewed polluter pay bills intended to give state regulators more tools to enforce environmental cleanups.
After the introduction of the renewed package in October 2023, the bills were subject to workgrouping with the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy and various industry stakeholders. 
Although several of the bills in the previous package passed through the Democratic-led Michigan Senate, the efforts never came to a vote in the House, as partisan bickering and party infighting left the House’s previous Democratic leadership unable to hold session at the end of their term. 
With Republicans now in control of the chamber, the reintroduced polluter pay policies will likely face an uphill battle in the House, though Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks (D-Grand Rapids) told the Michigan Advance that it would be great to see the policies move forward in some form.
According to a statement from Irwin’s office, several of the renewed polluter pay bills have already been introduced in the Michigan House, with the rest set to be introduced next week. Additionally, Sen. Sean McCann (D-Kalamazoo), who chairs the Senate Energy and Environment Committee, said he intends to hold a hearing on the bills next week. 
Proposals in the 2025 polluter pay bills include:

Stricter pollution reporting and cleanups requirements; 


Creating an avenue for EGLE to update cleanup criteria as researchers learn more about contaminants while prioritizing the removal of contamination over implementing use restrictions;
Allowing individuals exposed to hazardous substances to sue polluters for the cost of medical monitoring;
Allowing the state to hold polluters accountable for cleanup costs and damages to the environment from contaminants not regulated before 1994, such as PFAS;

Democrats were unable to advance the policies while they held control of both Legislative chambers, but Nick Occhipinti, state government affairs director for the Michigan League of Conservation Voters, said the policies are still viable, even in a split-power Legislature.
“You do any polling on asking Michiganders if polluters should pay to have both legacy and existing sites cleaned up to protect public health, to redevelop those sites and return them to the community, return them to prosperity, they are overwhelmingly in support,” Occhipinti said.

(Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma’s attorney general said Thursday he “demands” the removal of Afghan refugees who were resettled in the state in 2021 with Gov. Kevin Stitt’s support. 
Gentner Drummond, who is also a Republican candidate for governor, said the thousands of Afghan refugees were not properly vetted in 2021 and pose a threat to public safety. His statement followed a travel ban from President Donald Trump on 12 countries, including Afghanistan. 
Stitt and the organizations who helped resettle around 1,800 refugees from Afghanistan in Oklahoma pushed back. They said Drummond’s statement was inaccurate and creates unnecessary fear about the Afghan population in the state.

The Republican governor said in a statement Friday that the Biden administration had failed to secure a safe exit from Afghanistan, costing American lives and left Afghani citizens in danger. 
“They aided our troops in some of the most dangerous combat situations,” Stitt said. “It is unconscionable that anyone would suggest that we should have left them at the mercy of the Taliban. Individuals using their official platform to campaign for a higher office are using prejudice and fear tactics to sow discord. If the attorney general can identify laws being broken, he should use his existing authority to prosecute criminal activity. Oklahomans see through the political rhetoric.”
Drummond rebuffed Stitt’s statement. He said Friday his top focus as attorney general is to ensure “law and order,” adding that it was a public safety issue. 
“We greatly value the Afghan friends and allies who assisted US forces, but federal investigations have clearly borne out that vetting was woefully insufficient,” Drummond said. 
Drummond on Thursday referenced two acts of violence involving Afghan refugees, including one threat to Election Day in Oklahoma City.  
Tax dollars are being used to pay for resettlement efforts and “foreign nationals” who are not properly vetted pose a threat, he said in his statement. 
“Adding insult to injury, Gov. Stitt illegally directed millions of our tax dollars to pay for resettlement expenses,” Drummond said Thursday. “Now that President Trump has acted in the best interests of the United States by fully restricting Afghan nationals, I am demanding that Gov. Stitt reject the approval he gave to the Biden Administration so all Afghan refugees can be removed from Oklahoma.” SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
But leaders of community organizations who helped with resettlement efforts said Drummond’s statement is inaccurate and sows unnecessary fear about a vulnerable population. 
Patrick Raglow, executive director at Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of Oklahoma City, said it’s “ludicrous” to say this population is a threat for having not been vetted. 
“His beef is not with the Afghan arrivals so much as it is with the governor, and this just happens to be the shape of the rock he’s throwing at the governor,” he said. “That’s my personal opinion, but the statement itself is most unfortunate and factually flawed. It creates a little bit of hostility and animus in our community for those who are here, who fled violence and were not brought here to import violence.”
Raglow said in 2021, Catholic Charities was approached by Stitt to aid in the resettlement efforts after the fall of Kabul to the Taliban. Catholic Charities has been involved in refugee resettlement for decades. 
He hopes that people draw a distinction between refugees and asylum seekers and immigrants. 
“Every refugee is an immigrant. 99% of immigrants are not refugees,” Raglow said. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLEVeronica Laizure, executive director of CAIR Oklahoma, said refugees undergo some of the more strict security screenings. She said she’s disappointed in Drummond’s words. CAIR Oklahoma is a nonprofit advocacy group working to “enhance the understanding of Islam, protect civil rights, promote justice, and empower American Muslims.” 
“We are pretty dismayed and disappointed that (Attorney General) Drummond feels it’s appropriate to hold an entire population accountable for the actions of a very, very small minority, and that he’s willing to generalize and paint all of our Afghan neighbors with the same brush,” she said. “We live in Oklahoma, which is a state that’s very familiar, painfully familiar, with the impact of domestic terrorism, and yet we don’t assume that everyone who looks like Timothy McVeigh holds his same views or would commit the same actions that he did.” 
Afghan refugees who came to the U.S. were individuals, or family members, who worked with the U.S. military at high risk to themselves, resulting in violence and death, Laizure said. 
Islamophobia is at a high level right now, Laizure said, which puts this community on edge. She said she encourages people to reach out to people and organizations who have real experience before “operating based on stereotypes and prejudice.”",https://oklahomavoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/P2282114-scaled-1-1024x916.jpg,,,2025-06-06 17:10:17.519373

Ned Lamont pitched an idea to Congress during his annual State of the State address in January: “Rethink the Jones Act.”
The remark — which referenced a century-old maritime law that limits trade between U.S. ports to American-made ships — drew little attention from the local press or public at the time. The comment got scattered applause during the address, appearing to even surprise the governor.
But for one of member of Connecticut’s congressional delegation, the idea opened up a rare point of disagreement between political allies with a long record of working together to support Connecticut’s shipbuilding industry and maritime trades.
Last month, U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney, D-2nd District, penned an op-ed that dismissed calls to repeal the Jones Act as “a page out of Project 2025,” the conservative agenda laid out by allies of President Donald J. Trump. Courtney was responding directly to another op-ed by a scholar from libertarian think tank CATO Institute, and the piece made no mention of Lamont’s differing views on the subject.
Courtney said conversations about the maritime law have happened more at the staff level with the governor’s office.
“I think at this point, we agree to disagree. But I feel very confident that the basic goal of trying to increase the building capacity is something that … the two of us agree on that,” Courtney said in a recent interview, referring to his shared commitment with Lamont to the shipbuilding sector in maritime states.
For his part, Lamont has stood by his call to revisit the Jones Act. During a recent event in eastern Connecticut, he pointed to the law’s impact on the nascent offshore wind industry at the State Pier in New London.
“We have to bring up all the wind turbines on international vessels,” Lamont said. “Then we have to offload them, put them onto another vessel. They go offshore, and it’s relatively expensive. You know, be very selective, but we ought to make it a little easier for us to build the energy we need in the future.”
Courtney, who serves as ranking member of the House Armed Services’ Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee, said debate over the Jones Act has been a “recurring, perennial issue” since he came to Congress almost two decades ago.
CATO Institute and the conservative Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 have called for repealing or reforming the Jones Act. Meanwhile, sea services like the U.S. Coast Guard have been strong proponents of the law as well as the Shipbuilders Council of America, which represents dozens of companies that operate 80 shipyards around the country.
More formally known as the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, the law was written to address post-World War I era concerns about U.S. shipbuilding and the unavailability of a maritime fleet to transport troops to Europe. It requires ships going between American ports to be built, owned and operated by the U.S. and fly American flags. (The popular name of the law comes from its original sponsor, U.S. Rep. Wesley L. Jones of Washington).
More than a decade after its original passage, the Jones Act was updated to include subsidies for the construction of vessels manufactured in American shipyards. But those subsidies were eliminated by the Reagan administration in 1981. Courtney noted countries like South Korea continue to provide subsidies to their shipbuilders.
The Jones Act “really wanted to make sure that we were going to have a healthy merchant marine workforce and fleet,” Courtney said.
“The worst thing we can do in my opinion is to whittle away at the Jones Act,” he continued, adding it’d be “a race to the bottom and would decimate any semblance of a merchant marine fleet in the U.S. and a merchant marine workforce that’s out there.”
According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, there were 92 Jones Act-compliant, oceangoing vessels available for port-to-port shipping last year.
Some U.S. territories are exempt from the law, including American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin Islands and the Northern Mariana Islands. Waivers can also be temporarily issued in certain cases such as matters of national defense or in response to natural disasters.
But the Jones Act applies to other noncontiguous areas of the U.S. like Puerto Rico, which has been a point of contention for some critics in Connecticut who argue it increases shipping costs for the island territory. During this year’s General Assembly session, a resolution passed out of the Commerce Committee calling on Congress to amend the Jones Act and provide exemptions for Puerto Rico by allowing foreign-flagged ships to transport certain goods, including liquid natural gas. But the effort died in the House when the session ended earlier this week.
Lamont’s interest in the Jones Act appears to be mostly focused on its impact on the cost of energy. In his State of the State address, the governor spoke about how Connecticut, like the rest of New England, gets the majority of its electricity from power plants fueled by natural gas pipelines.
In the winter, those pipelines become constrained due to the demand for gas to heat people’s homes, leading to temporary price spikes.
While liquid natural gas can also be imported through terminals in Massachusetts, Lamont noted those imports come from overseas on foreign-flagged ships, due to the lack of Jones Act-compliant tankers available to carry it from ports on the Gulf Coast.
“We bring in very inexpensive natural gas from Pennsylvania, but that pipeline is at capacity, and we bring in LNG by foreign ships, which is more polluting and more expensive,” Lamont said. 
Whether repealing the law would actually spark a resurgence in shipping between U.S. ports is subject to some debate, however.
Ryan Kellogg, an economist at the University of Chicago, said that repealing the Jones Act would have only a “modest” impact on energy prices New England, due to the further distance ships must travel from Gulf Coast ports and lower prices when compared to overseas markets. In a 2023 paper studying how a potential repeal would affect the price of gasoline and diesel, Kellogg and a co-author found that the biggest benefits would come to ports farther south along the East Coast.
“If anything, the problems may be a little bit worse when it comes to LNG, just in the sense of, really what you’re competing with now are these really big price differentials to Europe and Asia,” Kellogg said. “An LNG carrier is simply not going to go to New England unless they get a price that’s comparable to what they could get by sailing to Europe.”
The American Maritime Partnership — a coalition that represents vessel operators, shipbuilders, repair yards and others in the domestic maritime industry and supports the maritime policy — argued that changes to the Jones Act wouldn’t remedy issues like high energy prices in the region.
“Claims that the Jones Act drives high energy costs in New England reflect a misunderstanding of both the law and regional energy markets,” Jennifer Carpenter, president of the American Maritime Partnership, said in a statement. “Connecticut’s energy costs stem from its over-reliance on volatile spot markets, inadequate pipeline infrastructure, and limited storage capacity, not national security laws like the Jones Act.”
In April, Trump issued an executive order promising to reassert “America’s maritime dominance” through commercial shipbuilding. The order directed officials to come up with a plan for new investments in shipbuilding, along with a study of existing cargo preference laws.
And federal lawmakers in both parties are looking to incentivize U.S. shipbuilding as part of legislation called the SHIPS for America Act. 
Courtney pointed to the planned development of Jones Act-compliant ships in Philadelphia and the construction of the Charybdis, the first American-made offshore wind installation vessel, as an example of the kind of work supported by the Jones Act. (The Charybdis was originally intended to work on wind projects being launched from New London but is now scheduled to work off the coast of Virginia).
Courtney added that the support of other prominent Republicans, including House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., is a sign of the Jones Act’s enduring popularity in Congress. 
“I just think politically waiving or weakening the Jones Act is going to run into a firestorm of bipartisan opposition,” Courtney said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2024_1003_SR_LongIslandSound_304-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-06 17:10:17.519373

(Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)An Arkansas legislative committee filed a report Friday detailing a requested audit into the Board of Corrections’ 2023 hiring of a Little Rock attorney, a move that raised concerns from lawmakers about the board’s procurement practices.
The nonpartisan Arkansas Legislative Audit began the probe a year ago at the request of the Legislative Joint Auditing Committee, which heard the report Friday and continued to express frustrations about attorney Abtin Mehdizadegan’s contract with the prison board.
Mehdizadegan has been representing the Board of Corrections in both its legal challenge against two 2023 state laws and Attorney General Tim Griffin’s suit against the board for allegedly violating the Freedom of Information Act in Mehdizadegan’s hiring.
Griffin’s office usually represents state agencies in legal cases, but Arkansas law allows special counsel to be appointed in disputes between the attorney general and constitutional officers. Board member Lee Watson, who was the panel’s secretary at the time it began working with Mehdizadegan, reiterated this to the committee Friday.
Watson said the circumstances surrounding the board’s November 2023 dispute with Griffin, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders and then-Corrections Secretary Joe Profiri required special action. The board and the executive branch officials clashed over who has ultimate authority over Arkansas’ prison system, including the expansion of facilities.
Lawmakers criticize Arkansas Board of Corrections members, attorney over altered contract

“Our governor and our secretary were moving forward with moving prisoners into overcrowded facilities,” Watson said. “Based upon our collective experience, we believed that that would endanger the people in that facility and the general public nearby.”
He repeated past statements to lawmakers that Profiri’s and Sanders’ actions justified hiring Mehdizadegan after an executive session at a brief meeting in December 2023.
The Joint Performance Review Committee spent three April 2024 meetings discussing and questioning Mehdizadegan’s hiring and contract, and the panel voted to recommend that the Arkansas Legislative Council not review the contract.
The audit report found that Mehdizadegan was present and spoke at several Board of Corrections meetings, but this was not reflected in the meeting minutes.
The report also took issue with the board signing “engagement agreements” with Mehdizadegan “without establishing how the Board would pay for these services, as the Board has no appropriation or funding.” The engagement agreements also did not include the contract length or cost.
Mehdizadegan’s relationship with the board began when Watson informally contacted him as the board’s legal liaison, Watson previously told lawmakers, but auditors “were unable to verify” his appointment as liaison until after Mehdizadegan’s hiring.
Additionally, Mehdizadegan has submitted invoices totaling $230,138 to the board for his legal work, but those invoices were unpaid as of Feb. 11, the report states.
Auditors recommended in the report that the Board of Corrections make the following changes:

Making all board business public
Amending the board’s bylaws to include liaison appointments in required public business
Including all relevant details in proposed contracts
Consulting with state procurement officials before procuring goods or services
Making sure all information submitted to state procurement officials is “complete and accurate”

 
BOC special audit report 

Mehdizadegan wrote the board’s 30-page response to the audit findings, recommending that auditors revise the report “and find that the Board acted lawfully, reasonably and appropriately in its selection of special counsel.”
Sen. Jonathan Dismang, R-Searcy, said he was “disappointed” in the board’s response.
“All I was looking for in response was, ‘Hey, we were in uncharted territory, we didn’t know what we were doing, and you know what? We should have followed the procurement process,’” he said.
Mehdizadegan and Board of Corrections Chairman Benny Magness were present at Friday’s committee meeting but did not face questions from lawmakers.
The lawsuits
Less than a week after being hired, Mehdizadegan filed the board’s lawsuit against Sanders, Profiri and then-Secretary of State John Thurston, challenging the constitutionality of Act 185 and Act 659 of 2023.
Act 185 requires the secretary of corrections to serve at the pleasure of the governor rather than the board, while Act 659 alters the reporting structure for the directors of the Division of Correction and Division of Community Correction, requiring them to serve at the pleasure of the secretary rather than the board.
The board argued the laws violate Amendment 33 of the Arkansas Constitution, which protects the power of constitutional boards like the board of corrections from the executive or legislative branches of government.
Pulaski County Circuit Judge Patricia James granted a preliminary injunction in January 2024, which Griffin appealed.
Arkansas Supreme Court sends AG’s FOIA lawsuit against prison board back to circuit court

The Arkansas Supreme Court allowed the lawsuit to continue Thursday when it dismissed the state’s motion to send the case back to the circuit court, order the preliminary injunction vacated and dismiss the case as moot.
The high court also dismissed a motion to disqualify Mehdizadegan from further participation in proceedings before the court.
Last month, the state Supreme Court reversed a lower court’s dismissal of Griffin’s suit against the board for allegedly violating the FOIA to hire outside counsel.
Pulaski County Circuit Judge Tim Fox gave Griffin 30 days to work with the corrections board on an agreement with an outside attorney to represent it. Fox dismissed the case without prejudice in January 2024, ruling Griffin’s office failed to make an effort to initiate the statutory procedure that allows special counsel to represent state officials and entities.
Griffin moved to vacate the circuit court’s order, arguing his office could not certify special counsel until the board asked for legal representation. The Supreme Court agreed and sent the case back to Fox.

Yellowstone […]","This frame capture of a video from a webcam shows a small eruption emanating from Black Diamond Pool in Biscuit Basin, a subbasin of Upper Geyser Basin in Yellowstone National Park, on May 31, 2025.  This was the site of a hydrothermal explosion on July 23, 2024. (Provided by the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory)On Saturday night, an eruption from the Black Diamond Pool in Yellowstone National Park shot up about 20 feet, according to the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory.
On May 14, scientists had installed a temporary and mobile camera at the Biscuit Basin site, northwest of Old Faithful, following a massive explosion there on July 23, 2024.
Yellowstone Volcano Observatory scientist-in-charge Michael Poland said this week the detection of the burst at the Black Diamond Pool shows the camera was a good investment, and the plan is to install a permanent monitoring station in the area.
“This felt like a really good use of resources to capture an event that will help us better understand what’s going on at Biscuit Basin,” Poland said.
This summer, scientists will be testing and phasing in the installation of a permanent station there, with a microphone to capture acoustic noise, GPS station, and equipment to monitor seismic changes.
The camera on the site can’t stream video, but it can record it on site, and it can send static images every 15 minutes to the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory, a consortium of state and federal agencies that monitor and provide hazard assessment in the Yellowstone Plateau region.
Poland said scientists capture and review those images for changes, and sure enough, the images of the pool on May 31 from 8:30 p.m. to 8:45 p.m. looked different.
“It looked like the pool had been disturbed, rocks moved, water was around all the edges,” Poland said.
He said a look at the video confirmed the camera had captured a small eruption.
Poland said a couple of eruptions after the explosion last summer had been observed, and a number of smaller ones had been detected based on seismic data and acoustic monitoring.
On Nov. 5, 2024, a geologist in the park taking samples witnessed an eruption of muddy water going up 20 or 30 feet, he said. Then, on Jan. 3, 2025, a tour group looking at bison nearby observed a small eruption in the pool.
“We have all these other suggestions of other data that these events have happened many times,” Poland said.
By comparison, Old Faithful shoots up from 106 feet to more than 180 feet, according to the National Park Service.
Poland said the smaller flareup captured on video is probably typical of the current activity at the Black Diamond Pool.
The area has a history of eruptions and explosions, and it probably formed in the early 20th century, Poland said.
“Since that time, it has gone through periods when it has been a bit more active and then periods when it’s quiet,” he said.
In the mid-2000s to mid-2010s, it erupted maybe a few times a year, and then it went quiet until 2024, Poland said.
Last summer, in a massive explosion, the pool threw rocks as large as 3 feet wide hundreds of feet into the air and reformed pools.
No one was hurt, but the boardwalk was damaged, and Yellowstone National Park still has marked the area as closed.
“The history at this particular pool seems to be one where it likes to have a muddy explosion from time to time,” Poland said.
But Poland said one explosion there doesn’t forecast another one.
At Old Faithful, the “plumbing system” is established, and it creates consistent behavior, Poland said. It erupts on a regular basis, as its name suggests.
However, Poland said most hydrothermal features don’t have such well-defined or steady plumbing systems.
He said one reason is that hot water carries lots of minerals, and as it gets close to the surface and cools, minerals drop off and tend to coat “conduit walls,” where water flows, and seal them off.
The water then looks for a different way to move, and it will break a seal, resulting in an explosion.
But he said scientists don’t know enough about the subsurface conditions of most hydrothermal areas or how they change over time to forecast which features will have explosions, when they might take place, or how big they might be.
“That’s one of the real challenges we face with hydrothermal activities,” Poland said.
In an email, a spokesperson for Yellowstone National Park said the parking lot and boardwalks are still closed at Biscuit Basin: “We are closely monitoring activity at the site for the possibility of additional events, and it will reopen when it is safe to do so.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/explode-2-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-06-06 17:10:17.519373

The decision dismisses suits brought by towns who argued the state should not be allowed to force compliance with the MBTA Communities multifamily zoning law.
The post MBTA Communities law is not an unfunded mandate, judge rules  appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","A PLYMOUTH COUNTY judge overseeing a bundle of municipal lawsuits from towns seeking to halt enforcement of the MBTA Communities housing law has denied their motion for a preliminary injunction and dismissed their complaints. In a 40-page decision released Friday afternoon, Superior Court Justice Mark Gildea considered lawsuits brought by the towns of Duxbury, Hanson, Holden, Marshfield, Middleton, Wenham, Weston, and Wrentham, plus a taxpayer suit brought by Hamilton residents. The collection of suits argued that, because the state auditor’s office concluded that the MBTA Communities law is an “unfunded mandate” by forcing cities and towns near public transit to zone for multifamily development, the state should be blocked from enforcing the law until a funding mechanism is put in place. More broadly, they claimed, the state imposed improper compliance requirements through the law as a condition to receive significant grant funding.Involving towns across six counties, the decision came at a critical time for a set of MBTA Communities with just over a month left to get into compliance with a revised set of state regulations.Zoning for a potential 750 new units or more in each community, they argued, would impact infrastructure and services within their borders. These issues touched on water and sewer, education, buildings, roads, and other governmental services along with some municipality-specific concerns. The injunctions would have both freed up grant funds the state was withholding for non-compliance with the law and stop the state from excluding these towns from future grants. The anticipated possible costs that the towns could incur from the rezoning are “indirect” and therefore not in need of specific funding from the state, Gildea wrote. Similarly, the towns did not claim specific enough details about infrastructure costs, he wrote. “The only allegations … before the court are generalized comments about large-scale issues they foresee,” such as impacts on sewer capacity without specifics, which are not enough to support an unfunded mandate claim, Gildea wrote. There was only “speculation” about possible direct costs, he concluded, noting that the filing and affidavits submitted include words like “may,” “expect,” “possibly,” “anticipate,” and “estimated.” The court, Gildea wrote, is also not bound by State Auditor Diana DiZoglio’s office finding that the law constitutes an unfunded mandate. He disagreed with the auditor’s ultimate conclusion, calling the determination “flawed as a matter of law.” There is no requirement to construct new housing, and even advocates of the law argue that claims of overwhelmed resources and booming amounts of new units are greatly overstated.  The regulations being challenged here, he wrote, “do not compel construction. They merely encourage it.” And there is actually funding available, he said. There are programs – like MassWorks and HousingWorks that are competitive grants for a variety of infrastructure projects associated with housing development – for municipalities based on the cost they claim will arise in either conducting the rezoning process or seeing an influx of related units. The towns did not convince Gildea that the MBTA Communities rezoning process exceeds regular zoning tasks that would make the process cost anything more than “incidental local administration expense[s]” not requiring specific funding.  None of the towns showed that they would likely succeed on the merits of the case and are not entitled to a preliminary injunction that would require releasing withheld grant funding, the judge ruled. “We are pleased the courts have again affirmed the intent of the MBTA Communities Law, and we look forward to working with the remaining communities to complete their zoning changes,” said Ed Augustus, Secretary of Housing and Livable Communities, in a statement after the ruling. “Massachusetts’ housing shortage has led to unaffordable prices and rising rents, but the MBTA Communities Law is working to deliver new housing where it’s needed most and to bring down the cost of housing for all residents.” The judge also disposed with the argument that towns like Holden and Middleton are not “adjacent” to the MBTA system and therefore subject to the law. The towns, he wrote, seem to “misconstrue” the word adjacent to mean adjoining – essentially incorrectly claiming they would have to be touching a municipality with MBTA service. The MBTA Communities law has been a stand-in for the long dispute over city and state powers. Advocates for local control claim that the towns that have actively rejected compliance should be free to refuse. But this ignores long-held, common understanding that municipalities are merely “creations” of the state Legislature, Gildea wrote. The rights of a town and its voters are “subordinate” to state lawmakers deciding to enact the MBTA Communities law, he added.  Even some municipalities who submitted compliant action plans were hoping to drag their feet on fully rezoning while the courts considered the “unfunded mandate” determination. Gildea’s decision will have implications across the state, including in the first town to resist – Milton. Taxpayers in Milton threw the town into the legal mix yet again by suing at the end of May on unfunded mandate grounds, and the Planning Board is weighing another round of potential but unspecified litigation.  The post MBTA Communities law is not an unfunded mandate, judge rules  appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Single-Family-Housing.png?fit=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-06 17:10:17.519373
,DC,2025-06-06 20:23:37+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Republicans in Congress axed the ‘green new scam,’ but it’s a red state boon",Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/republicans-congress-axed-green-new-scam-its-red-state-boon,,"WASHINGTON —  Clean energy manufacturers and advocates say they’re perplexed how the repeal of tax credits in President Donald Trump’s “one big beautiful bill” will keep their domestic production lines humming across the United States, particularly in states that elected him to the Oval Office.While some Republicans have labeled the billions in tax credits a “green new scam,” statistics reviewed by State Newsroom show the jobs and benefits would boost predominantly GOP-leaning states and congressional districts. Now the industry is already slowing amid Trump’s back-and-forth tariff policy and mixed messaging on energy and manufacturing.Trump vowed in early April to “supercharge our domestic industrial base.”“Jobs and factories will come roaring back to our country, and you see it happening already,” he told a crowd in the White House Rose Garden while unveiling his new trade policy.But as a way to pay for the $3.9 trillion price tag of extending and expanding the 2017 corporate and individual tax cuts, U.S. House Republicans found billions of dollars in savings by slashing over a dozen clean energy tax credits enacted in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act under President Joe Biden.Critics say the mega-bill, which passed the GOP-led House on May 22 in a 215-214 vote, would effectively strip away the Advanced Manufacturing and Production Credit and other incentives.They have bolstered the production of batteries and solar components in numerous states — top among them North Carolina, Georgia, Michigan, South Carolina, Indiana, Tennessee, Texas, Nevada, Illinois and Oklahoma, according to the Clean Investment Monitor, a joint project by the Rhodium Group and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research.U.S. senators are now negotiating the massive budget reconciliation legislation.Kevin Doffling, CEO and founder of Project Vanguard, an organization that connects veterans to clean energy jobs, warned pulling the plug on the clean energy tax credits will stifle progress the U.S. has made against other countries, namely China.“We're just going to see a huge pullback from investments inside of advanced manufacturing here in the U.S., and then we'll go source it from other places, instead of doing it here,” Doffling said on a May 28 press call pressing for senators to protect the tax credits.Doffling’s organization works in several states, including Arizona, Colorado, Indiana, Minnesota, Washington and Utah.Moving away from fossil fuelsThe suite of tax credits enacted under the IRA incentivized homeowners, car buyers, energy producers and manufacturers to invest in types of energy beyond fossil fuels, with the aim of a reduction in the effects of climate change.For example, the IRA’s Advanced Manufacturing and Production Credit is awarded per unit produced and sold, and in some cases the capacity of energy output. Battery cell manufacturers can earn up to $35 per battery cell multiplied by potential kilowatt hours. In the case of solar, the credit offers producers 7 cents per solar module multiplied by wattage output. For mining operations extracting critical minerals, such as lithium, companies can receive a 10% tax break on the costs of production.Most credits phase out by 2032 under the Biden-era law, except those for critical mineral mining, which continue.A group of House Republicans, who have dubbed the tax credits the “green new scam” — echoing Trump’s rhetoric — pushed to accelerate the expiration in the final version of the mega-bill, even for critical mineral mining and production. The federal government classifies critical minerals as crucial to national security.The House-passed bill also severely tightens language around foreign components, titled “foreign entities of concern,” making the credit practically unusable as many parts of the clean energy manufacturing supply chain are global, industry professionals say.The legislation also repeals “transferability,” which allows companies with little or no tax liability to sell the credits.For example, a critical mineral mining company would not turn a profit during an initial phase and could sell the credits to offset the cost of operations.Schneider Electric, a global corporation with a U.S. base in Massachusetts, has facilitated 18 transfer deals worth $1.7 billion in tax credits for U.S. companies since 2023. In a statement, Schneider said the deals “reflect growing market interest in flexible financing mechanisms that directly fund renewable projects.”Silfab Solar, which recently built a solar cell manufacturing and module assembly plant in Fort Mill, South Carolina, announced in mid-May the sale of $110 million in Advanced Manufacturing and Production Credits to help fund its expansion. The company already runs a solar manufacturing site in Burlington, Washington.Investment soaredSpurred by the Advanced Manufacturing and Production Credit, known as 45X, actual investment in clean energy manufacturing since August 2022 reached $115 billion in April, up from $21 billion over the same length of time prior to the IRA, the Clean Investment Monitor found.Of the 380 clean technology production facilities announced since the third quarter of 2022, 161 are now operational, according to CIM data.The credit spurred a “sea change” in U.S. clean energy manufacturing, said Mike Williams, senior fellow at the liberal Center for American Progress and former deputy director of the BlueGreen Alliance, which advocates for the joining of labor and environmental organizations.Despite solar technology’s roots in the U.S., the nation “didn’t even have a toe” in solar manufacturing, Williams said. Other countries, most notably Germany and then China, have dominated the industry.“But after the Inflation Reduction Act passed, all of a sudden we see panel manufacturing, we see parts and components manufacturing, absolutely exploding. Plants have announced and started construction in Georgia, in Oklahoma,” Williams said in an interview with States Newsroom.Active manufacturing of solar components, advanced batteries and wind turbines and vessels is concentrated in rural areas. Most are located in states that went red in the 2024 presidential election, according to the Clean Power America Association’s May 2025 State of Clean Energy Manufacturing in America report.The renewable energy policy group estimated the industry supports 122,000 full-time manufacturing jobs across the U.S.Active solar manufacturing sites and expansions are clustered in Texas, Ohio and Alabama, according to data from the association. Should major project announcements in Georgia pull through, the state would surpass Alabama for third place.Advanced battery manufacturing spans 38 states, with the largest concentrations in California, Michigan and North Carolina.But various parts of the battery production process stretch throughout the country — for example, battery cell production in Nevada and Tennessee and module production in Utah. Other supporting hardware is made in South Carolina, Arizona and Texas.Lithium, a critical mineral for battery production, is currently mined in Nevada and California. And investors are eyeing other spots in the U.S., namely Alaska, to mine and produce graphite, another critical mineral.China largely dominates the world’s critical mineral supply chain, according to U.S. Geological Survey data for 2024.When accounting for the full suite of clean energy tax credits that were enacted in 2022 — including residential, electric vehicles and clean electricity credits — just over 312,900 new jobs are linked to the industry, the bulk in Republican-led congressional districts, according to the advocacy group Climate Power’s 2024 report on clean energy employment.Troy Van Beek, CEO and founder of the Iowa-based solar company Ideal Energy, said his business weathered the pandemic and has been able to add jobs, but is now facing uncertainty again.“​​We're getting our feet under us and really starting to operate. I went from 20-some jobs to over 60 jobs, and those are good-paying jobs for people and their families. So we need that stability in the industry,” said Van Beek, who spoke on the call with Doffling.“What troubles me is the rocking of the boat to such a degree that we can't get anything done, and that's been very difficult to deal with,” he said.Industry slowdownThe industry has seen a pullback since January and the beginning of the Trump presidency.Six announced projects representing $6.9 billion in investment were canceled in the first quarter of 2025, according to the Clean Investment Monitor’s latest State of U.S. Clean Energy Supply Chains report. While investment in clean energy overall continues to grow, the beginning of 2025 shows a slowdown from where the industry was a year ago.Van Beek, whose solar company provides construction and installation among others services, said recent talks to strike a deal with a solar manufacturer collapsed after threats to the tax credits.“We had worked an entire year on putting together (a deal) with one of the leading manufacturers in the world that has U.S. manufacturing to actually have joint ventures and work with them on projects,” Van Beek said. “And when this came up, that deal came to a screeching halt.”Van Beek did not name the company on the call and did not respond to a request for a follow-up interview.Several companies declined States Newsroom’s requests for comment while senators negotiate the bill.Spencer Pederson of the National Electrical Manufacturers Association said the unpredictability is interrupting how operators are planning for the coming years.“Whether large or small, just the business certainty and the ability to plan out your business is disrupted when you have any type of tax mechanism that is abruptly halted when you're doing business planning at five- or 10-year intervals,” said Pederson, the association’s senior vice president of public affairs.Too expensive, Republicans saySome House Republicans, led by Rep. Jen Kiggans of Virginia, urged party colleagues to protect the clean energy tax credits — for example by removing the “overly prescriptive” restrictions on foreign entities of concern and keeping in place transferability of tax credits.Kiggans wrote to House Republican tax writers in mid-May that “the last thing any of us want is to provoke an energy crisis or cause higher energy bills for working families.”Her co-signers included Don Bacon of Nebraska, Mark Amodei of Nevada, Rob Bresnahan of Pennsylvania, Juan Ciscomani of Arizona, Gabe Evans and Jeff Hurd of Colorado, Dave Joyce of Ohio and Dan Newhouse of Washington, who all eventually voted for the final bill.Far-right House members won on not only shortening the lifespan of the credits, but also on keeping the restrictive foreign entity language and on repealing a company’s ability to transfer credits.The right-leaning National Taxpayers Union hailed the “commonsense changes” championed by the far-right House Freedom Caucus, under the leadership of Maryland Rep. Andy Harris.The organization, which favors cutting government spending and lowering taxes, pointed to the cost. According to the Penn Wharton Budget Model, the credits as of 2022 were valued at roughly $384.9 billion over ten years.“The longer these subsidies remain in law, the more expensive they will become and the harder it will be for Congress to remove them. Now it’s up to the Senate to support the Green New Deal Rollbacks,” Thomas Aiello, NTU’s senior director of government affairs, wrote in the days following the House vote.Hope in the Senate?But representatives from multinational corporations to mid-size businesses and sizable trade associations are now looking to the U.S. Senate to restore measures that they say created a boom time for investment, production and new energy on the grid.Jeannie Salo, chief public policy officer at Schneider Electric, said in a statement to States Newsroom that “The Senate should restore and extend the timelines for key energy and manufacturing credits and their transferability to ensure the nation continues to attract key investments and projects that will power the U.S. economy and help make energy more affordable.”Pederson said the restrictions on foreign components and company ties are “particularly restrictive coming out of the House.”“So we're hoping to work with the Senate Finance Committee and some of the members of the Senate who have indicated some willingness to make the foreign entity of concern language a little bit more workable,” Pederson said.Doffling believes senators have a “longer term vision” of the nation’s energy strategy than House members who face reelection every two years.“They see what's happening not just in their district, but in the entire state that they represent,” Doffling said.The House bill just sets the U.S. “further behind,” he added. “This bill is all about going backwards in time and hoping for the best.”“I wish they could look at the numbers and understand the economic impacts it's gonna have. … But somehow we're talking about the fact of hamstringing a whole entire industry itself over verbiage of the word ‘clean.’”",,,,2025-06-06 17:10:17.519373

(Photo by Jennifer Peacock | Assembly Republican Office)Supporters of a new law that ended New Jersey’s controversial county-line ballot system signaled there is no rush to amend the statute, even after a federal judge warned this week that the law may be unconstitutional.
U.S. District Court Judge Zahid Quraishi in a Tuesday order said some balloting practices that were challenged in court last year likely remain unconstitutional despite changes signed into law this March, but Senate President Nicholas Scutari (D-Union) said he thinks the law, which he sponsored, “meets constitutional muster.”
“Ballot design has always been in the purview of the Legislature, but I’m aware of what he said,” Scutari said.
Scutari added that he had not read the order but had heard some of the judge’s concerns through other mediums.
It’s unclear what effect Quraishi’s order will have on future elections. There are primaries on Tuesday — gubernatorial and Assembly candidates are on the ballot — but it’s too soon to change ballots before then.
The new law was spurred by a lawsuit filed in February 2024 by now-Sen. Andy Kim and two other congressional candidates. The three Democrats alleged that the state’s county-line ballot system — which groups party-backed candidates on the ballot no matter what office they’re seeking — is unconstitutional.
In March 2024, Quraishi ruled that Kim’s lawsuit was likely to succeed on its merits, and he barred county clerks from using county-line ballots in the June 2024 primary. Instead, he ordered them to use office-block ballots, which group candidates by the office they’re seeking.
The Legislature then acted. Earlier this year, it passed the new ballot law, which revamped the design of primary ballots largely to conform to Quraishi’s March 2024 edict. But the judge, in his new order, noted that the law permits candidates to bracket with one another on the ballot and have their ballot positions determined by a single draw instead of individual draws.
Those provisions, he wrote, “likely do not remove the unconstitutional practices alleged.”
Quraishi’s March 2024 order barred clerks from conducting ballot draws that “do not include a separate drawing for every office and candidate” and required ballot draws offer each candidate an equal chance of securing the best ballot position.
The Kim lawsuit alleged  Jersey’s bracketing system — which allowed candidates to have their ballot positions drawn as a group if they shared a slogan, as did candidates backed by party leaders — violated other candidates’ associational rights by requiring they bracket with others to avoid being disadvantaged by the ballot itself.
Under prior law, ballot draws for candidates for high office could determine placements for those seeking other offices, from the state to local level.
The new law allows candidates seeking the same office, like two running mates for a single Assembly district, to have their ballot positions drawn as a group. Quraishi said this week that leaving ballot draws to clerks’ discretion could harm candidates in the future.
One of the law’s sponsors said the Legislature would act if Quraishi orders further changes.
“The ballot design legislation was written with unprecedented public input and reviewed by counsel from the Office of Legislative Services, as is the case with any law. If there is a legal challenge and a court determines we need to address something, I’m sure the legislature will,” said Assemblyman Al Barlas (R-Essex), who co-chaired an Assembly panel convened to consider new ballot design.
As the new law was being contemplated, numerous witnesses urged legislators to require randomized electronic ballot draws and rotating candidate ballot positions to ensure each appeared in the first position as often as their opponents and warned that bracketing provisions could disadvantage solo candidates.
Quraishi’s concerns haven’t spawned wide-reaching worry among the state’s most prominent politicians.
“They put the people who are running together together. I don’t have a great passion about that one way or the other, but the ballot worked for me,” Gov. Phil Murphy told reporters Thursday. “It was dead straight forward, dead easy.”

(Photo by Illustration Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Earlier this week, a young child in San Juan County with one dose of the measles vaccine contracted the measles on a domestic flight, putting area doctors on watch for more cases.
“I would say we’re in a cautious holding pattern,” Dr. Brad Scoggins, a pediatrician based in Farmington, told Source New Mexico. “We’re appropriately concerned, but not panicked.”
Measles, a highly contagious respiratory virus, spreads through contact with airborne droplets from an infected person’s coughs and sneezes. Symptoms can take one to three weeks tos develop, and include headache, cough, fever, red eyes and a spotty red rash on the head and face that spreads across the body.
New Mexico health officials report measles exposures in San Juan, Lea county hospitals

Scoggins said the clinic has enacted increased precautions to prevent spread, such as using virtual visits or testing any cases with symptoms of fever and rash outside of the clinic.
The New Mexico Department of Health reported no change in the state’s number of cases Friday, but public health officials have recently warned they expect a rise in cases due to summer travel.
Much like cases across the U.S., over 80% of New Mexico’s 81 measles infections impacted people who are unvaccinated or of unknown status. However, 13 cases of New Mexico’s included patients with at least one dose of the vaccine.
One dose of the measles vaccine offers 93% protection from infection and a second dose offers higher protection, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
When spread increases, measles can sometimes infect vaccinated people, but but with less severity, because the vaccine primes the body’s defense system to fight it, Scoggins said.
“In real world terms, that means that the duration of illness is a bit shorter, and the severity is less,” he said. “[Measles, mumps rubella] vaccine is considered a sterilizing vaccine. So once you’ve had the vaccination, you should theoretically not be able to transmit it — or at least, it’s much less likely.”
Scoggins said he empathizes with parents who are concerned about safety and efficacy of vaccines, despite decades of research.
“There’s a whole lot of noise out there right now, and it’s hard for parents to know, I think, who to listen to,” he said.
Scoggins said he’s working to counter misinformation by pointing people to works of history including “The Great Influenza” on the 1918 flu epidemic and “Man and Microbes,” a history of plagues.
“It offers a little bit of a historical perspective because we live in a time where we’re so protected from these things, but it’s only because of what our forebears have instituted,” he said.
Scoggins said that vaccine advice doesn’t just apply to his patients, noting his own children have vaccinations, as do all 12 of the pediatricians and nurse practitioners in his office with children.
“All of our kids have had their vaccines on their regular schedule,” he said. “We don’t do anything for other people’s kids that we wouldn’t do for our own.
Officials from San Juan County Regional Medical Center urged patients to call the NMDOH hotline at 1-833-796-8773, with any questions about testing, vaccines or symptoms.
“The best thing our community can do to protect themselves is to get vaccinated against the measles,” said Laura Werbner, a spokesperson at San Juan County Regional Medical Center. “Talk to your pediatrician about the measles vaccine for your children. If you are an adult and have not been vaccinated, you can still get the vaccine.”
More information about free vaccine clinics can be found at the state’s measles webpage.

,Mississippi Today,2025-06-06 20:16:47+00:00,Mississippi Today,"Violence fell notably during Jackson’s 100 Days of Peace, but ‘we can’t say’ why",Molly Minta,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/06/06/violence-fell-notably-during-jacksons-100-days-of-peace-but-we-cant-say-why/,"The reduction in violence was one goal of 100 Days of Peace, also known as 100 Days of Action, an initiative launched earlier this year by the Office of Violence Prevention and Trauma Recovery.","By the final day of “100 Days of Peace” in Jackson Friday, the city once called America’s deadliest had recorded a marked decline in violent offenses — 35% fewer homicides and nearly half of shootings — compared to last year. 
But amid instability at the city’s fledgling violence prevention office, the exact reason for the recent respite eludes city leaders. 
The reduction in violence was one goal of 100 Days of Peace, also known as 100 Days of Action, an initiative launched earlier this year by the Office of Violence Prevention and Trauma Recovery. 
From Feb. 27 to June 6, the office planned to host events to raise awareness and loosely create an atmosphere of peace in Jackson. It also announced $150,000 in grants, which began in January, to three community violence intervention organizations, Strong Arms of Mississippi, Living With Purpose and Operation Good.
The plan was to collect data to document how their work reduced violence outside of  police involvement or incarceration. It was a fitting opportunity for the office, which was only launched in 2022 with a $700,000 grant from the National League of Cities, to justify why the city should allocate its own resources to these efforts, instead of simply increasing the police budget.
But before that could happen, the city fired Keisha Coleman, the director of the office who was spearheading these data collection efforts. 
“We didn’t make it there,” Coleman said. “And I would like to get that information cause I still can look at it from a violence standpoint. We know homicides are down, but we can’t say with 100% accuracy what’s contributing to that.”

In other words, Coleman said she’d hoped to “prove that because of the 100 Days of Action and the initiatives that came from the office, it was a critical piece to keeping peace in the city.” 
To do that, Coleman said she had asked the three organizations to submit reports to her describing the number of people served, including their age and city zip code, what service they received, and how long they had been in each organization’s program. 
With Coleman gone, it’s unclear if the city of Jackson is hip to what data has been collected or if it plans to analyze it to determine what programs are most effective moving forward. When the city fulfilled Mississippi Today’s requests for data analysis after Coleman was fired, it only provided one report that Living With Purpose completed in February, before 100 Days of Peace began. 
But the city should have possession of more data than that. Benny Ivey, a co-lead of Strong Arms, told Mississippi Today his organization had submitted reports to Coleman detailing the work they were doing. 
“We’re constantly in the community working with kids,” he said. “We’ve got a bunch of parents that reach out to us weekly wanting to get their boys enrolled in their program. We pick them up, they play ball, we have group sessions.” 
Ivey did not seem to know that data analysis had been a goal of 100 Days of Peace. 
“100 Days of Peace was something that Keisha and the Office of Violence Prevention came up with just to bring awareness,” he said. “But events and barbecues and cookouts and waterslides, all that’s fun, but we’re out there on the ground with our boots trying to make real change.” 
Fredrick Womack, executive director of Operation Good, said his organization is working to make Jackson safer whether or not the city is able to collect data.
“We work every day to have peace,” Womack said. “We want 365 days of peace.” 
In some cities, the impact of solutions to violence that do not involve police has been straightforward to qualify: The mayor meets with rival gang members, and they agree to a ceasefire, in exchange for job training. 
But in Jackson, a variety of organizations are working to reduce violence outside of the police, and they employ different methods. In general, it can be difficult to show through crime data reported by the police how these organizations are impacting violence in the city — precisely because their work is intended to prevent people from becoming a statistic. 
Operation Good uses a variety of models, including an approach called “it takes a village,” to prevent interpersonal conflicts from turning violent and reduce the social conditions that lead to such conflicts. Strong Arms and Living With Purpose primarily work with credible messengers, folks in the community who have been involved in the criminal justice system, to encourage youth to take a less violent path in life.  
When the city launched the Office of Violence Prevention and Trauma Recovery more than two years ago, the goal was to help these organizations grow by offering support through additional grant funding and technical assistance, such as how to collect data.
Coleman said, when she showed Ivey the data she intended to collect earlier this year, he was ecstatic because he had not yet figured out how to do that. 
“Their passion exceeds their administrative duties,” she said. “They were doing the work, but they just hadn’t conditioned themselves to record it.”
But the first monthly deadline to submit data came and went with nothing submitted, she said. As part of the memorandum of understanding with the city, these three organizations were supposed to be submitting data to Coleman.
Strong Arms ended up submitting a quarterly report, Coleman said. She also met with Womack at Operation Good’s office to talk to him about the data she was needing, leading Womack to show her that he collected more data than she was asking for. 
“When she saw our spreadsheet and saw that it was more detailed and so forth, she just said that would be sufficient,” Womack said. 
But when Mississippi Today requested this information, the city only provided one report from Living With Purpose. Titled “OVPTR performance management meeting report,” the form shows that between Jan. 1, 2025, and Feb. 28, 2025 — the start of 100 Days of Peace — the organization reported 11 individuals had received a “ceasefire communication” outside of custody. 
The organization also conducted 19 mediations. While this term is not defined in the document, the spreadsheet notes that 80% were conflict mediations, with “two sides,” as opposed to “conflict intervention conversations,” which only had “one side.” (In Womack’s case, a mediation occurs after an Operation Good staff member intervenes in a potentially violent situation and helps the people involved leave with mutual understanding.) 
The form does not include location data, so it is not clear in which areas of the city these mediations took place in.

Multiple statistics show that violence and crime have fallen in Jackson. The Jackson Police Department recorded 17 homicides from Feb. 27 to June 6 of this year, compared with 26 in the same time frame last year. 
The Gun Violence Archive, a national nonprofit, documented 33 shootings in Jackson, compared to 61 last year. 
But JPD was not an official arm of 100 Days of Peace, and the department has its own explanation for why the city’s violent crime rate plummeted this year.
“Well, crime is down because a lot of people are still in jail,” Deputy Chief Sequerna Banks said. 
That’s because many people are receiving high bonds they cannot pay, preventing them from returning to the community.
“We’ve had some low bonds, something we’re not happy with, but that’s out of our control as far as setting bonds,” Banks said. “But most definitely the high bonds play a part. People are in jail on high bonds and not having to worry about them getting out and that plays a very high part in crime being down.” 
Ask Operation Good, Living With Purpose or Strong Arms why crime is down, they will say it’s because they are working to prevent people from committing crimes. 
For instance, Womack noted that Operation Good has actually intercepted more violent incidents this year compared to last, because Operation Good’s area has grown beyond south Jackson, and Womack has been able to hire more mediators. 
To support Womack’s point, Coleman said she had envisioned creating a series of heat maps of Jackson. She wanted to look at crimes committed in previous years and compare that to the past 100 days in Jackson to see if there was a reduction in the areas of the city served by the three organizations. 
“I explained that was gonna be the role of the Office of Violence Prevention, that once they collected their information or recorded their data, we would take it and synthesize it collectively, and we would create the stories and the narratives that go along with the data to show how the credible messengers and violence interruption organizations are real drivers of crime reduction in Jackson,” she said. 
Coleman never got that far, and confusion persists among city officials about what data can actually be provided to the public. 
“I don’t know if your public records request would account for all of their work,” outgoing Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said on Tuesday after the city council meeting, when asked if the city had any data on 100 Days of Peace. “It wouldn’t account for everything that they – you would only have access to the public information of us giving to them.” 
“I’m talking about communicating with them and understanding where they were engaged and what their engagements yielded,” he continued. “None of that would be recovered by a public records request, which is the meat of that type of work. The meat of actual violence interruption, you don’t go talk to gang members and say okay I need you to sign this document. It is actually about the connections, so that would never be connected by a public records request.” 
Safiya Omari, the mayor’s chief of staff, said that a number of offices around the country have been working to prove the efficacy of non-police approaches to violence. 
“There’s a lot of information that we collect,” she said. “What we have is a disconnect between data and actual work and now we are trying to bridge that disconnect.” 
Omari noted one example of data the city has obtained to support the office’s work. 
“For example, we know the six zip codes that have the highest amount of gun violence in the city,” she said. “The work is supposed to center around programmatically addressing what’s happening in the community. Events are good in terms of raising awareness, but you actually have to have some boots on the ground kind of work taking place.” 
A document analyzing those six zip codes was never provided in response to Mississippi Today’s records request for data. 
Other details are missing. Coleman said she distributed gun safety locks at the Westside Community Center as part of 100 Days of Peace, but that handout was not documented in the records provided to Mississippi Today.

Photo via Adobe StockWhen they returned to Montpelier for this legislative session, Vermont lawmakers looking to rein in Big Tech had to retrace their steps. Last biennium, after months of contentious negotiations, the state Legislature passed a sweeping data privacy package — a 100-plus-page bill that would have established some of the strongest online privacy protections in the nation. But despite broad support, Gov. Phil Scott vetoed the bill, arguing that it would harm local businesses while opening the state up to costly litigation. A vote to override the veto failed narrowly in the Senate.At the start of this session, the architects of last year’s bill followed a more piecemeal approach, splitting the changes into two main bills. One, S.69 — known by advocates as the Kids Code — would require social media companies to adjust their design codes for users under 18 with the goal of making platforms like TikTok and Snapchat less addictive and harmful for children. The other, S.71, would establish comprehensive data privacy protections, minimizing the amount of Vermonters’ data that tech companies and online retailers can collect, use and sell.With the session nearing a close, lawmakers are celebrating the passage of the former bill, which was overwhelmingly approved by both chambers last week and was delivered to the governor on Friday.But after months of testimony and dealmaking, legislators have chosen to put the data privacy overhaul on ice for the year. The primary reason to take more time, leading lawmakers have said, is to try to counter the narrative spread by an intense lobbying campaign waged by local and national interests against more stringent data privacy rules.“The public and even other members of the body don’t realize how extreme the lobbying tactics are on tech bills in the building,” Rep. Monique Priestley, D-Bradford, said last week.  “Lobbyists have a lot to do with deciding the fate of these bills.”Rep. Monique Priestley, D-Bradford, listens during a House Commerce and Economic Development Committee at the Statehouse in Montpelier on April 8, 2025. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger‘There are all these different levels of industry’ With federal lawmakers mostly unable or unwilling to effectively regulate cyberspace, Vermont legislators have been trying for years to establish digital privacy ground rules at the state level.In their latest attempt, state lawmakers this year put forward S.71, which seeks to minimize the amount of data that companies can harvest from Vermonters, enabling them to collect only what is necessary for the service they provide. In its original form, the bill also includes a private right of action, allowing consumers to sue companies for illegally collecting and selling sensitive data.  Almost as soon as it was introduced, the bill hit a wall of resistance from local businesses and national groups. “We have concerns about untested and confusing definitions, a continued private right of action being included and moving in a way that will catch businesses getting it wrong to the benefit of litigators rather than helping them get it right to the benefit of consumers,” Megan Sullivan, vice president of the Vermont Chamber of Commerce, said during a Senate committee hearing in March. The Vermont chamber and others instead backed S.93, another bill introduced this year that proposes weaker data protections and does not include a private right of action. But lawmakers have said that it’s hard to distinguish homegrown concerns from those of big tech companies who have swarmed the building this year as well. According to records from the Vermont Secretary of State’s Office, Meta, Apple, Amazon, Google, Netflix and TikTok all had representatives in the Capitol this year. Collectively, the six companies spent just over $110,000 on lobbying activities in Vermont since January. Representatives from nationwide industry lobbying groups that represent tech conglomerates, like the State Privacy and Security Coalition and the Connected Commerce Council, have also been in the building, according to records from the Secretary of State’s Office. “There are all these different levels of industry — the international companies and local businesses,” Sen. Wendy Harrison, D-Windham, said. “It’s more helpful for me and other legislators to know what the impact is on actual Vermont businesses.”Sen. Wendy Harrison, D-Windham, listens to testimony during a Senate committee meeting at the Statehouse in Montpelier on Feb. 28, 2024. File photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger Credit: Glenn Russell‘A compromise with industry’Lacking sufficient support to pass S.71 as written in the Senate, Harrison and fellow members of the Senate Committee on Institutions decided to amend the bill, essentially replacing it with the language of S.93 — thereby removing the private right of action — before passing it out of the chamber and over to the House. According to Priestley, the House Committee on Commerce, which took up the bill in April, expected to reach a compromise with industry players and eventually restore the bill to something closer to its original form before advancing it this year. Instead, they’ve decided to hold onto the bill for the summer.“Toward the end of session we were trying to get to a place where we could strike a compromise with industry, and it was really not coming to that,” she said.Priestley said that the pause would allow her coalition to work with lawmakers in other New England states like Connecticut, Massachusetts and Maine, which are developing similar policies. She also said she hoped the time would allow for lawmakers to find daylight between the concerns of Vermont businesses and those of tech conglomerates.“Our decision in wanting to take a pause this summer is in large part to make sure that we’re actually getting engagement from Vermonters and small businesses from all over the state because that’s who this is protecting,” she said.  Lawmakers have similarly decided to shelf until next year S.70, a bill that would put up stricter guardrails for third-party data brokers, and H.342, a bill that would grant public servants the legal right to request that their private information be removed from data broker websites like Whitepages.Priestley said she and other bill drafters would now “be spending all summer on engagement, education and coalition building” and will look to move forward on the bills next year.‘It’s critical to support our kids’Vermont lawmakers have found more common ground on the Kids Code, which cleared the Legislature last week and is now under review by Gov. Scott. Taking aim at social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram that consumer advocates say are explicitly designed to keep children hooked, the bill would require platforms to adjust their algorithms and design codes for users under 18, functionally prohibiting certain addictive features like 24-hour push notifications and endless scroll for minors. The legislation would also force social media platforms to adopt stringent default privacy settings for minors for their safety, while minimizing the data that the platforms can collect from younger users to then use or sell. Supporters say the bill would go a long way toward improving the mental health of teens by mitigating the worst excesses of social media use, a goal that also lies behind the ongoing push to ban smartphones from Vermont classrooms. A miscellaneous education bill, H.480, which would require K-12 schools in the state to adopt phone-free policies, passed out of the Senate last month and is awaiting approval from the House.“It’s critical to support our kids,” Harrison, the lead sponsor of S.69, said in an interview last week. “Having the ban on cellphones and the Kids Code together, I’m very pleased that we (in the Senate) have passed both of those.”The Kids Code now heads to the desk of Gov. Scott, who has tentatively signaled his support for the bill, at least in spirit.“I’m in favor of trying to protect kids from social media,” Scott said Wednesday at his weekly press conference, noting that at that point he had not officially received the bill. “They may have come to a place where I can support it, but, again, we’ll take a look at it when we get it.”Scott has continued to raise concerns that the Kids Code could face an uphill battle in the courts, where groups representing tech firms have attempted to torpedo similar laws passed by other states. However, the support from legislators in both chambers would be enough to override any veto, if it holds.Most prominently, NetChoice, an advocacy group representing Google and Meta, among many other companies, has sued several states, including California and Maryland, to block the implementation of social media design code laws on First Amendment grounds.However, Vermont lawmakers say the state’s Kid Code deliberately avoids those pitfalls by targeting the structural design of social media platforms rather than moderating content.  “We’ve basically been trying to keep up with those lawsuits and making sure that our language reflects what is being called out in court,” Priestley said.Read the story on VTDigger here:  As ‘Kids Code’ awaits action from Vermont Gov.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Clean energy advocates said Iowa stands to lose jobs, manufacturing facilities, renewable energy project expansions and face more expensive utility bills if Congress passes the budget reconciliation bill as is. 
Many of these credits were extended via the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act, which put them under attack from Republican lawmakers opposed to the green policies. Renewable energy advocates say continued investment into wind, solar and other clean energy sources, regardless of environmental impact, is vital to meeting growing energy demands. 
Nearly three-fifths of Iowa’s total electricity generation comes from renewable sources, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, which also reports Iowa is one of the top states for solar and wind energy generation. Since 2019, Iowa has generated more electricity via wind than from coal and continues to grow its solar production.

Kristina Costa, who formerly worked at the White House implementing the Inflation Reduction Act’s energy and climate policies, said the IRA established at least 10 years of tax credits to support clean energy industries, which launched new projects and expanded the industry.
“The House bill that the Republicans passed explodes that entire paradigm,” Costa said. “It functions as a full repeal of the Inflation Reduction Act.” 
Costa, during a Thursday press conference with Climate Power, said the bill “really radically” changes how clean electricity developers can plan and develop their projects, by eliminating the ability to “lock in” a tax treatment at the start of construction. 
“This is going to create a lot of uncertainty for project developers,” Costa said. “It’s going to raise financing costs for project developers pretty considerably … but it also just means that fewer projects will end up qualifying for the credits.” 
How the bill impacts clean energy projects
Clean energy tax credits impact transportation, power generation, industry and construction and create incentives for projects like renewable vehicle fuels, solar, wind, nuclear power generation and more. 
Per the reconciliation bill text as it passed the House May 22, the bill would terminate clean vehicle credits, residential energy efficiency credits, hydrogen fuel credits and place restrictions on credits for clean electricity production, zero-emission nuclear energy production and other sectors. 
Some of the restrictions include strict construction timeline requirements, like beginning construction within 60 days of enactment, and bringing the projects online by 2028.
Costa said these timelines create an “incredibly sharp cliff” for developers to work within for projects that often take years and can face lengthy setbacks from supply chain disruptions.
The budget bill also has extensive language pertaining to and restricting projects that have any ties to foreign entities. 
Costa said these restrictions are “very complicated, unworkable, Byzantine requirements” that impose “a lot of red tape” for developers and would have the “immediate effect of freezing the market.” 
She said it would require companies to understand where “literally every nut, bolt, screw and wire in a project they are building comes from” and certify that it does not have any ties to China or to Russia.
Costa said gutting these policies will lead to increased energy costs for American customers. A study from Clean Energy Buyers Association analyzed the impact of removing just two clean energy tax credit programs, and found it would cause an average increase of 7% for residential electricity costs.
Part of the problem is an anticipated 2% energy demand increase nationwide, in 2025 and again in 2026, according to the EIA. Much of that energy demand is a result of battery manufacturing and data centers. 
Iowa alone has roughly 100 data centers, which is one of the largest concentrations in the midwest. 
“The near term additions to the grid are going to come from renewables, or they’re supposed to come from renewables under the current tax regime,” Costa said. “That is why you would see these consumer electricity price increases.”
A spokesperson for Alliant Energy, one of Iowa’s utility companies with significant investments in solar and wind energy, said the company is monitoring the bill. 
A spokesperson for MidAmerican Energy declined to comment on the pending legislation. 
Earlier this year, NextEra Energy proposed restarting its Duane Arnold Energy Center, a nuclear plant near Palo. A representative from the company did not answer questions about the impact the Republican-sponsored bill would have on the Iowa project. 
A study from The Nature Conservancy found that clean energy tax credits in Iowa alone would add more than $238 million in annual economic value to Iowa, if left intact through 2032. 
Repeal of the credits would also affect associated manufacturing companies, like those that make solar panel parts, or wind turbine blades. 
Analysis from Climate Power found 400,000 jobs nationwide would be in jeopardy without the tax credits supporting the expanding industry. 
Joe Zimsen, an Iowa resident with 10 years of construction experience in the wind industry, said the IRA created a “tremendous amount of hope” among his colleagues in the industry that has now “disintegrated” because of budget bill. 
Zimsen formerly worked on wind projects near Grinnell, but now works for Renew Energy as a construction manager for off-shore wind projects. He and his family still live in Iowa, and he urged Iowa senators to oppose the bill as it is currently written.
“This policy of killing offshore and onshore wind and solar energy is going to have tremendous detrimental effects and set us back another 10 to 15 years behind our competitors, like China and Europe,” Zimsen said. “We can’t afford to do that.”
U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley said Tuesday that wind energy incentives have been at risk since 2015 when he worked to extend them, and he said he senators would try to find a “compromise” on them again, Radio Iowa reported.
But, the so-called, “big beautiful bill” comprises much more than just clean energy concerns, which Grassley said means one issue can’t “stand in the way” of the rest of the bill.
U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst’s office did not respond to requests for comment.

The road leads to a site where an Australian company called Felix Gold could begin mining antimony. (Max Graham/Northern Journal)Alaska hasn’t produced antimony — a shiny mineral used in weapons, flame retardants and solar panels — in almost 40 years.
That could change this summer, according to the executives of a Texas company that has snatched up more than 35,000 acres of mining claims in Alaska.
Dallas-based U.S. Antimony Corp. is looking to the state as a new source of antimony for its smelter in Montana, the only plant in the United States that refines the mineral.
Alaska’s antimony, the company says, could help the U.S. overcome a recent ban on exports of the mineral from China, the world’s top antimony producer. Antimony is among several minerals — many of which are used in renewable energy — that the U.S. has sourced primarily from China and other countries in recent decades. Efforts to build more mines in the U.S. have accelerated amid worsening trade tensions and growing demand.
With no active antimony mines, the U.S. in recent years has imported roughly 60% of its antimony from China. Meanwhile, need for the mineral has surged as antimony-laden arms flow to wars in Ukraine and the Middle East.
The price of the mineral has quadrupled in the past year, rising from around $13,000 to $55,000 per ton.
U.S. Antimony is now expanding its Montana smelter and rushing to find more ore to supply it. Alaska is its “primary focus” for boosting production, an executive said in an interview last week.
In the past eight months, a U.S. Antimony subsidiary, Great Land Minerals, has acquired claims in three different areas of Alaska’s Interior: outside Fairbanks; near the small town of Tok; and along the Maclaren River off the Denali Highway, a scenic road that runs outside the national park.
U.S. Antimony says it’s looking to truck antimony ore some 2,000 miles from Alaska to its processing plant in Montana. That operation could start as soon as September, executives said on a recent call with investors.
“We can’t get that antimony from Alaska to Montana fast enough,” Joe Bardswich, U.S. Antimony’s chief mining officer, said on the call.

The company’s plans coincide with a separate effort by an Australian company to start up its own small-scale antimony mine near Fairbanks.
Felix Gold is seeking to restart production this year at a long-shuttered antimony mine that sits within a few miles of a residential subdivision, Hattie Creek.
The company also is eyeing prospects near the hamlet of Ester on the outskirts of Fairbanks — where U.S. Antimony’s subsidiary has claims, too.
The potential developments are generating a mix of responses locally.
Some residents worry about environmental impacts of mining and its potential to transform tranquil Fairbanks-area neighborhoods into noisy industrial sites.
“I don’t want to be all NIMBY. But it literally is my backyard,” said Lisbet Norris, who lives in Hattie Creek, about 10 miles north of downtown Fairbanks. “It’s just so close.”
Norris, a dog musher, runs sled tours on trails that cross Felix Gold’s claims on state land, and she’s concerned that mining might impede her business. She’s also worried about heavy industrial use of the dirt road that connects her neighborhood — and Felix Gold’s potential operations — to the rest of town.
Other Fairbanks residents, however, say they support mining in the area; some cite the town’s early history as a gold mining town and the potential economic benefits of new mines.
“It’s because of mining that Fairbanks is what it is,” said Roger Burggraf, a local prospector who owns some of the claims that Felix Gold has leased to study the feasibility of antimony mining.

Burggraf said he understands the concerns of people who live near gold and antimony prospects. But when they bought their properties, “they should have realized that if a mine developed, that might change their lifestyle,” he added.
Felix Gold has a permit only for mineral exploration, not active mining.
The company aims later this year to apply for additional state permits, and to finish studying the profitability of developing a small antimony mine near the Hattie Creek subdivision.
U.S. Antimony also has applied only for a permit to search for antimony, though it hopes to apply for more permits and start mining within a year. If its exploration efforts show a mine would be profitable, it would propose an underground operation, said Rodney Blakestad, U.S. Antimony’s vice president of mining.
The footprint would be small, more similar to the family-run placer mines in the area than to a large-scale hardrock mine, according to Blakestad.
“We’re not Fort Knox,” he said, referring to Fairbanks’ huge open pit gold mine.
But before U.S. Antimony begins mining, it wants to buy antimony ore from existing placer gold mines.
Antimony often appears alongside more-valuable gold, and gold miners have typically thrown it aside.
Now that antimony prices are surging, though, U.S. Antimony representatives say every little bit is valuable. A 25-ton truck could carry some $600,000 worth of minerals, Bardswich said in an interview.
That means small loads of antimony ore from shallow, exploratory trenches that the company intends to dig at its Alaska prospects this summer also could be worth driving 2,000 miles to the Montana smelter, company executives said.
In the meantime, they intend to launch an advertising campaign to share their interest in buying the mineral from placer miners.
“People don’t realize this: Gold is not the best mineral to be mining, if you’re looking for really good value,” said Blakestad. “Antimony is.”

SPRINGFIELD — Illinois’ latest budget misses the mark in several key areas, according to one independent nonprofit fiscal analyst.

State lawmakers sent Gov. JB Pritzker a $55.2 billion budget on May 31 that raises $1 billion in new revenue and increases spending by more than $2 billion in fiscal year 2026 compared to the current year.

But the head of one of Chicago’s top nonpartisan government research organizations said lawmakers made too many short-term decisions to balance the budget in fiscal year 2026 that could make future fiscal years more challenging.

“It’s an incomplete budget,” Civic Federation President Jose Ferguson told Capitol News Illinois. “It does not add in any meaningful way to discuss any structural issues the state has. It’s a maintenance budget.”

Ferguson said a key reason for that is at least $271 million in fund sweeps used to balance the general revenue fund. Fund sweeps occur when lawmakers dip into lesser-known and underutilized funds outside the main general fund to use as a source of revenue for the fiscal year. This year’s budget also pauses several transfers to keep certain dollars available in the general fund for use this year.

For example, the budget calls for pausing the final transfer of motor fuel sales tax revenue to the road fund. The move would free up $171 million of general fund spending in FY26, but delays putting that money toward road construction projects.

“It's not balanced on gimmicks,” House Speaker Chris Welch, D-Hillside, told Capitol News Illinois for the latest episode of the “Illinois Lawmakers” program. “It's balanced based on revenues and expenditures, and it's based on what we know. We passed a budget based on what we knew at the time, and we weren't going to pass the budget with cuts alone.”

The FY26 budget would also suspend the monthly transfer to the “rainy day” fund for one year, freeing up $45 million for general fund use.

“It’s absolutely a mistake,” Ferguson said, calling that decision “troubling.”

The “rainy day” fund should continue to grow over time, he said, especially “knowing that we are going to need to go to some last-case resorts in all likelihood when we understand the federal impact and when we approach the transit issues as well, and this was not the moment to go to that well.”

The fund is still expected to grow from interest income and cannabis revenue in FY26.

Lawmakers used some of the fund sweeps to give the governor authority over a new $100 million “emergency” fund to plug unforeseen budget shortfalls.

Pritzker argued at a news conference after the budget passed that the state’s “structural” deficit – or the gap between ongoing spending and baseline revenues – has improved since he took office in 2019.

“We're diminishing the one-time expenditures that we have to make,” Pritzker said. “So we've gotten, really, much closer than ever before to balancing that structural deficit.”

Relying on fund sweeps will only make budgeting more challenging if a crisis arrives, Ferguson said.

“Everyone acknowledges that it is all but certain that there are additional things that are going to need to be attended to in the coming months,” Ferguson said.

An eye on Congress

New action from Congress that punches holes in state budgets, coupled with the state’s public transportation fiscal cliff, could be a wake-up call for lawmakers, Ferguson said.

The U.S. House has already passed a domestic policy plan that would shift more cost of government programs to states, cut Medicaid funding and phase out clean energy tax credits. The Senate is expected to make changes to the legislation, but President Donald Trump wants to sign the bill into law by July 4.

While many components may not hit Illinois’ budget this year, state lawmakers are watching for any changes that could require them to return to Springfield and adjust the FY26 budget.

“We have told the caucus to stand on the ready,” Welch said. State lawmakers boosted spending in the FY26 budget for safety net hospitals and federally qualified health centers, but the state wouldn’t be able to absorb major federal cuts to Medicaid.

“We got some room in there to be able to respond, but it’s hard to prepare when you don’t know exactly what’s coming down the pipe,” House budget leader Rep. Kam Buckner, D-Chicago, said during a news conference Thursday with the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee.

House Republican Leader Tony McCombie, R-Savanna, was less worried Congress will cut Medicaid and other key benefits.

“After conversations with the Illinois delegation, I don’t feel that there’s going to be any concerns with cuts that are important in our Medicaid budget,” McCombie told Capitol News Illinois.

Last-minute budgeting

Democrats unveiled a more than 3,300-page spending plan about 24 hours before it passed the General Assembly, while the $1 billion tax plan was filed about five hours before lawmakers took a vote.

Ferguson, the Civic Federation president, criticized the legislative process that gives lawmakers and the public little time to review the budget’s contents.

“It was chaotic, nontransparent – nontransparent even to the legislators that had to vote on it – and not really the way that we want to go about this business, especially at a sensitive time,” he said.

A group of conservative lawmakers also contended the process was illegal in a lawsuit filed this week in Sangamon County. The Illinois Freedom Caucus argues that the budget amendments were not read on three separate days in each chamber of the General Assembly, which they say violates the state constitution.

The constitution states a bill “shall be read by title on three different days in each house,” but does not specify that each amendment to a bill receive the same.

Each of the bills were read on three separate days this spring in both chambers, even though the substantial amendment containing the budget was filed in the final hours. For example, the bill lawmakers used to raise $1 billion of revenue was originally filed to establish an Emmitt Till commemorative day. The bill met the three readings requirement in both chambers before the Emmitt Till Day provision was removed in the final hours of session in favor of the tax plan.

The constitution also states that it’s up to the House speaker and Senate president to “certify that the procedural requirements for passage have been met.”

In applying what’s known as the “enrolled bill doctrine,” the Supreme Court has consistently declined to infringe on the legislature’s authority to certify its own bills, due to separation of powers concerns. It has also consistently upheld broad authority for the General Assembly to gut the original contents of a bill and amend it with a new subject, making the lawsuit a long shot.

(Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Immigrants being held inside a federal prison in northeast Kansas and their attorneys reported an unsanitary, inequitable and unhealthy environment that has left people, even those who have won their immigration cases, deprived of basic needs.
Based on interviews with people inside the prison and attorneys representing those people, immigrants face unsanitary and crowded living quarters, extended lockdowns, delayed and costly medical treatment, restricted contact with their families, and no access to religious services. 
In some cases, these conditions have led to suicide attempts.
“These aren’t criminals,” said Michael Sharma-Crawford, a local immigration attorney and chair of the Kansas and Missouri chapter of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. “In theory, none of these people deserves to be in jail.”
A pair of letters — one sent to the warden of the Leavenworth Federal Correctional Institution complaining of a rat infestation and another sent to the warden, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Federal Bureau of Prisons — detail conditions that are “well below” what is required of the federal agencies.
Attorneys and advocates claim in the letters, sent May 5 and May 29, that a “significant number” of people remain imprisoned at Leavenworth despite having won their immigration cases, which often fall under civil law, not criminal. Some cannot return to their countries of origin because, upon return, they could face torture or violence.
While the possibility of securing release for people facing deportation is low, Sharma-Crawford said ensuring they are held within legal standards could be done.
Leavenworth, formerly the Fort Leavenworth Military Prison, is one of two facilities in the state currently used to detain immigrants.
In February, ICE and the Bureau of Prisons agreed to hold immigrants at Leavenworth. A separate facility in Leavenworth, a shuttered prison owned by private company CoreCivic, was planned to reopen and detain immigrants as well, but a judge blocked the company from doing so Wednesday based on local zoning rules.
Sharma-Crawford said he has heard anecdotes about ICE officials in and around Chicago driving across the region, including to Kansas and Missouri, frantically trying to find a place to hold people.
More than 1,300 men are typically held in the medium-security prison, and about 220 are held in a minimum security “satellite camp.” At least 80 immigrants are being held at Leavenworth, according to the letter.
Randilee Giamusso, a spokeswoman for the prison bureau, declined to comment on the letter’s claims but confirmed the bureau received the letter.
“The Federal Bureau of Prisons is committed to ensuring the safety and security of all inmates in our population, our staff, and the public. We have received the letter,” Giamusso wrote in an email. “However, we do not comment on matters related to pending litigation,  legal proceedings, or investigations.”
Media officials at ICE did not respond to requests seeking a comment.
 
Life without sunlight
“Several immigrants” at Leavenworth experienced such a depression from extended lockdown periods, which sometimes lasted 20 hours at a time for three days straight, that they attempted suicide, said the May 29 letter signed by a collection of six civil rights organizations and attorney groups.
After their suicide attempts, they were reportedly put in solitary confinement.
“One detainee who witnessed a suicide attempt has felt depressed and fearful during subsequent lockdowns,” the letter said, “but has been afraid to report his mental health symptoms to staff for fear that he, too, will be removed from the unit and will be placed in solitary confinement.”
Another representative of the prison bureau declined to confirm or deny the letter’s claims about suicide attempts in Leavenworth.
Karla Juarez, executive director of Advocates for Immigrant Rights and Reconciliation, said in a news release that the conditions at Leavenworth are horrifying.
“What’s happening at FCI Leavenworth is not only a violation of ICE’s own policies — it’s a violation of our shared humanity,” she said.“These are people who have already won their immigration cases and who should be free with their families, not locked in overcrowded cells without access to medical care or even sunlight.”
People serving sentences from criminal convictions at Leavenworth are able to use the prison’s outdoor yard for recreation and exercise. Those in ICE’s custody are not, despite that being a condition of the two agencies’ collaboration.
The agreement between the federal agencies said: “ICE detainees will have access to education and psychology materials, leisure and law libraries, and indoor and outdoor recreation.”
Reports from inside the prison have found that people being held for immigration reasons have access to none of these things.
Plus, a pervasive language barrier has created a hurdle for immigrants in the prison who say their basic needs aren’t being met, the letter said.
Those imprisoned for crimes and in immigration cases both report that they usually do not encounter prison staff who speak Spanish, the letter said. One person who only speaks Spanish said he wasn’t offered a translator when given medical care. Another, who only speaks Russian, said his requests for medical assistance have gone unanswered for months.
Access to prescribed medications, dental care, mental health care and medical care has been delayed, the letter said, and “when they are seen by staff for treatment, they are not provided with proper care and are instructed to pay for medication, which is in violation of ICE policy.”
The letter concludes with a list of 14 recommendations. The foremost suggestion demands the release of all detained immigrants who have won their immigration cases. Others included providing free and timely medical care, interpretation services, free and private confidential calls with attorneys, access to a chaplain, free printing from the prison law library, recreational services, and outdoor time.
 
The ‘rodent letter’
In early May, the Kansas Federal Public Defenders wrote to Crystal Carter, the prison warden, and Nathan Atkinson, a general attorney for the prison bureau, about a months-long rat infestation in Leavenworth that showed “no signs of abating.”
“Rats have infested the housing area,” said the letter, obtained by Kansas Reflector, “Clients report rats stealing commissary and finding rat feces in their food, as well as finding dead rats in the common areas.”
The federal defenders saw and heard rats during visits with their clients. The letter outlined the health and safety hazards associated with such infestations, arguing that allowing the rodents to remain could degrade conditions so much so that it amounts to a constitutional violation.
Often, in-person visits are the attorneys’ only options, they said in the letter. They called video visits “problematic” because clients are frequently brought into video visitation rooms late, or the wrong person is brought in, or all the rooms are full, so visits have to be done in a common area.
Carter, the warden, stated in a May 13 response obtained by Kansas Reflector that the prison had cleaned infested areas and implemented pest control measures, including regular inspections, baiting, and setting traps.
A person who was detained in Leavenworth earlier this year described the prison to civil rights groups and attorneys as “very dirty.”
“We didn’t have any cleaning supplies. Food was the hardest part because it wasn’t a pleasant meal. There was no way to wash clothes. We only had one uniform, and that was it,” said the man, who was unnamed in a press release from the ACLU of Kansas. “Honestly, the time we were locked up in the cell was the worst. We had no communication with our families, and they didn’t comply with the necessary resources.”
While both letters make claims that the federal agencies are breaking the law, attorneys and advocates have not filed a lawsuit or an official complaint. If proper conditions for immigrants cannot be ensured, that’s when they could go to court, said Sharma-Crawford, the immigration attorney.
At one point, immigration officials and courts would allow leniency for immigrants with open cases who were in good standing, Sharma-Crawford said
“That grace is gone,” he said. “That humanity is gone.”
Eunice Cho, senior staff attorney at the ACLU’s National Prison Project, said the Trump administration should cease the use of federal prisons to detain immigrants.
“Holding people in extended lockdown, and denying them access to adequate medical care, legal counsel, and even sunlight isn’t just inhumane,” Cho said. “It’s illegal.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/U.S.-Penitentiary-Leavenworth-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-06 16:09:06.577566

Jim Carlin, shown here at a rally in October 2021, has launched a Republican campaign for U.S. senator.  (Photo by Katie Akin/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Former state legislator Jim Carlin, a Republican, announced he is running for Iowa’s U.S. Senate seat in the upcoming election — the latest candidate this week to announce their plans to run in 2026.
Carlin, who served in the Iowa Senate from 2017 through 2023 and previously in the Iowa House, is running for the seat currently held by U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst. Since his time in the Iowa Legislature, Carlin went on to found the Iowa Liberty Network, an organization focused on recruiting and electing “constitutional conservative” candidates in state government and other public offices.
In an interview with the Iowa Capital Dispatch, Carlin said Ernst is not reflecting Iowa Republicans’ values in Congress. He pointed to the Heritage Action scorecard for Ernst from the 2023 session, when she received a 42% score on how often her votes aligned with conservative goals. He pointed to her support for money to aid Ukraine in its war against Russia and her vote in favor of the Respect for Marriage Act as examples of Ernst not voting in line with conservative values.

Carlin said Ernst has not delivered on her commitment “make ’em squeal” by cutting federal spending, as well as promises to work to repeal the Affordable Care Act and 2014 campaign statement that she would only serve two terms in the U.S. Senate.
“The people of Iowa can judge whether or not she’s keeping those promises,” Carlin said. “And I believe that when they … evaluate it, when they look at her voting record and the decisions she’s made as a sitting senator, that they will come to the conclusion that she doesn’t represent them well in terms of the things they want to see done and the things that they believe in.”
Bryan Kraber, Ernst’s 2026 campaign manager, pointed to Carlin’s failed primary bid against U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley in the 2022 election. “Good luck trying to take on this combat veteran,” Kraber said in a statement Friday. “Senator Ernst has a proven record of conservative leadership—cutting waste, securing the border, and making Washington squeal to keep Iowans’ hard-earned money in their own pockets. And she delivers for our families, farmers, and veterans. Iowans already saw through Carlin’s last failed campaign, and they’ll reject his desperate attempt at relevance again in 2026.”
Though Carlin and Ernst are battling on conservative bonafides, much of the conversation centered on the upcoming race has focused on Ernst’s town hall statement that “we are all going to die” last week during talks on the funding cuts to Medicaid included in the budget reconciliation bill passed by the U.S. House. Carlin said he supports President Donald Trump’s spending goals and believes cuts that should be made to federal programs but “her handling of that showed a lack of judgment.”
“You don’t flippantly say to people, ‘well, we’re all going to die,'” Carlin said. “That actually kind of reminds me of Hillary Clinton’s statement, ‘what difference does it make,’ on the other side of Benghazi when people died. I thought it was really inappropriate.”
Iowa Rep. J.D. Scholten, D-Sioux City, announced Monday he would compete for the Democratic nomination, saying he “just can’t sit on the sidelines” following the Senator’s comments.
Scholten and Nathan Sage, a Mason City Democrat, are the only Democrats to have officially joined the race, but other potential Democratic candidates also weighed in on Ernst’s comments this week. State Sen. Zach Wahls, D-Coralville, who has expressed interested in a run, said “it is of course true that we are all going to die, but our Senators shouldn’t be the ones killing us” in response to Ernst’s comments.
State Rep. Josh Turek, D-Council Bluffs, is also weighing a bid for the seat. Turek joined a call with Protect Our Care Iowa, an organization advocating for health care access through programs like Medicaid, on Thursday and said the proposal to reduce Medicaid spending by $625 billion in the next decade and implement work requirements will prevent more people with disabilities from accessing needed care.
Republicans supporting the “big, beautiful” tax and spending bill have repeatedly stated people with disabilities and complex medical conditions as well other protected populations, like minors, seniors, parents of dependent children and pregnant people will not be subject to work requirements or taken off the program.
But Turek said as a person with a disability who has worked for an organization assessing and providing mobility devices, he has extensive experience with how funding cuts and moves like Iowa’s Medicaid privatization have limited access to needed health care and services for Iowans with disabilities. The state legislator said he went to Washington, D.C., to speak with all members of Iowa’s federal delegation about how the proposed changes will hurt people in need.
“I talked to them specifically about this bill and about the cuts to Medicaid, and additionally about what they’re looking at doing on grant funding,” Turek said. “And we’re looking at 140 organizations and groups here in Iowa, disability services — beyond just Medicaid, that are looking at losing all of their funding in some cases, or 50%, 25%. They cannot plead ignorance. They know exactly what this bill is. It’s a tax break to the richest, most wealthy Americans off the backs of the poorest and the most vulnerable.”
Woman who shouted ‘people will die’ at Ernst town hall runs for Iowa House
Ernst’s comment also led to another campaign launch for the Iowa House. India May, the 33-year-old from Charles City who sparked Ernst’s comments on Medicaid during the Parkersburg town hall, is running for Iowa House District 58, currently represented by Republican Rep. Charley Thomson, R-Charles City.
May, the Ionia Public Library director, is a county death investigator for Chickasaw County and registered nurse. She shouted “people will die” at Ernst during the public meeting.
“People are not — well, we all are going to die, so for heaven’s sake,” Ernst responded.
The day after the meeting, Ernst made an “apology video” filmed in a cemetery where she said she “made an incorrect assumption that everyone in the auditorium understood that, yes, we are all going to perish from this earth.”
“So I apologize, and I’m really, really glad that I did not have to bring up the subject of the tooth fairy as well,” Ernst said in the video. She also added that “for those that would like to see eternal and everlasting life, I encourage you to embrace my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.”
In a social media post responding to the video, May wrote that Ernst’s apology was “disingenuous and reinforced gaslighting and christofascism aimed toward her MAGA supporters.” She also used the platform to highlight her own run for office.
“In short, my response to Joni’s phoney apology is this: I don’t want to see another Iowan choose between medicine or food. It’s already happening and this bill will make it worse,” May wrote. “… Joni may be disappointed to know that I will continue to email her every day with my concerns, and that it is my intention to run as a progressive Democrat for Iowa House District 58, to undo the damage caused by the incumbent, Charley Thomson, who recently made headlines for targeting a nonprofit organization.”
May had referenced the directive sent by Thomson in his capacity as the House government oversight committee chair to the Iowa Migrant Movement for Justice, an immigrant rights organization, requesting information about the nonprofit organization’s clients, donors and members. An attorney for Iowa MMJ rejected the request in April, saying it was not legally valid.
Eddie Andrews joins governor’s race
Iowa Rep. Eddie Andrews launched his bid for Iowa governor Wednesday, running as a Republican for the seat that will be vacated by Gov. Kim Reynolds following the 2026 election.
Andrews, a Johnston Republican first elected in 2020, is one of the first GOP candidates to officially run in what is expected to be a crowded field. Former state Rep. Brad Sherman had announced he is running as a Republican gubernatorial candidate before Reynolds left the race. U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra and Iowa Sen. Mike Bousselot, R-Ankeny, have both launched exploratory committees for a gubernatorial campaign, and other high-profile Iowa Republicans like Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird and House Speaker Pat Grassley have expressed interest but not made a decision on whether to run.
In a news release on his run, Andrews said his work as a state lawmaker shows why Iowans should back his campaign — he highlighted his support for “landowner rights” through supporting bills restricting the use of eminent domain in carbon sequestration pipeline projects, efforts to increase psychiatric residencies and provide more incentives to keep doctors in the state, as well as proposals to end sales tax on certain essential items.
As governor, Andrews said he wants to focus on improving Iowa’s education system, making mental health care more accessible, and pledged to “destroy the human trafficking industry in our state.”
“Iowa deserves a Governor who listens and delivers,” Andrews said in a statement. “My experience as a tech entrepreneur, minister and legislator prepares me to serve you.”
Democrat Julie Stauch, a longtime Iowa political operative, also launched her campaign for governor this week. Iowa Auditor Rob Sand is considered the frontrunner in the Democratic gubernatorial primary, though Stauch alongside Democrat Paul Dahl will be competing against him in the primary June 2, 2026.

(Photo courtesy David Eaton, Murray State athletics)
College baseball legend Ron Polk has told us again and again through the years: “There is no such thing as an upset in baseball.”
Polk is right, of course. Baseball contains so many variables: bad hops, sore arms, sudden wind gusts, line drives that find gloves, weakly hit ground balls that find holes, capricious umpiring, etc.  All that contributes to the fact that anything can happen on any given day in baseball. But if we don’t call them upsets, then what to call what we have seen happen again and again in the NCAA Baseball Tournament that continues today at sites other than Mississippi?

Rick Cleveland 
Keep in mind, we are watching college baseball in a new era when the richer schools in the elite power conferences can simply buy the best players from the smaller schools in lesser leagues. You would think the pay-for-play and the transfer portal would make it doubly hard for the Murray States, the UTSAs and the Wright States of the college baseball world to compete with the SEC and other power conferences.
But, yet, here we are. Samples:

Closest to home, Murray State, a 4-seed from the Missouri Valley Conference, comes to Oxford, knocks off Ole Miss twice and wins a regional, probably playing in front of more fans in two games than they played before in their entire regular season. Get this: The Murray State head coach Dan Skirka reportedly makes $68,000 a year. Many power conference players make that much and more. Mississippi State just signed Brian O’Connor to a contract that will pay him $2.9 million a year. Nevertheless, the Murray State Racers came off the bus in Oxford hitting line drives and never quit. They will play a Super Regional at Duke beginning Saturday. I would not bet against them.
No. 1 seed Vanderbilt was eliminated by Wright State of the Horizon League. Wright State eliminated the Commodores before eventually losing to Louisville in the championship game. For those who don’t know, Wright State is located in Dayton, Ohio. The Horizon League includes such name brands as Youngstown State, Robert Morris and Northern Kentucky. Vandy probably spends more money on one player than Wright State has in its entire NIL budget. Yet, here we are.
UTSA of the American Athletic Conference stunned mighty Texas, the No. 2 seed overall, beating the Longhorns not once, but twice, in the Austin Regional. Want to know the beauty of this? UTSA lost its best pitcher and its best everyday player to the portal last year. The shortstop went to Arizona State. The pitcher went to – you guessed it – Texas. UTSA coach Pat Hallmark, asked about the players who left said this: “We’re not here if those players are still here. We’re here because they left. … If they want to get in the portal, get in the portal. We’ll go after the next guy.”
A record 13 SEC teams made the tournament. Only four advanced. And one of those, LSU, had to rally from behind to beat Little Rock in the championship game after losing to Little Rock the day before. Little Rock of the Ohio Valley Conference entered the tournament with a losing record and an RPI of 243.

The guess here is that legions of college baseball fans, disgusted with what the transfer portal and NIL have done to college athletics, will find themselves pulling for teams such as Murray State and UTSA as the tournament continues. 
More than likely the eventual champion will come from the Big Boy leagues. Such powers as Arkansas, LSU, Tennessee and Florida State still remain. They all host Super Regionals. They have all the advantages. 
Murray State? 
Wouldn’t that be something?",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/06142729/Murray-Celebrates.jpg,,,2025-06-06 16:09:06.577566

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Controversy continues to swirl around the president designate of Florida A&M University with the latest dispute over Marva Johnson’s five- year contract and how she will earn her pay.
FAMU Board of Trustees Chair Kristin Harper said Friday Johnson’s contract puts the university at odds with the FAMU Foundation, which is responsible for providing most of the money in the contract. That’s because state law caps state contributions at $200,000 annually for presidential salaries.
FAMU Foundation’s board chair said it could not afford a $750,000 base salary, the Tallahassee Democrat reported, which is what Johnson requested.
The FAMU Foundation anticipated the new president’s salary would be $588,562, Harper said, reading from a letter from the foundation. 
The contract says the board “shall use its best efforts to cause the foundation to contribute to the university portions of all payments” beyond $200,000. That language concerns Harper, who said she is not sure trustees have the ability to make the foundation, a direct support organization of the university, do anything.
“I have concerns about the burden, the financial burden that this places on the university and the university’s inability to fund this sweetheart deal of sweetheart deals,” Harper said.

There was significant pushback among alumni to Johnson’s candidacy much of which was centered around Johnson’s political connections to former Gov. Rick Scott and Gov. Ron DeSantis. Alumni also cited the lack of higher education administration experience as a reason to reject. Johnson.
Despite the opposition the FAMU Board of Trustees voted 8-4 last month to select Johnson its next president. Harper voted against selecting Johnson. After the trustees approved Johnson, the board voted to put FAMU trustee Nicole Washington in charge of negotiating the contract. At the time, Harper said she was offended.
The pick to run Florida’s only public HBCU is an ally to top Florida Republicans

On Friday Washington disagreed with Harper’s assessment about the foundation’s ability to pay.
“It’s my understanding that the foundation will be required to amend their budget to accommodate this expense,” Washington said. 
“Required is quite a strong word,” Harper replied.
Washington on Friday stood by the contract she negotiated, which was ultimately approved with an 8-3 vote.
“I compare this process to, similar to, buying a house. I still regret not buying a house back in 2017 when the median home price in Florida was $237[,000]. In 2025, that median price is $389,400, a 60% increase. The market has changed,” Washington said, calling the contract “competitive yet balanced.”
Johnson is yet to be approved by the Board of Governors. If approved, her contract would take effect Aug. 1.
Total compensation would be about $840,000 in the first year and rises up to about $981,000 in the final year.
Comparing the contract to other historically Black colleges and universities, the FAMU contract rises above the average HBCU contracts that search consultants evaluated of $446,094. The average of other institutions with a similar research capacity as FAMU is $617,021, according to consultants. 
Trustee Craig Reed took issue with the size of the contract compared to former President Larry Robinson, whose total salary was $591,669 in his last year.
“I find it highly difficult to approve a contract that significantly exceeds, essentially, what we paid our previous president that had significant experience as a sitting president and as a faculty member in a higher ed institution,” Reed said.
Compared to other State University institutions, FAMU’s package would land it below the 50th percentile in the first year, which is $899,644. 
The contract also provides Johnson a spot as a faculty member at the FAMU college of law after her presidency. 
Priorities
One concern voiced by some trustees and a pack of people during public comment, was whether the contract prioritizes retention rather than performance.
The five-year contract would start Johnson at a base salary of $650,000 with a 3% annual increase. 
The contract provides annual performance compensation of $86,000, if the board deems her performance worthy. For comparison, the recently negotiated University of Florida contract would’ve provided Santa Ono with a 20% performance bonus. Johnson’s performance bonus would be approximately 13% of her salary.
Her contract provides a $150,000 annual retention payment, able to be cashed out after the three and five-year marks. The retention bonus would be approximately 23% of her annual base salary.
“I’m just concerned, you know, about what matters more to this board: Occupying a seat or delivering outcomes for student success?” Harper said, adding that she would prefer that performance and retention were swapped. 
Trustee Zayla Bryant, a student, stood with Harper.
“And with that only being less than half of what her retention payment would be, I feel like that sets a clear standard or sets a clear indicator that her presence is more important than her performance,” Bryant said. 
But Washington countered that the two are intertwined.
“It’s interesting that you see that as an ‘either or.’ I see that as a ‘both and.’ In order for the president to remain for three years would require that she has performed over that time,” Washington responded, adding that “This is not a contract that anybody is going to get just for sitting in the seat.”

(Photo via Google Earth)A female resident of a Coralville care facility wandered from the home earlier this year and was later found at a Nebraska truck stop 265 miles away.
The incident occurred in January at Community NeuroRehab’s Glen Oaks facility in Coralville, a state-licensed, five-bed residential care facility for people with mental or developmental disabilities.
Newly disclosed state records show that a worker at the facility told state inspectors on May 14, 2025, that she was working the morning shift at 9:40 a.m. on Jan. 2, 2025, when she checked on a resident who was due for her medication.

The resident, who had previously been diagnosed with a traumatic brain injury, dementia and psychological issues, was not in her room. The worker discovered a bent window screen underneath the bed, and in looking out the window she saw a footprint on top of an air-conditioning unit directly under the window. It was snowing at the time, and the temperature was around 22 degrees.
The staff then launched a search for the woman in the community. Shortly after 5 p.m., the resident’s mother called the facility to report that her daughter had been found, confused and frightened, 265 miles away at a truck stop in Gretna, Nebraska.
According to state inspectors’ reports, the woman had “hitched a ride from a semi-driver who drove her to Nebraska.”
In their written report, state inspectors said the woman had “engaged in some type of sexual activity,” as determined by the medical provider she saw on Jan. 3, 2025, “resulting in a very traumatic 24 hours.” A review of lab work revealed that testing for sexually transmitted infections was negative, the inspectors reported.
A worker at the home allegedly told inspectors she had been trained to check and make sure each resident was present at the beginning of her shift but acknowledged she had not done so on Jan. 2, 2025.
Inspectors concluded the resident had walked 2.3 miles through a mostly residential neighborhood to an interstate highway and then hitched a ride where she appeared to have been picked up by the driver of a semi-truck.
The Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing recently fined Community NeuroRehab $3,000 for resident-safety violations related to the incident.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — An ousted member of the state’s top school board will lead the process to approve K-12 textbooks that align with controversial new academic standards for social studies.
Former Oklahoma State Board of Education member Kendra Wesson will continue as the chair of a key committee that chooses all state-approved textbooks for public schools. She has been State Superintendent Ryan Walters’ designee to lead the committee since she joined the state Board of Education in January 2023.
“​Serving in this role and being able to still help my state is what it’s all about, right?” Wesson said. “It’s not about (having my) name in lights. It’s about doing the serving and coming in and being who I am and consistently being who I am. So, I value it very much.”
Wesson, of Norman, said she brings high integrity to the role and has enjoyed the committee and its staff, so “it meant a lot to me to be able to stay here.”
A spokesperson for Walters’ office did not immediately return a request for comment on the superintendent’s designee and the coming textbook adoption cycle.

Gov. Kevin Stitt replaced three state Board of Education members, including Wesson, on Feb. 11 while complaining the board had fallen victim to “needless political drama.” The three removed members had voted with Walters to advance a now-defeated proposal to have public schools collect students’ immigration status, an idea Stitt opposed.
Wesson and the State Textbook Committee gathered Friday for an orientation meeting to initiate the 2025-26 adoption cycle, a process that determines which textbooks the state will approve for the next six years. The committee last met Feb. 7 to conclude the 2024-25 cycle.
Like with the state Board of Education, the governor appoints all members of the 13-member textbook committee except for one — the state superintendent, who can choose a designee to serve as the committee’s chair in his place.
The committee, mostly made up of educators, will receive sample products by July 1 from textbook publishers interested in selling to Oklahoma school districts. The number of companies bidding in the small-market state has dwindled in recent years while political debates over classroom content grew. 
After the July 1 deadline, teams of subject-matter experts will begin quality reviews of the submitted learning material in August before making recommendations to the textbook committee, said Carolynn Bristow, project manager of educational materials for the Oklahoma State Department of Education.

The process culminates in the committee’s Nov. 14 vote to approve a list of textbooks aligning with the newly enacted standards for social studies education. The committee also will vote on instructional materials for personal financial literacy courses. The state will execute contracts with publishers in February after the board’s final meeting of the adoption cycle.
Wesson said the committee will follow the typical textbook adoption process and doesn’t anticipate any differences from previous cycles.
The committee and its review teams will adhere to a pre-approved rubric to evaluate textbook materials, she said.
The rubric checks for classroom usability and compliance with state academic standards. Last year, the committee also added social and moral questions to the rubric asking whether the submitted materials “degrade traditional roles of men and women,” promote “illegal lifestyles” or neglect the importance of religion in preserving American liberties.
“We have a great team here at (the state Education Department) that keeps us on track, and that’s why that rubric is there, to keep everybody on the same page,” Wesson said. “And so you will always find this committee, especially, following that process.”
The new social studies standards, which dictate what public schools must teach to students in history and government classes, have been the source of significant public scrutiny this year.

The standards now require schools to educate students about biblical teachings and Judeo-Christian values that influenced the American colonies and founding fathers, which Walters has said is crucial to ensuring students understand the full context of the country’s history. 
Language casting doubt on the integrity of the 2020 presidential election results also is required teaching.
Stitt’s three new appointees to the state Board of Education said they were unaware of the 2020 election language at the time they voted on the standards on Feb. 27. Walters said he is responsible for adding the new content, but he didn’t acknowledge it until weeks after the board vote.
Despite bipartisan concerns among the state Legislature, the Republican supermajority in the state House and Senate permitted the standards to take effect. A lawsuit in Oklahoma County District Court contends Walters’ administration failed to uphold proper transparency procedures.
Wesson said the State Textbook Committee won’t have any issues finding textbooks that align with the new social studies standards, even with the new content that has made headlines.
“We’re not going to have a problem there at all,” she said.

(Getty image)Attention voters in Central Falls and Rhode Island’s Senate District 4: The deadline to register to vote or change your affiliation to participate in special city and legislative elections is days away.
Voters have until 4 p.m. on Sunday, June 8, to register or change party affiliation ahead of the July 8 Democratic Senate District 4 primary and a special city election in Central Falls. Forms can be completed online at vote.ri.gov, or by mailing or dropping off a paper form at your municipal board of canvassers office.
In Senate District 4, spanning North Providence and a small section of Providence, four Democrats have signaled their intent to run for the open seat left vacant after former Senate President Dominick Ruggerio died in April. There is also one Republican and one independent who have declared they are running, and will compete in an Aug. 5 general election.
Senate candidates must submit nomination forms with 100 valid signatures from voters by June 10 to have their name appear on the ballot.
Central Falls will hold special elections — without a primary —  on July 8 for an open seat on the City Council alongside a ballot question over changes to the structure of the city school board. One candidate, Anthony Solano, will appear on the ballot for the open City Council District 4 seat, having already submitted the required signatures by the May 7 deadline. 
Close behind the registration deadline is a second key date for primary voters: The deadline to apply for a mail ballot. Applications are already available online, due back no later than 4 p.m. June 17. Applications sent by mail must be postmarked by the Aug. 20 deadline. 
Another special election is slated for Aug. 5 in Coventry to decide two seats on the Coventry Town Council. Three candidates — Richard Houle, Kathy Farwell and Robert Delellis — have declared their intent to run in the nonpartisan race, for which there is no primary. Coventry voters have until Sunday, July 6, to register to vote.
More information on upcoming election dates and deadlines for voters and candidates is available on the Rhode Island Secretary of State’s website.

Wyoming’s lone congressperson wants to codify Trump’s push to require English proficiency among drivers. Reaction was mixed among truckers on I-80.
The post Hageman wants to crack down on truckers’ English. Drivers are split over whether it’s needed. appeared first on WyoFile .","In a state where the vast majority of residents are white, the truck stops along Wyoming’s 400 miles of Interstate 80 stand out as racial and linguistic melting pots. 
Among the idling semi-trucks and in the lounge areas where people wait their turn at a shower, drivers speak to each other or into phones in Russian, Spanish, Nepali, Hindi and more. 
To some, including President Donald Trump and supporters of his Make America Great Again political movement, these roadside Babels represent a troubling trend — an increasing number of truck drivers who don’t speak English as a first language — and a public safety threat. 
Over the last two months, the Trump administration and Republican lawmakers, including Wyoming Rep. Harriet Hageman, have moved to take truck drivers who don’t speak a certain level of English off the road.
Federal law has long required commercial truck drivers to possess a certain level of English proficiency. But in 2016, the federal government issued guidance that while drivers could be cited if a law enforcement officer found they failed to meet that requirement, they could also drive on. 
On April 28, Trump reversed that policy and instituted a new crackdown. Beginning June 25, Wyoming Highway Patrol officers, along with their counterparts in other states, will work under new guidelines that call for them to test the English of drivers they interact with if they suspect a lack of language proficiency. Drivers could face those tests if pulled over on suspicion of a traffic offense, or during inspections that sometimes occur at weigh stations and the state’s port-of-entry facilities. 
If drivers fail the roadside test, they’ll be taken out of service — forced to park their truck until a different driver can reach Wyoming and take the wheel. Among immigrant truck drivers, that burdensome consequence has raised concerns about the arbitrariness of patrol officers and inspectors conducting language exams. 
Hageman has championed the issue, and this month announced her cosponsorship of legislation to codify Trump’s executive order into law — meaning a future president couldn’t just relax the enforcement requirement again.
A spokesperson for Hageman did not respond to an email requesting an interview with Wyoming’s lone representative. 
Trucker response
It’s a crackdown drawing mixed reactions among truck drivers passing through Wyoming. 
“I’m a native Russian speaker, but I feel it was my obligation to learn English,” Grey Kiroff, who has been driving trucks in the United States since 2002, told a WyoFile reporter Wednesday, after stepping down from his cab at Love’s Travel Stop outside Laramie. 
“This is an absolute necessity, it’s not just a good idea,” he said. 
But others considered the new emphasis on English proficiency another prong in the Trump administration’s assault on the country’s immigrant workers. 
“I have seen people who don’t speak English do this job really well,” one driver, who said he’d immigrated to the United States but declined to share his name or country of origin, told WyoFile. Lacking English proficiency is “not a barrier” to safe driving, the driver said, speaking to WyoFile next to his truck while stopped at the Akal Travel Center 20 miles further west. 
Another driver there, who spoke to a reporter in Spanish, said he could not converse in English but was perfectly capable of reading road signs. He also declined to share his name, as did several opponents of the Trump administration’s rule change, saying they did not want to draw attention to themselves.
Tightening the language requirement, the Spanish-speaking driver said, would hurt an economy that depended on many immigrant drivers.

Nearly every truck driver interviewed by WyoFile agreed people need to be able to read road signage to some degree — particularly in Wyoming and the Mountain West, where signs identify steep grades or warn of inclement weather. 
“The hills are messed up,” Ron Brown, a driver from Pennsylvania, said. “If guys don’t know how to read the signs, they’re not even going to drop the Jake.” Brown was referring to using the engine brake on a long downslope, which can keep a truck from blowing its brakes and beginning an out-of-control descent.    
“I don’t feel that it’s racist, I feel that it’s necessary,” Kim Starr, a driver from California, said. 
But drivers disagreed on whether significant numbers of truckers were on the road, who couldn’t hit that threshold of English proficiency.
Inside the Akal travel center, reputed for a small restaurant churning out Indian cuisine, an employee said the many drivers he interacts with all have a sufficient grasp of English. Long-distance truck drivers crash because they’re using their phones or watching videos while driving, or they’re intoxicated, or they fall asleep at the wheel, said the employee, who gave his first name as Jamal but declined to share a last name.
“It’s not about the language,” Jamal said. “It’s all politics.”
Roadside test
Wyoming Highway Patrol officials provided WyoFile with a copy of the new testing rules, issued May 20 by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. The new regulation calls for officers to first ask drivers a series of questions, such as “how long have you been driving today?” or “did you perform your pre-trip inspection before you started driving today?”
If officers decide someone is unable to respond well enough to those questions in English, they can take the driver out of service, preventing them from traveling on. If the drivers pass that portion of the test, however, officers are also directed to quiz the driver on traffic signs. 
The guidance obtained by WyoFile includes 37 images of highway signs. Officers are instructed to quiz drivers on four of them — and drivers must properly identify at least three to pass the test. 
Officers can pick from a set of signs that vary widely, from a simple speed limit sign to a sign stating “trucks over 10 tons must enter weigh station next right.” 
In Wyoming, troopers will escort a truck driver who fails the test, if it’s administered along the side of the highway, to the next good stopping point, Lt. Colonel Karl Germain told WyoFile.
Immigrant truck drivers are concerned about the potential for bias as state troopers and inspectors are given the power to determine a legal level of English. “Accents, cultural differences, or imperfect grammar should not be a reason to end someone’s career,” an online petition calling for federal regulators to rethink Trump’s executive order states. The petition had more than 7,500 signatures as of Friday. It also notes that with just 60 days from order to implementation, truck drivers and companies haven’t had time to prepare for the English tests. 
“We all contribute to this country, and we all deserve equal respect on the road,” the petition, which does not note an author, says.

Long-standing industry instability and legitimate public safety concerns are mixing with the current political climate, University of Minnesota economics professor and former long-haul truck driver Stephen Burks told WyoFile. Trucking companies have become places of high turnover, where drivers are worn down by firms’ desires to keep them on the road and away from home for long periods, coupled with often low pay, Burks, who studies the industry with an emphasis on labor economics, said.
Amid those pressures, and amid the impacts of free-trade agreements that allowed Canadian and Mexican drivers into the country in increasing numbers, American truck drivers have long worried about immigrants who accept lower pay and companies that skirt rules to bring in cheaper drivers. Companies that might bend the rules on foreign drivers are also likely to worry less about regulations that increase driver and motorist safety, Burks said. 
Regulating drivers’ English addresses those various anxieties.
“This English proficiency thing is kind of a new variant on the same concern, and it naturally meshes for the Trump folks with the anti-immigrant sentiment,” he said. “Is there a legitimate underlying issue? Yes, there is. I can not tell you how big it is.”
Connor’s Law 
Supporters of the crackdown, like Hageman, point to specific tragedies. The bill Hageman is cosponsoring is called Connor’s Law, and is named after Connor Dzion, an 18-year-old who was killed by a semi-truck driver in 2017, on Interstate 95 in Florida. I-95 is the principal north-south highway along the East Coast. 
Dzion’s family sued two truck companies, and a jury issued a $1 billion damage verdict after finding drivers for both companies were distracted and responsible for Dzion’s death. 
One driver, a Russian immigrant, created a mile-long traffic backup after crashing his tractor trailer, Jacksonville, Florida-based attorney Curry Pajcic, who litigated the case for the Dzions, told WyoFile. That driver was on drugs and watching pornography on a cell phone when he crashed, Pajcic said. 
Dzion, in a Toyota Corolla his parents gifted him on his 16th birthday, was the last car in the traffic backup. A second truck driver, an Indian immigrant to Canada who had been driving for 25 hours straight from Montreal, smashed into Dzion and killed him. 
That driver drove by multiple signs warning of stopped traffic, keeping “the hammer down on cruise control at 70 mph,” Pajcic said. The truck crested a low rise in the road and hit the traffic on the other side. The driver was allowed to return to Canada after the crash, according to Pajcic. As a result, lawyers were unable to get his cell phone data or post-crash drug test results. 
Pajcic’s team proved the driver had falsified his driving logs, the attorney said, and they proved he couldn’t read signs in English in depositions. 
It’s possible the language barrier was one factor among others, Pajcic said, but he believed if the driver could have understood the signs, he may have slowed down in time. “There’s a reason the rules say ‘you gotta read fucking English,’ if you don’t you’re gonna kill someone,” Pajcic said. 
He and Dzion’s parents have worked with lawmakers on Connor’s Law, he said, because even if other factors are involved in such crashes, they believe stricter enforcement of English language proficiency could save lives. “We never want there to be another Connor,” he said. Pajcic too, though, said he thought the new rules could also protect jobs for U.S. drivers. 
“It takes away American jobs,” he said of companies bringing in foreign drivers. “It drives down the quality of our drivers and we need to protect American roads.”

Across the country, some state lawmakers are concerned that the growing data center industry is creating a surge in demand for new electricity and grid infrastructure. (George Frey/Getty Images)Since the legislature established the Utah Inland Port Authority (UIPA) in 2018, UIPA has demonstrated an ability to spend millions of tax payer money on one bad idea after another.  The latest is to bring artificial intelligence (AI) data centers to their Wasatch Front project areas. UIPA is being caught up in a 21st century gold rush, but like the one in 1848, it will turn out to be mostly fool’s gold.
Nationwide, state and local officials are fast tracking data center permits in their communities, foolishly giving them enormous tax breaks. Most of the biggest data centers are being built by the mega-billionaire tech bros like Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg, the very same people who are already hoarding unprecedented wealth and power. Much of the impetus for these data centers has degenerated into a race between these mega-billionaires to see who ultimately dominates the holy grail of computing — “artificial general intelligence” (AGI), essentially human brain level sophisticated computation. Data center construction has doubled just since 2022, and the only result is further concentration of wealth and power at the top of  big tech.
The tech bros race to rule AGI is the crown jewel in their pathologic ethos of “move fast and break things.” Numerous experts are warning about the existential danger of AGI. It will render many jobs obsolete, it represents a grave national security threat, and it blurs the lines between truth and fiction. This next level AI creates new content by analyzing and mimicking patterns from vast amounts of existing data. Its uses are far beyond helping students to cheat on writing papers. It’s being used to spread climate misinformation, exacerbate housing discrimination of Black communities, create increasingly sophisticated phishing scams, and assisting state and corporate surveillance, monitoring workers’ every move. AI is stymieing worker critical thinking and not delivering productivity gains.
A State Department report concluded AI could pose an “extinction-level” threat, comparing it to the threat of nuclear weapons if not regulated. AI workers are concerned about the irresponsibility, and perverse motives of these tech companies’ executives.
Our environment is another one of the things they are “breaking.” Data centers already rank in the top 10 water-consuming industries. Data centers can consume up to 5 million gallons of potable water a day, 25 times the 200,000 gallon commercial limit set by Salt Lake City. Good luck saving Great Salt Lake if we surround it with UIPA-subsidized data centers.
Cryptocurrency serves no useful purpose and requires massive AI computations. Each Bitcoin transaction generates the equivalent carbon footprint of one million VISA transactions.  Bitcoin is already one of the leading global industrial polluters. The quality of the algorithms is dependent on the size of the computing systems, and AGI can require 10 to 100 times more computing power than say GPT-4, with an exponential increase in energy demand.  One complex can require 100 MW of electricity, the entire output of a small coal-fired power plant. Energy demand from AI data centers is forecasted to more than quadruple by 2030, strain on local electrical grids will be substantial. “Hyperscale” data centers can require dozens of highly polluting diesel generators for back-up power.
AGI electricity demand is undermining decarbonization strategies worldwide, driving an increase in carbon emissions at the worst possible time for climate mitigation. Gov. Spencer Cox cited electricity demands of AI as contributing to Utah’s “energy crisis” justifying his “Operation Gigawatt,” a promotion of his “all of the above” strategy, including more polluting, climate killing fossil fuels and risky nuclear power.
Data centers are noise pollution centers. They emit constant humming and buzzing that can exceed 85 decibels, which is bothersome and harmful to neighbors. Noise pollution is the second most hazardous environmental pollutant after air pollution, causing many of the same adverse health outcomes.
Musk’s xAI is being used primarily for his chatbot, Grok, which allows creation of unfiltered deepfake images, like Mickey Mouse wearing a Nazi uniform, and ever more pornography. Musk calls it “the most fun AI in the world.”  The environmental price tag of all that “fun” is enormous. For example, Musk’s AI supercomputer center in Memphis, Tennessee, uses 35 methane driven gas turbines, none have pollution controls required by EPA. It is already one of the largest emitters of toxic nitrogen oxides in a highly polluted county, far more than an oil refinery. Imagine if Utah allowed UIPA to bring several of these to Salt Lake, Tooele, and Weber Counties, each emitting far more pollution than another oil refinery.
In many ways the explosion of artificial intelligence is already harming society and threatening our future. We should rename it “artificial stupidity.” Utah should be smarter than to allow UIPA to drag us into competing for tax payer subsidized big tech data centers, leaving the rest of us as collateral damage.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Utah-data-center.jpg,,,2025-06-06 15:09:17.375450

Idaho law enforcement agencies never send texts to people to demand payments, threaten penalties for violations or tolls that haven’t been paid, or for missed jury duty, the Idaho Attorney General’s Office said in a news release. 
“Scammers stole over $63 million from Idahoans last year, predominantly targeting our seniors,” Attorney General Raúl Labrador said in a statement. “These scammers are now using fake DMV texts to steal even more. Idaho families need to know that legitimate government agencies never demand payments through text messages.”
Claiming to be from the Idaho DMV, some of the scam texts say your driver’s license could be immediately suspended unless you pay — through a suspicious link. 
The Idaho Attorney General’s Office urges Idahoans to look out for red flags, like:

Demanding payment urgently — or through gift cards.
Threats to suspend licenses, or even arrest.
And suspicious web links that might look official.

If you receive a suspicious text, do not click any links or share your personal information. Report the text to the Federal Trade Commission, and delete it. The FTC’s fraud reporting website is https://reportfraud.ftc.gov. 
The Idaho Transportation Department is also warning Idahoans about scam texts that falsely promote online payments or quicker access to REAL IDs, also known as Star Cards. 
“Scammers are targeting Idahoans with messages that look official but are completely fake,” Idaho DMV Administrator Lisa McClellan said in a statement. “Your REAL ID can only be obtained in person through an authorized DMV office, not by clicking a link in a text message.”

(Stock photo by Doug Wilson via Getty Images)Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds has signed into law a bill allowing municipalities to establish a Length of Service Award program for members of volunteer first-responder organizations. 
Under the provisions of House File 1002, municipalities that establish such a program can apply for matching state funding. The state funding will be awarded on a dollar-to-dollar basis for awards of up to $500 per person. Volunteer firefighters, volunteer emergency medical care providers, and emergency peace reserve officers are eligible for a Length of Service Award. 
“It’s more like we’re unpaid firefighters and first-responders,” said Kent Brix, first vice president of Iowa Firefighters Association. “We all go through the same training as professionals, we deal with the same situations as professionals. It’s just that small communities can’t afford to hire people full-time.”
According to Brix, volunteer participation is a major problem, with most volunteer departments down five to six people. Across the state, he estimates, 100 to 150 people are dropping out of volunteer first-responder programs each year. Many of the volunteers are age 50 to 70 — and sometimes older. Low volunteer rates mean that some communities are very short on people to respond to emergency calls. Brix believes that by providing an incentive for volunteers, it will increase participation in the programs. 
“It takes so much of your time with all the training required by the state and new rules,” said Keith McDavid, a former Pleasantville volunteer firefighter of 33 years. “It’s a lot of time and effort. And the amount of time a volunteer puts in is crazy sometimes, especially if you become a volunteer EMT.” 
When McDavid became a volunteer, the fire and rescue teams in Pleasantville were separate with around 20 members each. Now both teams have been combined with only a total of only to 15 to 20 members. He also noted that participation on an individual basis is diminished, with many members unable to put in as much time. The result is a reduction in capability to address emergency situations in a timely manner.
McDavid said he was never personally interested in a monetary reward, but notes that one of the biggest issues for volunteers is the cost of equipment. During his time in the service, his team would buy used firetrucks through eBay and refurbish them with the assistance of members who had experience as mechanics. 
Brix said that affording firetrucks, buildings and equipment is a major issue for organizations. Volunteer fire organizations get a certain amount of tax money from their community, he said, and they hold around two to three fundraisers each year, but even then it’s a “constant money chase.”
“It’s something to protect a person’s life, so it’s not cheap,” Brix said. “We always have different equipment we have to have to protect ourselves and protect our communities.”
Reynolds also signed House File 969 on Friday, a bill dealing with cancer coverage for firefighters.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)The completion date and cost for a new westbound Washington Bridge is finally here. But it will take two more years and $59 million more than expected to resurrect a new thoroughfare connecting Providence and East Providence.
Gov. Dan McKee unveiled the November 2028 target completion date and an up-to-$427 million contract cost at a State House press conference Friday. 
The long-awaited news comes nearly a year-and-a-half after state officials halted all traffic on the westbound highway after engineers discovered broken anchor rods that put the bridge spanning the Seekonk River at risk of collapse.
State officials originally sought to rebuild the bridge by August 2026 at an estimated cost of $368 million.
“I understand that this has been a challenging time for those who rely on the Washington Bridge, especially in the early days before we were able to restore six lanes of traffic,” McKee said. “We owe it to you to deliver a bridge that is safe and will ultimately make your lives easier.” 
Tasked with constructing the new bridge is Walsh Construction Company. The Chicago-based firm worked on the Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge on Interstate 95 over the Quinnipiac River in New Haven, Connecticut, along with the Interstate 90 Westbound Innerbelt Bridge in Cleveland, Ohio.
For this project, the firm will draw from its design of the Chain of Rocks Bridge in St. Louis, Walsh Program Manager Charles Parish told reporters.
“It’s not often that you get to build the same project twice, or the same bridge twice,” Parish said. “But our ability to do that on the new Washington Bridge gave us the confidence to commit to both the price and schedule that we’re sure we can meet.”
The state’s plan calls for five lanes of travel over the new bridge, along with an onramp from Gano Street in Providence and a new offramp to Waterfront Drive in East Providence. The original bridge had four lanes.
Construction is scheduled to begin next month, which overlaps with the ongoing demolition of the existing bridge. Demolition contractor Aetna Bridge Company is expected to complete its work by the end of 2025.
During that time, Walsh will secure permitting, workers, and pre-fabricate material to rebuild the bridge, Parish said.

Walsh will be paid at least $339 million to build the new bridge, with incentives and contingencies that could bring the total cost up to $427 million. The deal also has built-in daily penalties of $25,000 for exceeding the project deadline. With demolition and emergency repairs, the entire project adds up to $570 million, which is “well within what we budget,” McKee said. 
McKee’s administration has identified more than $713 million in financing available for the project over the last year. That includes $35 million in remaining pandemic relief aid, $107.6 million from the state’s capital plan fund, and up to $334.6 million in Grant Anticipation Revenue Vehicles bonds, which allow the state to borrow against future allocations of federal transportation money.
The state was also awarded nearly a pair of federal infrastructure grants worth roughly $221 million. The grants were temporarily frozen under President Donald Trump’s initial flurry of executive orders, but released to Rhode Island in late March. 
However, Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha, in a lawsuit filed with 19 other states in May, warned that funding could still be at risk due to a federal directive tying infrastructure grants to compliance with the Trump administration’s diversity and immigration policies.
McKee said he does not believe federal funds will be taken away from the project.
“We have the sign off from [Transportation] Secretary (Sean) Duffy,” the governor said Friday.
Also unclear: how the new price tag will impact the state’s budget. House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi said in a statement that legislative leaders will review the governor’s announcement as they shape a final fiscal 2026 budget.
“As the bridge project moves forward, the House of Representatives will continue its work ensuring the administration is accountable,” Shekarchi said.
Walsh was one of two finalists vying to rebuild the bridge after the state issued its latest bidding window last December.  The other proposal came from a joint venture by American Bridge and MLJ, firms based respectively in Pennsylvania and New York.
Rhode Island Director of Transportation Peter Alviti Jr. said both companies were qualified and made similar technical proposals. Walsh’s proposal projected around $340 million in hard construction costs, while American Construction and MLJ’s bid estimated nearly $387 million. 
Because it did not win the state’s tentative contract, the losing bidder will receive a $1.75 million consolation prize for participating, as set out in the state’s solicitation. It took two rounds of requests or proposals to yield any firm bids, a sore spot that McKee’s critics continue to seize on, including his potential 2026 Democratic gubernatorial rival, Helena Buonanno Foulkes.
“Governor McKee’s catastrophic failure to manage the Washington Bridge has impacted countless Rhode Island families and businesses, forcing them to endure longer commutes, lost wages, and economic hardship,” Foulkes said in a statement Friday.
But McKee said he has no regrets.
“As far as I’m concerned we’re in a good spot,” he said. “The people in the state of Rhode Island know that the funding is there, the time schedule is there, and we have a quality bridge-builder to actually execute the project.”

(Photo by Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)A federal appeals court on Thursday upheld lower court decisions barring counties from imposing safety standards on a pipeline subject to federal safety standards.
The cases involved Summit Carbon Solutions, the company proposing to build a carbon sequestration pipeline through the state, and county supervisors from both Story and Shelby Counties in Iowa.
Summit sued the counties in 2022 for enacting ordinances that required county-specific setback requirements and other regulations the company argued were preempted by federal pipeline safety laws.
A federal judge ruled in favor of Summit in Dec. 2023 and issued permanent injunctions, stopping the counties from enforcing the regulations, which would have impacted the carbon sequestration pipeline and other pipelines.

The county supervisors appealed the decision and presented oral arguments in November 2024 to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. The counties argued that local land use and zoning regulations are not “preempted standards” under the Pipeline Safety Act.
Writing for the appeals court, U.S. Circuit Judge Duane Benton wrote that the county ordinances “focus” on safety and “repeatedly” mention safety risks associated with the pipeline, which “undermines” the Pipeline Safety Act’s goal of preempting state regulations on safety.
“This holding does not prohibit local governments from considering safety, nor prevent them from enacting all zoning ordinances, as the counties suggest,” Benton said in the opinion. “This court emphasizes the distinction between safety standards — which the PSA preempts — and safety considerations — which the PSA does not preempt.”
The county ordinances also included emergency response requirements and abandonment provisions which the court ruled were also preempted by federal regulations.
Circuit Judge Jane Kelly, however, dissented on those elements and wrote she does not believe that PSA preempts setback and abandonment provisions. Kelly said that while the counties’ setback requirements are “animated in part by safety considerations” they do not have the “direct and substantial” effect on safety that is reserved for federal regulation.
Kelly also wrote that per her understanding, the Pipeline Safety Act “does not cover pipelines that have been abandoned” and therefore the Shelby County abandonment provision is not “expressly preempted.”
The court affirmed the lower court’s decision in both cases, but ordered the federal court for the Southern District of Iowa to reconsider an additional ordinance that’s at issue in the Story County case.
Sabrina Zenor, on behalf of Summit Carbon Solutions, said the ruling “confirms” pipeline safety regulation set by the federal government and the Iowa Utilities Commission’s role in route and permit decisions.
“This supports a consistent, lawful permitting process for critical infrastructure projects like ours,” Zenor said in a statement.
A press release from Bold Alliance, a group representing landowners opposed to the pipeline project, called the order an “anti-local government ruling” and said the parties involved in the case are examining their “legal and legislative options” in response to the decision.
“The landowners, impacted community members, county and state elected officials who worked for months or years to develop ordinances and state regulations are witnessing their hard-won efforts to enact common sense protections for their communities stripped away by judicial fiat,” the statement read.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Salt Lake City officials warned this week that water use is up this time of year compared to the past several years, and they’re urging residents to be mindful of their consumption amid heat and drought. 
As Utah has seen an unusually warm spring this year — with temperatures in the Salt Lake valley reaching the 90s some days — the Salt Lake City Department of Public Utilities issued a news release Thursday warning that water use is up both overall and outdoors. 
The department reported water demand in recent weeks has been “trending upward compared to the average water demand over the last three years during the same time period.”
Great Salt Lake is again on the decline, and summer likely won’t help it

“We must protect our natural resources and support efforts for the Great Salt Lake,” Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall urged in a prepared statement. 
Laura Briefer, director of the Salt Lake City Department of Public Utilities, said as of Thursday, total water use had increased by 5% in the department’s service areas, with outdoor water use up 10%. 
“Though snowpack in our area was average this year and our reservoirs are full right now, overall runoff is lower than expected, and much of the state is projecting drought conditions,” Briefer said. “It is important that our community members continue to focus on water conservation given these factors and the potential for drought conditions to worsen.”
In addition to providing water to Utah’s capital of Salt Lake City — which is home to more than 217,000 people —  the Salt Lake City Department of Public Utilities also services portions of suburban cities of Millcreek, Holladay, Cottonwood Heights, Murray, Midvale and South Salt Lake. 
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, 95.5% of Utah was experiencing abnormally dry conditions as of Thursday, with 76.2% in moderate drought and 44.6% in severe drought. About 3.2% — an area concentrated in Washington County in the southwestern corner of the state — was in extreme drought. 
Utah creeps deeper into drought as long-term forecasts point to a hot summer

This time last year, only 23.9% of the state was classified as abnormally dry, according to the drought monitor. 
Plus, hotter than usual temperatures are expected to persist through the summer. According to the three month seasonal outlook from the National Weather Service, Utah is forecasted to have above average temperatures through August. As for rainfall, the service says it’s unclear whether there will be above or below average precipitation this summer. According to its models, there’s an equal chance of both in the majority of the state. 
Salt Lake City officials urged both homeowners and businesses to conserve water. They noted that the city offers a variety of programs meant to reduce water use indoors and outdoors, including landscaping rebates, low-water grass seed, irrigation controllers and water-wise toilets. 
Here are some of the water conservation programs and resources Salt Lake City officials highlighted: 

Salt Lake City’s Turf Trade site, where customers can order low-water grass seeds.
Utah State University’s Water Check program, which provides customized pressurized sprinkler schedules for select areas. 
Salt Lake City’s Rain Barrel program, which sells rain barrels to Salt Lake City Public Utilities customers.
Utah Water Savers’ Slow the Flow incentives programs for water-smart landscaping, toilet replacement, and smart sprinkler controller installation.

Thalia Mara Hall was closed last August due to mold remediation, to replace the heating and cooling systems and perform updates to the fire system. The building had previously failed an inspection in late January.
State Fire Marshal and Insurance Commissioner Mike Chaney issued the following statement on June 6: 
“The State Fire Marshals Office (SFMO) conducted a follow-up inspection of Thalia Mara Hall on Tuesday, June 3, 2025, and determined that the building met standards to reopen. A Certificate of Occupancy will be issued to the City of Jackson (COJ). A hydrostatic test was conducted on Monday, June 2, 2025, to determine the integrity of pipes and valves in the building. The test was successful. The building elevators and escalators remain out of service pending repair and inspection. The COJ has scheduled a new fire curtain to be installed in July.
A condition of the reopening is that a third-party fire watch must be in place until the fire curtain is installed and passes inspection. A fire watch involves having someone monitor the building during events for fire hazards and to alert occupants and emergency services if a fire breaks out.
My office remains committed to working with Jackson officials to protect the health and safety of the public and important cultural structures like Thalia Mara Hall.”
Thalia Mara Hall’s closure brought with it a slew of scheduling issues for performing arts groups such as Ballet Mississippi and Mississippi Symphony Orchestra, who had to move performances to Madison Central High School Auditorium and Jackson Academy Performing Arts Center.
The city has spent nearly $3 million in repairs, with the bulk of the funding going to Guarantee Restoration Services, which was in charge of mold remediation, encapsulation and HVAC cleaning.

State workers increase pressure in union negotiations 
State employees picketing outside negotiations between Minnesota budget officials and their union on Wednesday said they were absolutely willing to strike over Gov. Tim Walz’s part-time return-to-office order that took effect this week.
“One-hundred percent I would. We can’t just roll over here,” said Erin Malone, an auditor for the Department of Revenue, at a demonstration in St. Paul with more than 50 workers and supporters on Wednesday.
The two unions representing nearly 40,000 state workers — the Minnesota Association of Professional Employees and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees — are also fuming over the state’s health care proposals they estimate will raise many workers’ costs by thousands of dollars a year. The administration says rising health care costs leave them no choice.
The soonest state employees could strike is in late summer, once contracts expire on June 30, they complete 45 days of mediation and then provide 10 days notice. The union explained those details in a FAQ for their members posted late last month in another sign that negotiations are headed toward a volatile impasse.
State employees haven’t gone on strike since walking off the job for two weeks 2001, but MAPE President Megan Dayton says she’s never seen her members so fired up by Walz’s unilateral decision to force workers back to the office. Hundreds of workers showed up to multiple demonstrations organized by the union over two days this week.
Under Walz’s order, state employees must work in the office at least 50% of the time unless they live more than 50 miles away or receive an exemption. Walz argues the policy will improve collaboration, mentorship and workplace culture, with the added benefit of bringing bodies and dollars back to a forsaken downtown St. Paul.
The policy officially began June 1, but some agencies have delayed implementation as they make space for employees to return. After the COVID-19 shifted office jobs to workers’ homes, state agencies began downsizing their office footprint in anticipation of permanent remote work. The Department of Revenue, for example, reduced its leased office space by 35% since 2021, saving $2.45 million annually.
Many workers argue they’re more productive at home and complain that the order adds to their costs in parking and gas. Some also question the motive, suspecting Walz could be distancing himself from public unions ahead of another run for governor — or trying to nudge workers off the payroll as the state stares down fiscal uncertainty.
The state has also proposed changing contract language to make it easier to lay off workers in the event of “fiscal exigencies” such as federal funding cuts, as well as epidemics, natural disasters and national security emergencies.
“I think it’s political posturing,” said Christine Retkwa, a data analyst at the Department of Human Services. “It can’t be collaboration if we’ve been more productive… It’s not to save costs.”
Walz’s relationship with public sector unions, which have historically been an important political ally, have soured rapidly since he announced the policy in March without consulting the unions. The union compared Walz to Elon Musk, and Walz did not invite anyone from the union to attend his State of the State Address.
Job Corps students face homelessness
Tens of thousands of students at Job Corps centers across the country are facing homelessness after the Trump administration’s Labor Department announced it will eliminate the vocational training program for low-income teenagers and young adults.
“You don’t hit the ground running, you just hit the ground period. Straight homeless – nothing. Just straight into the ground,” Tyrone Bills, one of more than 150 students at the Hubert H. Humphrey Job Corps Center in St. Paul, told Fox 9.
Last Friday, the Labor Department gave students a week’s notice to move out and abandon their free training to fill jobs in manufacturing, construction, law enforcement, health care and other high-growth industries.
The department later extended the deadline, and then a federal judge blocked the Trump administration from killing the program. By then, many students had already moved out.
Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer, once an advocate for Job Corps, justified eliminating the $1.7 billion program because of “serious incidents” as well as high costs and low student graduation rates.
Just 38% of students graduate, with an average cost of more than $80,000 a year, according to the agency. The National Job Corps Association disputed these figures, saying graduation rates before COVID-19 have historically been above 60% while the cost is less than $50,000 per enrollee.
Minnesota surpasses 3 million jobs in 2024
Minnesota continued to have one of the country’s strongest labor markets in 2024, adding 40,000 non-farm jobs to push the state above 3 million jobs for the first time, according to the second annual State of Working Minnesota report from the labor-backed think tank North Star Policy Action.
In the Midwest, Minnesota has the highest median wages, the highest share of workers in unions and the highest rate of health insurance coverage. The state also has the lowest unemployment rate for Black residents in the region and the lowest fatal injury rate on the job.
Wage inequality also declined, while union membership increased by nearly 7% (although this can fluctuate from year to year due to imprecise data, and the general trend has been down for unions.) Support for unions is near historic highs, and that’s helped nearly triple the number of union elections over the past five years, according to the report.
It wasn’t all good news: unemployment ticked up while the median wage moved down from $26.43 to $25.52 in an unusual break from a nearly exclusive upward trend.
There is also cause for concern, according to report author Aaron Rosenthal, given federal Republicans’ drive to reduce spending on health insurance for the working poor to offset some of the costs of tax cuts largely benefitting the wealthy.

Working families are increasingly reliant on health insurance through Medical Assistance, the state’s version of Medicaid. The number of people insured through Medical Assistance in families with at least one full-time worker increased 165% over the past 15 years.
In rural areas, roughly 18% of adults and 37% of children are insured through Medical Assistance, compared to 15% of adults and 30% of children in the Twin Cities metro area.
National jobs data released on Friday showed hiring has slowed as Trump’s trade war and federal cuts have put employers on edge, with nearly all of the 139,000 job gains for the month being concentrated in health care and hospitality. The federal government lost 22,000 jobs.
Doctors and nurses picket across the state
In a first for Minnesota, newly unionized doctors, physician assistants and nurse practitioners picketed outside several Allina clinics on Tuesday as negotiations stalled over a first labor contract. (It was an informational picket and not a strike.)
Frustrated with what they describe as factory-style health care, the clinicians voted by a wide margin to unionize with Doctors Council SEIU in October 2023, forming the nation’s largest private-sector doctors union with more than 600 members across 60 Allina clinics in Minnesota and Wisconsin.
But since then, union leaders say they’ve made little progress toward finalizing a first labor contract covering wages, benefits and working conditions — despite meeting with hospital leaders nearly 40 times.
“We’re not seeing Allina come to the table with meaningful proposals,” said Dr. Chris Antolak, a family physician, outside Allina’s clinic in Coon Rapids.
Unionized nurses also took to the picket lines outside 11 hospitals in the Twin Cities and two in Duluth in their push for greater staffing levels to protect themselves from workplace violence and improve patient care. The Minnesota Nurses Association is negotiating contracts covering roughly 15,000 nurses at seven of the state’s largest health systems.
Contracts expired on May 31 at St. Luke’s and Essentia in Duluth  and will expire at the end of this month at Twin Cities hospitals run by Allina, Children’s, M Health Fairview, HealthPartners and North Memorial.

Midjourney/AI-generated art A bipartisan group of state lawmakers, including six from Georgia, is calling on Congress to cut a provision out of the massive federal spending bill that freezes state regulations on artificial intelligence for 10 years.
“As state lawmakers and policymakers, we regularly hear from constituents about the rise of online harms and the impacts of AI on our communities,” the lawmakers wrote. “In an increasingly fraught digital environment, young people are facing new threats online, seniors are targeted by the emergence of AI-generated scams, and workers and creators face new challenges in an AI-integrated economy. Over the next decade, AI will raise some of the most important public policy questions of our time, and it is critical that state policymakers maintain the ability to respond.”
The Georgia signers were Sen. John Albers of Roswell and Reps. Todd Jones of South Forsyth and Gary Richardson of Evans, who are all Republicans, as well as Democratic Reps. Scott Holcomb and Tanya Miller of Atlanta and Sam Park of Lawrenceville.
In all, 261 legislators from all 50 states signed the letter.
Georgia lawmakers from both chambers met over the summer last year to discuss potential AI regulations. Albers, who chairs the Senate AI study committee, often stressed that he did not wish to overregulate, saying that he saw lawmakers’ duty as balancing protections for Georgians with creating a friendly environment for businesses.
During this year’s legislative session, no major AI bills passed into law, including broadly popular provisions like increasing penalties for using AI to create child pornography or deceptive “deep fake” campaign advertisements.
An Albers bill intended to create a new state advisory board on artificial intelligence and to require local governments to report on their use of the technology died in the Senate Economic Development and Tourism Committee on the advice of Suwanee GOP Congressman Rich McCormick.
Then-committee chair Brandon Beach, who now serves as U.S. Treasurer, said at the time that McCormick told him not to take any action on AI because Congress would take care of it.
Senators created a new committee this year to examine artificial intelligence and digital currency, but members have not yet been appointed and no hearing dates have been set.
The GOP’s megabill, which has become the cornerstone of President Donald Trump’s domestic agenda, passed the House by a single vote and is now in the hands of the Senate.
Getting the legislation through the House was a challenge the first time, with factions within the Republican Party at odds over the size of cuts to federal programs and the expected increase in the deficit.
The new focus of the AI provision could prove to be another sticking point. Members of the House including Rome Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene have indicated they were not aware of the regulation ban when they voted for the bill and will not support it when it comes back to the House unless the rule is removed.
“I voted for President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill because it delivers his MAGA campaign promises and he endorses the bill and wants Congress to pass it in order to fund his MAGA agenda,” Greene said on social media. “Do I love the price tag? NO. But I want OUR policies funded. I campaigned across the country for YEARS with Trump, more than any member of Congress, and the man NEVER said he would destroy state rights for 10 years to let AI tech companies run rampant!!! TAKE IT OUT OR I’M VOTING NO WHEN IT COMES BACK TO THE HOUSE!!!!!”

Uttering and publishing a false or altered public record, also punishable by up to 14 years in prison;
Substantial endangerment to the public, punishable by up to five years in prison;
Discharge of an injurious substance to waters of the state, punishable by up to two years in prison.

“Serious violations by businesses that endanger the health and well-being of Michigan residents and our environment cannot be tolerated,” Nessel said in a statement. “I am grateful to the talented prosecutors in my office, the dedicated experts from the Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy, Michigan State Police, the Genesee County Sheriff’s Office, the Oakland County Sheriff’s Office, and detectives of EGLE and [the Department of Natural Resource’s] Environmental Investigation Section, who all played a significant role in advancing this case through the judicial process.” 
Minhas also faces several misdemeanor charges including nine violations of the state’s liquid industrial waste law and 11 other offenses for violating hazardous waste statutes.
A pretrial date has not been set, according to the Attorney General’s office.

The base reads, “Henry McMaster, 117th Governor of South Carolina.”
This is the first time staff of the Department of Parks, Recreation and Tourism, which runs the gift shop, are aware of a novelty item featuring the likeness of a governor being sold at the Statehouse, said agency spokeswoman Sam Queen.
And they’re exclusive to that store.
The idea for the bobblehead came from a conversation between the agency’s director, Duane Parrish, and the governor’s chief of staff, Trey Walker. The two got to talking about how people collect coins, Beanie Babies and baseball cards, and Walker wondered out loud whether a bobblehead of the governor might turn into a collectible of its own, he said.

“It seemed like a neat, novel thing they didn’t have in the gift shop,” Walker said.
Parrish agreed to the idea, thinking the bobblehead “would be a unique item to offer,” Queen said.
The figurine officially hit shelves May 20, about two weeks after the 2025 legislative session officially ended. As of Thursday, the gift shop had sold 28 of the 150 bobbleheads it ordered, despite less foot traffic from lobbyists and legislators, Queen said.
“It’s been a popular item in the short time it’s been available,” she said.
The design was approved by the governor’s office. When McMaster first saw the finished product, he liked it so much he brought one back to the Governor’s Mansion and showed it off during a gathering that night, Walker said.
On Thursday, McMaster told reporters he found the take on himself “interesting,” adding he might buy a couple for his grandchildren.
His only concern is the $50 price tag, which the Republican governor said seems a bit steep.
“Fifty dollars for those things — that was a surprise to me,” McMaster said.
None of the money goes to him or his office.
The price is a matter of limited supply, Queen said.
About 12% of the bobblehead’s cost will support the gift store’s operations. The novelty and scarcity of it will hopefully drive more people into the store to shop, she added.
All proceeds from Statehouse gift shop sales support operations for the parks department. More than 40% of the agency’s budget for the fiscal year that starts July 1 comes from self-generated revenue, including store sales, park entry fees and camping fees.
“It brings a smile and brings in a little bit of money for the state, so that’s a good thing,” Walker said.
McMaster is the longest-serving elected governor in South Carolina’s history. The former lieutenant governor ascended to the job in January 2017, when Nikki Haley became President Donald Trump’s first United Nations ambassador. That gave McMaster two years in office before his first inauguration.

Guillermo Smith speaking at a press conference in the Capitol on March. 19, 2025 (Photo credit: Mitch Perry / Florida Phoenix)Florida Democrats from countries in President Donald Trump’s travel ban list denounced the policy that they say punishes families and hurts the economy during a virtual press conference Friday morning.
Orlando Democrat Anna Eskamani, who’s Iranian-American, said she worries she won’t be able to see her aging grandmother before she passes.
“It is a very difficult reality for many of us, where we are navigating conflict in these homelands that are dictorial in nature, that make it difficult already to survive, and for folks who are fleeing that to achieve the American dream, it is heartbreaking and unAmerican that they cannot do that,” Eskamani said.
Trump issued a proclamation late Wednesday barring the entry of people from a dozen countries, including Iran, and partially restricting entry of nationals from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela. Florida is home to the largest population of Cubans, Venezuelans, and Haitians in the country.
The travel ban proclamation, which cited national security concerns, goes into effect on Monday.
The Democrats, who are in the superminority at the state Legislature, said Congress needed to be held accountable, particularly Florida’s Republican delegation.
“At least within the Haitian community, ever since on the campaign trail, this administration has been targeting Haitians, and it’s turned its back on Cubans as well,” said North Miami Democratic Rep. Dottie Joseph, of Haiti.
Seminole Republican Rep. Berny Jacques, who is from Haiti, supports the Trump administration’s policy.
“It is essential for our nation’s sovereignty and security,” he wrote to Florida Phoenix.

These bills seek to unnecessarily ban trans girls from competing in high school sports. 
When I first was made aware of the bills, my teacher heart and coaching experience kicked into action, and I got to work reading and thinking. I asked myself, “Why are these bills being proposed?” “Who do these bills impact?” and “How?” Guided by data provided by Kids Count in Michigan, our analysis quickly revealed that these bills are both dangerous and unnecessary. 
The narrative that trans girls are boys is simply wrong and dehumanizing. The argument that trans girls don’t deserve to play sports is discriminatory and heartbreaking. All kids deserve the opportunity to participate in extracurricular activities alongside their peers, which has been proven to lead to better attendance in school, something Michigan schools are struggling with right now. 
As a high school coach for 15 years, I know firsthand the community and sense of safety athletics can provide. This is especially important for the transgender teens — representing fewer than 1% of teens in Michigan — who experience higher rates of anxiety and depression than their cisgender peers. More than half of transgender high school students have seriously contemplated attempting suicide. Surrounding them in a supportive system, such as a sports team, could be a lifeline for these students. 
Michigan House Republicans introduce bill to halt gender-affirming surgeries and care for minors

This legislation isn’t just harmful to trans girls; it’s harmful to all girls. We’ve seen anti-trans legislation result in girls being harassed simply for not outwardly looking “feminine enough.” Our female athletes already have to prove their worth of being competitive enough, assertive enough, strong enough, athletic enough. 
Michigan already has policies in place for trans athletes. The Michigan High School Athletic Association (MHSAA) reports receiving just two requests per year from transgender athletes wanting to play sports. This legislation unnecessarily targets trans youth while at the same time impacting virtually zero percent of the high school athletic population. 
The bills have passed out of the House and are now headed to the Senate.
There is no doubt about it: this legislation is anti-trans, anti-girl, anti-youth. Michigan kids deserve better.

,DC,2025-06-06 16:54:28+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,U.S. Senate GOP will try to drag Trump’s mega-bill across the finish line,"Jennifer Shutt, Ariana Figueroa, Shauneen Miranda",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-gop-will-try-drag-trumps-mega-bill-across-finish-line,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Senate Republican Leader John Thune will spend a crucial next few weeks working behind the scenes with other top GOP senators to reshape the the party’s “big beautiful bill” — a balancing test accompanied in recent days by incendiary exchanges between President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk over whether the current proposals are so bad that Congress should just go back to the drawing board.South Dakota’s Thune will need to gain support from deficit hawks, who want to see the mega-bill cut at least $2 trillion in spending, and moderates, who are closely monitoring how less federal funding for safety net programs like Medicaid and food assistance could harm their constituents and home-state institutions like rural hospitals.Interviews by States Newsroom with Republican senators in early June showed many major elements of the package, which are far from decided, could change, including provisions that would put states on the hook for unanticipated costs. Arkansas Sen. John Boozman, for example, indicated the Senate may rewrite a proposal in the House-passed bill that would shift some of the cost of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which provides food aid to low-income people, to state governments.“We can do whatever we want to do,” the Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee chairman said when asked by States Newsroom about amending that policy.The final deal — intended to extend the 2017 tax cuts — cannot lose more than three GOP senators and still make it back across the Capitol to the House for final approval, since all Democrats are expected to oppose the bill. Thune only needs a majority vote in the Senate for the special process being used by Republicans.Internal debates about just how to rework the Trump-backed tax and spending cuts measure began in the first week of June during meetings on Capitol Hill and at the White House, as GOP senators began critiquing the House-passed package line-by-line to ensure it complies with their strict rules for the complex reconciliation process and their policy goals.Republicans said during interviews that several provisions in the House version likely won’t comply with the chamber’s Byrd rule, which could force lawmakers to toss out some provisions.Complicating all of it was the very public back-and-forth between not just Trump but GOP leaders and former White House adviser Musk over the bill, which Musk on social media labeled “a disgusting abomination” and a “big, ugly spending bill” for its effect on the deficit and debt limit. “KILL the BILL,” Musk said on X, the platform he owns. Senate leaders so far have dismissed Musk’s criticisms.Fragile House coalitionThe talks, and whatever the legislation looks like after a marathon amendment voting session expected in late June, have already raised deep concerns among House GOP lawmakers, who will have to vote on the bill again in order to send it to Trump.The extremely narrow majorities mean House Republican leaders cannot lose more than four of their own members if all the lawmakers in that chamber vote on the party-line bill.Any changes the Senate makes could unbalance the fragile coalition of votes Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., cobbled together last month for a 215-214 vote. But GOP senators are adamant they will amend the legislation.Complicating matters is a new report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office that shows the proposed changes to tax law, Medicaid, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and higher education aid wouldn’t actually help to reduce deficits during the next decade but raise them by more than $2.4 trillion.The numbers are the exact opposite for what Republicans hoped their sweeping tax and spending cuts package would accomplish.Scrutiny beginsThe first stop for the House-passed reconciliation package in the Senate appears to be the parliamentarian’s office, where staff have begun evaluating whether each provision in the current version of the bill complies with the upper chamber’s strict rules.Boozman said staff on his panel have already begun meeting with the parliamentarian to go over the House provisions within its jurisdiction.He expects that section of the package will have to change to comply with the strict rules that govern the reconciliation process in the Senate and to better fit that chamber’s policy goals.“We can't really decide exactly what we want to use in the House version until we know what's eligible,” Boozman said. “We've got some other ideas too that we asked them about. But we need to know, of the ideas that we have, what would be viable options as far as being Byrd eligible.”The Byrd rule, which is actually a law, requires reconciliation bills to address federal revenue, spending, or the debt limit. This generally bars lawmakers from using the special budget process to change policies that don’t have a significant impact on those three areas.Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville, who is campaigning to become his home state’s next governor, said pushing some of the cost of the nutrition program to states may be problematic.“We're trying to send more costs to the states. Most states can't afford that, so we want to take care of people, but we need people to go back to work,” Tuberville said. “It's not a forever entitlement. It's for part-time, you know, take care of yourself until you get a job, go back to work and let people that need it really, really get it.”Rural hospitals on edgeSenate GOP leaders will have to navigate how best to reduce federal spending on Medicaid, the state-federal health program for lower-income people and some with disabilities, that is relied on by tens of millions of Americans, many of whom are loyal Republican voters.The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects that 7.8 million people would lose access to Medicaid during the next decade if the House’s policy changes are implemented as written.There are also concerns among GOP lawmakers about how losing the revenue that comes with treating Medicaid patients would impact rural health care access and hospitals.Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley said under no circumstances would he vote for a bill that cuts benefits to Medicaid recipients and is worried about how provisions in the House package would affect rural hospitals.“They're very concerned about it, rightly so,” Hawley said, referring to conversations he’s had with health care systems in his home state.“This is something that we need to work on. I don't know why we would penalize rural hospitals,” he added. “If you want to reduce health care spending, then cap the price of prescription drugs. I mean, that's the way to do it. If you want to get major savings in the health care sector, don't close rural hospitals, don't take away benefits from working people. Cap the costs, cap the price that (the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) is going to pay for prescription drugs.”West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito said she’s not yet come to a decision about whether to keep, amend, or completely scrap some of the House changes to Medicaid.“I talked to a lot of our hospitals when I was home to see what the impacts would be, because we have a very high Medicaid population,” Capito said. “I want to see it work and be preserved, but I want it to be there for future generations. And it's just getting way out of control on the spend side. So right now, we're looking at everything.”Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy — chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee — said he doesn’t expect all of the health care provisions in the House bill make it through the “Byrd bath” with the parliamentarian. But he declined to go into detail.“Some of it is more regulatory, that's all I can say,” Cassidy said.West Virginia’s Sen. Jim Justice said he is in favor of requiring some Medicaid enrollees to work, participate in community service, or attend an educational program at least 80 hours a month to stay on the program, a sentiment shared by many of his GOP colleagues.“I'm good with every bit of that,” he said. But Justice expects the Senate will make its own changes to the package and that it will be “proud of their own pond.”“Any frog that’s not proud of your own pond’s not much of a frog,” Justice said.He did not go into detail on what those changes would entail.SALT shakersThe state and local tax deduction, or SALT, represents another tightrope  for Thune, who is no fan of the changes made in the House. But he has said repeatedly this week he understands altering that language too much could mean a Senate-amended version of the bill never makes it back through the House to actually become law.Thune said outside the White House following a June 4 meeting with Trump and others that there will very likely be changes to SALT.“There isn’t a single Republican senator who cares much about the SALT issue,” Thune said. “It’s just not an issue that plays.” States that are most affected generally don’t elect Republicans to the Senate.The House tax-writing panel originally proposed raising the SALT cap from $10,000 to $30,000, but Johnson had to raise that to $40,000 in order to secure votes from House Republicans who represent higher tax states like California, New Jersey and New York. The revised cap would benefit more high-income taxpayers in their states.“In 2017, that was one of the best reforms we had in the bill,” Thune said. “But we understand it’s about 51 and 218. So we will work with our House counterparts and with the White House to try to get that issue in a place where we can deliver the votes and get the bill across the finish line.”Republicans hold 53 seats in the Senate, but can rely on Vice President J.D. Vance to break a tied vote if necessary.At least 218 House lawmakers must vote to pass bills when all 435 seats are filled. But with three vacancies at the moment, legislation can move through that chamber with 216 votes. The GOP has 220 seats at the moment, meaning Johnson can afford four defections on party-line bills.North Dakota Sen. John Hoeven told reporters this week that he’d like to see GOP senators rework the SALT section of the bill, even if that causes challenges for Speaker Johnson’s ability to pass a final version.“Let's talk about SALT, for example. The House has a very large SALT number. The Senate is probably going to take a look at that,” Hoeven said. “There'll be a lot of areas we can look at. There'll be other things we're going to look at. We'd like to get to $2 trillion in savings.”Ohio Sen. Bernie Moreno joined in putting his House colleagues on notice that they likely won’t get the agreement they struck with the speaker in the final version of the bill.“I think we're going to make common-sense changes. For example, the SALT cap, by the way, something that definitely helps very wealthy people in blue states,” Moreno said. “I think that cap, the 400% increase, is too much, so we're going to work on tweaking that.”Hawley, of Missouri, speaking more generally about the tax provisions, said he would like the Senate to make sure middle-class Americans benefit from the tax changes, just as much as companies.“I want to be clear, I'm in favor of additional tax relief for working people. So my view is this corporate tax rate, which they lowered in 2017, they made that permanent back then. I know some workers that would like permanent tax relief,” Hawley said. “So I think it's imperative that we do some addition to tax relief for workers. So I think that's important.”A new $4 trillion debt limitDeficit hawks in the Senate have also voiced objections to raising the nation’s debt limit by $4 trillion, arguing that GOP leaders haven’t done enough to assuage their concerns about the nation’s fiscal trajectory.Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul argued that the debt limit increase is more about next year’s midterm elections than good governance.“​​This is really about avoiding having to talk about the debt during election times because people like to go home and talk to the Rotary or the Lions Club and tell them how they're fiscally conservative and they're against debt,” Paul said. “It's embarrassing to them to have to vote to keep raising the debt. But they're unwilling to have the courage to actually look at all spending.”Paul suggested that House Republicans created problems by inflating some of the spending levels in their package, including to continue construction of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Paul is chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.“The $46.5 billion for the wall is eight times higher than the current cost of the wall. If you're going to do 1,000 miles, you can actually do it for $6.5 billion. They want $46.5 billion,” Paul said. “We can't be fiscally conservative until it comes to the border, and then we're no longer fiscally conservative.”The border wall has been a constant focus for Trump, who made it a central part of his 2016 presidential campaign, when he said repeatedly that the United States would build it and Mexico would pay for it.South Carolina’s Lindsey Graham, chairman of the Budget Committee, hinted during a brief interview that Congress can only cut so much spending without going near programs like Social Security, which accounted for $1.5 trillion in expenditures last year, or Medicare, which spent $865 billion. Both are normally considered untouchable.“I think we're going to make some changes to try to find more spending reductions. I think that's a fair criticism of the bill, but you can't do Social Security by law,” Graham said, referring to one of the many rules that govern the reconciliation process. “Nobody's proposed anything in the Medicare area.”Graham added that “trying to make the bill more fiscally responsible is a good thing, but we need to pass it.”",,,,2025-06-06 13:07:58.578141

David Parker will not run in November special election,Taylor Vance,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/06/06/desoto-sen-david-parker-will-not-run-in-november-special-election/,"Parker, one of Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann's top Senate leaders, was facing a special election due to legislative redistricting that changed his district to a slightly majority-Black one.","State Sen. David Parker, a Republican from Olive Branch, announced on Thursday that he will not run in an upcoming special election, creating an open Senate seat in DeSoto County and making him the second incumbent to forgo the special election. 
Parker, who has served 13 years in the Legislature, wrote on social media that the recent death of his childhood friend and the founding surgeon in Parker’s eye-care practice weighed heavily on his decision to leave public office. 
“Their loss has served as a powerful reminder of how precious our time is, and it reaffirmed my desire to devote more intentional time to my family and to the next chapter of life,” Parker said. 
Even though Parker was elected to a new four-year term in 2023, a federal three-judge panel ruled last year that the state’s current legislative maps didn’t comply with federal voting laws and diluted Black voting power.  
The federal panel then approved a new state legislative map that redrew five House districts and nine Senate districts, one of which was Parker’s. 
Parker did not cite this as a reason for his retirement, but state officials also changed his district to a slightly majority-Black district. If the DeSoto County lawmaker drew an opponent, he likely would have spent this year facing a competitive election cycle.
Sen. John Polk, a Republican from Hattiesburg, also announced earlier this year that he will not run in the special election because of health reasons. The redistricting plan placed Polk in the same Senate district as state Sen. Chris Johnson, a fellow Hattiesburg Republican. 
The two departures come at a time when Republican Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann, the Senate’s presiding officer, has clashed politically with House Speaker Jason White and, at times, with Gov. Tate Reeves. The Republicans have battled over Medicaid expansion, the state’s public pension system, school choice legislation and crafting a state budget.  
Polk and Parker were two of Hosemann’s most loyal lieutenants in the 52-member chamber, so the two departures could create more political challenges for the lieutenant governor as he faces pressure from his fellow state leaders.
The last day candidates can qualify for the redistricting special elections is Monday, June 9. Party primaries will take place on August 5 and the general election is on November 4. 
Three more special elections in the Legislature will also take place soon, though they will happen on a different timeline, set by the governor, than the 14 special elections to account for redistricting: 

Sen. John Horhn, a Democrat from Jackson, will soon resign after he was elected the new mayor of Jackson 
Rep. Orlando Paden, a Democrat from Clarksdale, will soon resign because he was elected as the new mayor of Clarksdale.

Attorney General Kris Kobach says a Kansas governor is obligated to negotiate in good faith with on a tribal compact. In this image, Kelly speaks at 2024 dedication of a replica of the Ad Astra statue of a Native American pointing an arrow at the North Star. (Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Attorney General Kris Kobach said Gov. Laura Kelly was obligated under federal law to negotiate in good faith with the Wyandotte Nation on a compact agreement to allow operation of casino gambling, including sports betting, on tribal land.
Negotiations with the Wyandotte Nation wouldn’t violate state law applicable to operation of four nontribal casinos in Kansas nor would negotiations be inconsistent with compacts with four tribes in the casino business in Kansas, the attorney general said.
On Friday, Wyandotte Nation Chief Billy Friend said he appreciated the attorney general’s opinion affirming the tribe’s contention that state and federal statute wouldn’t interfere with the tribe seeking a gaming compact in Kansas.
“We were pleased with the opinion,” he said. “We’re looking forward to sitting down and negotiating in good faith and coming up with a fair compact.”
Kobach’s nonbinding legal opinion said the federal Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, or IGRA, governed gaming on tribal land held by the Prairie Band Potawatomi, Sac & Fox, Kickapoo and Iowa tribes in Kansas. IGRA would likewise preempt state law related to a Wyandotte Nation request for a compact applicable to its 7th Street Casino in Wyandotte County and Cross Winds Casino near Park City in Sedgwick County, the opinion said.
Under the Kansas Expanded Lottery Act, or KELA, the opinion said the state’s jurisdiction over gambling activities was confined to four casinos outside of tribal land in Mulvane, Pittsburg, Dodge City and Kansas City, Kansas. These Kansas Lottery facilities operated through management contracts with private companies. KELA does forbid Kansas from adding state-owned casino zones through 2032.
“Because KELA and the management contracts do not prohibit efforts that further tribal gaming under IGRA, they do not prohibit negotiating with the Wyandotte Nation over a compact,” Kobach said.
Kobach said sports wagering could be featured in a compact with the Wyandotte Nation because Kansas permitted that type of gaming at casinos across the state.
In 2022, the Legislature and Kelly granted the four state-owned casinos an opportunity to operate sports books. Since 2023, the Iowa, Sac & Fox and Prairie Band Potawatomie nations negotiated sports betting agreements with the state.
Friend, chief of the Wyandotte Nation headquartered in northeast Oklahoma, said the intent was to seek a compact with Kansas enabling the tribe to participate in sports gambling.
Justin Whitten, chief counsel to the governor, sought the attorney general’s insight into the intersection of IGRA and KELA. The request reflected government and industry concern about potential violation of state management contracts with nontribal casinos.
“A compact with the Wyandotte Nation would not fall under, and would not violate, KELA,” Kobach said. “And, because federal law trumps state law, to the extent there is any conflict between IGRA and Kansas Statutes Annotated 46-2305, IGRA prevails.”
Under the existing system of developing gaming compacts in Kansas, a tribe would begin by requesting negotiations with the governor. The negotiated compact documents would be submitted to the Legislature for consideration. If approved, the compact agreement would be forwarded for review to the U.S. Department of Interior.
Kobach said the U.S. Supreme Court weakened IGRA’s central mechanism for getting states to negotiate with tribes by holding IGRA didn’t abrogate state sovereign immunity.
“This means that if the state does not negotiate with the Wyandotte Nation, or if the Wyandotte Nation believes the state is not negotiating in good faith, the state can invoke its sovereign immunity against any resulting suit by the tribe,” Kobach said.
While a tribe might not successfully pursue a lawsuit against the state of Kansas, Kobach’s opinion said, the federal government could take legal action on behalf of a tribe to sidestep a sovereign immunity defense.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Kelly-with-Kansa-sculpture-2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-06 13:07:58.578141

Beachler recently filed a civil lawsuit against the woman, Stefanie Boone, who is associated with the group Moms for Liberty, which specifically advocates against school curricula involving LGBTQ+ content and themes.
The harassment Beachler experienced, and the back-and-forth legal battle that is now playing out as a result, was just one more instance of Michigan libraries and librarians facing attacks from right-wing groups dedicated to excising LGBTQ+ related materials from their shelves.
Earlier this week, Michigan Advance highlighted additional efforts in Hartland and in Lapeer to sequester, move or label materials conservative library board members have deemed inappropriate for children – and many with LGBTQ+ characters or content.
But for Beachler, the legal fight she’s facing in Lowell is personal.

Parents have several options to work with the district to ensure they have oversight over the books their children read, Beachler said. There are opportunities to challenge books in the library, a path to require permission to check out books, and other options to direct students away from consuming media their parents might disagree with.
But Boone’s actions have gone beyond that, as she has read excerpts from books out of context at school board meetings, Beachler said, and posted floods of untrue statements about her on Facebook saying she provides pornography to minors, all culminating in Beachler filing a civil lawsuit against Boone on May 13.
“It’s just really hard to talk about. That’s why I’ve actually been working from home a lot. … I mean being called a groomer, being called a pedophile, I was called a whore, a smut peddler,” Beachler said. “I’ve been an educator for 37 years and how can somebody call somebody that name that has invested their life in working with kids? It’s very hurtful and obviously untrue.”
Last June, Boone filed her own lawsuit against Beachler, as well as the school district and several school employees for what she says are violations of her parental rights to challenge indoctrination of students.
Boone is being represented by former Republican Michigan attorney general candidate and attorney Matt DePerno, who is currently facing felony charges for reported mishandling of voting equipment after the 2020 election.
“[The] defendants have continued to groom children by fostering relationships that include secrecy, undue influence, control, and pushing personal boundaries,” Boone said in her lawsuit against Beachler. “[The] defendants have attempted to and have desensitized children to DEI, SEL, sex, social justice issues, alternate sex and gender ideologies, and liberal political ideology, and through manipulative behavior by showing them pornography or discussing sexual topics with them, and have introduced the idea of sexual contact.”
Lapeer library board mulls age restrictions on materials despite shaky legal ground 

Boone did not return a request for comment at the time of this story’s publication.
The years of false statements and accusations published on Facebook posts and through public comments at school board meetings came to a fever pitch in February. Beachler said Boone interrupted a tour Beachler was leading a tour alongside two students of a large-scale renovation of a school library to ask where the mature section was. Beachler’s lawsuit said Boone filmed the interaction, posting the video with the caption “Which way to the PORN section please?”, which was reposted by individuals with large social media followings like former Republican gubernatorial candidate Garrett Soldano.
“I put up with it for five years. I sent a cease and desist order and asked her to stop. It’s only amplified. It’s only gotten worse, to the point where I was getting threats,” Beachler said. “Half of my hair fell out and I’ve broken several of my teeth from grinding my teeth and I couldn’t even work for quite a while because I just couldn’t come here without even crying.”
In the nearly four decades Beachler has worked in education, Beachler said never before has there been such disrespect and dishonesty when it comes to criticisms of educators. And as Michigan faces a teacher shortage in schools that are already struggling to catch kids up on learning losses from the COVID-19 pandemic, Beachler said misinformation campaigns about the books kids have access to at school take time away from the learning experience.
Anyone has the right to talk about how much they disapprove of a book, Beachler said, and Boone can post all she wants on Facebook about how she hates what’s in the school library. That’s her First Amendment right, Beachler noted. But that’s not what Boone’s rhetoric or lawsuit is about, she added: it’s about destroying trust in public schools at any cost.
Lowell is a tight-knit small town community, which Beachler said is filled with “very wonderful people” who lean conservatively, but in general don’t expect people to conform to their own beliefs. There have been, however, some members of the Lowell community that believed what Boone was selling them, especially grandparents, Beachler said.

Some of the books that were being brought to their attention, with passages read out of context, aren’t even in the school library, Beachler said. And when Boone posted her video in February, Beachler said there was a switch in the community who did not support the calls for violence against her.
Several members from the community stood up during the packed March 10 Lowell Area Schools Board of Education meeting following Boone’s video posting, who extolled their disgust for the mistreatment of the librarian with calls for civility in conversations about books.
“So much of this is being done … straight from the Moms for Liberty people. It has been done from a Christian movement, and the behavior and the way that they have treated me is so anti-Christ, it’s been so the opposite of how a Christian person would treat somebody, with respect and truth,” Beachler said. “We can have a difference of opinion. That’s absolutely fine, and you have the right to make those decisions for your children, but again, to be mean-spirited and say untrue things about a person and call them … horrific names has been incredibly hurtful to me and to my family.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/GettyImages-120619990-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-06-06 12:21:02.525624

(Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Gov. Tim Walz and legislative leaders have a signed agreement for a special legislative session on Monday, with the goal of passing 14 already agreed-upon bills in one day, according to a document obtained by the Reformer.
The long-awaited special session comes after weeks of behind-closed-doors meetings between Walz, House Speaker Lisa Demuth, House DFL caucus leader Melissa Hortman and Senate Majority Leader Erin Murphy after the Legislature adjourned on May 19 without passing a biennium budget. The agreement suggests that leaders have whipped enough votes from their caucuses to pass the bills.
The agreement states that lawmakers will vote on just 14 bills, which are mostly budget bills. However, lawmakers will also pass a standalone bill to strip MinnesotaCare from undocumented adults, as well a bill specifically about financial inducements for the development of data centers, though the agreement doesn’t elaborate on the details.
The special session agreement was signed by all caucus leaders, including Senate GOP Minority Leader Mark Johnson, who refrained from signing a previously announced budget agreement last month. Johnson said in May that the agreement fell short of what was required for a bipartisan budget.
Lawmakers during the special session will not be able to make amendments to the 14 bills on the floor, except as previously agreed to.
But the agreement suggests legislators may not have time to fully read the bills, some of which will be hundreds of pages long.
“The finalized bills will be conveyed to the House and Senate on Monday, June 9, 2025, and must be voted upon or passed by both bodies before 7:00 a.m. on Tuesday, June 10, 2025,” the agreement states.
The bills include a tax and local aid bill and a capital investment bill — two pieces of legislation that were on shaky ground throughout the weeks-long budget negotiations.
No other bills other than those listed in the agreement will be considered.
The one-day mandate is a tall order for lawmakers, many of whom are used to making long floor speeches.
Hortman late last month said House Democrats will want to make speeches on the floor about the bill to strip MinnesotaCare from undocumented adults to justify their no votes, though she said she’s confident the work can be done in one day.

(Photo by Wichayada Suwanachun/Getty Images)As a physician, I have witnessed firsthand the inefficiencies in our health care system that make it harder for patients to access the care they need. One of these complexities patients now have to navigate is a growing industry of insurance middlemen known as pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), whose practices meddling in our local health system increase health care costs and block access to critical medications.
PBMs work between health insurance companies and drug manufacturers to negotiate lower drug prices for the health plans they represent. Their function and influence in the health care industry have evolved significantly, and today, PBMs operate with very little oversight or transparency and their decisions are often based on what is most profitable for a health plan rather than what is best for a patient.
PBMs wield significant influence over what treatments patients can access and how much they will be required to pay. These middlemen receive significant rebates and discounts from pharmaceutical manufacturers for the cost of medications and treatments after negotiations, but they don’t pass those savings on to patients receiving the care, increasing what patients are required to pay out of pocket when they pick up their medication at the pharmacy counter.
PBMs can also require only certain drugs be covered by a health plan, impose arbitrary rules around access to provider-prescribed medications, and PBM revenue is often directly linked to the list price of a medicine, so PBMs are incentivized to recommend treatments that would yield the most profit.
The three largest PBMs – CVS Caremark, Express Scripts and OptumRx – manage nearly 80% of prescription drug claims for 270 million people across the country. To make matters worse, PBMs are increasingly integrating and consolidating with other health care services, including distributors and pharmacies, making the influence PBMs hold over the health care system even larger. As these for-profit entities merge and collaborate, it’s unclear if the system is actually functioning in the best interest of patients regarding quality and cost of care.
PBMs have flown under the radar for far too long, but scrutiny of these middlemen and their impact on our health care system has rightfully grown in recent years, with many federal and state policymakers and regulators calling attention to the outsized role PBMs play in driving up health care costs. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) found that PBM integration with chain pharmacies and insurers has allowed them to dominate the broader health system and that PBMs have significant control over what drugs are available to patients and how much they are required to pay.
The FTC even filed suit against the three of the nation’s largest PBMs, citing their anticompetitive tactics as a barrier to health care access. In addition, numerous investigations found that PBMs often act in their own financial interest, including pushing patients toward drugs with higher out-of-pocket costs because it’s more profitable for the PBM.
Access to consistent treatments is necessary for Louisiana patients, particularly those living with chronic health conditions or hard-to-treat illnesses such as cancer. Each year, more than 25,000 Louisianans receive a new cancer diagnosis. Alleviating access and financial barriers to care is a necessary step to improving health outcomes for patients.
It is overwhelmingly clear that we must take action to reform PBM practices to improve access to care for patients and stop letting middlemen meddle in our health system. There has never been a time when we can do more for patients as doctors, but at the same time, there has never been a time when we have more complexities in the health care systems impede healthcare access and affordability. This “profit over patients” business model is putting critical care out of reach for many Louisiana patients. Time is overdue to curb harmful PBM practices.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/health-care-stock-image-1024x618.jpg,,,2025-06-06 12:21:02.525624

We need spaces where Black women don’t have to shrink themselves just to get by.,"You know that saying, “Things aren’t like they used to be”? 
It hits different every time, especially when it’s used to downplay what Black women are still dealing with today. Honestly, not enough has changed. Right here in Connecticut, just like everywhere else, Black women are still fighting to be seen, heard and taken seriously.
People love to point at “progress” like it’s some magic fix. They’ll drop a few names of successful Black women in politics or Hollywood, like that’s supposed to erase centuries of harm. But real life for most of us isn’t a trending topic or a feel-good headline. It’s daily. It’s constant. And it shows a way bigger problem hiding behind those few success stories.


Being overlooked isn’t just about feeling bummed out; it has real-life consequences. In serious moments, like medical emergencies, it can mean delayed treatment and serious trouble. You see this a lot in healthcare. There’s this unconscious bias about Black women and how we experience pain. When our safety or basic needs are ignored, this lack of attention can lead to unfairness in getting important resources, showing that being invisible can sadly become a matter of life and death.
This also happens at work, where we get praised for working hard but somehow always get passed over for promotions. It’s in our schools, where Black girls get labeled as “trouble” and don’t get the same understanding as other kids. Over and over, we hear, “Well, at least it’s better now,” and it’s like a slap in the face. 

Xyania Clarke
And I’m asking you: Better than what? 
Better doesn’t mean good enough. Better doesn’t mean equal.
But for some reason, that’s where everyone stops. Even in Connecticut, a state that loves to call itself progressive, Black women’s struggles barely make it into the conversation. DEI panels and hashtags sound nice, but how often do they actually focus on us? How often do they talk about what it’s like to move through the world being both Black and a woman?
I’ll tell you: Not enough.
The hard truth is, society expects us to be strong enough to carry the world’s weight, but not too strong, so we don’t make anyone uncomfortable. We’re supposed to be the backbone, the peacemakers, the ones who show up for everyone else while getting the bare minimum in return.
And the second we speak up, we get hit with, “It’s not that bad, everybody struggles,” or “You’re being too sensitive,” basically telling Black women to be grateful because “Things aren’t as bad as they used to be.” It’s just another way of telling us to shut up. And we’re over it!
So, here’s the deal: Yeah, we can see that some things have changed — but that doesn’t mean the work is done. Progress doesn’t always mean fairness, and right now, things still aren’t fair for everyone.
We can celebrate the wins without pretending the system isn’t still working against us. In Connecticut and everywhere else, it’s time to stop checking boxes and start making real, lasting changes that truly focus on and support Black women —not just with words, but with actual steps.
We don’t need more empty slogans. We don’t need another panel that goes nowhere. We need healthcare providers who actually listen to us. Employers who promote us because we’ve earned it, not just to make their team look diverse. We need schools that lift up Black girls instead of putting them in boxes with old, biased ideas. We need spaces where Black women don’t have to shrink themselves just to get by. Because “better than it used to be” is still not good enough — and we deserve so much more than that.

Along with punishing the 14 states that use their own funds to cover immigrants who are here illegally, analysts say last-minute changes to the bill would make it all but impossible for states to continue helping some immigrants who are in the country legally, on humanitarian parole.
Under the bill, the federal government would slash funding to states that have expanded Medicaid and provide coverage to immigrants who are on humanitarian parole — immigrants who have received permission to temporarily enter the United States due to an emergency or urgent humanitarian reason.
The federal government pays 90% of the cost of covering adults without children who are eligible under Medicaid expansion, but the bill would cut that to 80% for those states, doubling the state portion from 10% to 20%. That’s the same penalty the bill proposes for states that use their own money to help immigrants who are here illegally.
Ironically, states such as Florida that have extended Medicaid coverage to immigrants who are here on humanitarian parole but have not expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act would not be harmed by the bill, said Leonardo Cuello, a Medicaid law and policy expert and research professor at the Center for Children and Families at Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy.
More states offer health care coverage for certain immigrants, noncitizens

It is “wildly nonsensical and unfair” to penalize expansion states for covering a population that some non-expansion states, such as Florida, also cover, Cuello said. “It would appear that the purpose is more to punish expansion states than address any genuine concern with immigrant coverage.”
West Virginia is one of the states where lawmakers are nervously watching U.S. Senate discussions on the proposed penalty. Republican state Rep. Matt Rohrbach, a deputy House speaker, said West Virginia legislators tabled a proposal that would have ended Medicaid expansion if the federal government reduced its share of the funding, because the state’s congressional representatives assured them it wasn’t going to happen. Now the future is murkier.
Cuello called the proposed penalty “basically a gun to the head of the states.”
“Congress is framing it as a choice, but the state is being coerced and really has no choice,” he said.
There are about 1.3 million people in the United States on humanitarian parole, from Afghanistan, Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, Ukraine and Venezuela as well as some Central American children who have rejoined family here. The Trump administration is trying to end parole from some of those countries. A Supreme Court decision May 30 allows the administration to end humanitarian parole for about 500,000 people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela.
Not many of those parolees qualify for Medicaid, which requires a waiting period or special status, but the 40 states with expanded Medicaid could be penalized anyway when they do start accepting them as they begin to qualify, said Tanya Broder, senior counsel for health and economic justice policy at the National Immigration Law Center.










It would appear that the purpose is more to punish expansion states than address any genuine concern with immigrant coverage.


– Leonardo Cuello, Georgetown University research professor


Meanwhile, an increasing number of states and the District of Columbia already are considering scaling back Medicaid coverage for immigrants because of the costs.
The federal budget bill, named the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, is now being considered by the Senate, where changes are likely. The fact that so many states could be affected by the last-minute change could mean more scrutiny in that chamber, said Andrea Kovach, senior attorney for health care justice at the Shriver Center on Poverty Law in Chicago.
By her count, at least 38 states and the District of Columbia would be affected by the new restrictions, since they accepted some options now offered by Medicaid to cover at least some humanitarian parolees without a five-year waiting period.
“They’re all going to be penalized because they added in parolees,” Kovach said. “So that’s 38 times two senators who are going to be very interested in this provision to make sure their state doesn’t get their reimbursement knocked down.”
The change to exclude people with humanitarian parole was included in a May 21 amendment by U.S. Rep. Jodey Arrington, a Texas Republican who chairs the House budget committee. Arrington’s office did not reply to a request for comment, though he has stressed the importance of withholding Medicaid from immigrants who are here illegally.
Need to go to the hospital? Texas and Florida want to know your immigration status.

“[Democrats] want to protect health care and welfare at any cost for illegal immigrants at the expense of hardworking taxpayers,” Arrington said in a May 22 floor speech urging passage of the bill. “But by the results of this last election, it’s abundantly clear: The people see through this too and they have totally rejected the Democrats’ radical agenda.”
Some states already are considering cutting Medicaid coverage for immigrants, though Democratic lawmakers and advocates are pushing back.
Washington, D.C., Democratic Mayor Muriel Bowser has proposed phasing out a program that provides Medicaid coverage to adults regardless of their immigration status, a move she says would save the District of Columbia $457 million.
Minnesota advocates protested a state budget deal reached last month with Democratic Gov. Tim Walz to phase out health care coverage for adults who are here illegally, a condition Republican lawmakers insisted on to avoid a shutdown.
Similarly, Illinois advocates are protesting new state rules that will end a program that has provided Medicaid coverage to immigrants aged 42-64 regardless of their legal status. The program cost $1.6 billion over three years, according to a state audit. The state will continue a separate program that provides coverage for older adults.
“Our position is that decision-makers in Illinois shouldn’t be doing Trump’s work for him,” said Kovach, of the Shriver Center on Poverty Law. “Let’s preserve health coverage for immigrants and stand up for Illinois immigrant residents who have been paying taxes into this state for years and need this coverage.”
Illinois state Sen. Graciela Guzmán, a Democrat whose parents are refugees from El Salvador, said many of her constituents in Chicago may be forced to cancel chemotherapy or lifesaving surgery because of the changes.
“It was a state budget, but I think the federal reconciliation bill really set the tone for it,” Guzmán said. “In a tough fiscal environment, it was really hard to set up a defense for this program.”
More States Offer Health Coverage to Immigrant Children

Oregon Democratic Gov. Tina Kotek is among the governors holding firm, saying that letting immigrants stay uninsured imposes costs on local hospitals and ends up raising prices for everyone.
“The costs will go somewhere. When everyone is insured it is much more helpful to keep costs down and reasonable for everyone. That’s why we’ve taken this approach to give care to everyone,” Kotek said at a news conference last month.
Medicaid does pay for emergency care for low-income patients, regardless of their immigration status, and that would not change under the federal budget bill.
Franny White, a spokesperson for the Oregon Health Authority, said her state’s Medicaid program covers about 105,000 immigrants, some of whom are here illegally. She said the policy, established by a 2021 state law, can save money in the long run.
“Uninsured people are less likely to receive preventive care due to cost and often wait until a condition worsens to the point that it requires more advanced, expensive care at an emergency department or hospital,” she said.
California was among the first states, along with Oregon, to offer health insurance to immigrants of all ages regardless of their legal status. But it now is considering cutting back, looking to save $5 billion as it seeks to close a $12 billion budget deficit. In May, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom proposed freezing enrollment of immigrant adults who are here illegally, and charging them premiums to save money.
“It’s possible that other states will decide to cut back these services because of budgetary concerns,” said Drishti Pillai, director of immigrant health policy at KFF, a health policy research organization.
If the federal budget bill passes with the immigrant health care provision intact, states would have more than two years to adjust, since the changes would not take effect until October 2027.
“We have time to really understand what the landscape looks like and really create a legal argument to make sure folks are able to maintain their health care coverage,” said Enddy Almonord, director for Healthy Illinois, an advocacy group supporting universal health care coverage.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-06 16:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,No-fault eviction bill failed a third time in CT. Renters say housing situation is dire,James Watson,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/06/ct-just-cause-eviction-housing-shortage/,"Advocates fear CT's low housing vacancy rate incentivizes landlords to evict lower-income tenants — which, in turn, drives up homelessness.","In Connecticut, landlords must legally have “just cause” in order to evict a tenant who is either over 62 years old or has a disability. That includes not paying rent, not abiding by the rental contract, engaging in certain illegal activities or putting other tenants’ health or safety at risk. 
For years, tenants and their advocates have been urging lawmakers to extend those protections to all renters in the state.
The proposal has now failed three years in a row. 
Meanwhile, the situation is growing more urgent, proponents say. Connecticut faces an estimated lack of 110,000 housing units to meet demand. The vacancy rate for housing in Connecticut is 7% for this year, well below the national average of 11%, according to researchers with consultancy ECOnorthwest. 
Advocates fear that’s incentivizing landlords to evict lower-income tenants — which, in turn, drives up homelessness among the state’s most vulnerable groups. 
“If we don’t do something in the next few years, the situation is not going to get better,” said David Rich, a homelessness advocate and president of the Housing Collective, a nonprofit dedicated to creating more affordable housing and ending homelessness in the state.
Last year, 3,410 individuals in the state experienced homelessness — a 13% increase from the year before, according to the CT Homeless Management Information System, which conducts an annual “point-in-time” census of the state’s unhoused population. It was the third year in a row Connecticut’s homeless population rose.
The increase is also affecting younger people. Data from the point-in-time count shows that among the 2024 homeless population, approximately 700 were children. 
For many lower-income families in Connecticut, available housing units often aren’t affordable. The vast majority of the state, 90%, is zoned for ‘single-family’ housing, as opposed to more-affordable multi-family complexes, according to a report known as the Connecticut Zoning Atlas. Even new multi-family construction is often out of reach for lower-income renters, given the high cost of construction.
Rents have also been rising in Connecticut since the COVID-19 pandemic, housing experts say. The problem is exacerbated by the lack of supply and growing demand.
“Many people are working and still can’t afford rents. They need subsidies to keep them afloat,” said Kellyann Day, chief executive of New Reach, a nonprofit in Connecticut addressing housing insecurity. Day said advocacy can only go so far; she believes renters — particularly women and minorities in urban areas — need statutory protections against eviction.
This year, lawmakers put forth House Bill 6889, the latest attempt to extend tenant protections. But the bill died before coming up for a vote in the House. 
The General Assembly did pass a sprawling measure tackling zoning, homelessness and fair rent commissions. The bill seeks to increase housing supply by offering towns prioritization for funding if they change their zoning to make it easier to build multifamily housing and increases the number of fair rent commissions, which are local bodies that can make legal rulings on whether rent increases are acceptable. Many called it the most significant housing legislation in years. 
No-fault eviction protections didn’t make the cut. Critics of the concept were concerned it would make it difficult for landlords to evict problem tenants.

Sen. Rob Sampson, R-Wolcott, ranking member of the Housing Committee, described the proposal as creating “barriers for housing providers,” deterring landlords from entering the housing market and thus further restricting available units.  
“Taking tools away from landlords, that’s onerous and punitive,” Sampson said. 
Landlords contend that “lapse of time” evictions — which allow a landlord to terminate a lease when the contract’s term has come to an end — are a necessary tool for removing tenants who repeatedly engage in destructive or illegal behavior. 
“There needs to be something in place for a quick eviction if tenants are not properly maintaining a property,” said Jeff Feroni, President of Trio Properties, a Glastonbury real estate firm with a focus in commercial multi-family complexes.
“It’s not really an eviction. It’s just me trying to get back my property. It is a graceful way to end a contract between two people,” said John Souza, Hartford County Landlord and president of the Coalition of Property Owners, an organization dedicated to helping landlords across the state.
Lawmakers and landlords both worry that excess legislation for tenant protections will create a climate that is untenable for landlords to keep renting.
Jessica Doll, executive director of the Connecticut Apartment Association, said the stress should be on growing housing and not targeting landlords. Others also said that a debate around landlords’ agency over properties they own was not useful to addressing the needs of vulnerable tenants in the state.
“Our goal is never to have vacancies, it is always to have long term tenants,” she said.

Negotiating positions
Renters — particularly those who are lower-income — say they feel they’re at a relative disadvantage when they need to work out issues with their landlords.
Advocacy groups, including the Connecticut Tenants Union, New Reach, Make The Road and All In, say protections are needed so people have the ability to raise concerns about poor conditions — such as doors that don’t lock, lack of heat or sewage issues — without feeling they’re risking eviction or a non-renewal of their lease.
Julian Eileen, long time renter at the Manor House Apartment Complex in Bloomfield and one of the leaders of the Manor House Tenant’s Union, said certain landlords try to “blame the victim.” 
When landlords initiate eviction proceedings, many lower-income tenants can’t afford legal representation — which also puts them at a disadvantage, advocates say. 
“The vast, vast majority of tenants still go through the eviction process unrepresented,” said Luke Melanokos-Harrison, vice president of the Connecticut Tenants’ Union. Trying to represent one’s self, while also trying to find housing, is particularly challenging, he said.
Jay Osborne, a social worker and advocate, said his landlord took him to court three times for eviction. Osborne has a disability, and is protected under the current regulations from no-fault eviction. Still, he lost all three cases in court. 
Following an ongoing legal battle, Osborne founded the Windham Mills Connecticut Tenant’s Union to protect tenants in his building who were subject to ‘lapse of time’ evictions, with leases not being renewed.
“There is a big problem in the state,” he said. “There are over a million renters in the state and most of them don’t know their rights.”
In 2020, COVID shifted landlord-tenant dynamics temporarily, with moratoriums on evictions and emergency rent assistance programs. But when those came to an end, the number of people who could no longer afford to rent rose, leading to more non-payment evictions and contributing to the rise in homelessness.
Disproportionate impacts
Amid the current strains in Connecticut’s housing market, the state’s most vulnerable communities are losing their homes.
Antoinette Humes moved out of her housing in New Haven’s East Rock neighborhood last August in order to avoid eviction proceedings after she was unable to make rent. She has been staying in a shelter and living apart from her 16-year-old son so he can continue to go to school in their former neighborhood.
“Everyone has the same story,” Humes said. “People here are working and not getting treated right by their landlords.”

Humes, a single parent, said she doesn’t feel that members of the legislature see her plight clearly — if they did, they’d do something, she said. “I have a pressure that sits with me all day long. I don’t think they voice our pain enough,” she said.
Minorities and women in urban areas have been the biggest casualties of this strain, making up the majority of homelessness cases. According to the point-in-time count, 66% of the state’s unhoused population were minorities — twice as many as those from Caucasian backgrounds, according to the point-in-time census.
A recent survey of 1,400 Black women in the Detroit area found that evictions commonly lead to poor health outcomes for individuals and their communities. The researchers found that more than a third of individuals who experienced an illegal eviction reported worse health. And those who experienced eviction before age 18 — whether court-ordered or illegal — faced higher rates of poor physical and mental health. 
Amy Eppler-Epstein, a housing attorney in Connecticut, has seen first-hand that Black women experience homelessness more than any other group in the state. “You can see certain ZIP codes where evictions are particularly concentrated,” she said.
Sarah Fox, head of the Connecticut Coalition to End Homelessness, a nonprofit dedicated to homelessness prevention, said people of color are more likely to be renters, and are thus at a higher risk of homelessness. 
Minorities and low-income families in urban areas including New Haven, Bridgeport and Hartford, face the highest rates of evictions that lead to homelessness, advocates said. In these areas, evictions are particularly common among single mothers, like Humes, who struggle to afford rent whilst holding stable jobs and looking after children.
Advocates say they’ll be back again next year to push the General Assembly to address what they see as systemic issues driving up homelessness among the state’s most vulnerable communities.
“Until legislation is put in place, there is only so much we can do,” Osborne said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Just-cause-eviction-rally.jpg,,,2025-06-06 12:21:02.525624

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Medical experts are dismayed over a federal report’s claim that kids are overprescribed asthma medications, saying it minimizes how many lives the drugs save.
Safe treatment protocols for asthma management have been carefully studied over the years, said Dr. Perry Sheffield, a pediatrician and professor at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.
“The federal government actually has some really beautiful and clear guidelines and strategies, and things that are vetted by and carefully edited by many experts in the field,” said Sheffield, who co-directs a region of the federally funded Pediatric Environmental Health Specialty Units that serves New Jersey, New York, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
Asthma affects more than 4.6 million American children, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It’s one of the most common long-term diseases in U.S. children.
The Make America Healthy Again Commission report released in late May, parts of which have been widely criticized, alleges that American children are on too much medication of various kinds, including asthma treatments.
Experts worry that the administration will set policy based on the assessment that would dissuade insurers from covering asthma prescriptions. They also say that the report’s assertions could worsen disparities that affect children’s access to those medications and undermine years of research around the drugs.

The MAHA commission has until August to release a strategy based on the findings in the report.
Black and Indigenous children as well as those living in inner cities or in lower-income households are among those with the highest rates of asthma. Pollution disproportionately shrouds communities of color and can be a trigger that exacerbates the disease.
The report’s message could heighten those disparities, said Dr. Elizabeth Matsui, a University of Texas at Austin professor and a past chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ Section on Allergy and Immunology.
“One thing that has been very clear is that kids of color are less likely to be appropriately managed in terms of their asthma medication management,” she said. “So a message of overprescription that is simply not supported by the evidence also could potentially exacerbate already-existing racial and ethnic disparities in asthma that we have really not made much headway on.”
The commission’s claims
The report touches on childhood prediabetes, obesity and mental health. However, firearm injuries — the leading cause of death for children and teens in 2020 and 2021, according to the CDC — weren’t mentioned.
The 70-page report from the commission, chaired by Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr., claims four main issues are the drivers behind childhood chronic disease: poor diet, aggregation of environmental chemicals, lack of physical activity and chronic stress, and “overmedicalization.”
Matsui and other experts said the report’s use of that word is “problematic.”
“The implication could be, unfortunately, that when a child has asthma — so, they have coughing, chest tightness, wheezing — that that is not really a disease,” said Matsui. “We know for a fact that that’s a disease, and we know that it is quite treatable, quite controllable, and that it has profound impacts on the child’s day-to-day life.”
Other scientists have similarly criticized the report, saying it makes sweeping and misleading generalizations about children’s health without sufficient evidence. The White House corrected the report after nonprofit news outlet NOTUS found that it cited studies that didn’t exist.










The implication could be, unfortunately, that when a child has asthma … that that is not really a disease. We know for a fact that that's a disease.


– Dr. Elizabeth Matsui, University of Texas at Austin professor


When it comes to asthma, the report says, “Asthma controller prescriptions increased 30% from 1999-2008.” That sentence originally cited a broken link to a study from 2011; the link was later replaced. Controller meds include inhalers.The MAHA report also claims that “There is evidence of overprescription of oral corticosteroids for mild cases of asthma.” The original version of the report listed estimated percentages of oral corticosteroids overuse, citing a nonexistent study. The wording was changed and the citation was later replaced with a link to a 2017 study by pediatric pulmonologist Dr. Harold Farber.
The study was not a randomized controlled trial, which increases reliability. Farber told NOTUS that the report made an “overgeneralization” of his research. Stateline also reached out to Farber, whose public relations team declined an interview request.
Oral corticosteroids are liquid or tablet medications used to reduce inflammation for conditions including allergies, asthma, arthritis and Crohn’s disease. For asthma, they’re used to treat severe flare-up episodes. The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America says the medications have been shown to reduce emergency room visits and hospitalizations, and that while they do come with risk of side effects, they’re mostly used in acute flare-ups. And while rare, asthma-related deaths in kids do occur, and are often preventable.
“Asthma medications, including oral steroids, are lifesaving,” said Dr. Elizabeth Friedman, a pediatrician at Children’s Mercy Kansas City. “I believe that physicians, not politicians, are best equipped and most effectively trained to make the determination of whether or not these medications are needed for our patients.”
Friedman worries that federal characterizations of asthma meds will affect how state Medicaid agencies cover the drugs. When Medicaid coverage changed for a common prescribed inhaler last year, many of her Missouri Medicaid patients were suddenly without the drug. They ended up hospitalized, she said.
Friedman directs Region 7 of the Pediatric Environmental Health Specialty Units, a network of experts that works to address reproductive and children’s environmental health issues. Region 7 provides outreach and education in Iowa, Kansas, Missouri and Nebraska.
She also said she’s concerned that the report is “making a broad, sweeping statement based on one epidemiologic study from one state.”
Increased use
An increase in inhaler prescriptions is not necessarily a bad thing, experts say. It’s a sign that kids are getting their medication.
There has been an increase in inhaler prescriptions, along with a corresponding decrease in the oral corticosteroids, which is what experts would want to see, said Chelsea Langer, bureau chief of the New Mexico Department of Health’s Environmental Health Epidemiology Bureau. She said that means kids are “following their asthma action plans and taking the controller medications to prevent needing the relief or treatment [oral] meds.”

Asthma prevalence has increased over the years, meaning more people need medication, noted Dr. Alan Baptist, division head of Allergy and Clinical Immunology at Henry Ford Health in Michigan.
He said that because steroid tablets come with risk of side effects, it is best to limit them.
But for kids without access to a regular pediatric provider or to health insurance that covers an inhaler, cost can be an obstacle, he said. Fluticasone propionate, an FDA-approved medicine for people 4 and older, costs on average $200 or more for one inhaler without insurance.
“What often happens with kids, and especially kids who are in Medicaid, or who are in an underserved or disadvantaged population, they are not given appropriate asthma controller medication,” said Baptist, who helped write federal guidelines for asthma treatment best practices as part of a National Institutes of Health committee.
Baptist noted that while he was glad to see pollution mentioned in the report as a danger for kids, it’s at odds with the recent cuts to environmental health grants that aimed to address such asthma triggers.
“They’re somewhat cherry-picking some of the data that they’re putting down,” he said. “It says the U.S. government is ‘committed to fostering radical transparency and gold-standard science’ to better understand the potential cumulative impacts of environmental exposure. If that’s what they’re saying, then they should be funding even greater studies that look at the effects.”
Dr. Priya Bansal, an Illinois pediatrician and past president of the Illinois Society of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology, said she’s concerned the report doesn’t define mild, moderate or severe asthma to differentiate the different best-practice treatment plans.
Bansal also said she worries that federal officials’ characterization of an FDA-approved drug will lead to insurance companies refusing to cover inhalers or oral steroids for her patients who rely on them.
“I’m going to be worried about coverage for my asthmatics,” she said. “The question is, what’s the next move that they’re going to make? If they think that, are they going to now say, ‘Hey, we’re not going to cover inhalers for mild asthmatics’?”

You can read more about the section here.

With graduation season upon us, I can’t help but be proud of the next generation of leaders. Each cap and gown represents not just an achievement, but a hope for the future and for a better Mississippi.
But graduation season has been overshadowed when I read about the freeze of $137 million in federal funds promised to Mississippi schools. My mind drifts to the death of Harvey Johnson Jr. It may not be easy to see the connection between the shooting of a 15-year-old and a school budget cut, but for me — as a district attorney for nearly a decade — the consequences are painfully personal.
A cut in school funding isn’t just a line in a report. It means fewer resources, fewer safeguards and more young lives at risk.  Lives like Harvey’s.
Harvey was caught in a battle between the streets and the schools—and the streets won. One Sunday afternoon in Columbus in 2022, he found himself with a man nearly 15 years older than him, Tommy Flowers Jr. They were drinking and using drugs together until Tommy decided to settle a score. He took Harvey along, handed him a Taurus 9mm and had him fire round after round at a house where he had a beef with the occupants.

What Tommy failed to prepare Harvey for was that the young men in that house were armed too — “Second Amendment ready,” as people like to say. One of them had an AR-style rifle and returned fire so quickly and heavily that it didn’t take long before Harvey was hit and killed.
During the trial, my focus was on holding Mr. Flowers accountable for leading Harvey to his death. The idea that a nearly 30-year-old man would get a teenager drunk and high, arm him with a gun and take him to attack a home he knew was likely to respond with bullets so enraged me that it was difficult to think about anything else. The jury agreed. I moved on to the next case. In my work, there is no finish line.
But when I read about the freeze in federal education funding, the Harvey case came rushing back–not just the facts, but the warning it carries.
What $137 million can do for Mississippi’s schools is not hypothetical. It’s real support: school counselors who notice when a student starts slipping; after-school programs that keep kids safe until their parents are home; mentors, mental health staff and trained resource officers who de-escalate conflict instead of inflaming it. It’s guidance and structure that can help a 15-year-old imagine a future that doesn’t involve a gun.
According to Mississippi Today, about 70 school districts across the state are set to lose these desperately needed funds. The Jackson Public Schools District alone stands to lose $4.5 million. Of that, $3.62 million was set aside for urgently needed construction, and nearly $1 million was planned for instructional support. Other districts had allocated their money toward literacy programs, math tutoring, mental health services and classroom technology. That money was already budgeted—already spoken for.
The shooting that ended Harvey’s life happened on a Sunday. But the choices that led to it happened every day before that — in classrooms without enough adults to care, in neighborhoods without safe places to gather, in homes stretched too thin to fill the gaps.
If we care about liberty, if we care about life, we must care about what our schools can actually provide.
This funding freeze isn’t just a bureaucratic decision. It’s a threat to the only institutions standing between some of our most vulnerable kids and a world full of people like Tommy Flowers who see them as disposable. We may never know exactly what could have saved Harvey, but we know what didn’t: indifference, underfunding and too many missed chances.
As we celebrate graduation achievements, we must remember that the next generation deserves the opportunity to succeed. The next Harvey is already out there. We still have time to save him — but only if we give our schools what they need to reach him first. We owe that to him.  We owe it to our next generation of leaders.

(AP) — It’s a small part in a big movie, but for the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, their scene in “Sinners” is a huge deal.
The horror movie blockbuster, starring Michael B. Jordan as a gangster turned vampire slayer, paints a brief but impactful portrait of the tribe using Choctaw actors and cultural experts. For some, it’s the first time they’ve seen the Choctaw way of life accurately portrayed on the big screen.
In the scene, a posse of Choctaw, riding on horseback and in an old truck, arrives at a small farmhouse to warn the couple that lives there of coming danger. When the couple refuses their help, a Choctaw man wishes them luck in his native language before riding off.
“I’ve not seen another movie that has our language, like, spoken correctly,” said Cynthia Massey, a cultural consultant for “Sinners.”
Massey runs the tribe’s Chahta Immi Cultural Center alongside Sherrill Nickey and department director Jay Wesley. All three were hired as cultural consultants to ensure a genuine depiction of the tribe in the film. Together, they sifted through archives, researching how their ancestors would have dressed, spoken and acted in the 1930s, when “Sinners” takes place.
“I was honored and humbled by the fact that they wanted a true representation,” said Wesley, who also acted in the movie.
Wesley connected the filmmakers to Choctaw actors and artifacts like the beaded sashes the Choctaw characters wear in the movie. Those sashes are now part of a “Sinners” display at the cultural center.

The movie’s introduction also features a short snippet of a Choctaw war chant, performed by Wesley’s daughter, Jaeden Wesley, who is a student at the University of California, Los Angeles. While recording, Jaeden Wesley said the filmmakers told her they wanted the Choctaw people to hear their music in the movie.
“We were catering to our own people, even in that short little second,” Jaeden Wesley said.
Shining a spotlight on often overlooked cultures and topics, like the Choctaw people, is part of the mission at Proximity Media, which produced “Sinners.” The company was founded by “Sinners” director Ryan Coogler, his wife and film producer, Zinzi Coogler, and producer Sev Ohanian.
“It was never a question for us that if we were going to portray the Mississippi Choctaw, we got to have the right people who can tell us, who can tell Ryan, what we’re not knowing, what we’re not thinking,” Ohanian said. “It was all because we’re trying to serve Ryan’s story of like putting truth on screen.”
Ohanian and his co-founders didn’t stop with Choctaw consultants; they enlisted a small army of experts who advised on the confluence of cultures mingling in the Mississippi Delta, where the film is set. The resulting cinematic world was so well received, community organizers penned an open letter, inviting Coogler and his fellow filmmakers to visit the Delta. Last week, the Cooglers, Ohanian and others took up the offer, attending a “Sinners” screening in Clarksdale, Mississippi. Clarksdale is where the film’s events unfold.
“I hope this encourages other filmmakers to find opportunities to be authentic in their storytelling and to look at this rich tapestry of culture that’s right here in America,” Ohanian said, noting the film industry has historically misrepresented nonwhite groups.
For Wesley and his fellow consultants, the hope is the film will cultivate curiosity in audiences, encourage them to learn more about Choctaw culture and visit the Chahta Immi Cultural Center.
“It’s important to be connected to this culture because this was here before the public was here,” Massey said. “Probably three-quarters of Mississippi was Choctaw land, and now we only have 350,000 acres.”
They say Choctaw participation in the film has cultivated a sense of pride among tribe members. Nickey hopes it will encourage a sort of cultural renaissance at a time when she says fewer and fewer Choctaw speak their native language.
“I know for a fact that there are a lot of kids out there that don’t even know how to speak our language. They only speak English,” Nickey said. “I hope they know it’s okay to speak our language.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/06103844/AP16126717205614.jpg,,,2025-06-06 12:21:02.525624

Photo by Patrick Bilow/Stowe ReporterThis story by Patrick Bilow was first published in the Stowe Reporter on June 5.A years-long effort to coexist with the beavers around Memorial Park in Stowe is proving futile, according to town officials.Last week, the selectboard voted to remove a “beaver deceiver” from the park, which was installed last summer to deter the industrious animals from damming up culverts. The board also reiterated its authorization to trap beavers in the area, if necessary.The Memorial Park beavers have been busy for years, building dams that have exasperated an already-inadequate drainage system in the park. Culverts, of which there are several in Memorial Park, serve as a prime location for beaver dams, but their structures are notorious for blocking up the park’s stormwater system and worsening flooding events, which occur regularly in the area.READ MORE
In response, the town hired Skip Lisle to install beaver deceivers in Memorial Park last summer. Lisle is a Vermonter who installs his deceivers throughout the country. The contraptions deter beavers from culverts by altering the water flow at the inlet, eliminating them as a prime location for dams. They’re also designed to collect debris without interrupting water flow, but their effectiveness in this category depends on who you ask.Lisle’s deceivers were successful in driving the beavers out of Memorial Park, but they’ve been building a metropolis upstream, including a dam at least 30 feet long and eight feet high, a hut and a sizable pond.Over the weekend, during a period of heavy rain, the dam burst in one spot, releasing a rush of water that quickly overran the culverts, flooding the park’s baseball fields and reaching the cafeteria of the nearby elementary school.This is far from the first time the park has flooded, and selectboard member Nick Donza urged the board to act, saying people are starting to get frustrated when little league games are canceled due to floods, or there’s water in the school.The beavers were quick to patch up the dam and the pond filled up again almost overnight, but Harry Shepard, Stowe’s public works manager, doesn’t want to wait until the dam bursts again.To curb the impact of another flood in Memorial Park, the town removed one of Lisle’s beaver deceivers, which Shepard said was collecting debris and worsening floods, and utilized a pump to reduce the water level of the pond. The town has plans to slowly disassemble the dam this summer.Harry Shepard, Stowe’s public works director, Dan Danforth, parks superintendent, and Matt Frazee, parks and recreation director, discuss what to do with a beaver dam above Memorial Park on Friday. Photo by Patrick Bilow/Stowe Reporter“The issue with the deceivers is they compromise the hydraulic capacity of the culverts,” Shepard said.Lisle was staunch in his disagreement of that assessment and accused the town of scapegoating his devices, one of which remains in Memorial Park.Lisle said his deceivers were “mischaracterized” by Shepard to the selectboard. The deceivers aren’t the problem, he said, it’s the culverts, which are “too small and in a state of disrepair.”Shepard agreed the culverts are inadequate, but that’s the system the town is stuck with for now, he said. A multi-million-dollar project to renovate Memorial Park, including improving the park’s grading and stormwater system, is currently making its way through a gauntlet of zoning approvals, and might not even be possible considering Memorial Park’s state classification as a protected wetland. But that hasn’t eased Lisle.“This is the dumbest possible thing they could have done,” Lisle said, adding the park has been flooding since long before his devices were installed. “These are valuable devices the town is now just disposing of.”The deceivers cost the town about $17,000. When the selectboard voted to hire Lisle, it was part of a plan to entertain alternatives before the town resorted to trapping.The town has employed other tactics over the years, like installing wire around the base of trees, but Shepard and some selectboard members have indicated that cohabitation isn’t really working out.Last year, the selectboard said it would start trapping the beavers around Memorial Park if the alternatives failed, and during last week’s selectboard meeting, Donza asked, “Are we not there now?”A beaver deceiver. Photo by Gordon Miller/Stowe ReporterThe town doesn’t need additional approval from the selectboard to trap the beavers, ultimately killing them, according to town manager Charles Safford. Trapping, if it occurs, would take place during trapping season in October. Safford added the town is following guidance from the Agency of Natural Resources in dealing with the beavers.Brenna Galdenzi, president of Protect our Wildlife and a Stowe resident, has helped the town explore alternatives to trapping for years, and she doesn’t think the town did its best to assure the success of the beaver deceivers and she’s certain trapping won’t solve the problem either.According to Galdenzi, the town should have cleared the beaver deceivers of debris more frequently. Shepard said there was never a discussion about maintaining the devices after they were installed. He ticked off a long list of tasks and projects for his staff, clearing the deceivers has not been a high priority.Galdenzi said trapping isn’t a one-off action and, often, when beavers are removed from an area, a new family shows up and they can revive a dam almost overnight. If you trap once, Galdenzi said, you trap every year.The selectboard was not unanimous in its vote to remove the beaver deceiver, with Paco Aumand casting the sole nay vote.“I’m sensitive to the flooding issue,” Aumand said, “but I don’t think this solves our problem for this summer.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Beavers a dam dilemma for town public works.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Beaver-Dam2-Stowe-Reporter-060525.jpg,,,2025-06-06 12:21:02.525624

Kay Ivey on Friday appointed Rep. Cynthia Almond, R-Tuscaloosa, to serve as president of the Alabama Public Service Commission (PSC).
Almond will fill the vacancy left by Twinkle Cavanaugh, who is departing for a position in President Donald Trump’s administration. The appointment is effective June 16, and Almond is set to step down from her House District 63 seat on June 15.
“Cynthia has proven to be an extremely effective public servant and leader, and I am confident the people of Alabama will be even better served when she takes the helm at the Public Service Commission,” said Ivey in a statement.
As president of the three-member commission, Almond will oversee the regulation of public utilities in the state. Critics have long accused the PSC of being passive toward the companies it oversees. Since 1982, the commission has operated under a system that guarantees utilities a profit, a process different from a formal rate hearing, where an entity must justify any rate increases.

During her time in the House, she served as vice-chair of the Ethics and Campaign Finance Committee and was a member of the Ways and Means Education, Judiciary, and Rules committees. Almond carried legislation to update public records laws in 2023 and 2024 and require state agencies to respond within a set period.
“I am honored to have been asked by Governor Ivey to fill this important position,” Almond said in a statement. “I believe my training as an attorney and legislator will prove to be helpful in performing this role.”
Prior to her time in the state Legislature, Almond served four terms on the Tuscaloosa City Council, where she was elected president pro tempore.
Almond attended Vanderbilt University and is a graduate of the University of Alabama and the University of Alabama School of Law.

(Photo by Tom Foley/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Pride Month event organizers in Iowa are seeing an increase in participation amidst national and state activity targeting the queer community. 
“People in the community that are passionate about diversity, equity and inclusion and are passionate about the LGBTQ+ community are showing up because they know this is an important time,” said Wes Mullins, executive director of Capital City Pride.
Every June, celebrations of Pride Month focus on self-affirmation, dignity, equality, increased visibility and connections within Iowa’s LGBTQ+ community, and Capital City Pride’s Pridefest is the largest LGBTQ+ annual gathering in Iowa. The focus is on the so-called “Five Pillars of Pride,” which are education, family, health and wellness, community and celebration.
Each year, Pridefest hosts the Pride Stride 5k — an event that in previous years never had more than 500 participants. This year, there are more than 750. Additionally, all of the available vendor spaces at Pridefest have been booked for the first time in the event’s history.
“One of the hardest things in the LGBTQ+ community is combatting a sense of isolation and loneliness,” Mullins said. “With the political attacks on the LGBTQ+ community that have been happening, it’s even more important to make sure people are able to connect.”
Earlier this year, Iowa became the first state to remove civil rights protections from a protected class by removing “gender identity” as a protected characteristic under the Iowa Civil Rights Act, which prohibits discrimination in employment, housing, education, credit and public accommodations. After the law goes into effect on July 1, transgender Iowans will no longer have those protections under the state’s Civil Rights Act. 
Mullins calls the revisions to the Iowa Civil Rights Act an “embarrassment.” PHC Iowa, a healthcare provider, has already closed all gender-affirming care clinics to avoid losing federal funding. A 2024 study found that state-level, anti-transgender laws can cause up to a 72% increase in suicide attempts among transgender and non-binary youth. 
“I think people have whiplash in Iowa City, seeing the things happening at the state or federal level and they say, ‘that’s not my community, that’s not what’s happening here,’ but the reality is that is happening to a lot of other folks,” said Andy Owens, executive director of Iowa City Pride.
House File 856, a bill signed into Iowa law on May 27, prohibits public entities from engaging in certain activities relating to diversity, equity, and inclusion. The new law also prohibits any state organization from attempting to promote a policy or activity that references unconscious or implicit bias, cultural appropriation, transgender ideology, group marginalization, anti-racism and many other related concepts.
Owens says the dismantling of diversity, equity and inclusion on a state and federal level has had an impact on many young people in need of support. “When offices that are dedicated to support and advocacy disappear, then resources become more scarce,” he said. “That hurts.”
Legislation targeted the LGBTQ+ community
Another bill, House File 51, targeted drag shows, defined as shows in which a performer “exhibits a gender identity that is different than the performer’s gender assigned at birth.” Initially, the bill provided that anyone who brought a minor to one of the performances could be charged with a felony punishable by up to five years in prison. The bill was later revised to include an “obscene performance” definition and to make it a misdemeanor offense to take a minor aged 13 or younger to one of the performances.
Owens says in its original form the bill was “not an easy pill to swallow” and sparked fears that the organization would not be allowed to have outdoor drag performers during the festival. However, due to revisions in the bill’s final language, Iowa City Pride will proceed as planned. 
Iowa City Pride is one of the oldest Pride organizations in the country, founded just a year after the Stonewall riots in 1969. Owens said this is a “challenging” time for Iowans on the LGBTQ+ spectrum, especially trans individuals. However, he added, these times also provide “an opportunity for us to recalibrate” and maximize support. He said Pride organizations are “working even harder” to stage more events, support the community and work with other Pride organizations and advocacy groups throughout the state.
Mullins said Capital City Pride has also tried to partner with other organizations, such as lobbyists and legislative organizations — at least to the extent they can, given CCP’s status as a non-profit organization. As part of its work, CCP is connecting isolated individuals to mental health services and community organizations “in the midst of these attacks.”
Owens said he feels anti-LGBTQ+ sentiment and protest have been “drowned out by the voices of people who are supportive.” He says this year’s Pride festival is “shaping up to be the biggest one” Iowa City has ever had. Additionally, ICP has started an unofficial partnership with Coralville to expand their Pride organization and expand their community’s work beyond Iowa City.
When asked how the community can support their work, both Mullins and Owens said the same thing: show up and donate. As nonprofit organizations, much of CCP’s and ICP’s revenue consists of donations — but both organizations stress the importance of being present for Pride events. Mullins also suggests that people check in on friends and family who are members of the community to ensure everyone feels connected.
The Capital City Pridefest has events all month. The festival this weekend provides a family and youth zone for children, a teen zone, a pet pageant for “four-legged friends,” and a “Pride Ride” bike ride for members of the Iowa cycling community. 
The Iowa City Pride festival will take place on June 21 from noon to 10 p.m.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Capital-City-Pride-event.jpg,,,2025-06-06 11:19:21.057745

Activist groups, including GR Rapid Response to ICE and Movimiento Cosecha GR, say they quickly mobilized through social media, with members showing up outside the Intensive Supervision Appearance Program office to let new arrivals who were showing up for appointments know about the ICE presence, while others entered the office to warn people waiting inside.
“People who show up for check-ins were being taken anyway. This is what we’ve come to. We need to do much more to help the affected community. Still, I’m hopeful that over time, the number of people helping will increase,” Ivan Diaz, a former Kent County commissioner and candidate for Michigan senate, said in a text statement.

The arrests are just the latest by federal agents in Michigan that continue to spark concern among community members and activist groups of the increasing intensity and sweep of federal actions against the immigrant community.
Restricting legal status
Since the start of the current administration, the Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, protections for immigrants and humanitarian paroles are in danger of being removed from hundreds of thousands of foreign individuals.
Christine Sauve, from the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center, told Michigan Advance that it is uncertain how many members of the community across Michigan currently live under either TPS or humanitarian parole.
“There are currently 31,500 cases pending in Detroit’s immigration court, and the majority of those cases involve individuals with parole. These individuals deserve to have their case heard and their day in court, especially if they fear persecution in their country of origin,” Sauve said.
On Monday, May 19, the U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way, at least for now, for the Trump administration to end Temporary Protected Status for 350,000 Venezuelans who arrived in the United States in 2023.
That followed a February decision by the federal government to cut similar extensions for just over half a million Haitians, leaving them vulnerable to losing their jobs and facing deportation after August.
Additionally, by the end of May, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a court order that had protected almost 500,000 Cuban, Haitian, Nicaraguan, and Venezuelans immigrants with temporary legal status through what is referred to as the CHNV program, from losing their humanitarian parole protections, exposing them to possible deportation.
In an X post, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson wrote that the decisions by the federal government are within their legal authority to revoke the temporary status granted to hundreds of thousands during the Biden Administration.
“Biden’s program violated black letter immigration law, incentivized additional illegal immigration,” Jackson wrote.
Sauve did not appear hopeful about the issue being resolved in a timely manner for those facing deportation.
“During this time, current CHNV parolees will not have a legal immigration status. Individuals utilized these legal immigration pathways in good faith, and overnight they have been rendered undocumented, unable to work, and subject to deportation.” Sauve said.
Temporary Protected Status and humanitarian parole are two distinct immigration protection mechanisms. TPS allows qualified nationals already present in the U.S to live and work legally for a specific period, while humanitarian parole, granted on a case-by-case basis, allows certain individuals to enter or remain in the country temporarily. They are given to individuals from countries affected by armed conflict, natural disasters, or who might face persecution.
“Many individuals with parole status have fled dangerous situations in their country of origin and have pending applications for asylum or other immigration benefits that they may be eligible for,” Sauve highlighted. “They have built lives and become part of our Michigan communities. They are our neighbors and co-workers.”

Economic consequences
Another aspect of the mass deportations promised by the federal government is the impact to Michigan’s agricultural economy in which a considerable portion of the working population is undocumented.
In March, days after half a million Haitians found their TPS extension cut, a Michigan food corporation declared their operation would be significantly affected by losing such a large number of employees. Clemens Food Group in Coldwater employs around 400 Haitian TPS holders as its workforce.
According to a report by the American Immigration Council, based on 2022 data and published in 2024, TPS holders have contributed positively to Michigan industries and paid a significant amount of taxes in the U.S.
“Forcing them to leave the country not only risks putting these individuals in danger, but also threatens to significantly disrupt local economies,” the report stated.
The council says TPS holders across the state make significant contributions to both public coffers and the private economy, including earning $57.9 million in household income, which translates into $5.2 million in state and local taxes paid, $6.7 million in federal taxes paid.
“The end of TPS and parole designations is devastating for our clients and their families, but also for their families, workplaces, and communities across Michigan,” Sauve said. “These programs are lifelines for vulnerable individuals and should not be cruelly ended prematurely, while immigration cases are still pending or conditions are still not safe for individuals to return.”

(Photo by Julie O'Donoghue/Louisiana Illuminator)The Louisiana Legislature is advancing legislation that would allow politicians to spend their campaign funds on a broader group of expenses, including country club memberships and gym fees, while providing less transparency about who provided the money. 

House Republican Caucus Chairman Mark Wright, R-Covington, is the sponsor of House Bill 693 and said several elected officials and campaign finance experts had input on the proposal. 

The 101-page legislation makes “little to no change in substantive law” and mostly brings “practices that have been followed for decades” into the state code, Wright said at a Senate and Governmental Affairs Committee meeting Wednesday.

Louisiana’s Ethics Administration David Bordelon, who is in charge of enforcing the state’s campaign finance laws, had a different take. While the legislation reinforces some of the state ethics board’s guidance on campaign finance, it also “undoes” previous instruction the board has issued about political spending, he said at the same meeting. 
Republican Gov. Jeff Landry is the driving force behind this massive campaign finance rewrite. Two private attorneys for Landry, Stephen Gelé and Charles Spies, helped draft the proposal. 

Gelé and Spies are representing the governor in charges he faces from the ethics board over failing to disclose trips he took on a political donor’s private plane to Hawaii in 2021. That case isn’t affected by Wright’s legislation. 

Gele said the bill is meant to correct over-enforcement of campaign finance laws. The ethics board’s aggressive posture has impeded on the public’s right to free speech and political expression, he said. 

“That right is burdened when you have to pay lawyers and accountants significant amounts of money to make sure you are complying with the law or to fight ethics complaints over the law,” Gele told lawmakers in the committee hearing.

Landry, as governor, stands to benefit more from the loosening of campaign finance restrictions than any other elected official in the state. He has more money in his campaign accounts, and his reelection campaign in 2027 will likely be the most expensive. 

Wright’s legislation makes it easier for politicians to raise money and curbs existing public disclosure of that fundraising. It also explicitly permits politicians to spend their campaign cash on expenses the ethics board has been scrutinizing.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 
Spending more freely

As one example, the bill would enshrine the right to spend campaign money on “events related to the Mardi Gras celebration in Washington D.C.,” a five-day celebration that takes place every year in January. Lawmakers have complained in recent months that the ethics board was questioning their Washington Mardi Gras expenses. But who the board might be scrutinizing hasn’t been disclosed publicly because its investigations are confidential. 

Senate committee members pushed back on other carve outs for campaign spending in the bill. On Wednesday, the committee removed a provision that would have allowed political funds to go toward paying parts of candidates’ home mortgages and utility bills. 
They also tweaked language in the bill permitting politicians to cover their country club dues, gym memberships and Louisiana Mardi Gras krewe fees with campaign funds. 

The Senate committee replaced the words “country club” and “health club” with “private club” in the legislation. They also added a clause requiring politicians who want to use their money for club memberships to produce “a preponderance of evidence that the expense was not for personal use.” 

This means dues for country clubs, gyms and Mardi Gras krewes could still be covered with campaign cash, but the politician might be asked to justify the expense. 

“Be very careful about using campaign funds for subsidizing your lifestyle,” said Sen. Greg Miller, R-Norco, who offered the amendment at the committee meeting. “I don’t think we want to encourage that.”SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE

Less disclosure on campaign spending

While allowing candidates to spend more freely, the bill includes provisions that would lessen the amount of information available to the public about political donations and spending. 

Wright’s legislation raises the dollar-amount threshold at which a political donation or expense has to be included on a public campaign finance report more than 20 times. 
For example, the current law requires campaign contributions and expenditures that are over $200 and given within 20 days ahead of an election to be reported on a public campaign finance report within 48 hours. The proposed law would increase that threshold to $5,000. 
Individuals who are not political candidates or explicitly with a political committee could also spend money on an election without disclosing contributions they accepted for the politicking under the legislation.

These nontraditional political campaigns would also only have to disclose campaign spending if it was over $1,000 and included “express advocacy.” In the bill, “express advocacy” is defined as political communication that features phrases like “vote for” and “defeat” or that includes the candidate’s name and the office they are seeking. 
More subtle campaign expenditures – those that don’t mention an election or involve public advertising – wouldn’t have to be disclosed by sources that aren’t overtly political. 
Initially, this legislation also eliminated all campaign finance reporting requirements for ballot proposition campaigns, such as state constitutional amendments and tax millages. Wright backed off those changes when they proved unpopular.
The bill needs at least three more votes to pass, including from the full House and Senate. Those must be taken before the legislative session ends Thursday.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_20200623_085452-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-06 11:19:21.057745

(Grace Hills/Kansas Reflector)DOVER — A recreation of a TARDIS — the blue British police box and time-traveling spaceship from “Doctor Who” — sits on a Kansas prairie with one purpose: fostering connection, both with oneself and with others.
Other art installations along a walking path in Laura Mead and Dave Kendall’s backyard in Dover form a meditative journey and, like their well-attended virtual town hall in February for an absent U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran, represent the couple’s mission to reignite dialogue.
There are a few other literal and figurative bells and whistles — the TARDIS leads to an artistic interpretation of the spaceship, complete with a console, for example.

Mead hears a common response to their work: “I feel less alone.”
“People are longing to feel connected. They’re longing to feel a part of something, and shared values,” Mead said. “As we become more isolated in these bubbles, it becomes harder to even talk to people who think differently. It’s hard to find them.” 
The virtual town hall they hosted lasted two and a half hours, which signaled to them that Kansans are looking for a space to talk. As a next step, they’re producing a forthcoming podcast about how government changes affect people’s lives. At the town hall, both Republicans and Democrats shared their lived experiences.
Mead sees the value of diverse opinions and perspectives reflected back in the prairie — but also the harm of negativity.
During a walk through the prairie, she pointed to a small patch of land with about a dozen types of plants. Farther down the path, closer to the highway and before the art installations, an invasive species had taken over a stretch. The couple consulted with specialists and sprayed the grass with chemicals, which stopped the spread.
  The brown patches show where an invasive species began to take over and was killed with chemicals, turning the grass brown. (Grace Hills/Kansas Reflector)
“This just blows my mind,” Mead said. “There are seed banks underground where these seeds can last for 50 or more years. And if the conditions are right, they just bloom. And unfortunately, metaphorically, I think the conditions are right right now for some of the less established parts of human nature to bloom.”
Their property is a registered agritourism site, and they offer free appointments to walk the trails. Mead has seen people who were initially resistant to the walk, usually brought there by an eager partner, return more connected with themselves. 
Mead gestured toward a white bench nestled between two trees. She recalled an older man who had been unsure about joining the walk but was eventually persuaded by his wife. Mead said the man sat on the bench for about 30 minutes and upon return shared that he had been able to truly listen to himself. 
“In this liminal space we’re in, there’s an opportunity for some of our best qualities to bloom,” Mead said. “I think there is a basic human goodness. And if we can create the right environment, that will arise.”
Kendall, who has written opinion columns for Kansas Reflector, grew up on a Kansas farm. After some time in California, he returned. Mead grew up in Vermont, then moved to the prairie — a part of the world where both Kendall and Mead feel a connection. Kendall is especially worried about the Trump administration’s approach to climate change. 
“You can’t care about the climate until you’re in it,” Kendall said.
  Dave Kendall believes a connection with nature can foster better climate change policy. (Grace Hills/Kansas Reflector)
They believe stability, both emotional and political, can be achieved through connection. Their forthcoming podcast series will provide a platform where people from all backgrounds can answer the questions: How have changes in the federal government affected your life? What kind of America do you want to live in? What is important to you?
“This dehumanizing and othering is a difficult thing for people. It makes me unpopular in some circles, but we can’t other even the people that are following the policies of this administration,” Mead said, referring to President Donald Trump. “We can disagree, which I do.”
Mead said that connection has allowed her to see that people on the other side of her politically are wanting safety, security, and respect.
The couple run Prairie Hollow Productions, a documentary production company, for which they interviewed former Republican U.S. Sen. Nancy Kassebaum. 
“I learn every time I talk to Senator Kassebaum, because she’s intelligent. She’s thoughtful. Even if we don’t necessarily agree with certain budget items or whatever, I like that kind of exchange with people. It’s healthy,” Mead said. “So my hope is that our society will deescalate some of this vitriol, deescalate some of this othering and find a way to talk again.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TARDIS-and-Laura-Mead--1024x576.jpg,,,2025-06-06 11:19:21.057745

Hruska Federal Courthouse in Omaha, where the Eighth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals held its hearing on the pipeline cases on Nov. 20, 2024. (Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)A federal appeals court on Thursday upheld lower court decisions barring counties from imposing safety standards on a pipeline subject to federal safety standards.
The cases involved Summit Carbon Solutions, the company proposing to build a carbon sequestration pipeline through Iowa and ending in North Dakota, and county supervisors from both Story and Shelby counties in Iowa.
Summit sued the counties in 2022 for enacting ordinances that required county-specific setback requirements and other regulations the company argued were preempted by federal pipeline safety laws.
A federal judge ruled in favor of Summit in Dec. 2023 and issued permanent injunctions, stopping the counties from enforcing the regulations, which would have impacted the carbon sequestration pipeline and other pipelines.
The county supervisors appealed the decision and presented oral arguments in November 2024 to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. The counties argued that local land use and zoning regulations are not “preempted standards” under the Pipeline Safety Act.
Writing for the appeals court, U.S. Circuit Judge Duane Benton wrote that the county ordinances “focus” on safety and “repeatedly” mention safety risks associated with the pipeline, which “undermines” the Pipeline Safety Act’s goal of preempting state regulations on safety.
“This holding does not prohibit local governments from considering safety, nor prevent them from enacting all zoning ordinances, as the counties suggest,” Benton said in the opinion. “This court emphasizes the distinction between safety standards — which the PSA preempts — and safety considerations — which the PSA does not preempt.”
The county ordinances also included emergency response requirements and abandonment provisions which the court ruled were also preempted by federal regulations.

Circuit Judge Jane Kelly, however, dissented on those elements and wrote she does not believe that PSA preempts setback and abandonment provisions. Kelly said that while the counties’ setback requirements are “animated in part by safety considerations” they do not have the “direct and substantial” effect on safety that is reserved for federal regulation.
Kelly also wrote that per her understanding, the Pipeline Safety Act “does not cover pipelines that have been abandoned” and therefore the Shelby County abandonment provision is not “expressly preempted.”
The court affirmed the lower court’s decision in both cases, but ordered the federal court for the Southern District of Iowa to reconsider an additional ordinance that’s at issue in the Story County case.
Sabrina Zenor, on behalf of Summit Carbon Solutions, said the ruling “confirms” pipeline safety regulation set by the federal government and the Iowa Utilities Commission’s role in route and permit decisions.
“This supports a consistent, lawful permitting process for critical infrastructure projects like ours,” Zenor said in a statement.
A press release from Bold Alliance, a group representing landowners opposed to the pipeline project, called the order an “anti-local government ruling” and said the parties involved in the case are examining their “legal and legislative options” in response to the decision.
“The landowners, impacted community members, county and state elected officials who worked for months or years to develop ordinances and state regulations are witnessing their hard-won efforts to enact common sense protections for their communities stripped away by judicial fiat,” the statement read.

The study conducted by nonprofit research group, the Urban Institute, analyzed ways Fairfield County could benefit economically by closing racial gaps.
Doing so would result in more than $15 billion in revenue for the county’s economy, according to Tina Stacy, principal research associate with the Urban Institute. The revenue is estimated based on the change in county gross domestic product.
“Business, philanthropy, local and state governments and the general public can all play a role in shrinking these gaps and benefiting the larger community. So really, you know, I think this shows that economic growth is not a zero sum game, right? We all benefit when gaps are closed and everyone thrives.”
The report focused on five main aspects of a community. They were education, wealth-building, health and well-being, housing and workforce development.
Looking for ways to construct housing quicker, cheaper and easier to build will make it more affordable for people to live in Fairfield County, Stacy said.
“Any way we can increase that supply across the income distribution is going to help reduce those inequities,” Stacy said.
If Black and Latino residents in Fairfield County had the same education opportunities and salaries as their white neighbors, it would also result in 33,000 more homeowners in the area, Stacy said.
Connecticut is currently employing several programs that the report commends for increasing homeownership. However, the study found there’s more to be done, including providing down payment assistance for first-generation homeowners.
“Their parents weren’t able to purchase a home, and we know from our history of housing in the U.S. that that kind of barrier can be passed down from generation to generation,” Stacy said. “Being able to break that barrier and allow first-generation home buyers to purchase a home and build up that savings and equity can really go a long way towards reducing these inequities.”
Another recommendation was parking reform.
Traditionally, developers looking to build housing complexes were required to include a parking lot for residents’ vehicles. This can be a barrier to development in communities with few available plots or lot size requirements.
Under newly-passed state legislation, developers are no longer required to include on-site parking, opening up development opportunities and pushing for more biking and walking.
The study was done in collaboration with Fairfield County’s Community Foundation and DataHaven, along with an advisory board of leaders from Fairfield County in the public, private, philanthropic and nonprofit sectors.
Mendi Blue Paca, president of Fairfield County’s Community Foundation, said the report paints a clear picture of what is possible for the area.
“When we lift up everyone, we all rise,” said Blue Paca. “This isn’t just the right thing to do, it’s the smart thing to do. The question isn’t whether we can afford to make these investments. It’s whether we can afford not to.”

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Medical experts are dismayed over a federal report’s claim that kids are overprescribed asthma medications, saying it minimizes how many lives the drugs save.
Safe treatment protocols for asthma management have been carefully studied over the years, said Dr. Perry Sheffield, a pediatrician and professor at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.
“The federal government actually has some really beautiful and clear guidelines and strategies, and things that are vetted by and carefully edited by many experts in the field,” said Sheffield, who co-directs a region of the federally funded Pediatric Environmental Health Specialty Units that serves New Jersey, New York, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
Asthma affects more than 4.6 million American children, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It’s one of the most common long-term diseases in U.S. children.
The Make America Healthy Again Commission report released in late May, parts of which have been widely criticized, alleges that American children are on too much medication of various kinds, including asthma treatments.
Experts worry that the administration will set policy based on the assessment, dissuading insurers from covering asthma prescriptions. They also say that the report’s assertions could worsen disparities that affect children’s access to those medications and undermine years of research around the drugs.
Blue Cross Blue Shield now requires prior approval for severe asthma drugs in some states

The MAHA commission has until August to release a strategy based on the findings in the report.
Black and Indigenous children as well as those living in inner cities or in lower-income households are among those with the highest rates of asthma. Pollution disproportionately shrouds communities of color and can be a trigger that exacerbates the disease.
The report’s message could heighten those disparities, said Dr. Elizabeth Matsui, a University of Texas at Austin professor and a past chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ Section on Allergy and Immunology.
“One thing that has been very clear is that kids of color are less likely to be appropriately managed in terms of their asthma medication management,” she said. “So a message of overprescription that is simply not supported by the evidence also could potentially exacerbate already-existing racial and ethnic disparities in asthma that we have really not made much headway on.”
The commission’s claims
The report touches on childhood prediabetes, obesity and mental health. However, firearm injuries — the leading cause of death for children and teens in 2020 and 2021, according to the CDC — weren’t mentioned.
The 70-page report from the commission, chaired by Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr., claims four main issues are the drivers behind childhood chronic disease: poor diet, aggregation of environmental chemicals, lack of physical activity and chronic stress, and “overmedicalization.”
Matsui and other experts said the report’s use of that word is “problematic.”
“The implication could be, unfortunately, that when a child has asthma — so, they have coughing, chest tightness, wheezing — that that is not really a disease,” said Matsui. “We know for a fact that that’s a disease, and we know that it is quite treatable, quite controllable, and that it has profound impacts on the child’s day-to-day life.”
Other scientists have similarly criticized the report, saying it makes sweeping and misleading generalizations about children’s health without sufficient evidence. The White House corrected the report after nonprofit news outlet NOTUS found that it cited studies that didn’t exist.




The implication could be, unfortunately, that when a child has asthma … that that is not really a disease. We know for a fact that that’s a disease.


– Dr. Elizabeth Matsui, University of Texas at Austin professor



When it comes to asthma, the report says, “Asthma controller prescriptions increased 30% from 1999-2008.” That sentence originally cited a broken link to a study from 2011; the link was later replaced. Controller meds include inhalers.
The MAHA report also claims that “There is evidence of overprescription of oral corticosteroids for mild cases of asthma.” The original version of the report listed estimated percentages of oral corticosteroids overuse, citing a nonexistent study. The wording was changed and the citation was later replaced with a link to a 2017 study by pediatric pulmonologist Dr. Harold Farber.
The study was not a randomized controlled trial, which increases reliability. Farber  told NOTUS that the report made an “overgeneralization” of his research. Stateline also reached out to Farber, whose public relations team declined an interview request.
Oral corticosteroids are liquid or tablet medications used to reduce inflammation for conditions including allergies, asthma, arthritis and Crohn’s disease. For asthma, they’re used to treat severe flare-up episodes. The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America says the medications have been shown to reduce emergency room visits and hospitalizations, and that while they do come with risk of side effects, they’re mostly used in acute flare-ups. And while rare, asthma-related deaths in kids do occur, and are often preventable.
“Asthma medications, including oral steroids, are lifesaving,” said Dr. Elizabeth Friedman, a pediatrician at Children’s Mercy Kansas City. “I believe that physicians, not politicians, are best equipped and most effectively trained to make the determination of whether or not these medications are needed for our patients.”
Friedman worries that federal characterizations of asthma meds will affect how state Medicaid agencies cover the drugs. When Medicaid coverage changed for a common prescribed inhaler last year, many of her Missouri Medicaid patients were suddenly without the drug. They ended up hospitalized, she said.
Friedman directs Region 7 of the Pediatric Environmental Health Specialty Units, a network of experts that works to address reproductive and children’s environmental health issues. Region 7 provides outreach and education in Iowa, Kansas, Missouri and Nebraska.
She also said she’s concerned that the report is “making a broad, sweeping statement based on one epidemiologic study from one state.”
Increased use
An increase in inhaler prescriptions is not necessarily a bad thing, experts say. It’s a sign that kids are getting their medication.
There has been an increase in inhaler prescriptions, along with a corresponding decrease in the oral corticosteroids, which is what experts would want to see, said Chelsea Langer, bureau chief of the New Mexico Department of Health’s Environmental Health Epidemiology Bureau. She said that means kids are “following their asthma action plans and taking the controller medications to prevent needing the relief or treatment [oral] meds.”
Trump has canceled environmental justice grants. Here’s what communities are losing.

Asthma prevalence has increased over the years, meaning more people need medication, noted Dr. Alan Baptist, division head of Allergy and Clinical Immunology at Henry Ford Health in Michigan.
He said that because steroid tablets come with risk of side effects, it is best to limit them.
But for kids without access to a regular pediatric provider or to health insurance that covers an inhaler, cost can be an obstacle, he said. Fluticasone propionate, an FDA-approved medicine for people 4 and older, costs on average $200 or more for one inhaler without insurance.
“What often happens with kids, and especially kids who are in Medicaid, or who are in an underserved or disadvantaged population, they are not given appropriate asthma controller medication,” said Baptist, who helped write federal guidelines for asthma treatment best practices as part of a National Institutes of Health committee.
Baptist noted that while he was glad to see pollution mentioned in the report as a danger for kids, it’s at odds with the recent cuts to environmental health grants that aimed to address such asthma triggers.
“They’re somewhat cherry-picking some of the data that they’re putting down,” he said. “It says the U.S. government is ‘committed to fostering radical transparency and gold-standard science’ to better understand the potential cumulative impacts of environmental exposure. If that’s what they’re saying, then they should be funding even greater studies that look at the effects.”
Dr. Priya Bansal, an Illinois pediatrician and past president of the Illinois Society of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology, said she’s concerned the report doesn’t define mild, moderate or severe asthma to differentiate the different best-practice treatment plans.
Bansal also said she worries that federal officials’ characterization of an FDA-approved drug will lead to insurance companies refusing to cover inhalers or oral steroids for her patients who rely on them.
“I’m going to be worried about coverage for my asthmatics,” she said. “The question is, what’s the next move that they’re going to make? If they think that, are they going to now say, ‘Hey, we’re not going to cover inhalers for mild asthmatics’?”

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Cruise ship passengers in Alaska’s capital city, visitors to the Alaska State Capitol and residents could be greeted by officials in hazmat suits next week as the city hosts a large-scale military exercise.
“Operation ORCA” will test the readiness of first responders and members of the Alaska National Guard for a terrorist attack that involves chemical, biological, nuclear or explosive weapons, said Lt. Col. Brett Haker, commander of the 103rd Civil Support Team, which is putting on the exercise.
Haker said ORCA is held every other year in Alaska, but this is the first time for Alaska’s capital city and for the State Capitol itself, where they will stage a scenario involving an attack by fictitious Russia-based terrorists. 
Streets on three sides of the Capitol building will be closed to traffic for three days, June 9, 10 and 12, according to the Juneau Police Department. The Capitol itself will remain open to the public during the exercise.
Haker said some parts of the scenario will involve a houseboat at or near Juneau’s cruise ship docks, which welcome more than 1 million visitors per year.
“They will see us in our hazmat suits. We will have signs up, and ultimately, they’ll see us entering and exiting. We’ll have our vehicles — they are all like a blue Air Force color. They look civilian, but they all have lights on, and they look like, like an emergency vehicle,” he said.
The exercise will involve about 100 people, he said, including members of the FBI, U.S. Border Patrol, the U.S. Coast Guard, local police and fire departments, and local governments including the Tlingit and Haida Central Council. 
Some members of the National Guard from other states will also participate, and large military cargo planes will be involved.
Haker credited his operations officer, Capt. Kyle Rehberg, for organizing much of the exercise but said it will also be a test of organization for everyone involved. 
“Ultimately, the main purpose is to improve interoperability, so that we are all speaking the same language when we work with all these additional first responders … and we have these complex problem sets that we have to work through collectively,” he said.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/250517-Alaska-Capitol-copy-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-06 10:08:05.673973

SPRINGFIELD — A bill that would lift long-standing restrictions on small poultry farmers in Illinois, reducing red tape and transforming the way local farmers process and sell their products, is heading to the governor.

Under a measure dubbed the “chicken bill,” farmers who process fewer than 7,500 birds annually would be exempt from state and federal inspections of their poultry operations or from having to send birds to USDA-approved processing facilities — an increase from the previous 5,000-bird threshold. The change, part of an update to the Illinois Meat and Poultry Inspection Act, also allows these farmers to sell their poultry beyond their own farms — including at farmers markets, roadside stands and through delivery — a major shift from earlier restrictions.

""This is important for our small farmers to be able to get their product to the community, and that's what this is all about,"" said Sen. Sally Turner, R-Beason, who co-sponsored the bill. The Illinois House voted 116-0 on Friday, May 30, to approve House Bill 2196, and the Senate passed it unanimously on May 22.

Turner represents a largely rural district spanning 10 counties. ""Farmers in my community, especially small farmers, are important to me, personally, but also to our whole district,"" she said.

State Rep. Charlie Meier, R-Okawville, a farmer himself, said the legislation provides local agriculture with a much-needed boost.

""We always want to get the freshest product to the consumer. We want them to know where it came from,"" Meier said. ""So what's better than meeting the farmer who's raised those chickens, knowing where they're coming from? They're fresh, and you're getting a good, healthy product.""

Initially, the bill faced pushback from some public health groups, which argued for stricter labeling and packaging rules to ensure the safety of poultry products for consumption.

The revised bill includes mandated temperature controls during storage, transportation, shipping and delivery. Processed poultry must be packaged in sealed, leak-proof containers to prevent contamination. Each package must also be clearly labeled with the farm’s name and address, the product name, net weight and a statement indicating that the poultry was processed under exemption and not inspected by state or federal authorities.

""Everything you see in that bill was done by some of the public health coalitions,"" Michael Desmedt, interim director of public health for DuPage County, said. ""I think our voices were heard, and they understood our concerns.’’

Ed Dubrick, a poultry farmer and policy organizer with the Illinois Stewardship Alliance, a nonprofit organization that advocates for sustainable agriculture, said he went around the state and asked livestock farmers what they needed to help with the processing of their animals.

Dubrick said the current exemption was too limiting because farmers could only sell “on or from the farm.”

""Expecting someone to come to the farm every time they want some chicken just really isn't realistic,"" he said. ""But if we can bring it to a farmers market where the consumers are, that adds an opportunity.""

Illinois is one of the few states without more flexible on-farm poultry processing exemptions, Dubrick said.

“In many states — about 40 — you’re allowed to process up to 20,000 birds under similar rules. We’re only asking for 7,500,” he said.

Farmers will benefit, according to Dubrick.

""It gives them the opportunity to drive both their production and their profits on their farms,"" he said

For consumers, he said, ""I think you'll see an increase in the availability of local poultry, and I don't think you'll see any difference in food quality or safety. Farmers are proud of their product. They're not going to put their name, their reputation, their business on the line.""

Anna Morrell, co-owner of The Little Farm at Weldon Springs in Clinton, said the bill could make it more viable for her and her husband to scale up their small operation, which began in 2020.



[caption id=""attachment_70009"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1140""] Anna Murrell, owner of “The Little Farm” holds her 6-week-old goose. (Medill Illinois News Bureau photo by Grace Friedman)[/caption]



“This basically just opens up another avenue for getting poultry processed with lower overhead and gives us an avenue of sales into farmers markets,"" Morrell said. ""We're currently not operating under the poultry exemption. We take our meat to USDA-inspected facilities, but there are very few processors in Illinois that process poultry.""

Morrell said the current law had made it more challenging for poultry farmers in Illinois to sell their products; this bill would decrease the number of miles farmers have to travel to get their poultry processed.

If signed, Legislators and advocates say the bill represents a rare collaboration between producers, public health departments and state lawmakers.

""And let's see if we can't keep a few more farm families on the farm and give kids another chance at a future on the farm,” Meier said.

Tim Walz speaks with Minnesota Reformer Editor in Chief Patrick Coolican in front of States Newsroom leaders and reporters Thursday, June 5, 2025 at the Royal Sonesta in downtown Minneapolis. (Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)MINNEAPOLIS — Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Thursday said that communication between states and the federal government under the second Trump administration “is nonexistent,” opening the door to catastrophe in the case of a natural disaster or other emergency.
Walz, during an interview with Reformer editor Patrick Coolican at a States Newsroom conference in Minneapolis, said that the Trump administration is unprepared for the next disaster — like another global pandemic — and that leaves states particularly vulnerable.
“The flow of information has been disrupted between the states and the federal government, and we just can’t get answers … No one is allowed to talk to us, and that’s really problematic,” Walz said.
The Minnesota governor said the silence from the feds differs from the first Trump administration. At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Walz said then-Vice President Mike Pence would call him every few weeks to check in to see what he needed. He said he sensed Pence would call in “under the radar, so he didn’t draw anybody’s attention.”
“There were a lot of great people inside the first Trump administration that, in spite of the president, were doing good work,” Walz said.
Walz said one of his biggest fears is a cybersecurity attack. The Trump administration has cut millions of dollars for several cyber security initiatives and slashed jobs from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which helps protect the nation’s critical infrastructure.
Walz discussed the role of the states in opposing the Trump administration’s agenda — particularly on immigration — and the Democratic Party’s current malaise.
Minnesota is increasingly reliant on immigrants, who are needed to fill jobs being vacated by an aging workforce. “There’s not a cow in Minnesota that’s not being milked by an immigrant,” he said. Walz said Minnesota would not be commandeered into enforcing immigration law, which he said is a federal duty.
Walz repeated a spiel he’s given around the country, including at a recent Democratic Party event in South Carolina, which has traditionally been early on the presidential primary calendar, fueling speculation that he is considering a presidential run.
He said he’s not running, but merely using his megaphone to help fill a vacuum left by a Democratic Party in disarray.
The governor urged Democrats to figure out how to become the party of the working class again and said Democrats need to “fill all the lanes” in the media environment to reach voters.
“I still have come to the conclusion that Trump fills so much space that you’ve got to fill all these new spaces. Do I think if we would have gone on, you know, Joe Rogan, would we have won? I doubt that, but I also don’t think it hurts,” Walz said. “If your message is good, you want to get out there.”
Walz backed the 2005-06 idea of former DNC Chair Howard Dean and his “50 State Project,” which sought to reach voters in areas not traditionally associated with Democrats.
“We’re probably never going to win Idaho, but … you got to be out there for it,” Walz said.
Walz said Democrats should rotate where they hold the early primary to reach more voters, which may not endear him to Democrats in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, the traditional early states that have long jealously guarded their first in the nation status.
When asked which state should be the first to hold the primary, Walz deadpanned “Minnesota.”

More intra-government disagreement and possible litigation over the MBTA Communities housing law are again on the table in Milton as a special Town Meeting creeps closer.
The post Milton complies with the MBTA Communities law, with an asterisk appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","AFTER ALMOST TWO years of contentious back-and-forth over whether to abide by the MBTA Communities housing law, Milton has submitted a plan to the state that lays out a path to compliance. But the next two weeks will be a bumpy ride. In the 10 days before Town Meeting voters may decide to give their stamp of approval or reject two plans to up-zone parts of Milton, town officials may decide to square up for another legal battle. While elected officials ponder litigation, several Milton residents beat them to it with a new lawsuit against the state housing office. The affluent Boston suburb was the original flashpoint over a 2021 law that requires cities and towns near public transit to create multifamily districts of reasonable size. The vast majority – 133 out of the 177 MBTA Communities – now have zoning that meets the state requirements or have submitted a plan to do so. Thirty-five small towns adjacent to public transit have an end-of-year deadline to submit a plan, and just a few municipalities remain openly defiant as their mid-July deadline approaches. Milton’s stance remains mercurial and the town itself tightly divided. Though the planning board and voters at Town Meeting approved a plan in 2023, 54 percent of voters tossed the rezoning plan by special referendum in early 2024, prompting the state attorney general to sue the town to force compliance. After the Supreme Judicial Court ruled in January that the law is enforceable and mandatory, town officials pressed forward with efforts to rezone, and did land on an option that would meet state requirements while easing off on some of the areas targeted for the most density under the earlier plan.  In the past month, however, the town’s journey involved several sharp pivots. On May 8, the planning board voted to submit two plans to the warrant committee that approves items to be put before Town Meeting voters for its special June 16 meeting.  One would treat the town as an “adjacent community” and another as a “rapid transit community,” the latter of which is how the state defines Milton.  Milton is 0.95 miles from the Ashmont MBTA station and within 5 miles of a commuter rail line. Even though the Mattapan High-Speed Trolley system that extends from the end of the Red Line subway line passes through its borders, many in the town disagree over whether Milton is more like the communities that are “adjacent” to public transit rather than directly served by it. Because the state housing office designated Milton as a rapid transit community, the town must rezone for a potential addition of 25 percent of their total current units. If it were considered adjacent, the obligation would drop to 10 percent. But five days after deciding to submit the two plans, the planning board reversed itself and voted not to include the “rapid transit community” plan on the Town Meeting warrant. According to the Milton Times, the Planning Board voted 4 to 1 to pull back the 25 percent plan because members still thought Milton was being treated unfairly and were swayed by state Sen. Bill Driscoll’s statements that a compromise with the state can still be reached before the next deadline for compliance on July 14.  Indignant residents in favor of rezoning gathered the necessary signatures for a citizen’s petition to include the plan on the warrant. Town Meeting member Karen Friedman-Hanna, who was among those who organized the citizen’s petition drive, told the town warrant committee in a meeting this week that she “received more emails and calls than I’ve ever gotten in my 30 years of being a town meeting member. Many of them were very upset that the planning board was continuing to promote only an illegal and costly 10 percent plan despite many compromises being made when this newer version of the compliant plan was developed by the planning board.” With the petition in hand, the town’s Select Board authorized the town administrator, Nicholas Milano, to submit an action plan and send a letter to the Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities. The town had two articles on the warrant to “establish multi-family overlay districts related to the MBTA Communities Act,” he wrote in the letter – one from the planning board for the 10 percent rezoning, and one by citizen’s petition for the 25 percent rezoning. He noted a separate East Milton Square mixed-use overlay district – a different warrant article and proposed zoning bylaw – as evidence of the Town’s ongoing work on mixed-use growth unrelated to the MBTA Communities law.In the action plan, which the state approved to bring the town into interim compliance, Milano noted that a continuing area of concern for the town is the long-term quality of the Mattapan Trolley.   “The Town has concerns about the capacity of the Mattapan Trolley and its ability to absorb new riders and achieve the goal of taking cars off the road,” he said. It is also worried about the state’s “commitment” to the Mattapan Trolley Transformation Project to replace the iconic but not terribly speedy orange trolley cars along the line – a project which is now in its eighth year. “Those improvements will be crucial to ensuring the trolley is able to support the potential new density that a [MBTA Communities] district will create,” Milano wrote. “While the MBTA has made periodic announcements about this project, there is no indication that it continues to move forward in any capacity.” As May wound to a close, 16 Milton residents filed a lawsuit in Norfolk County Superior Court as taxpayers against the Commonwealth and its housing office, describing a “one-sided campaign of aggressive enforcement through threats, intimidation, coercion, and punishment.” This adds Milton – or at least some of its residents – to the list of towns that have sued the state separately since late February, looking for a court declaration that the MBTA Communities law was an unconstitutional “unfunded mandate” and they should be excused from compliance until the state properly funds the impacts of the rezoning effort. Marshfield, Middleborough, Hanson, Halifax, Weston, Duxbury, Carver, and Wilmington have sued. Middleborough dropped its suit in late March, reaching an agreement with the state, which accepted a new expanded smart-growth district proposed to town voters to count towards compliance with the MBTA Communities law. Broadly speaking, laws that impose direct service or cost obligations on municipalities must be paired with funding to cover that cost. In the 2021 economic development bill, the Legislature created the concept of MBTA Communities and the basic rezoning requirements but left it up to the state housing office to determine the rules for compliance. No funding mechanism was included at the time. Halifax “is required to incur significant costs to upgrade its infrastructure and provide services in order to comply” with the housing law, it argued in its complaint filed on May 8. This, in the assessment of the state auditor’s office that kicked off another round of back-and-forth between the state and municipalities, counts as an unfunded mandate. “I think the SJC decision clearly answered the question about whether it was constitutional and answers the question about whether the attorney general has the authority to enforce the law,” Secretary Ed Augustus, of the housing office, said on Thursday. The auditor’s office introduced an additional level of explanation needed for each MBTA Community, he said. “Some towns feel like they agree with the auditor’s finding and want to go through the court route to get a decision about whether, in fact, this is an unfunded mandate.” Augustus said he’s confident that the attorney general can make the case in court that technical and financial assistance have been provided to every municipality who asked for it to come up with a compliant zoning plan. The Milton taxpayers are seeking an injunction to halt enforcement of the law, and a hearing is scheduled in Norfolk County Superior Court for June 11.  During lengthy Monday and Wednesday meetings, the committee in charge of the Milton warrant agreed to send both the 10 and 25 percent rezoning plans to the voters and discussed the taxpayer lawsuit. Macy Lee, a committee member, said on Wednesday that the multiple cases have been consolidated and the other towns will be coming in for the injunction hearing.  Milton’s planning board will meet on June 12, scheduled to discuss the zoning proposals set to go to Town Meeting four days later. It is expected that possible litigation will again be on the table, depending on the outcome of the prior day’s injunctive relief hearing. The court route is just “part of the process,” Augustus said. “People have options. The real headline is, despite all of these questions – some of which have been answered, some of which will be answered shortly – 75 percent of the communities have done what is necessary and are now opening up the opportunity to build more housing.” The post Milton complies with the MBTA Communities law, with an asterisk appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Mattapan_05.jpg?fit=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-06 10:08:05.673973

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)And then there were two. In late May, Aberdeen businessman and political influencer Toby Doeden entered the race for the Republican nomination for governor of South Dakota. He joins state Speaker of the House Jon Hansen as the only announced candidates, so far, for the nomination. 
Throughout his announcement speech, and sprinkled liberally through his campaign website, are references to Doeden’s support for President Donald Trump. It’s hard to miss the comparisons between the president and the gubernatorial candidate. 
Doeden takes pride, as Trump did in his first campaign, at never having been elected to public office. Doeden, however, knows something about how to get other people elected. Through his Dakota First Action political action committee, he supported a bevy of anti-establishment Republicans who were able to unseat legislative incumbents in the last primary. 
While Doeden sees his lack of electoral experience as a positive, voters always run a risk when they decide to put someone in a position of power who has never been there before. In his first term as president, Trump often seemed befuddled by the finer points of how the federal government works. For Doeden, promising to shake things up in Pierre is the easy part. Harder than the shaking is the governing. 
Doeden joins race for governor with pledge to eliminate property taxes

While he’s shaking things up in Pierre, Doeden has promised to cut spending from a state government budget that he sees as bloated. That made it seem odd when among his first pronouncements as a candidate was the creation of not one but two new state agencies. He has proposed to create the South Dakota Department of External Revenue to find new revenue sources for the state and the South Dakota Department of Government Efficiency, which sounds eerily like Elon Musk’s DOGE.
We can only hope that Doeden’s version of DOGE has a lighter touch than the Trump/Musk version, which is prone to cutting government by sending in a lumberjack to do work that was best suited for a surgeon. Much of DOGE’s work and Trump’s attempts to shrink the federal government have ended up in court battles that haven’t been winners for the president. 
Doeden’s version of his personal history seems to play off the Trump-inspired myth that people who have made a fortune can relate to the problems and challenges faced by the rest of us. Doeden touts his hardscrabble youth, something that Trump never had, as a way to connect with voters. 
Yet Doeden faces the same ironic set of circumstances as Trump, touting personal success that won’t make him subservient to donors all the while that his website welcomes donations. That suggests that somehow candidates like Doeden and Trump are better suited to lead us because they’re rich, yet their wealth doesn’t keep them from asking for our money. 
In his announcement, Doeden railed against career politicians, the likes of which have yet to enter the race for the Republican nomination. Widely speculated as potential candidates are Gov. Larry Rhoden, U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson and Attorney General Marty Jackley. Hansen hails from the same populist wing of the party as Doeden, which runs the risk of them splitting the primary vote from that group. 
It will be Doeden’s challenge to get Republican voters to choose his brand of populism over Hansen’s. He’ll need to do that while getting them to cast aside the established leaders who have devoted their lives to building up government. To be successful, Doeden will have to convince voters that it’s in their best interest to let him tear it all down.

An ambitious proposal that would require fossil fuel polluters to pay for climate disasters caused by the greenhouse gases they emit appears to have stalled in the face of strong opposition from those same fossil fuel polluters.
As CalMatters’ Alejandro Lazo explains, a bill by Assemblymember Dawn Addis would require multinational oil and gas companies to pay for emissions from “the extraction, production, refining, sale, or combustion … of fossil fuels” or other petroleum products such as oil and gas. Though it’s unclear how much these companies would pay, the money would be set aside to fund disaster preparedness and climate efforts, including evacuation planning, building climate-resistant communities, electrifying school buses and more.

Addis, a San Luis Obispo Democrat: “Oil caused the climate crisis, in large part … they lied about it, as they caused the damages, and it’s time for them to come to the table and create more affordability for the very people that they’ve harmed.”

But despite the Los Angeles County wildfires in January mobilizing bill proponents, the measure has sat idle since clearing its most recent committee hearing in April. That same month, another bill that would have allowed victims of wildfires and other climate disasters to sue oil companies for damages died in the Legislature.
Oil and gas companies lobbied strongly against both proposals. Jim Stanley, a spokesman for the Western States Petroleum Association, said Addis’ bill and its twin measure in the Senate are “misguided” and punishes companies “for providing a legal product that was, and remains, critical to our state’s economy.”
Because the bill includes “urgency” provisions, it’s exempted from certain legislative deadlines, including today’s house-of-origin deadline (more on that below). The measure sits before the Legislature as Gov. Gavin Newsom also proposes to reroute money from California’s landmark cap and trade program to pay for Cal Fire operations and the High-Speed Rail project.

CA Legislature vote on labor bills

To keep bills alive for this session, state legislators have until today to advance bills through the house where they were introduced. For some bills related to labor and wage theft, it’s been a mixed bag this week:

Pausing one wage theft bill: Sen. Scott Wiener said Thursday that he is shelving his wage theft bill until January “for further work.” The measure would have enabled workers to recover more money from lost wages through private lawsuits, rather than filing claims through the Labor Commissioner’s Office, which has a severe backlog. The San Francisco Democrat’s proposal stemmed from a CalMatters series probing the state’s wage theft issues.


Penalties for stealing wages: Another bill to hold employers that commit wage theft accountable passed through the Assembly Tuesday. The proposal would require state agencies to deny renewing licenses or permits for employers that have outstanding wage theft claims. Though most Democrats (and two Republicans) approved the measure, Assemblymember Anamarie Ávila Farías of Concord was the only Democrat to vote against it, along with six other Republicans.


Workers’ rights outreach: The Senate on Monday approved a bill that would expand and make permanent an outreach program to educate employees on labor rights and workplace protections. The measure passed along party lines, with all 10 Republicans voting against — though two Democrats abstained from voting, which is the same as voting no.




Safety net to end for CA community colleges

A safety net for struggling California community colleges is set to expire at the end of June, leaving many campuses — particularly in the Bay Area — grappling with difficult cost-cutting measures, write Desmond Meagley and Lylah Schmedel-Permanna of CalMatters’ College Journalism Network.
Since 2018, most community college districts began receiving incremental cost-of-living adjustments to help pay for the rising costs of maintaining buildings, employee benefits and other expenses.
But these adjustments are slated to end on June 30 — and without it, districts must find other ways to close their budget gaps. Some are already feeling the squeeze: Cabrillo College in Santa Cruz, for example, is facing a $5.9 million shortfall and said it would cut 5% of its course offerings and impose a hiring freeze for vacant positions.

California’s climate ‘superfund’ plan may have stalled,Alejandro Lazo,,,,,https://calmatters.org/environment/climate-change/2025/06/climate-superfund-california-legislature-oil/,"Proposed legislation hasn't moved out of the state Assembly or Senate, raising questions about how far California will go in its efforts to make oil and gas companies pay for climate damage.","In summary
Proposed legislation hasn’t moved out of the state Assembly or Senate, raising questions about how far California will go in its efforts to make oil and gas companies pay for climate damage.


In the battle over how to pay for damage wrought by climate change, California lawmakers had an idea: Create a “superfund” that makes big polluters pay.
The Polluters Pay Climate Superfund Act of 2025 would make the world’s largest sources of greenhouse gases from fossil fuels financially responsible for the damage caused by wildfires, droughts and other events exacerbated by the warming climate.
The idea adopts the “Superfund” model — created by Congress in 1980 to clean up the nation’s worst toxic waste sites — and applies it to greenhouse gases, aiming to hold companies financially accountable for emissions that drive climate change. 
New York and Vermont have already enacted similar measures despite massive opposition from the oil and gas industry.
But the proposed California legislation has stalled since April, even as environmental groups — galvanized by the death and destruction of the January Los Angeles wildfires — have made it a top priority.
Identical versions in both legislative houses have sat idle in Assembly and Senate committees despite a full-court press by supporters framing the superfund as a solution to California’s $12 billion budget deficit. The bills passed out of their first committees but have not advanced further. 
“Nobody can afford the kind of financial crisis that the climate crisis has caused,” said Assemblymember Dawn Addis, a Democrat from San Luis Obispo, one of the authors, told CalMatters. “Oil caused the climate crisis, in large part … they lied about it as they caused the damages, and it’s time for them to come to the table and create more affordability for the very people that they’ve harmed.”
The funds would be earmarked for paying for community disaster preparedness, such as evacuation planning and emergency housing, as well as energy efficiency, zero-emission fleets and charging, and natural resource protection, among other projects, according to the bill.
Opposition includes oil companies and major business groups. In addition, despite worsening wildfires and floods, many Californians have been increasingly voicing concern that the state’s climate policies are driving up gas and electricity costs.
“At a time when Californians are struggling with a cost-of-living crisis, these bills will likely result in massive price increases for gasoline, diesel, natural gas, electricity and consumer goods.”JIM STANLEY, WESTERN STATES PETROLEUM ASSN.
Oil and gas industry lobbying has been fierce. Jim Stanley, a spokesman for the Western States Petroleum Association, the industry’s top lobbying group in the West, said in a statement that the measures were “misguided proposals to retroactively punish companies for providing a legal product that was, and remains, critical to our state’s economy.”
He said that “at a time when Californians are struggling with a cost-of-living crisis, these bills will likely result in massive price increases for gasoline, diesel, natural gas, electricity and consumer goods.”
The climate superfund also faces resistance from a powerful ally of Big Oil: California’s State Building and Construction Trades Council, a key union that has repeatedly backed the industry’s positions, as CalMatters has previously reported.
Earlier this year, the council also opposed legislation by state Sen. Scott Wiener, a Democrat from San Francisco, that would have allowed residents to sue oil companies for climate damages.
In April, Keith Dunn, a lobbyist for the trades union, told an Assembly committee that the climate superfund would drive up energy prices, kill middle-class jobs and act as a stealth tax on working families. “The affordability gap is widening,” Dunn told lawmakers. “It’s not by chance, it’s by choice.”
Both measures include “urgency” provisions, which allow them to take effect immediately if passed by a two-thirds vote and signed by the governor. That higher threshold makes them less vulnerable to certain legal challenges and exempts them from the usual legislative deadlines. (Most bills must clear their house of origin by today.)
“There was quite a bit of opposition earlier in the year so we’re continuing those conversations,” Addis said. “We have time to have those conversations.”
The bill would make companies pay for emissions from “the extraction, production, refining, sale, or combustion, including by third parties, of fossil fuels or petroleum products,” which includes oil, gas and coal.
Bill targets multinational corporations 
The bill applies to companies that emit more than a billion metric tons of global emissions from 1990 through 2024 — that means multinational oil and gas corporations. Within three months of the law taking effect, the agency would publish a list of companies that would pay into the fund.
There are no official estimates as to how much companies would pay. The legislation would require the California Environmental Protection Agency to estimate costs from past and projected climate damages to people, governments, ecosystems and infrastructure every five years through 2045, using peer-reviewed science.
“It is imperative that we make polluters that caused a large percentage of the climate crisis pay for the thing that they knowingly caused,” said Maya Golden-Krasner, an attorney with the Climate Law Institute at the Center for Biological Diversity, which has sponsored the California bills. “They’ve known that this would cause damage since at least the 1950s, they knew that these greenhouse gases would be regulated since the 1990s and they’ve been gaslighting us all the way and blocking climate regulation.”
“It is imperative that we make polluters that caused a large percentage of the climate crisis pay for the thing that they knowingly caused.”MAYA GOLDEN-KRASNER, CLIMATE LAW INSTITUTE 
The climate superfund fight is part of a broader national movement against major oil companies that is playing out in legislatures and courtrooms across America. 
California is leading efforts to hold oil companies accountable in court for climate change, recycling a legal strategy deployed during the 1990s, when states alleged that tobacco companies knew cigarettes cause cancer.
Trump-era politics have also been at issue. In April, President Donald Trump signed an executive order targeting state climate programs, specifically calling out Vermont’s and New York’s polluter-pays laws and threatening legal action against California’s landmark cap-and-trade program.
Backers say the climate superfund is a fair solution to California’s budget crunch as well as a long-overdue reckoning for an industry that knowingly caused the climate crisis.
But the plan — which could cause oil and gas companies to pay billions for emissions over the last three decades — faces an uphill battle in Sacramento.
Last year, Californians voiced strong opposition to  plans to overhaul one of its cornerstone climate programs, the Low Carbon Fuel Standard,  which could push gasoline prices higher. Last week, Assemblymember Jasmeet Bains, a Democrat from Bakersfield, called for California Air Resources Board Chair Liane Randolph, who led the board in its passage of that measure, to resign over cost concerns.
Likely to trigger a legal onslaught 
If enacted, the climate superfund would almost certainly trigger a wave of legal challenges. Donald Sobelman, a San Francisco environmental attorney, told CalMatters that the bill is legally ambitious — and is almost certainly headed for a courtroom challenge if it passes.
The Trump administration, for instance, sued New York and Vermont over their climate superfund measures, arguing they are unconstitutional.
Another potential legal argument, Sobelman said, is that the measure could charge companies now for pollution emitted years or even decades ago. Another is that the measure could act like a tax, which could make it easier to challenge in California court without two-thirds approval by the Legislature. 
And some judges may question whether the science linking the emissions to worsening fires and other climate events is strong enough to single out specific companies for climate damage, leading to the “classic battle of the experts,” Sobelman said.
In addition, courts could determine that consumers hold some responsibility for their actions, such as driving cars and trucks powered by fossil fuels, and that other industries around the world, such as power plants and farms, also emit a lot of greenhouse gases. 
A spokesman for Gov. Gavin Newsom declined to tell CalMatters whether he supports the measure.
In his May budget proposal, the governor adopted “polluters pay” language to rally support for an existing California climate program, cap-and-trade, which raises money by selling pollution credits to companies. 
The debate is unfolding amid a worsening budget crisis in which lawmakers are under pressure to find new revenue sources — especially ones that don’t involve tax hikes on Californians.  Supporters of the Superfund Act argue that the bill offers a “polluter-pays” principle rather than new taxes.
Newsom’s budget proposal said extending cap and trade “aligns with the polluter-pays principle in which carbon emitters will fund the state’s world-class forestry and fire protection programs in the face of wildfires that have become increasingly destructive because of climate change.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/070622_OilField_LV_CM_009.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-06 09:00:42.714062

Darrin Camilleri (D-Trenton) during a meeting of the Senate Energy and Environment Committee on June 5, 2025. | Kyle DavidsonMembers of the Michigan Senate are once again weighing efforts to deter out-of-state companies from dumping hazardous waste in the state while updating standards for managing landfills and potentially harmful materials.
Sen. Darrin Camilleri (D-Trenton) on Thursday laid out a renewed proposal for revamping the state’s approach to hazardous waste management before his colleagues on the Senate Energy and Environment Committee.
During his testimony, Camilleri noted the bills are a response to recent attempts to ship hazardous waste from the East Palestine train derailment, as well as radioactive material from the Manhattan Project, into disposal sites within his district.
“I’ve had countless conversations with residents and local municipal leaders who are horrified about that potentially harmful material being transported to their communities on their roads and disposed of in their backyard,” Camilleri said. “Frankly, it is ridiculous that these facilities are located in these dense population centers in the first place.” 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXIf passed, Camilleri’s Senate Bill 246 would require the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy to create a hazardous and radioactive waste management plan and issue a moratorium on licensing new hazardous waste storage and disposal facilities or expansions of existing facilities.
It would also place stricter siting requirements on hazardous waste facilities to keep them away from large population centers and cap the amount of hazardous waste disposed of within Michigan by tying it to the amount of waste the state produces.
While federal law prevents Michigan from banning trash from other states, Camilleri said his policy is a creative effort to try and skirt federal regulations on commerce between states by preferencing Michigan’s waste, and allowing other states to send their waste on top of that.
“It’s not a perfect solution to that out of state problem, but it’s our version of trying our best to take care of home first,” Camilleri said.
Additionally, Senate Bill 246 increases the fees for disposing of hazardous waste from $10 a ton to $25 a ton, radioactive waste from $5 per ton to $12.50 per ton, with a portion of the increased fees going towards redevelopment. Another percentage would go toward a new community surcharge reimbursement fund, and another piece would go toward a grant fund to support communities that host hazardous waste disposal facilities.
Camilleri’s proposal would also increase the waste tipping fee, or the charge to dump in Michigan landfills, from 36 cents a ton, to $1.20.
In her budget proposals for the 2024-2025 and 2025-2026 fiscal years, Whitmer asked lawmakers to increase the state’s tipping fee to $5 in order to combat out-of-state dumping and increase revenue for environmental remediation, brownfield redevelopment, local waste management assistance and grants and recycling initiatives.
Alongside Senate Bill 246, Camilleri’s Senate Bill 247 targets a liquid waste injection well in Romulus, creating a $100 per ton tipping fee for the waste that goes into those wells.
“The city of Romulus is, right now, on the hook for all types of public safety,” Camilleri said. “In the event of a disaster with this type of well, they will be the ones forced to pay for additional equipment, additional public safety, including fire and EMS. … This type of fee would help offset some of those costs.”
During the meeting, local officials from Romulus and nearby Van Buren Township and Canton Township shared their support for the bills. They cited concerns about out-of-state dumping, and the public health and environmental threats that could come from storing more waste at facilities like the Wayne Disposal Inc. Hazardous Waste Landfill in Van Buren Township.
Canton Township Supervisor Anne Marie Graham-Hudak noted that the landfill is three miles south of Canton and sits next to two schools in a residential neighborhood. It’s also surrounded by environmental justice communities, she said, neighborhoods where people of color and low-income individuals are disproportionately exposed to environmental hazards.
Kevin Krause, the director of community safety and development for the city of Romulus, said the city is inadequately prepared to respond to an emergency at the Romulus injection well, not only from the perspective of the local fire department, but from the regional and county level, as well. 
“We are under-resourced, under-trained and underprepared at this particular location,” Krause said.
Should there be an issue with the injection well, the response will fall solely on the shoulders of local firefighters to mitigate any threat to the environment and population, while agencies like the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Michigan EGLE would only be able to provide administrative support.
Supporting Senate Bill 247 would give the city the ability to develop proper pre-response plans, raise awareness, and incorporate surrounding departments and regional hazardous materials teams into their planning, Krause said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_3080-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-06 09:00:42.714062

(Photo courtesy AmeriCorps)A federal judge in Maryland on Thursday ordered the Trump administration to restore AmeriCorps programs and workers in the 24 states, and the District of Columbia, that sued to stop the deep cuts ordered in April by DOGE and the administration.
U.S. District Judge Deborah L. Boardman said the administration failed to provide sufficient notice of the cuts, which were announced without warning — in the case of AmeriCorps, nearly $400 million in grants were canceled after hours on a Friday, and many workers only found out the next day.
Boardman granted a preliminary injunction that temporarily blocks the cuts in the 25 jurisdictions, most led by Democrats, that filed the suit. Her order does not affect the program in the states that were not part of the suit, or the cuts ordered at the agency’s headquarters.
White House spokesperson Anna Kelly, in a statement Thursday, reiterated administration claims that AmeriCorps failed eight consecutive audits and reportedly made more than $45 million in improper payments just last year.
“President Trump has the right to restore accountability to the entire Executive Branch, and this will not be the final say on the matter,” Kelly’s statement said.
Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown (D), who led the April 29 suit, with 22 other attorneys general and two governors, has argued the AmeriCorps cuts are unconstitutional because the programs funded by Congress can only be undone by those lawmakers. He welcomed Thursday’s ruling, which he said “safeguards … life-changing services that help build a better Maryland.”

“AmeriCorps programs provide critical resources that Maryland communities rely on to educate our students, preserve our parks, and feed our families through the dedicated service of selfless public servants who tutor children, care for the elderly, and protect public lands,” Brown said in a statement. “As this case continues, I will do everything in my power to defend these essential programs from the Trump administration’s unlawful and reckless cuts.”
The cuts came at the direction of billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) Service and began in mid-April, when 85% of AmeriCorps administrative staff was placed on administrative leave, and a little more than a week later began receiving reduction-in-force notices.
States were notified after hours on April 25, a Friday, that nearly $400 million in federal grants had been canceled effective immediately, that grant recipients “must immediately cease all award activities” and AmeriCorps members were to be let go and sent home “due to the agency’s termination of the grant and program closure.”
Officials said that in Maryland, the administration’s cuts affected at least 550 positions at universities, state agencies and other organizations that offer programs such as mentoring services, food pantries and conservation.
The state Department of Natural Resources said in a statement Thursday that the abrupt loss of AmeriCorps funding forced the cancellation of many summer park events and programs such as student field trips, programming for campers and other functions handled by conservation corps members.
“The positive impacts this program has on the State of Maryland can only partly be measured in statistics,” Ranger Sara Marcinak, director of the Maryland Conservation Corps, said in a statement. “The real value are the sparks of stewardship they set in people’s hearts and minds and the resulting fires they carefully tend to further cultivate that stewardship ethic.”
Thanks to some state and private funding, 17 members, or less than half of the state’s Conservation Corps were “reactivated” last week. This season’s environmental education program will continue through August. But state officials did not indicate when, or if, other AmeriCorps members might be back on board.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Boardman’s order gave the government until 5 p.m. Friday to notify states and AmeriCorps members of the injunction, and she gave it until Tuesday to report back on what actions it has taken to implement her order.
DNR spokesperson Gregg Bortz said the agency does not have a comment on Thursday’s court decision. But a spokesperson for Gov. Wes Moore (D) praised Brown’s leadership in the fight against “draconian cuts” to AmeriCorps.
“Today’s ruling makes it clear that the chaotic decision by Washington to immediately dismantle service pathways and abruptly dismiss committed AmeriCorps members actively strengthening our communities was erroneous,” said Carter Elliott IV.
Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (D) — one of two governors, along with Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear (D), to join state attorneys general in the suit — said on social media Thursday that the “federal government made a commitment to organizations across the Commonwealth, and with the abrupt termination of AmeriCorps, the Trump Administration went back on that commitment without obeying the law.”
Boardman denied the states’ request to reverse the reductions-in-force of AmeriCorps administrative staff, saying the damage the states claimed as a result of those firings was too speculative.
Besides Maryland and Washington, D.C., the other states named in the suit are Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawai‛i, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/54215765040_0d4e3877b6_o-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-06 10:08:05.673973

A cost-of-living increase meant to help community colleges adjust to a new funding formula is expiring, leaving some districts to cut positions and classes.


This June, struggling California community colleges will stop getting yearly cost-of-living increases to their budgets. These increases have kept many districts afloat for the past six years while community colleges adjusted to a new funding method based on district performance rather than enrollment numbers alone.
Most districts are surpassing the system’s goals, while struggling districts have been making cuts to bridge their budget gaps. With yearly cost-of-living increases being eliminated, those struggling districts will need to make even more cuts.  
This year, Cabrillo College in Santa Cruz announced it would cut 5% of its course offerings and pause hiring for unfilled positions as it faces a $5.9 million deficit in the 2025-26 academic year. That deficit is projected to double in three years.
In Oakland, the Peralta Community College District had to close an $11.8 million deficit this year. It has eliminated 68 positions, including financial aid support staff at each of its four colleges. Peralta administrators have also discussed reducing the number of colleges in the four-campus district, possibly by consolidating operations, to decrease costs.
Population decline sparked new funding model
The way that most of California’s community college districts earn their funding changed in 2018. Nine districts in the wealthiest areas of the state, called basic aid districts, continued to receive funding through local property tax revenues only. But for the 63 remaining districts, the new formula split the funding they receive from the state into three buckets – 70% based on enrollment, 20% based on the number of students receiving financial aid and 10% determined by “student success” metrics like the number of those who successfully transfer or receive certificates. 
Previously, the funding model for non-basic aid districts was based solely on enrollment. However, the former chancellor for the state college system, Eloy Ortiz Oakley, predicted that an ongoing decline in state K-12 enrollment signaled a corresponding decline in future community college students. 
“Community college enrollment and K-12 enrollment mirror each other, but lag each other,” he said in a recent interview with CalMatters. Oakley is now the president and CEO of College Futures Foundation.
Oakley said he spent over a year travelling the state and consulting with the system’s administrators and employees to develop a new model that diversified its approach. Today, the funding model uses over 30 measurements to calculate funds based on full-time enrollment, economic demographics and student success outcomes. For example, students who earn transfer degrees net their colleges a larger amount than those who earn trade certificates, although both count for additional funding.
To help colleges that stood to lose money under the new model, the state guaranteed them the same amount of funding they received before the change. California Community Colleges State Chancellor Sonya Christian said that the system supports its underperforming college districts by preventing them from losing money each year “even if a district’s calculations otherwise suggest a lower level,” according to an emailed statement. This stopgap will continue until further notice.
To account for rising costs of building maintenance, educational materials and employee benefits, the state also included incremental cost-of-living adjustments in each district’s budget, allowing administrators to keep up with economic inflation. This temporary adjustment was originally set to last three years. It was extended twice, which let districts keep growing their budgets despite periods of enrollment declines exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Now, these yearly increases will expire for good on June 30. 
Five of the San Francisco Bay Area college districts that rely on the updated funding formula are underperforming, plus Cabrillo and Santa Monica further south. Without a guaranteed annual cost-of-living increase, these districts will be forced to find some other way to meet rising costs.

Struggling colleges voice concerns about the funding formula
College officials who spoke with CalMatters for this story unanimously supported the funding model’s goals of helping all students to successfully graduate in a timely manner. But some administrators also voiced concerns about their ability to grow their budgets under the formula moving forward.
Due to its proximity to UC Santa Cruz, Cabrillo College attracts a high number of students looking to transfer to the local university. These students generate additional revenue for Cabrillo. But the college’s president, Matthew Wetstein, said many other students don’t. Either their educational goals don’t include a degree for transfer, which is prioritized by the formula, or their household income prohibits them from qualifying for financial aid.
The Peralta Community College District in the East Bay faces a projected $11.8 million deficit for the upcoming fiscal year. Greg Nelson, Peralta’s newly hired deputy chancellor and chief operations officer, said that high turnover among leadership and dwindling enrollment have left Peralta “not prepared” for the cost-of-living increases to go away. He said that he will now prioritize ways to meet the formula’s metrics as he tries to reverse Peralta’s decline.

For Ron Gerhard, the district chancellor of Chabot-Las Positas, eliminating the yearly cost-of-living adjustments “effectively amounts to a cut” to his district and others in high-cost  communities in the San Francisco Bay Area – particularly “in this time and age where inflation is high.” He said that his two-college district has had to make reductions that don’t impact classes so the district could keep up with rising costs.
Chabot-Las Positas’ institutional research shows that students in the region are “least likely” to receive financial aid compared to the rest of the state. This is because students have to work more hours and earn more money to afford the higher regional costs, limiting both their ability to attend school and their eligibility to qualify for financial aid. Other similarly affected districts in the region, including Peralta and Cabrillo, supported the research findings.
Oakley argues that the funding formula is fair, saying that eligibility for Cal Grants and Pell Grants includes the cost of living, and it’s up to colleges to make sure they are accurately reporting that cost. However, federal Pell Grants only consider a student’s cost of living when awarding grants to full-time students, according to the Congressional Research Service. As of Fall 2024, about 74% of community college students in California are part-time.  
How a winning formula looks for one campus
Some colleges experiencing enrollment declines have leveraged other parts of the formula to stay afloat, such as focusing on class offerings that result in degrees and making sure eligible students are applying for financial aid. 
Lake Tahoe Community College District is bringing in 30% more funding under the new formula.
Times were not always easy for Lake Tahoe, President Jeff DeFranco said. His district grappled with pandemic enrollment declines, followed by the massive 2021 Caldor Fire that destroyed hundreds of neighboring homes. 
In response, he says the college made academic counseling appointments mandatory to keep students on track and explain the value of attaining a degree. The new model, he said, calls for more collaboration. “Our front line staff understand it’s important. Our counseling staff understand it’s important. Our administration and our boards understand it’s important,” he said. 
DeFranco also mentioned that the college now focuses on transfer degrees, leading to an increase in completed degrees every year. He said certificate awards are at an all-time high for the college.
“We’ve improved the student success metrics and our enrollment; it can’t just be one or the other. It really has to be both,” DeFranco said. 
But as DeFranco noted, where state budgets are concerned, there is no such thing as perfection.
“[It’s] an imperfect system but I don’t know that there is a perfect system out there,” he said. “The thing I do believe is, what gets measured gets done. That’s a basic leadership principle.”

Evan Vickers, R-Cedar City, is pictured on the first day of the legislative session at the Capitol in Salt Lake City on Tuesday, Jan. 16, 2024. (Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca is suing Utah’s attorney general and insurance commissioner over a law passed during the legislative session aimed at stopping drug manufacturers from limiting where hospitals and clinics can buy discounted medication.  
Filed in May in federal court in the District of Utah, the company accuses the law of being unconstitutional and in conflict with prior court rulings. 
Sponsored by Sen. Evan Vickers, R-Cedar City, SB69 deals with the federal 340B program, a decadesold provision in the Public Health Service Act that aims to supply hospitals and health clinics with drugs at a discounted price. 
The program requires drug manufacturers to provide discounts on certain outpatient drugs for entities covered under the program, like hospitals, clinics, or Native American tribes. 
According to the American Hospital Association, hospitals can pass savings from the 340B program along to patients by offering health care to uninsured patients, providing free vaccinations, or expanding mental and community health programs.

But Vickers, who owns and operates a pharmacy in Cedar City, said the program is not popular among drug manufacturers, who have tried to limit where the entities covered under 340B can obtain the discounted drugs. Speaking on the Senate floor earlier this year, Vickers said manufacturers have been enforcing a “one pharmacy rule,” where certain drugs can only be obtained from certain pharmacies. 
“From their perspective it’s expanded more than they would like, so they’ve tried to limit the access of drugs,” Vickers said.  “Essentially, you could have a patient being able to get a product at a discounted price in one town but not the other.” 
SB69, which passed in March during the final week of the legislative session, tries to prevent this. The bill is relatively simple at just 53 lines, and states that drug manufacturers cannot restrict pharmacies from contracting with entities covered under the 340B program. It also restricts manufacturers from preventing the delivery of a 340B drug to any location authorized to receive it. 
“I don’t stand here professing that the manufacturers are happy with this, I will tell you they’re not,” said Vickers earlier this year, telling his Senate colleagues that states that have passed similar legislation have been targeted by lawsuits. “But what we’re looking at is providing access to medication at a discounted price.” 
Vickers was right. AstraZeneca, the global pharmaceutical company that generated more than $54 billion in revenue in 2024, is now suing Utah Attorney General Derek Brown and Utah Insurance Commissioner Jon Pike to stop the enforcement of SB69. 
The Utah Attorney General’s Office did not provide comment on the active litigation. 
In the complaint, attorneys for AstraZeneca point to prior court rulings that supersede Utah’s law. 
“Apparently dissatisfied with the scope of federal law, the State of Utah has enacted a statute seeking to achieve under state law precisely the same result that federal courts have resoundingly rejected,” the complaint reads, accusing SB69 of requiring “discounted pricing for sales at an unlimited number of contract pharmacies.”
According to AstraZeneca, the requirement in SB69 goes beyond the original intent of the 340B program, putting state law at odds with federal law and violating the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution. 
Plus, the lawsuit alleges, SB69 violates the Contracts Clause of the Constitution because it interferes with agreements between drug manufacturers and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, as well as the Constitution’s Takings Clause, which protects private property from being seized for public use, since SB69 requires AstraZeneca to transfer its private property (prescription drugs) to entities covered under 340B.

WEST BLOCTON, Ala.—“The lilies have bloomed this season if you know where to go.”
It’s a line in Birmingham band I Declare’s newly released song “Cahaba,” and it’s the truth.
At the recent Cahaba Lily festival, you could hear the sacred Southern knowledge passing from one person to another.
“Where do you go? Have you been yet? Is the water low enough to see them?”
The lilies, a species endemic to the southeastern U.S., are named after Alabama’s longest free-flowing river, the Cahaba. They bloom boldly atop the jagged shoals that line the river’s bottom each year between Mother’s Day in May and Father’s Day in June.
This year, as is growing more often the case, an unusually rainy May has led to a less than ideal viewing season. But still, like clockwork, Alabamians have flocked to the Cahaba to see what they can.
“On the banks of the big river, watching nature’s finest show,” the song’s lyrics say. “It’s a biological marvel, a cesspool of teeming growth. A reflection of our survival in the water’s steady flow.”
It wasn’t always like this.

Dr. Larry Davenport is known as the world’s foremost expert on the Cahaba Lily, scientific name Hymenocallis coronaria. He was the keynote speaker at the 35th annual Cahaba Lily Festival, a gathering about 40 miles southwest of Birmingham that he’s been part of since its beginnings.

When the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service was searching for an expert to investigate the lily and its potential candidacy as an endangered species, they turned to Davenport. At the time, in the late 1980s, the Cahaba Lily wasn’t anywhere near the cultural symbol it’s now become for the region. A recent academic article called the flower “charismatic”—a characterization that left Davenport thrilled. The Cahaba Lily has come a long way in three decades, he said.
“It was a mysterious plant at the time,” Davenport said. “Little was known about it.”
So Davenport decided to take up what would ultimately become a lifelong challenge, investigating everything he could about the plant’s habitat, anatomy and life cycle.
Ultimately, USFWS chose not to list the Cahaba Lily as an endangered species, though organizations like the Nature Conservancy consider the lily “threatened.”


Historically, large populations of the flower have been wiped out by human activities like the damming of Alabama’s rivers.
The construction of a dam on the Black Warrior River in the early 1900s effectively drowned a miles-long stretch of the flowers, sometimes called shoal lilies.
“That was the motherlode,” Davenport said. “And when the dam was put in, all of those lilies were flooded out.”
A century later, another human activity—the burning of fossil fuels—has added yet another obstacle to the lily’s ability to thrive.
Research suggests that as the climate warms, heavy rain events in the southeast U.S. will become more frequent, as will periods of drought.
Siltation, where sediment coats the shoals needed for the plant’s growth, is one of the most serious threats to the Cahaba Lily, Davenport said. That type of water pollution, often caused by mining or other development upstream, can also be compounded by the impacts of climate change, which could lead to excessive rainfall that contributes to sediment runoff.
As such rain events become more frequent, viewing the lilies, too, will become more difficult, as the plants will often—like this year—be covered for much of the blooming season by high river water.
That human impact on the Cahaba and its lily—the effects of pollution and lax environmental regulation—are part of the dynamic that I Declare aimed to convey in their new album, “We Ought to Celebrate.”
The band’s five members—Hunter Huie, Austin Noble, Ben Smith, Kyle Posten and Joseph Foster—all grew up below the Mason-Dixon Line, struggling with what it meant to be Southern, white and progressive.
Huie, who grew up in Alabama, said he always identified with the rebellious, anti-authority attitude of his Southern community, but the older he got, the more he resented what he thought were the base political viewpoints that often accompanied it. As he grew older and learned more, he began to realize it was Southern Blacks and other progressives that truly embodied the ideas of fighting against the mainstream and pushing back against unchecked authority, not conservative whites who held fast to a historically bereft view of a “lost cause.”
“I just really hate that there is this patina of white supremacy and racism that coats the surface of everything in the South,” he said. “That’s something we want to fight against. We have to dig deeper.”
That’s at the heart of what “We Ought to Celebrate” is about, Huie said—painting a nuanced picture of the complex, heartbreaking, beautiful realities of the South in which he finds himself living.
“Me and my neighbors, we ain’t never gonna be OK with ‘Let’s Go, Brandon’ plate tags or those Johnny Reb battleflags,” one of the band’s lyrics say. “You and your buddies might be laughing at this son of a yuppy, but I’ll take my chances putting my money right where my mouth is.”
Explicit environmentalism, too, is part of what forms the fabric of I Declare’s new EP.
“Cahaba dreaming,” the band’s lyrics say. “Well I just think you should know. The lilies have bloomed this season if you know where to go. And I’ve got the lead on sallies—they’re buried in the mud. It seems so silly really, but it’s in our blood.”
Sallies (a reference to the region’s robust salamander population), like the Cahaba Lily, have been threatened by human activity, particularly habitat destruction. Just this year, residents of a Birmingham suburb fought a development that had been set to encroach on the habitat of resident spotted salamanders.
Reflecting on that kind of environmental impact is important to the band, guitarist and vocalist Ben Smith told Inside Climate News.
“We feel like being in Alabama, we’re surrounded by this culture that’s dominated by an affinity for the outdoors,” he said. “But we have this precious, unique ecosystem right here that’s absolutely wonderful that we actually don’t care about at all, that we pollute and mismanage. There’s this juxtaposition of this affection for nature while most people are also completely unconcerned with its health and well-being.”
It’s frustrating to witness, Smith said, but it makes for a good song.
Austin Noble, a saxophonist and vocalist for the group, grew up in Adger, a mining town in western Jefferson County that garnered headlines when a mine expanded beneath its residents’ feet. In March 2024, a grandfather living atop a mine in the area was killed when methane, a common byproduct of coal mining operations, leaked into his home, triggering an explosion.
Noble said growing up in a mining community shaped how he views the environment and the need for regulation.
“Everyone I knew in high school, they’d finish up, then head to work for the coal mines,” Noble said. “So they go into the mines, their health is affected and their lifespans are shortened, and this is how they’re repaid. An exploded home.”
That sentiment made its way into the music:
“I remember being told once
Don’t bite the hand that feeds
But what about mother nature
Who brings our thirsty throats a drink
Why should she have to pay for
All our externalities
Growth isn’t always a good thing
Oh man, plaque clogs the arteries”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_8086-2048x1366-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-06 08:05:41.938341

Starting July 1, staff with the Division of Cannabis Regulation will arrive unannounced at dispensaries and collect about 50 products a month off the shelves. They’ll take them to the Missouri State Public Health Reference Laboratory to be tested for things like mold, pesticides and a whole range of other things. 
Ryan Bernard, the division’s testing and research unit manager, said the unannounced sampling has been in the works for a while as a way to add an extra level of compliance. The division, Bernard said, isn’t expecting to find problems.
“We won’t know until we see the data,” Bernard said. “I have full faith and confidence in our testing licensees that they’re testing according to rule as it’s been outlined.”
However, national testing lab experts told The Independent that Missouri’s regulators might be shocked at the results.
“Shelf testing has not gone well in any state that I know of, especially if it’s just starting,” said Josh Swider, vice chair of the cannabis working group for American Council of Independent Laboratories. “It will be very telling very fast.”
Swider pointed to a citation in Arizona in April of a cannabis lab, where the state found more than a dozen alleged “deficiencies” including problems with the lab’s potency testing and pesticide and microbial detection methods.
Swider called the levels of pesticides on the Arizona products “sickening.”
“But this is what you’re seeing around the country,” said Swider, co-founder and CEO of Infinite Chemical Analysis Labs in San Diego. “Regulators are starting to enforce. They’re realizing an issue that’s been systemic for a long time.”
Other common issue Missouri regulars might also find, he said, are inflated levels of THC on products. 
Regulators previously talked about conducting a “round robin” testing, where the state’s certified testing labs would double check each other’s work under the state’s instruction. Amy Moore, director of the Division of Cannabis Regulation, told lawmakers in 2023 that this additional testing rule was “critical.” 
“The challenges in regulating and relying on for-profit cannabis testing labs,” Moore told lawmakers at a 2023 committee hearing, “is one of the most discussed challenges in the national cannabis regulatory community.”
However, the state never ended up getting the process going for a variety of factors, Bernard said, so the unannounced samples will be the regulators first attempt at a testing backstop.
Lawmakers began allocating money for this kind of sampling to be tested at the state laboratory in the fiscal year that began on July 1, 2024 with $3.8 million. Most of it went unspent because the cannabis testing methods were “still in the process of being implemented,” according to state budget documents. Another $2.4 million was allocated for this fiscal year ending on June 30, and it’s unclear how much of it has been spent.
Bernard couldn’t speak on the budget for testing, he said, because the division and state lab budgets are “totally separate.” 
“Our operating budget is DCR only,” he said. “State public health labs is theirs.”
The lab will receive another $2.4 million for the fiscal year beginning July 1. 
Swider said a standard test at a Missouri cannabis lab costs about $400. With the $2.4 million the lab is allocated to conduct 600 tests a year, it would put that rate at $4,000 a test. 
“That’s not good,” he said. 
It would take one employee in Swider’s lab to leisurely do 50 tests in a week, he said, but 50 in a day is doable. 
Bernard said sampling 50 products out of more than 500,000 product tags is “not even close” to being representative of the market, but he called this a “very much preliminary” start.
Bernard has been working closely with the state public health lab, he said, to build the infrastructure for cannabis testing and they’ve had some “hold ups.” 
“[The state lab has] experienced grant-funding delays and and then back orders related to potential tariffs,” he said. “They’ve had equipment failures…so this starting point number will get us to a point where we can start stabilizing the amount they need to purchase compared to the amount that I can sample.”
The goal is to get to a representative sample size as soon as possible, he said. 
At an MJ Unpacked cannabis conference in November, concerns were raised among testing experts about the fact that 82% of Missouri’s cannabis testing is conducted at one licensed lab, Greenway Magazine reported. And that lab catches fewer problems with mold compared to other Missouri labs and those across the country.
At the November panel, information obtained through a Sunshine request revealed that the lab referred to as “Lab D” reported a failure rate for Aspergillus—a mold that poses significant health risks— roughly 8 times lower than the national average.
The state’s other labs had a failure rate of 3.3%, which is aligned closely with the national average of 3.8%. 
Lab D’s failure rate was just under 0.5%. 
The information raised questions about whether the mold was adequately being checked. However, Bernard said those results didn’t raise any alarm for him. 
“Everybody’s being held to the same standards as far as testing is concerned and their ISO accreditation,” Bernard said. “Without doing further investigation, I have confidence that the industry is testing appropriately.”

(BanksPhotos via Getty Images)The intra-DFL rift between labor unions whose members build data centers and progressives skeptical of corporate giveaways was on full display at the Capitol last week as lawmakers considered extending generous tax breaks for data centers’ purchases of computers, software and energy equipment.
It was also evident in a May 28 energy webinar featuring top utility executives, state officials and representatives from regional labor, agriculture and environmental groups.
The conversation came as Minnesota utilities weigh proposals for thousands of megawatts of new data center capacity, representing new electric consumption equal to millions of homes. As other construction sectors falter amid high interest rates and sluggish demand, union laborers and tradespeople see an opportunity in building data centers and the power plants to run them.
“We need to be involved in the next iteration of energy development here in Minnesota,” said Joe Fowler, business manager for Laborers International Union of North America Local 563.
To labor, that means building not only the wind, solar and battery plants that will form the backbone of Minnesota’s future electric grid, but large industrial facilities to soak up the power they produce. Others in the left-of-center coalition say unfettered data center growth could jeopardize progress toward the state’s statutory target of 100% carbon-free electricity by 2040 while threatening grid reliability and raising costs for ordinary utility customers.
“We want to bring on large users like data centers, but not to the exclusion of others,” said Margaret Cherne-Hendrick, CEO of St. Paul-based Fresh Energy, a policy and communications shop focused on clean energy.
Though the data center boom was the elephant in the room, the conversation touched on some of the broader challenges issues facing Minnesota electric utilities, workers and customers as a dysfunctional state legislative session limps to a close and federal policymakers get closer to passing a budget bill that cuts taxes for the rich and Medicaid for the poor while, experts say, raising power prices for everyone.
How much data center demand is actually coming? 
Developers have proposed nearly 9,000 megawatts of new data center capacity across Xcel Energy’s eight-state territory, CEO Bob Frenzel said in October, or almost 9 million homes’ worth of electricity consumption. Data centers alone account for about half of Xcel’s expected 5% annual sales growth through 2029.
Xcel expects Minnesota’s share of that growth to be about 1,300 megawatts over the next seven to eight years, said Ryan Long, Xcel’s president for Minnesota and the Dakotas. That’s up from 60 megawatts of total capacity as of early last year.
“The curve is up and to the right,” Long told Energy Futures Initiative Foundation CEO and former U.S. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz on the webinar. “It’s shifted from us trying to attract (data center) companies to Minnesota to them knocking on our doors.”
Smaller utilities like Dakota Electric Association are also gearing up for massive amounts of data center development, CEO Ryan Hentges said later on the webinar. Projects proposed for Dakota Electric territory include a 12-building, 340-acre Farmington campus that residents are suing to stop.
But the demand won’t hit all at once, Hentges said.
“One gigawatt is not all going to happen next year,” he said. “It’s going to happen over time, and that gives us more time to plan.”
Can utilities serve new data centers while meeting Minnesota’s carbon-free power mandate? 
The short answer is yes, according to Long. Even with the influx predicted over the next five years, Xcel is on track to shut down its three remaining Minnesota coal units by 2030 and meet the interim state goal of 80% clean power by 2030, he said.
“These are aging, somewhat inefficient plants and we are blessed to live in a region that has excellent renewable resources,” he said.
Xcel could partner on future “clean firm” power projects with big tech companies, which have their own sustainability goals, Long added. Google, utility NV Energy and power developer Fervo Energy recently announced a geothermal power partnership in Nevada, while Meta, Amazon and Microsoft have all inked splashy nuclear deals. Nuclear and geothermal both produce carbon-free power without relying on variable weather conditions.
Those partnerships could eventually help wean Minnesota off natural gas power despite uncertainty around federal support for cleaner technologies, said Sydnie Lieb, assistant commissioner with the Minnesota Department of Commerce.
“In the absence of the federal government continuing to push development of clean firm resources, we are thinking about what the state can do,” she said.
Big data centers could also cover at least some of the cost of new transmission infrastructure needed to serve them, easing the burden on existing ratepayers, Hentges added.
But the state needs to ensure Minnesota data centers fully decarbonize their operations over time, including onsite backup generators that today generally run on natural gas or diesel, Cherne-Hendrick said. It also needs to push data centers to pay into state-administered equity programs facing sharp federal funding cuts, like the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, she said.
Is Minnesota really facing a ‘power emergency’? 
Also no, Long said, despite the Trump administration’s claims to the contrary.
Last month, Trump invoked an obscure law to order a Michigan coal plant to operate past its planned May 31 retirement date. Moniz, the former U.S. Energy Secretary, asked whether he could do the same in another Midwestern state committed to transitioning off coal.
Xcel is “obviously paying a lot of attention” to the issue but isn’t changing its coal retirement plans, which have been in the works for years and won’t affect system reliability, Long said.
He allowed that Minnesota will need gas power plants for many years, though they’ll increasingly serve as backup for renewables, nuclear and long-duration batteries. Xcel plans to build a new “hydrogen-capable” gas plant in southwestern Minnesota that will likely operate past 2040.
Will the transition to carbon-free power kill jobs? 
Building new wind, solar and battery plants has been cheaper than running existing coal plants for years, in part because renewable power requires far less labor to operate and maintain.
Fowler said that’s a challenge for unions like LIUNA, whose work in the power sector increasingly focuses on facilities that more or less run themselves. And LIUNA members are uneasy about the future.
“Our job is to work ourselves out of a job — we build something and then move onto the next project,” he said.
A February settlement between Xcel and Minnesota’s utility regulator pushes the utility to expand training opportunities for underrepresented populations and work with labor on workforce transitions at retiring power plants. The training partnership has already produced around 100 graduates who can now work on new power plant or data center construction projects, Fowler said.
“There are real benefits the state will see from … having citizens who feel like their job is waiting out there,” he said.
Is rural Minnesota being asked to do too much to support the green transition? 
Wind and solar development is a double-edged sword for rural communities, where income-earning opportunities for landowners clash with concerns about removing prime farmland from production, said Anne Schwagerl, vice president with Minnesota Farmers Union.
To demystify the issue and strengthen members’ negotiating position with power developers, Minnesota Farmers Union plans to update its five-year-old “farmers’ guide” to renewable energy. But the best way to ensure durable rural support for clean energy is to give farm communities more skin in the game, Schwagerl said.
Right now, for example, conglomerates barge most of the fertilizer used on Minnesota farms up the Mississippi River from massive factories on the Gulf Coast. Minnesota Farmers Union wants to see more local production, ideally led by rural cooperatives using excess wind power with support from federal and state green fertilizer grants, Schwagerl said.
“Our thinking is that the green transition is happening,” she said. “We’re seeing it in agriculture as in energy, and it would be a big bummer to us if it ended up being owned by the same multinational megacorporations.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/nuclear-power-plant-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-06-06 08:05:41.938341

James Meredith was shot a day after he began his one-man, 220-mile March Against Fear from Memphis to Jackson, Mississippi. 
Meredith survived, and the sniper was arrested. Meredith did the march to encourage Black Mississippians to vote in the wake of the passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. 
After Meredith’s shooting, Martin Luther King Jr. and other civil rights leaders and activists decided to continue the march in Meredith’s name. People from all over the nation came to join the march, which resulted in 4,000 new Black voters. 
The march ended at the state Capitol in Jackson, where 15,000 gathered, including Meredith, who had recuperated from surgery. It was the largest civil rights march in the state’s history.

,California,2025-06-06 12:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,California’s stubborn problems keep thwarting its ballooning budget,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/06/california-budget-problems-balloon/,"California's spending has tripled in 25 years under Democratic leadership, while such problems as homelessness, water shortages and poverty grew.","The first quarter of the 21st century has been, in a sense, a test of whether California — a state enormously blessed but enormously troubled — can be effectively governed.
For decades, California’s two political parties had struggled for dominance. Control of its governorship, its Legislature, its congressional delegation and its presidential electoral votes had shifted back and forth as the mood of voters oscillated.
However, by the turn of the century, Democrats had captured all the levers of political power. And over the last 25 years their dominance has grown ever stronger, interrupted only by the performative seven-year governorship of action film actor and nominal Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger.
The disappearance of inter-party competition means Democrats have been free to implement their responses to multiple issues spawned by the state’s economic and cultural complexity — such things as erratic water supply, low-performing public schools, homelessness, housing shortages, and chronically high levels of unemployment and poverty.
In general, Democratic governors and legislators have believed that throwing money — lots of it — at those and other problems would result in tangible improvement. An obscure chart in the state budget reveals how much money.
In 2000, the state’s population was 34 million and has since grown by 15% to just over 39 million. According to the state Department of Industrial Relations, California’s consumer price inflation has been close to 100% in that period.
However, California’s general fund — which pays for the state’s core programs, such as education, health care and prisons — has tripled from $78 billion during Democrat Gray Davis’ governorship to $229 billion in Gov. Gavin Newsom’s latest budget. The increase has been financed largely by taxing Californians’ personal incomes, which also have tripled from $1.14 trillion to $3.5 trillion.
General fund spending per capita is 2.5 times what it was in 2000, rising from $2,296 to $5,835. And the number of state employees — 311,239 in 2000 — is now 40% higher at 436,435.
Anyone would be hard-pressed argue that those increases by Democratic officeholders have produced breakthroughs on the state’s most pressing issues. Shortages and the costs of housing, homelessness, low academic scores and other existential issues continue to plague the state.
If the effectiveness of governance has not improved during the last quarter century of one-party dominance and high levels of spending, California’s economic and civic ails may reflect something else, perhaps a lack of creativity or cohesive civic leadership, or maybe a governance structure based on a 19th century model that doesn’t suit a 21st century reality.
The current blame shifting and finger pointing between state officials, especially Newsom, and city and county governments over accountability for homelessness may be a clue that something is lacking. It’s as if everyone knows they can’t fix the problem so they have resorted to face-saving.
The process of choosing a successor to Newsom will kick off a year from yesterday, with the June 2026 primary designating two finalists for the general election four months later.
On Wednesday evening, six of the self-proclaimed candidates for governor — four Democrats and two Republicans —answered questions about how they would govern in a forum sponsored by the state Chamber of Commerce at its annual economic summit.
Their polite banter revealed overall agreement on what some of California’s issues are — particularly the state’s high living costs — but was short on concrete proposals. The event, known in the political trade as a beauty contest, also was overshadowed by former Vice President Kamala Harris’ absence and coyness about running for governor.
Whether she’s in or out, the next governor will have a full plate of unresolved issues that need different approaches if California is to be – despite evidence to the contrary — still governable.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/042425_Dixon-Trail_AH_CM_44.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-06 08:05:41.938341

It’s fair to say Montanans have been raked over the coals for electricity costs by the utility companies that have followed in the wake of the disastrous utility deregulation bill passed by the 1997 Legislature and signed into law by then-Gov. Marc Racicot.
The faulty premise on which the measure was sold to the Legislature was that Montanans would enjoy lower electricity costs thanks to customers having “choice” to shop among the various utilities that were supposed to materialize.
But that didn’t happen.
The opponents to the measure cited the simple fact that Montana already had the lowest price for electricity in the region, thanks in large part because Montana customers had already paid the Montana Power Company, as a regulated monopoly, to build and maintain a series of hydroelectric dams. As one long-time lineman quipped “you can’t make electricity cheaper than water running downhill.”
Driven by the Montana Power Company’s intent to change from a utility to a telecommunications company, Touch America, the 200+ page bill was jammed through in the last weeks of the session with most legislators having no idea what was in it — nor the consequences of their actions.
Yet the Republican legislative majorities voted to grant Montana Power’s wish, bolstered by the Butte Democrats — except for brave Danny Harrington who didn’t kow-tow to the utility.
It was arguably the worst decision ever made by Montana’s lawmakers and governor.
First to go were the dams, which were sold to an out-of-state utility, Pennsylvania Power and Light.  Next to go was the Montana Power Company itself, taking with it the pensions and stock holdings of Montanans who thought of it as “our” power company.
Then Touch America, headed by Bob Gannon, the former CEO of the Montana Power Company, went bankrupt.
In the meantime, Montanans’ electricity bills began their skyward climb as the dams were sold yet again, each time for a higher price, that was then loaded on customers. Realizing the extent of the damage caused by the deregulation debacle, the Legislature finally decided to re-regulate in 2001. NorthWestern Energy is now our “regulated” electricity supplier since acquiring the system in 2000.
It’s fair to say Montana’s Public Service Commission has not been diligent in holding down rates, which have gone from the lowest to the highest in the region.
But here’s the good news.  Thanks to Brad Molnar, who was a commissioner from 2004-2012, was re-elected in 2024, and is now the new president of the Commission, NorthWestern has finally hit resistance to its unending requests for rate increases.
In a tremendous article, Daily Montanan’s deputy editor, Keila Szpaller, lays out in detail Molnar’s firm stance against the increase.  Citing a 50-year old law, NorthWestern claims the Commission did not take timely action and raised rates nearly 17% on May 25 without Commission approval.
Molnar says the increase “will be crushing to many low-income people, many of whom are simply elderly, that are being handed their butts every day in property tax increases, in utilities, insurance for their houses, insurance for their cars. You name it.  This is a very, very bad time to be a poor person, and this will make it worse.”
If the rate increase is unjustified, NorthWestern will have to refund the over-charge plus 10%.  As Molnar put it: “It is time for them to grow up and quit playing the victim and actually take responsibility for their actions.”
We’ll see what happens, but for now, Montanans owe a debt of gratitude to Commissioner Molnar for finally standing up to NorthWestern instead of rubber-stamping their endless rate increases.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/GettyImages-1248907535-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-06 08:05:41.938341

(Photo by Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images)Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo vetoed two bills this week that would have enshrined a shield law for health care providers who offer gender-affirming care and ensured protections for transgender people incarcerated at local jails.
The vetoes come as President Donald Trump, who Lombardo supported in the election, has escalated attacks against the LGBTQ+ community in the first few months of his second term and issued several anti-trans orders, including one that blocked federal support for gender-affirming medical care to patients younger than 19.
The governor “turned his back on LGBTQ+ Nevadans and their families—vetoing two critical protections just days into Pride Month,” Silver State Equality State Director André Wade said in a statement. “These bills would have provided critical protections to transgender people seeking healthcare and their medical providers, as well as to transgender people in our criminal justice system.”
To the surprise of many LGBTQ organizers, Lombardo in 2023 signed legislation that prevented insurance companies from discriminating against trans people on the basis of gender identity and required the Nevada Department of Corrections to adopt regulations to protect trans and gender-nonconforming people in prison.
The move at the time made him an outlier among Republican governors and legislatures, which have supported and passed bills targeting the trans and queer community. 
Gender-affirming care is supported by a variety of health providers and medical associations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics. But it has been a high-profile target, and several states, including Utah, have banned it.
Democratic state Sen. James Ohrenschall has said prohibiting gender-affirming care will “not only harm transgender individuals but create a climate of fear and uncertainty for health care providers who offer gender-affirming health care services.”
Nevada law doesn’t restrict medically necessary gender-affirming care, but many LGBTQ advocates and medical providers, including pediatricians, worried bans in other states could prevent trans youth from seeking care and doctors from providing it in Nevada.
Ohrenschall brought legislation in 2023 that sought to enact a shield law for medical providers in Nevada but Lombardo vetoed the bill.
With Senate Bill 171, Ohrenschall used the same language from the 2023 bill to yet again try to bolster protections for medical providers who offer gender-affirming care. It would have prevented a medical licensing board from punishing or disqualifying providers.
The bill passed both the Senate and Assembly in party line votes.
“This bill was a clear opportunity to ensure that transgender Nevadans can access the care they need—and that providers can offer it without fear of legal retaliation,” Wade said. “Transgender people in Nevada deserve safety, dignity, and access to life-saving health care. The Governor’s decision puts all of that at risk.”
In his veto message, Lombardo wrote that the bill “would lead to complicated legal battles and uncertainty about what laws providers must follow” and put medical “licensing boards in the awkward position of navigating potentially conflicting mandates in federal and state law.”
The message was similar to his 2023 veto.
The second trans bill vetoed by Lombardo, Senate Bill 141 would have required local detention facilities to develop policies that address the custody, housing, medical and mental health treatment of transgender, gender non-conforming, and intersex people incarcerated. 
Democratic state Sen. Melanie Scheible, who sponsored the bill, said during its hearing it was similar to legislation she brought in 2023 that required prisons to enact similar policies for trans people who were incarcerated. Lombardo signed that bill.
All 15 Assembly Republicans joined Democrats to unanimously pass SB 141, but the Senate voted along party lines.
In his veto message Lombardo acknowledged that he did “which authorized the Director of the Department of Corrections to implement similar policies through regulation with Board of Prison Commissioners’ approval.”
“Federal authority in this space is potentially evolving and, if altered, could conflict with the provisions of this bill leading to decreased state and local access to vital federal funding,” he wrote.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/trans-visibility-day-scaled-1-1024x676.jpg,,,2025-06-06 08:05:41.938341

Sept. 5, 2023. (Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)With a citizen-led campaign to impose voter ID requirements heading to the ballots, lawmakers discussed the issue at length Thursday before rejecting a legislative proposal mirroring the ballot initiative.
Several Republican members of the Maine House of Representatives said if returning clothes and buying cigarettes requires photo identification, so should voting. They alleged rampant voter fraud by noncitizens, which Maine’s Secretary of State has said is not the case.
Democrats pushed back, saying Maine already has a robust system to prevent fraud, and that requiring voter ID would disadvantage students, seniors and people with disabilities. With a 72-69 vote, the bill, LD 38, was rejected.
“There is a fundamental difference between having to show an ID to buy alcohol or tobacco products or returning an unwanted item to a store,” said Rep. Kelly Noonan Murphy (D-Scarborough).“None of those things are sacred rights granted to us in the Constitution. And therefore, imposing barriers on that right … is un-American.”
With papers shuffling between chambers this week, Maine Morning Star has compiled a slightly more pared down roundup again for Thursday, focusing on the biggest items of debates as well as legislation and issues that we’ve followed all session.
Here’s an overview of what happened Thursday. 
Both chambers
Both chambers have now passed an amended version of LD 1726, which seeks to improve planning for the future of the energy grid. The House supported it ​​with a 75-69 vote, and the Senate followed suit passing the bill 19-13 Thursday afternoon.
After LD 1928 squeaked through the House with a 72-70 vote, the Senate passed it 17-15. This bill would ban single-use plastic containers — such as mini shampoo bottles — at lodging establishments starting in 2030. 
Although Rep. Michael Soboleski (R-Phillips) said the well-intentioned legislation overlooks sanitation concerns and poses challenges for businesses, others praised it for its potential to chip away at plastic use in the state. 
“A conservative estimate is that this bill could eliminate as many as 73 million single-use plastic bottles per year from Maine’s waste stream as we struggle to recycle our way out of the catastrophe of microplastics, that is meaningful action,” said Rep. Vicki Doudera (D-Camden).
Although the proposed net energy billing reform that could save ratepayers more than $65 million has yet to hit the floors, the Senate and House passed an amended version of LD 839, which would create a fund to offset transmission and distribution costs associated with the policy that would otherwise be passed onto ratepayers. 
Additionally, lawmakers backed a bill requiring internet providers to treat all broadband internet traffic equally, a concept commonly referred to as “net neutrality.” LD 536 passed the House 79-66, while the Senate gave its approval Thursday.
With a 74-67 House vote, both chambers supported LD 246, which asks courts to consider a sentence other than imprisonment for primary caregivers. 
Rep. Adam Lee (D-Auburn) said the bill is needed because “the research is clear, children with incarcerated parents are more likely to face mental health challenges, exhibit behavioral problems, experience social isolation and suffer from economic hardship. These children are also more likely to perform poorly in school and have higher absentee rates.”
With a 73-69 vote, the House also passed LD 1859, a bill that would offer regional hubs for childcare, which can serve as access points in communities, tailored to the needs of those families. The Senate approved it Wednesday. 
Both chambers have now rejected LD 1476, which sought to impose a new lodging fee to help fund homeless shelters in the state. 
A heavily amended version of LD 1787 passed in the Senate after the House gave approval Wednesday. The bill initially sought to allow candidates for district attorney, sheriff and county commissioner to participate in the Maine Clean Election Act, but the version now being considered was amended to increase the contribution limits for gubernatorial seed money donations. (Read more about other proposals related to changing Maine’s clean elections here.) 
Legislation (LD 1900) to grant authority to certain Wabanaki Nations to develop tribal power districts and recognize the authority for child support enforcement passed the House 75-67 on Wednesday and Senate 20-12.
There was also bipartisan support for LD 1886, which would extend the current penalties applied when a motor vehicle violation results in death to violations that result in serious bodily harm. 
Lawmakers killed a proposal (LD 1461) to prohibit school boards from adopting a mask mandate unless directed by a health agency. 
So far, the Legislature has only supported modest refinements to the state’s paid family and medical leave. That approach continued Thursday, when two more bills looking to amend the program were rejected. 
LD 1169, which would allow employers to get a refund for any premiums paid into the state’s plan if they are approved to use a private substitute plan, was voted down 73-68 by the House and 18-14 by the Senate. Both chambers also rejected LD 1400, which looked to exempt certain public school employees from the program.
And the Senate cast a final enactment vote for LD 588, which would give agricultural employees the right to engage in certain concerted activity, which includes talking about wages, working conditions and other employment matters with other employees or the employer. (Read more about that here.)
Non-concurrent matters
After the Senate narrowly voted it down, the House passed LD 1535, which would require the Public Utilities Commission to gather a group of municipal, police and fire officials to discuss the high electricity usage related to illegal cannabis grows in the state. During discussions Wednesday, Sen. Craig Hickman (D-Kennebec) said the Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee is carrying over legislation into the next session that could provide a more comprehensive approach, including this sort of study.
The Senate insisted on its original vote Thursday night. 
Leaving it in limbo, the House did not again take up LD 810, the bill seeking to modify the law born out of a 2021 referendum question requiring the Maine Legislature to approve any new high-impact transmission lines. 
It fell shy of passage in the House with lawmakers voting 72-75 before ultimately killing the bill under the hammer. However, the Senate passed the bill 18-16 Wednesday.
During an evening session, the Senate rejected LD 1036, which would prohibit landlords from refusing to rent to tenants solely because they rely on programs such as General Assistance or housing vouchers. Since the House passed the proposal 72-70 on Wednesday, the lower chamber will need to take it up again. 
Sen. Chip Curry (D-Waldo) said this is an important issue, but asked the Senate to reject the measure simply because the Judiciary Committee is carrying a similar bill into the next session to allow more time to work on it. 
Although the House rejected LD 1236 earlier in the day on Thursday, the Senate voted 22-10 in favor of its passage after a failed 16-16 vote to reject the bill and impassioned floor speeches about the importance of addressing the presence of fentanyl in the state. 
The amended version of the bill seeks to create a Class A crime for aggravated trafficking of fentanyl when it results in an overdose. 
While no one refuted that fentanyl poses a crisis, Curry said the state can’t incarcerate its way out of it. Senate Minority Leader Trey Stewart said he supports a multipronged approach to solving the substance use crisis including access to treatment and other supports, but argued that this bill could bolster that.
Senate action
The Senate advanced two bills that aim to support mobile home park residents in purchasing their parks. (Read more about that here.)
Maine is one step closer to joining its New England peers who all have so-called food waste bans on the books now that the Senate has approved a slightly amended version of LD 1065. The bill would prohibit significant generators of food waste, which could include schools, hospitals, food producers and others, from disposing of food waste if they are close to a facility that could compost or otherwise dispose of the waste.

Democratic state Sen. Rochelle Nguyen’s Senate Bill 316 would have established “guardrails” for pharmaceutical benefit managers, such as requiring PBMs to pass along to consumers rebate savings they receive from the drug companies. Nguyen led the legislative effort but a bipartisan group of eight other lawmakers signed on, including Republican state Sen. Jeff Stone, a pharmacist, and Senate Minority Leader Robin Titus, a medical doctor.
The Senate and Assembly passed different versions of SB216, both with broad bipartisan support. Only Democratic state Sens. Dina Neal and Fabian Donate opposed. However, those votes came in the waning days of the legislative session, and the Senate did not get around to voting on whether to accept the Assembly’s amendments.
Here are 14 other bills the Nevada Current has covered that fell short (or really far) from becoming law during the 2025 Legislative Session.

Pet store ban. Assembly Bill 487 originally sought to ban retail pet sales statewide, following the lead of several municipalities that banned them within their borders. The bill, sponsored by Democratic Assemblymember Natha Anderson, passed the Assembly with bipartisan support. It appeared stalled in the Senate but, right before a key deadline, was heard by a Senate committee and amended into a study bill. When it returned to the Assembly for concurrence, Anderson moved for the chamber to reject the amendment. A trio of lawmakers from both chambers were chosen for what’s known as a “conference committee” to try and reconcile the differences between the chambers. But it appears no action was taken. That means retail pet sales remain legal in municipalities without bans.
Education management organizations. Senate Bill 318 (State Sen. Skip Daly, D) would have banned charter schools from contracting with for-profit education management organizations. The bill passed the Senate on party lines, with all Republicans opposing. It was referred to the Assembly Education Committee but was never given a hearing. That committee is chaired by Assemblymember Selena Torres-Fossett, who is also the executive director of a Las Vegas charter school contracted with Academica, the largest EMO in the state.
Third-party ticket vendors. Senate Bill 431 originally attempted to remove an exemption Nevada-based sports teams have from the state’s 8% live entertainment tax on tickets. That is an effort Democratic state Sen. Dina Neal has pushed in prior sessions. This year, the bill was amended into a bill to apply LET to tickets resold by third-party vendors like StubHub. Some of the funding would have supported public transit. The amended bill passed the Assembly with bipartisan support but was never given a floor vote in the Senate.
Farm worker protections. Senate Bill 172 (State Sen. Edgar Flores, D) sought to bolster protections for farm workers and amend overtime pay laws to include agriculture workers. The bill passed the Senate on party lines, with all Republicans opposing, but got stuck in the Assembly.
Free phone calls for prisoners. Senate Bill 323 (State Sen. Melanie Scheible, D) would have created a pilot program to provide free phone calls at Florence McClure Women’s Correctional Center. The bill passed the Senate with 20-0, with one senator excused from the vote, but died on the Assembly side.
Traffic cams in construction zones. Assembly Bill 402 (Assemblymember Selena Torres-Fossett, D) would have authorized traffic monitoring cameras in construction work zones when workers are present. The bill passed the Assembly with some bipartisan support, but then got stuck in the Senate Finance Committee. It was one of two “red light camera” bills introduced into the session this year. The other missed a legislative deadline earlier in the session.
Prison food study. Assembly Bill 246 (Assemblymember Venicia Considine, D) proposed a study on food quality, waste and nutrition within Nevada Department of Corrections prisons. The bill was considered and passed by the Assembly Judiciary Committee, but died in the chamber’s Ways & Means Committee.
Graduate assistant unions. Assembly Bill 191 (Assemblymember Natha Anderson, D) would have given graduate assistants the right to collectively bargain for better pay and conditions. The bill got stuck in the Assembly Ways & Means Committee.
Commerce tax. Assembly Bill 276 (Assemblymember P.K. O’Neill, R) would have adjusted the commerce tax threshold to inflation. The bill got stuck in the Assembly Ways & Means Committee.
Weight-loss drugs. Senate Bill 244 (State Sen. Roberta Lange, D) would have expanded the types of obesity treatments covered by Nevada Medicaid, including approving weight-loss drugs like Ozempic for wider use. The bill got stuck in the Senate Finance Committee.
‘Second Look’ Assembly Bill 91 (Assemblymember Erica Roth, D) is known as “second look” legislation and would have created an avenue for those incarcerated to have sentences reviewed by the State Board of Parole Commissioners after they’ve served extended periods of time. The bill passed the Assembly on party lines, then died in the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Lombardo’s health care bill Senate Bill 495, known as the Nevada Health Care Access Act, was Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo’s health care bill. It passed the Senate on party lines, with Senate Minority Leader Robin Titus urging her caucus to oppose the bill over amendments added by Democrats related to freestanding emergency rooms. The Assembly did not vote on the bill.
SNAP app. Assembly Bill 474 would have required DWSS to create  a “Smart Surplus Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.” The bill was criticized by local food banks, but passed the Assembly 40-1. Only Democratic Assemblymember Venicia Considine opposed. It was heard by the Senate Health and Human Services Committee but never voted out.
Artificial intelligence. Senate Bill 199 (State Sen. Dina Neal, D) would establish guardrails around artificial intelligence. The bill passed out of a Senate committee in early April but saw no activity after that.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/PXL_20250603_180716026-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-06 08:05:41.938341

The announcement came on Wednesday, more than three years after three environmental groups – the Center for Biological Diversity, The Institute for Regional Conservation, and the National Parks Conservation Association— filed a petition requesting that the ghost orchid be listed under the law as a threatened species.
The ghost orchid is endemic to southwestern Florida and western Cuba. It is estimated that its population has declined by more than 90% around the world, and by up to 50% in Florida.
There are only an estimated 1,500 ghost orchids remaining in Florida, and less than half are known to be mature enough to reproduce. They are located mostly in the Big Cypress National Preserve, Florida Panther’s National Wildlife Refuge, Fakahatchee Strand Preserve Park, Audubon’s Corkscrew Swamp Sanctuary, and other conservation areas in Collier, Hendry, and possibly Lee counties.
Among the factors that have led to the flower decreasing in population are the consequences of poaching as well as recent major storms, such as Hurricane Irma in 2017 and Hurricane Ian in 2022, says Jaclyn Lopez, an attorney with the Jacobs Law Clinic for Democracy and the Environment at Stetson University’s College of Law based in Pinellas County, who is representing the conservation groups.

Other factors that have led to the ghost orchid becoming more vulnerable include increased development and climate change. The ghost orchid is a leafless plant species that uses its roots to photosynthesize and attach itself to a host tree.
“The habitat changes that happen used to be quite slow over time. As sea levels have changed historically that allowed plants to move,” Lopez said. “The difference now is that the levels are rising much more quickly, not really giving plants the opportunity to adapt and to migrate on their own, and so the concern is that some of these trees could be lost to sea level rise.”
In February 2023, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission posted on social media that it had apprehended individuals attempting to steal a ghost orchid. In their petition to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the conservation groups noted that one of the chief threats to the ghost orchid was “overcollection,” and therefore they did not list the exact locations of where the populations of the flower exist.
However, Lopez says that the Endangered Species Act requires very specific data to be included in the petition process, so the conservation groups were still able to provide that information to the Fish and Wildlife Service confidentially.
“We understood that the principal threat is poaching, so we had to make sure that we weren’t going to be the reason poachers could find out their exact location,” she said, adding that the federal agency was later able to communicate directly with officials at Big Cypress and Corkscrew to provide “location specific information on the species” right down to the individual plant.
In a statement, Elise Bennett, the Florida and Caribbean director and attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, welcomed the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s announcement on the ghost orchid, but said it was far too early to celebrate.
“[W]ith the Trump administration’s incessant attacks on landmark environmental laws meant to stop species from going extinct, we know our job here isn’t done,” she said. “We’ll continue to do what’s necessary to ensure the ghost orchid and every other iconic Florida species has a fighting chance to thrive in our beautiful state.”
“People love plants,” adds Lopez. “They’re part of our own ecosystem and habitat. They’re part of the aesthetic of living in Florida. And ghost orchids in particular are like the movie star of that ecosystem, so I imagine that this proposal will be gladly supported. I don’t expect any political interference or backlash as a result. so we’re just hopeful that the administration is able to move forward without further delay in giving the species finally all the protection that it needs.”
The Fish and Wildlife Service is taking public comments on the proposed rule until August 4.

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)The 11 candidates running to become New Jersey’s next governor have a head-spinning list of people endorsing them, everyone from union leaders to celebrities and powerful politicians to obscure municipal officials.
While endorsements typically do little to change election outcomes, political observers say they matter more in crowded primary races like New Jersey’s, where they can sway undecided voters or serve as a tipping point in tight contests. The primaries are on Tuesday, June 10.
“Voters who are less familiar with the candidates and less informed about the race may use endorsements and establishment support as a guidepost,” said Alyssa Maurice, head of research at the William J. Hughes Center for Public Policy at Stockton University. “But for voters who are very engaged and rallied around a preferred candidate, an endorsement is not going to change their mind. It’s not going to be a game-changer.”
Engaged voters likely will be the only people who bother to vote in Tuesday’s primaries, with a recent Rutgers-Eagleton poll showing most registered voters aren’t even aware an election is approaching.
A low turnout could give endorsements more weight than they’d otherwise have and narrow slim margins between candidates in toss-up races, said Micah Rasmussen, director of the Rebovich Institute for New Jersey Politics at Rider University.
In the race to replace Gov. Phil Murphy, former Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli is considered the front-runner of five candidates in the GOP primary, while the six-candidate Democratic race remains wide open.
“In a low-turnout primary, where a small number of votes can shape the electorate, every group of votes matters,” Rasmussen said. “Low turnout magnifies the effects of real endorsements that actually drive votes.”
Endorsements only drive votes if they’re backed up with money and canvassing to publicize them and deliver voters to the ballot box, he said.
Some groups have proven especially adept at both, he added. He pointed to the Vaad in Lakewood, an influential coalition of Orthodox Jewish rabbis whose mobilizing helped Assemblyman Avi Schnall topple a four-term incumbent in 2023.
“They have like a high-tech phone tree where they make sure everybody knows, and everybody votes. That is an endorsement that very much matters. There’s no question that’s going to translate into votes,” Rasmussen said.
The Vaad endorsed Ciattarelli and Rep. Josh Gottheimer, a Democrat, for governor in the upcoming primaries.
The New Jersey Education Association, the union that represents about 200,000 teachers statewide, is another group whose endorsement carries weight — largely because teachers, like most college graduates, tend to vote more faithfully than other demographics, Rasmussen added.
Sean Spiller, one of the six Democrats vying to become governor, landed that endorsement easily — he’s the union’s president.
“They’re putting huge political capital into this endorsement, and I would argue that Spiller’s candidacy wouldn’t even exist if it wasn’t for the NJEA endorsement,” Rasmussen said. “It’s completely symbiotic, in their case, they’re joined at the hip. So there is very likely to be a lot of understanding among teachers in New Jersey of that endorsement.”
Endorsements can cut both ways, he said. He noted that most of the campaign cash boosting Spiller’s bid is funded by an outside group backed by teachers’ dues, which irritated some union members and could make the endorsement backfire at the ballot box.
George Norcross’ endorsement of Democrat Steve Sweeney, the former Senate president, also raised some eyebrows. While many political candidates would want the powerful South Jersey Democratic power broker’s backing, Norcross has plenty of critics, especially since he was indicted last year for racketeering (a judge dismissed the charges in February).
Democrat Steve Fulop also has sought to make rival Rep. Mikie Sherrill’s endorsements “double-edged swords” by denigrating her as the establishment candidate, Rasmussen said. She has collected endorsements from party committees around the state.
“He’s trying to make them into a liability, a sign that he’s the unbossed candidate, he’s the candidate that’s building a new way of doing things,” Rasmussen said.
Otherwise, endorsements largely align with the candidate’s politics and signal something about them, Maurice said. Mayor Ras Baraka, a Democrat, won the support of a group of progressive groups like the New Jersey Working Families Party.
“Everyone has their unique lane, and I think their endorsements reflect that lane that they’ve chosen to run on,” she said. “Sherrill won the most local endorsement contests with establishment Democrats, and institutional support. Sweeney has his South Jersey support. Baraka and Fulop have support from the anti-establishment or progressive groups. Spiller obviously has the teachers union.”
The timing of endorsements also matters, Rasmussen and Maurice agreed.
President Donald Trump endorsed Mendham Mayor Christine Serrano Glassner in her bid last year for U.S. Senate, but the endorsement came long before he was reelected, as he fought corruption charges in Manhattan. Serrano Glassner lost in the GOP primary to Republican Curtis Bashaw, who then lost in the general election to Democrat Andy Kim, now New Jersey’s junior senator.
Since Trump’s reelection, the Republican candidates vying for governor — aside from Sen. Jon Bramnick, a longtime anti-Trumper — battled fiercely for both his endorsement and the support of his devotees (Ciattarelli won Trump’s support). Whichever GOP candidate wins the primary, though, that strategy will likely change for November’s election, Maurice said.
“That candidate is going to have to walk a tightrope when it comes to Trump and how much to align himself with the President,” she said. “The effect of a Trump endorsement in the general will really depend on the political mood come November, because a lot can change, so time will tell.”
Other notable endorsements in the governor’s race include:

Baraka — Reps. Bonnie Watson Coleman and LaMonica McIver, Make the Road Action New Jersey, New Jersey Citizen Action, the Good Government Coalition of New Jersey, the Progressive Change Campaign Committee
Bramnick — The Philadelphia Inquirer, former House Speaker John Boehner
Ciattarelli — The New Jersey State Retired Police and Firemen’s Association
Fulop — College Democrats of New Jersey, The Philadelphia Inquirer, Progressive Change Campaign Committee
Gottheimer — Assemblyman Gary Schaer, guitarist Stevie Van Zandt
Republican Mario Kranjac — Newt Gingrich and Curtis Sliwa (founder of the Guardian Angels)
Sherrill — Former tennis star Billie Jean King, Sierra Club, Maine Gov. Janet Mills
Republican Bill Spadea — Right to Life (state and national)
Sweeney — Reps. Donald Norcross and Herb Conaway and about 25 union chapters

Mere weeks after taking flak for an unannounced visit to India initially paid for by an undisclosed business, the IndyStar revealed that he was out of the country — again without sharing his travel plans and paid for by an outside organization. 

 

Indiana Democrats are upset that I took some time away from the office.
I decided to give them some feedback on their press release and clear up some misconceptions.

— Diego Morales (@cdiegomorales) May 31, 2025
 

Since the story broke, he has revealed that organizers with the Conservative Political Action Conference picked up the tab for his Hungary visit while pointedly posting about his “personal time” online. But he spoke on both international trips as Indiana’s Secretary of State, not in his personal capacity.
“This certainly, to me, looks political and partisan. And so if someone else is footing the bill for him to make these international trips, it’s certainly worthwhile for your typical voter but also other branches of government … to know where that money is coming from,” said Greg Shufeldt, an associate professor of political science at the University of Indianapolis. 
The website for the Office of the Secretary of State doesn’t include any mention of international relations, but is centered on election oversight, registering businesses and trademarks, and licensing vehicle dealerships. 
Returning the office’s focus to those duties is part of the campaign platform for both Republican challengers who announced in recent weeks.
Knox County Clerk Dave Shelton ran against Morales in the 2022 convention but fell short in the final tally. He announced his bid with Indy Politics in April, days before Morales posted about his intention to run for reelection. 
Shelton described the position itself as the destination, rather than a stepping stone for another office, adding that his early announcement is designed to give him time to meet with delegates. 
“I want to do the job without fanfare. I don’t need my picture taken; I don’t need to make headlines,” said Shelton. “I just want the personal satisfaction of doing the job to the best of my abilities. I will not be a taxpayer-funded tourist on a statewide search for photo ops. That is not me.” 
Party candidates for the secretary of state are chosen by delegates at a convention, rather than through a primary process. The convention is scheduled for next summer, meaning that candidates can’t yet officially submit their names for consideration.

Jamie Reitenour outperformed a former attorney general in the Republican primary election for governor last year and now has her sights set on the office.
“To be super honest, I’m just offended. I’m offended for Hoosiers that he is not taking the secretary of state job, in my opinion, very seriously,” Reitenour told the Indiana Capital Chronicle. “It’s an administrative job; it’s not meant to be a job where you’re constantly posting about all your travel.”
Questions about international trips sent to Morales’ campaign didn’t get a response before publication, but the politician has shot back at critics online and in a recent WOWO interview. 
“… I will always take every opportunity to promote Indiana. I am always Indiana Secretary of State, even when I’m out of the office on personal time,” said Morales in a statement shared with Indy Politics. “I will continue to promote Indiana across the nation and internationally.” 
 Traveling for other, political purposes?

Unlike other state employees, the State Personnel Department has little oversight over elected officials. Elected officials don’t punch a time clock or have limits on personal or vacation time. And there are few restrictions or transparency about travel. 
The latter could change following a new state law mandating that such officeholders report their travel expenses from trips “taken in an official capacity” and whether state funding was used. It’s unclear if this would capture Morales’ international trips, where he spoke as Indiana Secretary of State but wasn’t explicitly on state business. 
“Broadly, the travel that Diego Morales is doing is frequently not tied to the day-to-day functions of his secretary of state duties,” Shufeldt said. “Moreover, if you assume that one of his chief responsibilities is the lead election official in the state, Hungary is not the place to go.” 
Indiana SOS publicly posts about India trip after 10 days away

Hungary is no longer considered a democracy to European Union officials, but the CPAC conference could be a jumping off point for other offices for Morales. His wife is also Honorary Consul of Hungary to Indiana.
“He is an ambitious politician and if his end goal was to be secretary of state, he probably wouldn’t be engaging in these sorts of things,” said Shufeldt. “But he’s trying to cement himself in conservative circles outside of the state — whether that is for a future gubernatorial run or congressional run — these things are very clearly tactical, strategic choices to put himself in conservative or illiberal spaces.” 
Former statewide elected officials, speaking generally about office travel, told the Indiana Capital Chronicle they tried not to overlap personal vacations with official duties. 
“Vacation time was limited for me. And when I had vacation time, I valued that and prioritized that with my family,” said Tim Berry, who has held multiple statewide offices. “I really tried to ensure that (it) was reserved just for family time and tried to keep that somewhat separate as much as possible.” 
Berry, a former Indiana Republican Party chair, served as the state’s auditor from 2007 until 2013 after being state treasurer for eight years. 
Critics have questioned if paying for Morales’ international trips would qualify as a campaign contribution. He recently revealed that he paid back the business that initially covered the excursion to India to protect them from “the crazy left,” as reported by State Affairs Indiana. 
Morales is no stranger to criticism. The politician started his term by hiring his brother-in-law for a six-figure position — a loophole to the state’s nepotism law — and bought a $90,000 vehicle with taxpayer money. Additionally, he showered his team with spot bonuses and has been accused of using his office for self-promotion with his name in large font on yard signs, an election security guide and printed maps — the latter of which was criticized by a sitting senator. 
Most recently, the office spent $100,000 for 5-second public service messages on digital billboards around the state, flashing messages about voting alongside directives to learn more about the office’s business and automotive dealership oversight. 
 The challengers

Self-described election nerd Shelton spends much of his time tinkering with and thinking about the minutiae of administration, having won recognition from the U.S. Election Assistance Commission for designing stabilizer brackets for e-pollbooks and improving accessibility for disabled voters. 
But, when he just started out, he said he conferred with other clerks rather than getting assistance from the secretary of state’s office. Even today, “they don’t have that experience” in the office, he said. 
“When you become a county clerk, you’re left, basically, to your own devices on how to learn to do the job,” Shelton said. “One of the things that I want to do is set up an in-person, intensive election boot camp for new clerks. Because our elections are not something you can learn by watching a PowerPoint presentation.”


The eventual Republican nominee might face a familiar name in the fall. 
Beau Bayh, son of former Indiana governor and U.S. Senator Evan Bayh, is said to be interested. He told the Indiana Capital Chronicle he can’t comment as a federal courts employee but his clerkship ends in August. 
Libertarian Lauri Shillings has also signaled her intention to seek her party’s nomination.


Since his showing at the 2022 convention, Shelton said some delegates have expressed “extreme buyer’s remorse” to him. 
“I’m telling people that I want to be a very boring secretary of state,” Shelton summarized. 
For her part, Reitenour calls for a return to paper ballots, fortifying Indiana’s election oversight and more state leadership aligned with President Donald Trump. 
“There’s been more than enough from the President’s administration … in regards to foreign adversaries and the fact that our elections are targeted. So it needs to be taken really seriously,” Reitenour said. “… Obviously, I’m a fan of President Trump. I’m an even greater fan of his leadership. I just think it’s unparalleled the way he’s approached politics … I intend to operate with that same diligence.”
She also vowed to hold weekly press conferences and emphasized the need for an officeholder who balances consumer and business interests, rather than someone who favors one party over the other. 
“I think (the office) will be unrecognizable. It’ll be like, ‘That was Diego traveling the world and this is Jamie right now.’ We’ll be focused on the state of Indiana,” Reitenour concluded. 
Indianapolis Rep. Andrew Ireland has also been floated as a possible contender, though he declined to comment for this story. 
Candidates willing to challenge an incumbent “is a promising sign for small-d democracy,” said Shufeldt, though the outcome is less certain.
Morales himself defeated incumbent Secretary of State Holli Sullivan in 2022, but he was appointed by former Gov. Eric Holcomb and lost due to pandemic-era pushback to Holcomb.
Delegates also rejected the establishment candidate, Rep. Julie McGuire, in favor of Micah Beckwith in the nomination for lieutenant governor last summer, signaling continued support for unconventional candidates.
“It doesn’t necessarily bode well for that more pragmatic … governing wing of the Republican party,” said Shufeldt. “Right now, the actions of Morales and Beckwith appear to be the types of actions I would think come from a politician that thinks they’re untouchable.”

DemasEarly data from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services suggests that deaths from opioid overdoses may have declined for the third year in a row. 
According to provisional data from the MDHHS, the state saw a 34% decline in overdose deaths between 2023 and 2024, a decrease of roughly 1,000 deaths.
In response Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel applauded the state’s work to reduce opioid deaths through prevention, treatment, recovery and harm reduction options, many of which are funded by Michigan’s participation in national opioid settlements. 
“The progress we are seeing in combatting the opioid epidemic proves what is possible when real investments are made in treatment and prevention,” Nessel said in a statement. “My office will continue working to hold those responsible for this crisis accountable to ensure the health and well-being of residents are put ahead of corporate greed and help support long-term recovery efforts for Michigan families.”
Since taking office in 2019, Nessel has helped secure more than $1.6 billion in settlements from companies including McKinsey & Co, Distributors Cardinal Health, McKesson, Inc., and AmerisourceBergen, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Teva Pharmaceutical, Allergan Pharmaceutical, CVS, Walmart and Walgreens.
The majority of these settlement funds are distributed equally between local governments and the state’s Opioid Healing and Recovery Fund. The funds also supported the distribution of more than 1.3 million naloxone kits – alongside other efforts – which have been used to reverse overdose in nearly 34,000 reported instances. 
The state’s chief medical executive, Natasha Bagdasarian, noted that this most recent year of data puts Michigan among the top 5 states for reducing opioid deaths. 
“Through the work of the Michigan Opioids Task Force and our local partners, we’ve distributed more than a million naloxone kits, strengthened our data systems, prevented thousands of overdose deaths using naloxone, and helped people access the care and support they need,” Bagdasarian said in a statement.

Etched into law in 2019, the public long-term care insurance program known as WA Cares survived an attempt to torpedo it at the ballot box last year. Already, $2 billion in tax collections have been banked in the program’s trust fund through the end of March.
Lawmakers continue to fine-tune the program ahead of its rollout next summer.
This past legislative session brought revisions intended to welcome back thousands of people who opted out of the program and to unite the state-run, worker-funded entitlement with private long-term care insurers.
“It’s a test case for the nation. It’s going to be amazing when we roll it out,” said Cathy Knight, state director of the Washington Association of Area Agencies on Aging. “We’ve needed something like this for a long time. It’s not perfect. But for people going through a difficult time, it will be a tremendous help.”
Other states are watching. Like Washington, they face rising costs of care for an aging population, tight state budgets and uncertainties around federal support for Medicaid, said Ben Veghte, director of WA Cares for the Department of Social and Health Services.
“Nobody wants to leave families unprotected dealing with this risk,” he said. “This is seen by many states as a promising model.”
The basics
WA Cares is funded with a 0.58% tax on the paychecks of workers in Washington. It amounts to just under $25 a month for those earning $50,000 a year, rising to $39 a month for those making $80,000 annually.
Collections by the state began in July 2023. A person pays as long as they are working in the state. Deductions stop if they retire, become unemployed or leave the workforce, and resume if the person returns to work.
Beginning on July 1, 2026, those living in Washington who qualify can begin accessing the long-term care benefit, which has a lifetime cap of $36,500, adjusted over time for inflation. Eligible beneficiaries living out of state can tap into benefits starting July 1, 2030. 
The money can be used to offset expenses like in-home caretaking, respite for family caregivers, equipment, medication and meals for people who are older, injured or disabled. In all, 19 different types of services are covered. 
There are two paths to becoming eligible for the full benefit amount – contribute for 10 years or pay in for three years within the last six from the date they apply for benefits. Near-retirees, defined as those born before 1968, who do not become eligible for the full amount will earn a pro-rated share of 10% for each year they work.
A person must work at least 500 hours during the year to earn a qualifying year.
Not every worker is in the program. Before the state started collecting payroll taxes — deemed premiums by the state — those with qualifying private long-term care insurance could opt out. An estimated 413,000 individuals chose this option, according to the Employment Security Department.
A work in progress
This program has faced criticism since its inception. 
Some objected to its mandatory nature. Others said it was unfair that if someone stopped working for a while, then returned, they lost credit for the contributions made before the break.
Critics and supporters said there should be exemptions for people who work in Washington but live out of state. And there was pressure to make the benefits “portable,” so if a person moved out of state after paying into the fund, they would be able to access the benefits.
As the pile of concerns grew, the Legislature passed a law in January 2022 delaying the start of payroll tax collections and delivery of benefits by 18 months, providing time to retool in response to critiques.
Changes made since then allow older workers nearing retirement to get partial benefits. The list of exemptions expanded to include people who live outside of Washington but work in the state, spouses of active-duty military service members, those with non-immigrant work visas, and veterans who meet certain disability requirements.
Meanwhile, Let’s Go Washington, a conservative political committee, capitalized on the frustrations in 2023, gathering 424,000 voter signatures to put an initiative targeting the program on the ballot. That measure, which was in front of voters last November, sought to make participation voluntary rather than mandatory, allowing workers to opt out whenever they want. Voters defeated Initiative 2124.
As the political fight played out, lawmakers made more revisions. Some seemed to come in direct response to concerns raised by program critics. Almost all reflected recommendations of the Long Term Services and Supports Commission, the panel of legislators, agency representatives and community members tasked with monitoring and implementing the program.
A law passed in 2024 makes the benefit available for those who leave the state if they’ve paid into the fund during their career.
And a few weeks ago, Gov. Bob Ferguson signed Senate Bill 5291, which makes several notable alterations.
It allows workers to rescind their private insurance exemptions and opt in. The period to rescind exemptions starts Jan. 1, 2026 and ends July 1, 2028.

State officials said they’ve heard from people who are interested because premiums for their policies have increased. Others said that the array of changes, such as making it possible to use benefits outside of Washington, made it worth joining.
The new law assures people who get out of the workforce for any period of time will resume building credit toward full eligibility when they return. It also provides automatic exemptions for active-duty military members with off-duty civilian work and non-immigrant visa holders.
And it opens a path for private insurers to create supplemental long-term care insurance policies designed for individuals with WA Cares benefits. This is expected to result in options for long-term care that are more affordable.
As envisioned, WA Cares benefits would cover the deductible of the private plan. So when an individual uses up their benefits, the supplemental private plan they purchase will kick in. 
Private plans will need approval by the Office of the Insurance Commissioner. 
There will be some requirements for the private plans. They must provide at least 12 months of coverage after WA Cares benefits are exhausted and allow people to keep their current care providers when transitioning between programs. The policies must also include options to reduce benefits rather than lose coverage if someone becomes unable to pay increased premiums, and they must cover care provided by qualified family members.
Finally, the new law clears the way to test the system for managing eligibility and paying providers. Up to 400 people in four counties — Thurston, Mason, Lewis and Spokane — are to be part of a pilot program that would run from Jan. 1, 2026 up until the formal launch.
There’s much work to be done in the next 13 months. Veghte is convinced the payoff will be felt across the state.
Aging is a phase of life “when we’re all extremely vulnerable. I’ve seen it with both my parents how vulnerable you can become when you’re frail and can’t live independently,” he said. “Having a pot of money the family can use to support that person in those times is a tremendous improvement in the quality of life for aging Washingtonians.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/long-term-care-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-06 08:05:41.938341

Utah is among several Western states seeking to reduce federal land ownership. (Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Public outcry was swift and forceful after a U.S. House committee last month hastily approved an amendment directing the federal government to sell off more than half a million acres of public land.
A few days later, lawmakers advanced the larger bill — a sweeping list of President Donald Trump’s priorities — but stripped the federal lands provision.
Yet leaders on both sides of the issue say the battle over selling off federal lands is likely just heating up.
Some conservatives in Western states have complained for decades that the feds control too much of the land within their borders. They see a long-awaited opportunity in a Trump administration that’s sympathetic to their cause. Public lands advocates are bracing for more attempts to turn land over to states, industry groups and developers.
“The threat level is red alert,” said Randi Spivak, public lands policy director with the Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental nonprofit. “Some of these states have been champing at the bit for decades to privatize. They’re certainly not going to let this opportunity pass without an aggressive effort.”
 The ‘balance sheet’

In Western states, where most federally owned lands are located, some leaders view these lands as a treasured inheritance — places reserved for all Americans and critical for wildlife, tourism and outdoor recreation. Others feel that too much of the land in their states is controlled by officials in Washington, D.C., leaving it off-limits for development and curtailing its economic value.
Trump officials and allies have embraced the latter view. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum has repeatedly called federal lands America’s “balance sheet,” describing them as untapped assets worth trillions of dollars. He has launched an effort to identify federal lands suitable for housing development.
Other proposals have centered around using land sales to pay for tax breaks or to finance Trump’s proposed government-run fund that could invest in stocks or real estate.
For some state leaders, the newfound interest at the federal level to turn public lands into cash — along with Trump’s cuts to land management agency staff — aligns with a long-standing movement to reduce federal ownership.
“I look at it as an opportunity to say, ‘Hey, turn it over to the state,’” said Utah House Speaker Mike Schultz, a Republican.
Utah leaders have made the most forceful push to challenge federal land ownership. The state filed a legal challenge last year seeking to take control of more than 18 million acres of “unappropriated” lands — parcels held by the federal government without a specific designation such as a national park or monument. That effort hit a roadblock earlier this year when the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the case.
But with Trump in the White House, state leaders may pivot from challenging the feds in court to seeking their cooperation.
“We would love if the federal government just turned it over to us and said, ‘Here, manage these lands,’” Schultz said. “That’s an option as well. Those are discussions that are happening. Everything is on the table.”
Schultz declined to say which federal officials have been involved in discussions about transferring lands to the state.
Some lawmakers in Wyoming backed a state resolution this year — which ultimately failed — calling on Congress to hand over all federal lands except for Yellowstone National Park. Idaho lawmakers passed a measure calling on the feds to turn over a wildlife refuge to the state. And Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo, a Republican, has called for a “systematic release” of federal land in the state.
But public lands also have many supporters in Western states, including some prominent Republican members of Congress, such as Reps. Mike Simpson of Idaho and Ryan Zinke of Montana. Zinke was Interior secretary for two years during the first Trump administration.
John Leshy, who served as solicitor for the U.S. Department of the Interior during the Clinton administration, said proposals to dispose of federal lands tend to be stymied by fierce public backlash.
“Federal lands are really popular,” he said. “It’s political poison [to sell off public land]. It’s a different West now. Public attitudes have changed.”
Leshy also noted that livestock ranchers especially benefit from discounted lease rates offered by the federal government.
 Housing arguments

The most recent clash over the future of federal lands was the amendment sponsored by a pair of congressional Republicans last month. The measure would have directed the Bureau of Land Management to sell more than 500,000 acres of land in Nevada and Utah. Local governments would have been able to buy the land at market value, with no restrictions on how they used it.
Backers said the sale would bring in revenue to cover Trump’s proposed tax cuts, while allowing local governments to build much-needed housing on the parcels. Utah GOP Sen. Mike Lee said he will try to revive the measure as the Senate considers the bill this month, E&E News reported.

In Nevada, where 85% of land is owned by the federal government, some leaders say their communities are hemmed in by a checkerboard of public lands that constrain development. The city of Fernley, which is growing rapidly, would have acquired 12,000 acres under the proposal.
“We need housing,” said Benjamin Marchant, Fernley’s city manager. “The city can’t plan roads and water lines, sewer lines and gas lines, when you have federal land between two parcels that want to develop. This will bring a practical and helpful consolidation of all these lands into one developable area.”
Nevada leaders have long worked on proposals to transfer some federal lands to local governments and allow for increased growth. But some lawmakers say the latest push bypassed that collaborative process — and failed to include safeguards that the money raised from the sale of the lands would be reinvested into conserving public lands elsewhere.
“It was a complete betrayal of everything we’ve worked on in this state,” said Assemblymember Howard Watts, a Democrat. “This amendment is trying to sell off half a million acres of Nevada’s public lands in order to pay for tax cuts for billionaires. This is not going to address our housing problem. These lands are positioned to be sold off for other forms of development and extraction.”
Similar debates are happening in Utah. In southwestern Utah’s Washington County, local officials say the disposal of federally controlled land could help alleviate the region’s housing crisis and increasingly strained infrastructure.
The county is experiencing rapid population growth — in 2022, St. George, the county seat, was the fastest-growing metro area in America. County and city leaders hoped the amendment would have helped them manage the growth. The measure would have disposed of roughly 11,500 acres of federally controlled land in Utah, selling it at market value to local governments.
The proposal received pushback from all sides, including environmentalists, hunting and fishing groups, House Democrats and even conservatives.
“[The amendment] is consistent with how U.S. Department of the Interior Secretary Burgum thinks about federal public lands, as simply assets on a ledger to be sold off,” said Steve Bloch, legal director for the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, an environmental nonprofit. ” … It’s just antithetical to how Westerners think about the federal public lands that make up so much of our landscape.”
Washington County Commissioner Adam Snow, a Republican, said a lot of the opposition was misguided. The county would have acquired almost half of the land earmarked for disposal, and Snow said much of that would have been used to widen existing roads and construct new ones that are bordered by Bureau of Land Management property.
“These were not pristine wilderness lands. Some of the environmental groups tried to make it sound like we’re selling off Zion National Park, and that’s not even close to true,” Snow said. “If we can just not have to deal with the federal government every time we want to chip seal a road or improve an intersection, that would be really nice. Because we have to ask ‘Mother, may I?’ for everything out here.”
Local leaders say federal parcels could help ease housing pressures as well. Snow said transferring parcels to the city or county is one of the only ways to stop the area from becoming wildly expensive.
“We’re running out of room real quick,” he said. “ … There is still private land to develop, but they’re going to charge an absolute premium.”
The amendment that was stripped from the House bill was widely criticized for not having any restrictions on what could be done with the land.
“There was no language whatsoever that would require Washington County or St. George to do anything with these lands. They could lease them for development. They could sell them outright,” said Bloch.
 The costs of management

In Utah, lawmakers have created a state Department of Land Management — essentially a placeholder agency that would be funded and staffed only if their effort to assume control of large swaths of federal land succeeds. Schultz, the House speaker, said the state is committed to keeping the lands in the public domain, reopening roads and campgrounds closed by the feds.

“We’d just take over the job from the federal government,” he said. “It is something that the state absolutely would do, and we’d do it more efficiently, more effectively and we’d have better outcomes.”
Schultz said the state could bring in the revenues needed to manage the land by raising lease prices for oil and gas operations on parcels currently managed for drilling.
But some public lands advocates say that’s not realistic. The federal Bureau of Land Management employed more than 950 people in the state as of 2024, and feds also assume the expensive task of wildfire management on their lands.
“If you look at the history of what Utah has done with their lands, they’ve sold more than half of them,” said Devin O’Dea, Western policy and conservation manager with Backcountry Hunters & Anglers. “We’re certainly of the perspective that states could not handle the economic costs of managing these lands. Their hand would be forced; they would have to sell these lands in order to deal with those costs.”
John Robison, Idaho Conservation League public lands and wildlife director, said Simpson — the Idaho congressman — and the state’s two senators have all won praise from constituents for their work on public lands compromises.
“Savvy Idaho politicians know that public lands are popular,” he said.
But other state leaders insist their governments are better equipped to manage the lands. Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador, a Republican, was among the officials who signed an amicus brief in support of Utah’s lawsuit against the feds.
“We live here, we work here, and we are far better stewards of our forests and resources than federal bureaucrats in Washington,” Labrador said in a statement. “ … If Idaho owned this land, we could lease it for timber, grazing, and mining — just like the federal government does — but reinvest that revenue right here in Idaho.”

(Photo from Indiana State Archives)Many Hoosiers recently learned that Indiana has an immunity statute that protects lawmakers from some arrests during the legislative session. The reaction has been surprise and frustration.
One social media user posted, “How have we gotten to the point in this state where our elected leaders are above the law? This is pure insanity & would NEVER be acceptable for the average citizen.”
Another reader responded, “Are they immune from common sense too?”
So, I thought I would delve into the provision and explain why it exists and how often it’s used.
History
State Sen. Mike Bohacek was pulled over for suspected drunk driving in January and recorded a blood-alcohol content of 0.238%. But the Michiana Shores Republican wasn’t charged until this week due to the legislative immunity provision.
The first important fact is that no modern-day lawmaker created this exemption, and it basically mirrors a similar provision for federal lawmakers. The National Conference of State Legislatures said most state constitutions contain similar provisions.
The state’s prohibition is found in Article 4, Section 8 of the Indiana Constitution.
“Senators and Representatives, in all cases except treason, felony, and breach of the peace, shall be privileged from arrest, during the session of the General Assembly, and in going to and returning from the same; and shall not be subject to any civil process, during the session of the General Assembly, nor during the fifteen days next before the commencement thereof.”
Indiana’s current Constitution was adopted in 1851 with numerous amendments since then. But this portion goes back as far as the state’s 1816 constitution before Indiana became a state. Then it was under Article 3.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
For a long time, there was no definition of breach of the peace in Indiana code but lawmakers in 2021 added one: “breaking or disturbing the public peace, order, or decorum by any riotous, forcible, or unlawful proceedings, including fighting or tumultuous conduct.”
The federal immunity provision is almost exact. Some historical texts indicate the language was created so that lawmakers weren’t blocked from being able to vote on a matter or otherwise participate in proceedings.
In his Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story said this:
“When a representative is withdrawn from his seat by a summons, the people whom he represents, lose their voice in debate and vote, as they do in his voluntary absence. When a senator is withdrawn by summons, his state loses half its voice in debate and vote, as it does in his voluntary absence. The enormous disparity of the evil admits of no comparison. The privilege, indeed, is deemed not merely the privilege of the member, or his constituents, but the privilege of the house also.”
The Supreme Court of the United States has interpreted the provision to apply to all crimes, but Indiana has generally seen it used in cases of misdemeanors.
Examples
Bohacek’s case is almost identical to one from 1992 when then-Rep. Keith Bulen was pulled over for drunk driving in January. Police also didn’t arrest him due to the immunity clause and he was charged weeks later after session ended. Similar to Bohacek, Bulen refused the breathalyzer test and said a prescribed medicine made him groggy. But Bulen’s incident resulted in him hitting an off-duty police officer’s car.
Bulen’s case, though, was not hidden from public view at the time. He was eventually acquitted.
In 2002, two northwest Indiana lawmakers — Reps. Charlie Brown and Vernon Smith — used the provision to contest their criminal case.
The Gary Post Tribune reported the pair was arrested June 18 on traffic and related offenses. They protested the action and claimed they were shown a lack of respect as elected officials and residents.
The legislature was in special session in Indianapolis, although the men were in Gary.
They were arrested immediately but the chief of police quickly apologized. The men were charged with obstructing traffic later that year by a special prosecutor. Smith was acquitted but Brown was found guilty.
If Hoosiers want to change the constitutional provision they will have to convince lawmakers to start that years-long process because Indiana doesn’t allow citizen-initiated constitutional amendments or referendums.
It remains to be seen what will happen to Bohacek, including any punishment by leaders of the Senate. Voters have the ultimate say on consequences at the ballot box, but they will have to wait a long time. Bohacek isn’t up for election again until 2028.

Missouri U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley was clear in his priorities for the legislation, writing in early May that “slashing health insurance for the working poor is … both morally wrong and politically suicidal.” President Donald Trump was blunter, telling lawmakers not to “f**k around with Medicaid.”
The bill passed by the House, does not pass their test – it does not, as Trump and Hawley claim, contain “NO MEDICAID BENEFIT CUTS.” Instead, it will kick millions of people off of Medicaid by piling on new red tape. And it will bury under-resourced state Medicaid offices in so much paperwork that they will be at risk of collapse. 
Together, these forces will mean that eligible Americans in Missouri and around the country will not have access to their Medicaid. Many will be left without health care as they prepare to bring a child into the world, face a new cancer diagnosis, or manage a chronic illness. In other words, if this bill passes, Medicaid will be cut for Missourians when they most need it. 
The House bill imposes new bureaucratic requirements on Medicaid beneficiaries, forcing them to file piles of new paperwork about their jobs, schools, disabilities, or sick family members to keep the health insurance they are already eligible for under the law.
These so-called “work requirements” do not boost employment as advertised – experiments in other states have repeatedly failed to do so. This is, in part, because the vast majority of Medicaid beneficiaries who can work already do. That makes sense – you can’t buy food and pay rent with a health insurance card. 
The reason this bill reduces the cost of Medicaid by billions of dollars is that it assumes regular people will get tangled in the red tape of proving they are eligible for Medicaid. Experts project that over 10 million eligible people will lose their health care because of all the paperwork, including over 180,000 Missourians.
But we believe that even this prognosis is too optimistic. Most analyses only consider the difficulty that people will have proving that they are entitled to Medicaid under the law, but not the difficulty states will have in administering the new paperwork requirements.
We have spent the last several years modernizing the systems that deliver benefits to millions of Americans, including Medicaid. What we have learned is that state Medicaid systems, including MO HealthNet, are already on the brink – and lack the resources and resilience to take on the onslaught of requirements and deadlines about to hit them. Trump’s tax legislation, the new requirements it imposes, and the lightning-fast timeline it requires, are setting Medicaid up for a collapse. 
Here’s how it could play out. States are responsible for determining Medicaid eligibility. They allow people to enroll in one of four ways – by mailing in documents, enrolling online, applying over the phone, or walking into a physical office. Each of these pathways is already at a tipping point.
Medicaid agencies around the country have staff vacancies as high as 30 percent, which means there are already too few workers to open mail, process applications, answer the phones, and staff walk-in centers. As a result, even under the current system, eligible people can see their Medicaid lapse because their paperwork is not processed in time.
Missourians have recent experience with the effects of an overburdened Medicaid system. By law, Medicaid applications are supposed to be processed in 45 days, but as of last May, Missouri missed that deadline 72% of the time – the worst record in the nation – causing the federal government to step in to help for the second time in two years. The wait time on the Medicaid call center was 56 minutes in February 2024.
The House bill will immediately explode the workload for state Medicaid offices. Medicaid beneficiaries will need to prove their eligibility twice a year instead of annually. 
And then it piles on the new paperwork rules. Missouri will have to figure out how to verify that a beneficiary is working, going to school, or meeting the new requirements some other way. They’ll need to send out millions of paper notices, emails, and text messages to notify enrollees about the changes and train staff to handle the deluge of documents that will flood in. Just hours before the bill passed, Congress quietly moved up the deadline for states to make these changes, requiring implementation by the end of 2026 or sooner.
And all this new bureaucracy rests on technology that is already failing. We’ve seen just how broken states’ health care infrastructure is – Luke helped uncover state software errors that improperly terminated coverage for nearly 500,000 eligible kids across 29 states after the pandemic. The added strain imposed by this legislation will crash websites, jam call centers, and trigger even more software errors – trapping working people in the chaos.
Under these conditions, failure isn’t just likely — it’s inevitable. 
We don’t need to guess at how this plays out. When Arkansas tried to implement Medicaid work requirements in 2018 the results were disastrous. People received confusing instructions about how to prove they were working and many never knew about the requirement. The state’s website repeatedly crashed. In the end, more than 18,000 people lost coverage, employment rates did not budge, and the state wasted $26 million on a failed experiment. 
In some states, that will mean lines around the block at overwhelmed county offices. In others, dropped calls, system outages, and piles of unprocessed renewals. These challenges compound. When the website breaks, you call. When your call drops, you drive to the office. Attrition will spike as the overmatched Medicaid staff are increasingly under siege, overtime is mandatory, and time off is cancelled. Smaller and smaller numbers of staff will bear larger and larger workloads until the system collapses.
And, eligible Americans – working adults, kids, seniors, students, and adults with illnesses and disabilities –  will still have no Medicaid. Hospitals will provide more uncompensated coverage, putting some – especially rural hospitals and children’s hospitals – at risk of failure.
This bill sets up state Medicaid agencies to fail at their most basic task – ensuring that eligible people have health insurance. It doesn’t matter to a pregnant mom why her Medicaid is cut, she is going to miss prenatal visits and skip her toddler’s check-up. If Hawley wants to stand up for over one million Missourians who rely on Medicaid, he should oppose this bill.

“We’ve had some good conversations in the last few weeks between the governor and the legislative leaders, and unfortunately, those, you know, conversations have stopped,” Born said.
Lawmakers and Evers announced Wednesday evening that their months-long negotiations had reached an impasse for the time being. 
Republicans said they would move forward writing the budget on their own, saying the state couldn’t afford what Evers wanted, and Evers said Republicans were walking away because they refused to compromise. Evers had said he was willing to support Republican tax cut proposals that even as they were similar to proposals he previously vetoed.
“The spending really that the governor needs is just more than they can afford,” Born said Thursday, “and it’s getting to the point where it’s about 3 to 1 compared to the tax cuts that we were looking at.”
He declined to share specifics about the amounts that were being discussed.
“I don’t think we’re going to relive the conversations of the last few weeks in any details, but certainly, you know, we’ve been focused on tax cuts for retirees and the middle class,” Born said. 
Evers’ spokesperson Britt Cudaback said in an email that Republicans’ “math is not remotely accurate.”
Despite the breakdown in discussions, the GOP lawmakers said they were optimistic about the potential for Evers to sign the budget they write, noting that he has signed budget bills passed by Republicans three times in his tenure as governor.
“I’m very hopeful that we will do a responsible budget that we can afford that addresses the major priorities and a lot of the priorities that I think the governor’s office has,” Marklein said. “I’m very hopeful that the governor will sign the budget.” 
Democrats on the Joint Finance Committee were less optimistic about the prospect for the budget to receive support from across the aisle, saying that it likely wouldn’t adequately address the issues at the top of mind for Wisconsinites, including public K-12 education, public universities and child care.
“We’re going to see a budget that prioritizes more tax breaks for the wealthiest among us at the expense of all of the rest of us and a budget from finance that will get no Democratic votes and that will likely be vetoed by the governor,” Sen. Kelda Roys (D-Madison) said. 
Roys said they didn’t know about the specifics of what Evers had agreed to. 
“We can’t really speculate on that, but I can say that we absolutely support the process and the idea of collaborative, shared government,” Roys said. “We are committed to that. We have been ready from Day One to sit down with our Republic colleagues to negotiate.” 
She said for now JFC Democrats will focus on providing alternatives to Republicans’ plans.
“We’re going to do our best to advocate for what Wisconsinites have said they want to need,” Roys said. “We want a lower cost for families. We want to make sure that our kids are the first priority in the budget, and we’re going to be offering the Republicans the opportunity to vote in favor of those things.” 
There is less than a month until the June 30 deadline for the Legislature to pass and Evers to sign the state budget. If the budget isn’t passed on time, then state agencies continue to operate under the current funding levels. 
Committee approves bonding authority for clean water fund
While negotiations have hit a wall, some committee’s actions on Thursday received bipartisan support. 
The committee unanimously approved an additional $732 million in bonding authority for the Environmental Improvement Fund (EIF). The program uses a combination of federal grants from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s clean water and drinking water state revolving funds and matching state funds to provide subsidized loans to municipalities for drinking water, wastewater and storm water infrastructure projects. 
“This is going to be very good for a lot of our local communities when it comes to clean water,” Marklein said ahead of the meeting. He noted that many communities were on a waiting list for their projects.
The Department of Administration and the Department of Natural Resources told lawmakers in late 2024 that that year was the first time the fund had not had enough resources to meet demand.
Demand for aid from the program increased dramatically starting in 2023, with a 154% increase in the clean water fund loan demand in 2023-24 and a 325% increase in demand for the safe drinking water loan program that year. Insufficient funding for the clean water program led to constraints in 2024-25 and left needs unmet for at least 24 projects costing around $73.9 million.
Rep. Deb Andraca (D-Whitefish Bay) said she was thrilled that lawmakers were approving money for infrastructure in the state.
“The state has over $4 billion here,” Andraca said. “A lot of that is one-time money and one-time money should be used for infrastructure — making sure that our communities are in a great position moving forward should the economy turn down.”
The action is meant to cover the next four years of state contributions to the fund.
Sen. Eric Wimberger (R-Oconto) said in a statement the loans will help Wisconsin communities address aging infrastructure and water contaminants.
“With these additional funds, municipalities will be able to access low-interest loans to modernize their water systems, saving local taxpayers millions of dollars and keeping their water clean for years to come at the same time,” Wimberger said. 
Peter Burress, government affairs manager for environmental nonprofit Wisconsin Conservation Voters, said including the additional revenue bonding authority in the budget is a “smart, substantive way” to make progress towards ensuring Wisconsinites have “equitable access to safe, affordable drinking water.” 
“We urge every legislator to support this same investment and send it to Gov. Evers for his signature,” Burress said. 
Actions on other agencies get mixed or party-line support
Republicans on the committee approved an additional $500,000 for the Medical College of Wisconsin’s North Side Milwaukee Health Centers Family Medicine Residency Program, which focuses on training family physicians with expertise and skills to provide individualized, evidence-based, culturally competent care to patients and families. 
The measure also included  $250,000 annually starting in 2026-27 for the Northwest Wisconsin Residency Rotation for family medicine residents. According to budget papers, starting the funding in the second year of the budget would allow time to find a hospital partner to support residents. 
Democrats voted against the measure after their proposal for higher funding was shot down by Republicans. The Democrats proposal also called for funding a  Comprehensive Assistance, Recovery, and Empowerment Fellowship Program focusing on treating substance use disorders and anAdvancing Innovation in Residency Education project to improve the behavioral health expertise of family medicine residents.
“I hope that my colleagues are reading national news because we’re seeing lots and lots of research funding being cut,” Andraca said. “The Medical College has lost about $5 million in research grants recently, and in addition to other research programs being canceled, I don’t know who has tried to make an appointment with the primary care physician, but there’s really long wait times right now, and this program is literally designed to bring doctors into the state.” 
Democrats proposed transitioning the Educational Communications Board’s Emergency Weather Warning System from relying on fees for funding to being covered by state general purpose revenue. 
Andraca, in explaining the proposal, said state funding for a system like that is more important now than ever.
“We’re talking weather alerts. We’re talking about making sure that people know when there’s something heading their way. We are in a time where we need these alerts more than ever. In fact, yesterday was an unhealthy air day, and… we’re looking at drastic federal cuts,” Andraca said. 
Republicans rejected the measure and instead approved a 5% increase that will be used on general program operations, transmitter operations and emergency weather warning system operations. Rep. Tip McGuire (D-Kenosha) joined Republicans in favor of the motion. 
The committee also took action on several other agencies with support splitting along party lines
Republicans approved a modification to the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation’s budget, lowering it by $3.8 million, due to projections that surcharge collections appropriated to WEDC will be lower than estimated. They also rejected Democrats’ proposal to provide an additional $5 million in the opportunity attraction and promotion fund, which makes grants to  attract events that will draw national exposure and drive economic development.
WEC budget on pause after DOJ letter
The committee was scheduled to take action on the Wisconsin Elections Commission budget, but delayed that after the U.S. Department of Justice sent a letter to the state agency accusing it of violating the Help America Vote Act. The letter threatened to withhold funding and criticized the absence of  an administrative complaint process or hearings to address complaints against the Commission itself. Ann Jacobs, the commission chair, has disputed the accusations and said there is no funding for the federal government to cut. 
Marklein said the state lawmakers want more information before acting on the agency’s budget.
“Out of caution, we think we’re just going to wait and see,” Marklein said. “We need to analyze this and see what implications there may be for the entire Elections Commission and what impact that may have on the budget.”

The mom said something vague about historical fiction, then stepped away and pulled out her phone. I started to list a few options. But the teen cut me off in a furtive whisper.
“Actually,” they said, staring fiercely up at me, “do you have any books about…” they paused. “Trans stuff? With not-obvious covers?”
We did. My heart swelling, incredibly moved that this kid trusted me, a stranger, with a question they seemed not to trust their own parent with, I got them the books.
This is the unspoken honor code between kids and the keepers of books for kids, be they booksellers, librarians, or teachers — the role I hold now. We keepers of stories are assumed to be the accepters of all kinds of stories, the people that help kids find the books they are seeking, no matter the content, and no matter the kid.
But this important work is in jeopardy. Book bans increasingly tie the hands of adults in these roles, preventing them from connecting kids to the books they’re asking for. 
In February, the U.S. Department of Education rescinded all previous guidance that categorized book banning as a civil rights violation. It also eliminated the Book Ban Coordinator position in its Office for Civil Rights, created by the Biden administration, which investigated schools and libraries that removed books in order to determine legality.
Maine is, thankfully, a state where this practice is not widespread. But in recent years, certain districts have become more aggressive with bans. For example, in 2023, the Hermon School Department partially restricted access to more than 80 books in its high-school library, and MSAD 6 in Buxton banned two titles completely, according to PEN America’s annual survey of book bans.
As a current middle school teacher and former children’s bookseller, I’m worried that this trend will worsen. Removing federal safeguards that protect kids’ free access to books could mean that overturning a ban is much harder. And while policy moves slowly, childhood is quick. If a book spends a year or even a few months off a shelf, that can mean it’s not available during the time when a child reader needs it most.
The vast majority of books challenged in Maine are flagged because of sex and gender-based content or LGBTQ+ representation. It’s no secret that the debate over these books is rooted in controversy over the minority groups that they’re written about. But removing them from shelves will do nothing to impact the existence of those minority groups, which have been a fact of life throughout human history and will remain so, regardless of any policies for or against them. Instead, in wrongfully attempting to censor a category of human identity, we stand to lose the cornerstone of humanity itself: our ability to understand, connect to, and care for each other and ourselves.
A predominant children’s literature theory put forth in 1990 by Dr. Rudine Sims Bishop states that books can be “mirrors, windows, or sliding glass doors”; that is, that a story can replicate a child reader’s own lived experience, allow them to view lives different than their own, or facilitate their entrance into another way of life.
A kid with two moms might read a book where the family structure mirrors their own and feel their experiences validated. A kid struggling to understand their identity might read a book with a nonbinary character and gain the language necessary to describe themselves, helping them move forward into the next chapter of their life. But even a kid who is not a part of the LGBTQ+ community can have an affirming experience with one of these books. Encountering diversity through story, reading books that are “windows,” fosters allyship. Empathy is a component of identity, too.
Kids’ job is to figure themselves out — their own identities, values, and interests. Our job as adults is to love and support them no matter what. Allowing kids to select their own books upholds our end of that unspoken code and empowers them to choose which ways of life beyond their own they have access to. It expands their understanding of the available options. In this way, childhood reading is a powerful tool for exploration, dignity, and self-determination. 
As an educator here in Maine, I’m aware that the most important thing I can teach my students is open-minded curiosity, a mindset that will propel them into a lifetime of learning. More than anything, I hope they apply that curiosity and open-mindedness towards people — both others and themselves. Free access to a diverse range of books is one of the best ways to achieve that goal.

Legislation dismissing pending cases for unlawful carry was again vetoed by Gov. Henry McMaster on May 22, 2025. (Stock photo illustration by Getty Images)COLUMBIA — South Carolinians will continue to face sentencing for a gun charge that’s no longer a crime after Gov. Henry McMaster again vetoed a bill erasing the pending cases.
A law signed by McMaster 15 months ago made it legal for adults to carry handguns without a permit and allowed past convictions for unlawful carry to be expunged. It set a five-year deadline — until March 2029 — for expungement applications. One conviction per person can be expunged.
But the law didn’t address pending cases.
Last year, McMaster vetoed legislation to dismiss those charges. The Legislature tried again this year with another version of the bill, which both chambers passed unanimously. But the governor vetoed that too.
In his May 22 veto letter, the governor made clear his “fundamental objections to the legislation remain unchanged.”
As the state’s former U.S. attorney and two-term attorney general, McMaster said he’s wary of limiting prosecutors’ authority and discretion to resolve those cases.
“Every case is unique and the prosecutors in our state should be permitted to evaluate each case based on law and the facts and then proceed as they deem appropriate,” McMaster wrote. The bill “would universally strip prosecutors of the ability” to determine whether a case warrants dismissal or prosecution.
Besides that, he wrote, it was a crime when they were charged.
“Their alleged actions were, in fact, unlawful,” he wrote. “To be sure, those actions might not be illegal today, but that distinction misses the critical point that such actions were illegal at the time they were committed.”
The question is whether the House will vote this time to override the governor’s veto.
Last year, the Senate voted unanimously to override the governor’s veto, but it takes a supermajority vote in both chambers for a bill to become law despite a veto. And the House never took it up. So, the bill died.
Last week, the Senate again voted unanimously to overrule the latest veto. The House never brought it up during the Legislature’s one-day special session to adopt the budget. But this time, an override is still possible next year.
House Judiciary Chairman Weston Newton said the chamber will likely take a vote when they return in January. The chamber’s unanimous approval of the bill May 8 suggests an override won’t be a problem, he said.
“It’s dismissing charges that are no longer illegal for the purposes of consistency,” said the Bluffton Republican.
Following passage in March 2024 of the law allowing any adult who can legally buy a handgun to carry it with or without a concealed carry permit, some solicitors dismissed older charges of unlawful possession on their own. But it wasn’t automatic. Some solicitors didn’t.
As of February, 206 people in 11 of South Carolina’s 16 judicial districts had charges pending for that crime alone, according to Lisa Catalanotto, the executive director for the state Commission on Prosecution Coordination.
She didn’t have numbers from the other five judicial districts.
More cases have been dropped since she last collected the numbers in February, said Catalanotto, who didn’t yet have an update.
But a decline isn’t good enough. No one should face conviction for something that’s no longer a crime, said Sen. Deon Tedder, who was again the chief sponsor. This time, three Republicans joined him in co-sponsoring the legislation.

“We had to act as a Legislature. It’s simply not fair,” said Tedder, D-Charleston.
He voted against the bill that legalized carrying a handgun without a permit, which supporters dubbed “constitutional carry.”
But anyone charged with a crime the Legislature has determined is unconstitutional certainly shouldn’t be convicted now, Tedder said.
“This fixes something that we missed,” he said.
During legislative hearings, opponents of the bill argued some people charged with the crime were known violent offenders, and unlawful carry was just the crime they could be arrested for at the time to build a case.
Catalanotto, with the prosecution commission, gave the example of a person who went to a former workplace with a gun, intending to shoot someone, but was chased away at the door. An officer arrested the person for unlawfully carrying a weapon with the intent to add additional charges later, she said.
But Tedder pointed to a sentence in the law specifying that an “immediate dismissal” isn’t mandated if the charge was made “in conjunction with any other criminal offense arising out of the same facts and circumstances.
The bill also specifies that a dismissed charge can’t be the basis of an unlawful arrest lawsuit — another concern of law enforcement that McMaster said in his veto letter he appreciated legislators addressing.

(Photo courtesy of Aqeela Sherrills)Community-based violence intervention programs nationwide have long worked alongside law enforcement officers to deescalate conflict, prevent retaliatory shootings and, in some cases, arrive at crime scenes before police do.
In many communities, these initiatives have been credited with saving lives and reducing violence.
But the Trump administration last month abruptly terminated at least 373 public safety grants from the U.S. Department of Justice’s Office of Justice Programs, pulling roughly $500 million in remaining funds across a range of programs, according to a new report by the Council on Criminal Justice, a nonprofit think tank. The cuts come just as summer is approaching — a season when violence consistently peaks.
The grants were initially valued at $820 million, but many were multiyear awards at different stages of rollout, which means some of the money has already been spent.
At least 554 organizations across 48 states are affected by the cuts, many of them small, community-based nonprofits that rely on this money. The rescinded grants supported everything from violence prevention and policing to victim advocacy, reentry services, research, and mental health and substance use treatment. Some of the grants also were cut from state and local government agencies.
Another new report from the Council on Criminal Justice dug deeper into local effects: It found that the Trump administration’s cuts also eliminated 473 minigrants — known as “subawards” — passed from primary recipients to smaller groups that often face challenges accessing federal dollars directly, such as rural government agencies and grassroots nonprofits.
About $5 million of those subawards was intended for state, local and tribal law enforcement agencies working to reduce violence in rural areas, according to the report.
Experts warn the timing couldn’t be worse. The summer months — historically linked to higher rates of violent crimes — are approaching, and the safety net in many cities is fraying. A growing body of research has found a correlation between spikes in temperature and violent crime, with studies suggesting that heat waves and sudden weather swings can inflame tensions and increase aggression.
“These programs are having to cut staff and cut services, and that will be felt in communities in states all over the country at exactly the time when they’re most needed,” said Amy Solomon, a senior fellow at the Council on Criminal Justice and the lead author of the report.
Solomon also previously served as assistant U.S. attorney general in the Biden administration, where she led the Office of Justice Programs — the Justice Department’s largest grantmaking agency.
Many of the primary grants that were terminated contained no references to race, gender or diversity-related language, according to the report — despite claims from federal officials that such criteria were driving the cuts. Primary grant recipients received their funding from the feds directly.
 ‘Wasteful grants’

U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi defended the cuts in a late April post on X, stating that the department has cut “millions of dollars in wasteful grants.” She also signaled that additional cuts may be on the way. In her post, she specifically cited grants that supported LGBTQ+ liaison services in police departments and programs providing gender-affirming care and housing for incarcerated transgender people.
The Department of Justice’s cuts come amid a broader push by the Trump administration and the newly created Department of Government Efficiency to pull funding from a range of federal programs — a move they say is aimed at reducing spending and saving taxpayer dollars.
For some groups, the sudden withdrawal of funds has meant scaling back crime victim services or pulling out of some neighborhoods altogether.
Community violence prevention groups aim to stop shootings and other forms of violence before they happen by working directly with those most at risk. Staff — often with experience in the justice system — mediate conflicts, respond to crises, and connect people to support such as counseling or job training. In some cities, they’re dispatched to high-risk areas to deescalate tensions, often before police arrive.
And research shows that community-level violence prevention programs can contribute to drops in crime.
After a historic surge in homicides in 2020, violent crime in the United States dropped in 2024 to pre-pandemic levels — or even lower — in many cities. Preliminary 2025 data suggests that the downward trend is continuing in major cities, including Baltimore, Houston, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.
But the progress hasn’t reached every community. Some neighborhoods are still grappling with high rates of gun violence and car theft.
Organizations that faced the toughest financial cuts had been funded through the U.S. Department of Justice’s Community Based Violence Intervention and Prevention Initiative — the federal government’s primary mechanism for supporting this work.
Since the program’s launch in 2022, the federal Office of Justice Programs has invested about $300 million in community violence intervention efforts and related research. But nearly half of that funding has now been wiped out, according to the Council on Criminal Justice report.
“It’s really unprecedented to see these kinds of grants cut midstream,” Solomon told Stateline. “This was an effort that had bipartisan support [in Congress] and in the field all across the country.”
 Impact on communities nationwide

In late April, Aqeela Sherrills received a letter from the federal Justice Department terminating a $3.5 million grant that supported the Community-Based Public Safety Collective. Sherrills is the co-founder and executive director of the national organization, which focuses on community-led approaches to preventing violence, including mediating conflicts, building relationships in high-risk neighborhoods and connecting people to resources such as housing, mental health care and job training.
The letter said the organization’s efforts no longer aligned with the federal Justice Department’s priorities, which include supporting “certain law enforcement operations, combatting violent crime, protecting American children, and supporting American victims of trafficking and sexual assault.”
Until the end of April, the collective had an agreement with the Justice Department to provide training and technical assistance to 95 local groups — including community groups, police departments, city and county governments, and state agencies — that had each been awarded $2 million over three years to run community violence intervention programs.










We're bracing for what could potentially be a high-violence summer.


– Aqeela Sherrills, co-founder and CEO of the Community-Based Public Safety Collective


But after the department cut $3.5 million, the Community-Based Public Safety Collective was forced to lay off 20 staff members.
“Without the significant funding … it destabilizes the organizations. People’s ability to be able to provide for themselves and their family is at risk,” Sherrills said in an interview. “We’re bracing for what could potentially be a high-violence summer.”
The deepest funding cuts hit states led by both Republican and Democratic governors, including California, Florida, Illinois, Kentucky, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Virginia and Washington.
About $145 million in violence intervention funding was rescinded overall, along with an additional $8.6 million for related research and evaluation efforts, according to the Council on Criminal Justice report.
Some of the canceled grants funded studies and research on forensics, policing, corrections issues and behavioral health. Now, those projects may be left unfinished.
Some of the largest losses hit intermediary organizations, such as the Community-Based Public Safety Collective, that support smaller programs by providing microgrants, training and technical assistance.
For organizations such as the Newark Community Street Team in New Jersey, the loss of federal funding has left some areas of the city without coverage.
The funding had allowed staff to monitor neighborhoods and engage directly with community members to prevent violence. That included weekly community walks, where team members connected with victims of crime and people who may have witnessed violence, linking them to resources such as counseling or legal aid. The team also operates a hotline where residents can report crimes or alert staff to tensions that might escalate — allowing the team to step in before violence occurred.
Some of the lost funding also supported school-based initiatives, where mediators helped students resolve conflicts before they escalated into fights or other forms of violence.
Of the 15 Newark positions affected by the cuts, four employees were reassigned to other departments; the others were let go. Some of the team’s staff members are formerly incarcerated, a vital trait that helps them connect with residents and build trust in communities that are often wary of traditional law enforcement.
“We just have to continue working and serving our community the best we can,” said Rey Chavis, the executive director of the street team.
That work appears to be contributing to a decrease in the community’s crime rates.
City crime data from Jan. 1 to April 30, 2025, shows a significant drop in violent crime in Newark compared with the same period in 2024. The total number of violent crimes reported to police fell by 49%, driven largely by a 68% decrease in robberies, according to Stateline’s analysis of the data. Homicides dropped by 53%, while aggravated assaults declined by 43%. Rapes dropped slightly by 3%.

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Tensions ran high Thursday morning at the Indiana Supreme Court as justices heard arguments in a case that could change who has the duty of care — private property owners or county officials — for visual obstructions at rural intersections. 
Yerano Martinez collided with another vehicle at a rural four-way intersection in Miami county, claiming an overgrown bush on Jeffrey Smith’s property obstructed his view of a stop sign. He sued Smith and accused him of negligence for failing to maintain the bush. 
Rural intersections sightline proposal to rack up edits

Smith countered and claimed that landowners have no duty to protect motorists from conditions that remain entirely on private property and do not intrude upon the roadway. 
The court proceedings cited previous precedent that said the landowners have no duty to the motoring public to avoid creating or maintaining visual obstructions. 
That ruling established a “bright-line rule,” finding that “landowners owe a duty to passing motorists on adjacent highways not to create ‘hazardous conditions that visit themselves upon the roadway’; but when a land use or condition that may impose a visual obstruction is ‘wholly contained on a landowner’s property, there is no duty to the traveling public.'”
The trial court and the Indiana Court of Appeals both agreed with Smith, granting him summary judgment. Martinez then petitioned the state’s highest court. 
Arguments on Thursday
On Thursday, Martinez’s attorney, Scott Faultless, asked the Supreme Court to overturn the lower court’s ruling and allow a jury to decide whether Smith bears responsibility. Faultless argued that the bush interfered with a public right of way by blocking traffic signage and fell outside previous protections.
“This case is the next step in the race,” Faultless said, referring to the litigation. 
Faultless argued that while the earlier case was correctly decided, it should not shield property owners who allow visual obstructions near public roads. He pointed to Indiana common law and statutes, arguing they impose a duty on landowners to prevent visual obstructions. He added that the bush in question appeared within the public right of way, based on evidence it had been planted and maintained by Smith, and mowed around. 
Justices pressed both sides for clarity. They explored whether a stop sign, as a vital traffic control device, constitutes part of the roadway — and whether obscuring it is protected.

Smith’s attorney, Sheila Sullivan, maintained that local governments are responsible for managing traffic visibility. She argued that counties employ people to handle these kinds of problems. But justices questioned whether rural counties like Miami have the capacity to consistently address such issues. 
During the 2025 session, lawmakers proposed legislation — sparked by a tragedy — taking an aim at dangerous overgrown rural intersections. The bill would apply to any agricultural land located alongside local road intersections without traffic signals. It would also require a landowner or renter to maintain a “line of sight triangle.” 
Under the bill, local governments could send landowners or renters a notice if they were not in compliance. People involved in vehicle crashes resulting from blocked sights would be able to sue for damages. But Senate Bill 183 died. Weaker language passed in another bill. 
The court will make its final decision on whose responsibility it is to take care of the obstruction in the coming days.

The traveling public art exhibit of the life-sized trunked giants is California-bound, with a Wyoming stop along the way.  
The post Migrating elephants amble into Jackson Hole appeared first on WyoFile .","JACKSON HOLE—The stampede of visitors isn’t coming for the grizzly bears, baby bison or Teton Mountain views. 
They’re coming to walk among the elephants. Thirty-two life-size replicas that look surprisingly at home on the range, lumber through the sagebrush, trailing behind a smaller herd of impressive bronze bison.
The Great Elephant Migration has made a stop at the National Museum of Wildlife Art, just north of Jackson Hole, creating a buzz along its journey across the United States. Madison Webb Stanko, the museum’s chief marketing officer, has met visitors who have driven from New Mexico, Colorado and Utah to stroll among the herd at one of its only stops in the Rockies. As a result, the museum has seen a spike in attendance both in person and online, she said. 
“I think it’s the experience,” she said. “It’s the scale of it. You feel small standing in front of it. It does inspire wonder.”

Visitors are advised not to touch the nearby bronze bison statues — or get too close to any of the living and breathing wildlife often visible just up the road in Grand Teton and Yellowstone national parks. But they can hug, kiss and pet these elephants all they want. 
The public art installation started as 100 elephants on display in July 2024 in Newport, Rhode Island, and has since migrated through New York City’s Meatpacking District, Miami Beach, and Houston.  
Now, the herd has split, with 32 taking up refuge at the museum, four on display in Teton Village and the rest on view through June 16 at the Buffalo Spirit Hills Ranch on the Blackfeet Indian Reservation in northern Montana. On May 30, Blackfeet painter and ledger artist Terrance Guardipee led a blessing of the elephants in Jackson Hole at the museum’s sculpture garden, attracting a crowd of more than 300.
“Of all the animals, elephants seem to be one that people feel connected to,” Webb Stanko said, “and it’s an animal you’re not often able to connect to in Wyoming.”
The Asian elephants also bring a story of how to coexist with large mammals. 
“Each sculpture is a replica of a real wild elephant, known by name and personality to the Indigenous communities of the Nilgiri Hills in Tamil Nadu,” the exhibit explains. “Here elephants live alongside people in the densest concentrations on the planet.” 
The sculptures are made from an invasive weed called “Lantana camara” that’s overtaking India’s forests and displacing wildlife. They each take four to six months to create, and are for sale for $8,000 to $22,000 to raise money for conservation work that supports coexistence.

Although people have been showing up at all hours to photograph and wander among the elephants, the museum has “elephant guardians” staffing the exhibit during museum hours to answer questions. 
The pachyderms will be packed up after the exhibit ends June 20, but enthusiasts will have one last chance to say goodbye. The museum is inviting the community to a farewell party from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m., June 22, when people can decorate the trucks before the herd “migrates” to its final U.S. destination.
After overlooking the wild open spaces of the National Elk Refuge, Webb Stanko said, “they’re going to Beverly Hills from here.”

Jamie Raskin (D-8th) addressed a crowd of hundreds outside NOAA's Silver Spring headquarters in March, just days after the Trump administration cut hundreds of jobs from the agency. (Photo by Jack Bowman/Maryland Matters)Marylanders affected by federal layoffs this year can now apply for an interest-free state loan to help them pay the bills in the short term, according a press release Thursday from the state Department of Labor.
The Federal Emergency Loan Program is directed at the thousands of Maryland residents who have lost jobs in the federal government so far since the Trump administration began slashing the federal workforce to cut down federal spending.
The loan program was created this year under the new Protect Our Federal Workers Act, sponsored this year by Majority Whip Jazz Lewis (D-Prince George’s) and signed into law in April. The law expands the use of two current employee-assistance funds so they apply to federal workers laid off as the Trump administration rushes to slash the size of government. It also expands the authority of the attorney general’s office to take legal action on behalf of laid-off federal workers in some instances, and it creates an expedited state hiring program for workers who lost jobs due to administration cuts.
“Let’s be clear — these federal workers didn’t lose their jobs because they failed us,” Lewis said in a written statement. “They lost them because of reckless decisions in Washington that turned public servants into political targets. These are our neighbors, our veterans, our civil servants — people who dedicated their lives to this country.”
Federal layoffs drag down state employment gains for second month, new numbers show

The program offers a $700 interest-free loan for residents who qualify. Those residents must have been terminated from a federal job since Trump took office, in a mass layoff, relocation, or closure of a unit of the federal government, or in a similar situation beyond their control.
Former federal workers must also demonstrate that they are experiencing “financial hardships” caused by the loss of their job in the loan application. Recipients have 180 days to pay the loan back, though they can ask for a 90-day extension if hardships continue. Federal contractors are not eligible for the loan.
“This loan program is an important piece of Maryland’s larger effort to respond to federal job loss, providing emergency financial assistance while we are also working to connect thousands of Marylanders to new job opportunities and help with career transition,” Maryland Labor Secretary Portia Wu said in a written statement Thursday.
Maryland’s workforce is uniquely susceptible to the effects of the federal layoffs, and its economy is heavily reliant on federal employment, due to the state’s proximity to Washington, D.C., though the exact scope of the impact to the state is challenging to calculate, according to labor department officials. So far, about 1,600 federal unemployment claims have been filed since the Trump administration started in January, the department said.
In addition to the new loan program, the Moore administration is also working to connect laid-off federal workers with state jobs, among other measures, in an effort to mitigate those impacts.

The Army Corps completed a study of Garrison Dam in June 2023. The dam holds back the Missouri River, creating Lake Sakakawea, the largest reservoir of any Army Corps project in the nation.
Flooding in 2011 caused Garrison Dam’s spillway to be used for the first time since it was completed in 1953.
After dam operators closed the spillway gates and operations returned to normal, the dam’s maintenance team assessed the impacts of the historic flooding and the spillway’s ability to handle even larger floods. 
The overall project includes the replacement of the spillway’s drainage system to remove manhole covers from inside the spillway. Some covers were dislodged in 2011. 
Other work at the dam this year includes replacing lighting along Crest Road and concrete repair on the Spillway Bridge that may slow travel, the Army Corps said in a news release.

Utah is among several Western states seeking to reduce federal land ownership. (Photo by Utah News Dispatch)Public outcry was swift and forceful after a U.S. House committee last month hastily approved an amendment directing the federal government to sell off more than half a million acres of public land.
A few days later, lawmakers advanced the larger bill — a sweeping list of President Donald Trump’s priorities — but stripped the federal lands provision.
Yet leaders on both sides of the issue say the battle over selling off federal lands is likely just heating up.
Some conservatives in Western states have complained for decades that the feds control too much of the land within their borders. They see a long-awaited opportunity in a Trump administration that’s sympathetic to their cause. Public lands advocates are bracing for more attempts to turn land over to states, industry groups and developers.
“The threat level is red alert,” said Randi Spivak, public lands policy director with the Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental nonprofit. “Some of these states have been champing at the bit for decades to privatize. They’re certainly not going to let this opportunity pass without an aggressive effort.”
The ‘balance sheet’
In Western states, where most federally owned lands are located, some leaders view these lands as a treasured inheritance — places reserved for all Americans and critical for wildlife, tourism and outdoor recreation. Others feel that too much of the land in their states is controlled by officials in Washington, D.C., leaving it off-limits for development and curtailing its economic value.

Doug Burgum, President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee for Interior Department secretary, waits for the beginning of a confirmation hearing before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee at Dirksen Senate Office Building on Jan. 16, 2025, on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)
Trump officials and allies have embraced the latter view. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum has repeatedly called federal lands America’s “balance sheet,” describing them as untapped assets worth trillions of dollars. He has launched an effort to identify federal lands suitable for housing development.
Other proposals have centered around using land sales to pay for tax breaks or to finance Trump’s proposed government-run fund that could invest in stocks or real estate.
For some state leaders, the newfound interest at the federal level to turn public lands into cash — along with Trump’s cuts to land management agency staff — aligns with a long-standing movement to reduce federal ownership.
“I look at it as an opportunity to say, ‘Hey, turn it over to the state,’” said Utah House Speaker Mike Schultz, a Republican.
Utah leaders have made the most forceful push to challenge federal land ownership. The state filed a legal challenge last year seeking to take control of more than 18 million acres of “unappropriated” lands — parcels held by the federal government without a specific designation such as a national park or monument. That effort hit a roadblock earlier this year when the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the case.
But with Trump in the White House, state leaders may pivot from challenging the feds in court to seeking their cooperation.
“We would love if the federal government just turned it over to us and said, ‘Here, manage these lands,’” Schultz said. “That’s an option as well. Those are discussions that are happening. Everything is on the table.”
Schultz declined to say which federal officials have been involved in discussions about transferring lands to the state.
Some lawmakers in Wyoming backed a state resolution this year — which ultimately failed — calling on Congress to hand over all federal lands except for Yellowstone National Park. Idaho lawmakers passed a measure calling on the feds to turn over a wildlife refuge to the state. And Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo, a Republican, has called for a “systematic release” of federal land in the state.
But public lands also have many supporters in Western states, including some prominent Republican members of Congress, such as Reps. Mike Simpson of Idaho and Ryan Zinke of Montana. Zinke was Interior secretary for two years during the first Trump administration.
John Leshy, who served as solicitor for the U.S. Department of the Interior during the Clinton administration, said proposals to dispose of federal lands tend to be stymied by fierce public backlash.
“Federal lands are really popular,” he said. “It’s political poison [to sell off public land]. It’s a different West now. Public attitudes have changed.”
Leshy also noted that livestock ranchers especially benefit from discounted lease rates offered by the federal government.
Housing arguments
The most recent clash over the future of federal lands was the amendment sponsored by a pair of congressional Republicans last month. The measure would have directed the Bureau of Land Management to sell more than 500,000 acres of land in Nevada and Utah. Local governments would have been able to buy the land at market value, with no restrictions on how they used it.
Backers said the sale would bring in revenue to cover Trump’s proposed tax cuts, while allowing local governments to build much-needed housing on the parcels. Utah GOP Sen. Mike Lee said he will try to revive the measure as the Senate considers the bill this month, E&E News reported.
In Nevada, where 85% of land is owned by the federal government, some leaders say their communities are hemmed in by a checkerboard of public lands that constrain development. The city of Fernley, which is growing rapidly, would have acquired 12,000 acres under the proposal.
“We need housing,” said Benjamin Marchant, Fernley’s city manager. “The city can’t plan roads and water lines, sewer lines and gas lines, when you have federal land between two parcels that want to develop. This will bring a practical and helpful consolidation of all these lands into one developable area.”
Nevada leaders have long worked on proposals to transfer some federal lands to local governments and allow for increased growth. But some lawmakers say the latest push bypassed that collaborative process — and failed to include safeguards that the money raised from the sale of the lands would be reinvested into conserving public lands elsewhere.
“It was a complete betrayal of everything we’ve worked on in this state,” said Assemblymember Howard Watts, a Democrat. “This amendment is trying to sell off half a million acres of Nevada’s public lands in order to pay for tax cuts for billionaires. This is not going to address our housing problem. These lands are positioned to be sold off for other forms of development and extraction.”
Similar debates are happening in Utah. In southwestern Utah’s Washington County, local officials say the disposal of federally controlled land could help alleviate the region’s housing crisis and increasingly strained infrastructure.
The county is experiencing rapid population growth — in 2022, St. George, the county seat, was the fastest-growing metro area in America. County and city leaders hoped the amendment would have helped them manage the growth. The measure would have disposed of roughly 11,500 acres of federally controlled land in Utah, selling it at market value to local governments.
The proposal received pushback from all sides, including environmentalists, hunting and fishing groups, House Democrats and even conservatives.
“[The amendment] is consistent with how U.S. Department of the Interior Secretary Burgum thinks about federal public lands, as simply assets on a ledger to be sold off,” said Steve Bloch, legal director for the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, an environmental nonprofit. ” … It’s just antithetical to how Westerners think about the federal public lands that make up so much of our landscape.”
Washington County Commissioner Adam Snow, a Republican, said a lot of the opposition was misguided. The county would have acquired almost half of the land earmarked for disposal, and Snow said much of that would have been used to widen existing roads and construct new ones that are bordered by Bureau of Land Management property.
“These were not pristine wilderness lands. Some of the environmental groups tried to make it sound like we’re selling off Zion National Park, and that’s not even close to true,” Snow said. “If we can just not have to deal with the federal government every time we want to chip seal a road or improve an intersection, that would be really nice. Because we have to ask ‘Mother, may I?’ for everything out here.”
Local leaders say federal parcels could help ease housing pressures as well. Snow said transferring parcels to the city or county is one of the only ways to stop the area from becoming wildly expensive.
“We’re running out of room real quick,” he said. “ … There is still private land to develop, but they’re going to charge an absolute premium.”
The amendment that was stripped from the House bill was widely criticized for not having any restrictions on what could be done with the land.
“There was no language whatsoever that would require Washington County or St. George to do anything with these lands. They could lease them for development. They could sell them outright,” said Bloch.
The costs of management
In Utah, lawmakers have created a state Department of Land Management — essentially a placeholder agency that would be funded and staffed only if their effort to assume control of large swaths of federal land succeeds. Schultz, the House speaker, said the state is committed to keeping the lands in the public domain, reopening roads and campgrounds closed by the feds.
“We’d just take over the job from the federal government,” he said. “It is something that the state absolutely would do, and we’d do it more efficiently, more effectively and we’d have better outcomes.”
Schultz said the state could bring in the revenues needed to manage the land by raising lease prices for oil and gas operations on parcels currently managed for drilling.
But some public lands advocates say that’s not realistic. The federal Bureau of Land Management employed more than 950 people in the state as of 2024, and feds also assume the expensive task of wildfire management on their lands.
“If you look at the history of what Utah has done with their lands, they’ve sold more than half of them,” said Devin O’Dea, Western policy and conservation manager with Backcountry Hunters & Anglers. “We’re certainly of the perspective that states could not handle the economic costs of managing these lands. Their hand would be forced; they would have to sell these lands in order to deal with those costs.”
John Robison, Idaho Conservation League public lands and wildlife director, said Simpson — the Idaho congressman — and the state’s two senators have all won praise from constituents for their work on public lands compromises.
“Savvy Idaho politicians know that public lands are popular,” he said.
But other state leaders insist their governments are better equipped to manage the lands. Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador, a Republican, was among the officials who signed an amicus brief in support of Utah’s lawsuit against the feds.
“We live here, we work here, and we are far better stewards of our forests and resources than federal bureaucrats in Washington,” Labrador said in a statement. “ … If Idaho owned this land, we could lease it for timber, grazing, and mining — just like the federal government does — but reinvest that revenue right here in Idaho.”

Tim Walz speaks with Minnesota Reformer Editor in Chief Patrick Coolican on Thursday, June 5, 2025 at the Royal Sonesta in downtown Minneapolis. (Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Thursday said that communication between states and the federal government under the second Trump administration “is nonexistent,” opening the door to catastrophe in the case of a natural disaster or other emergency.
Walz, during an interview with Minnesota Reformer editor Patrick Coolican at a States Newsroom conference in Minneapolis, said the Trump administration is unprepared for the next disaster — like another global pandemic — and that leaves states particularly vulnerable.
“The flow of information has been disrupted between the states and the federal government, and we just can’t get answers … No one is allowed to talk to us, and that’s really problematic,” Walz said.
The governor said the silence from the feds differs from the first Trump administration. At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Walz said then-Vice President Mike Pence would call him every few weeks to check in to see what he needed. He said he sensed Pence would call in “under the radar, so he didn’t draw anybody’s attention.”
“There were a lot of great people inside the first Trump administration that, in spite of the president, were doing good work,” Walz said.
Walz said one of his biggest fears is a cybersecurity attack. The Trump administration has cut millions of dollars for several cyber security initiatives and slashed jobs from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which helps protect the nation’s critical infrastructure.

Walz discussed the role of the states in opposing the Trump administration’s agenda — particularly on immigration — and the Democratic Party’s current malaise.
Minnesota is increasingly reliant on immigrants, who are needed to fill jobs being vacated by an aging workforce. “There’s not a cow in Minnesota that’s not being milked by an immigrant,” he said. Walz said Minnesota would not be commandeered into enforcing immigration law, which he said is a federal duty.
Walz repeated a spiel he’s given around the country, including at a recent Democratic Party event in South Carolina, which has traditionally been early on the presidential primary calendar, fueling speculation that he is considering a presidential run.

Walz said Midwestern governors stuck together, specifically mentioning former Gov. Eric Holcomb.
“(Holcomb) was very well liked even amongst the Democratic governors,” Walz said Thursday. “

He said he’s not running, but merely using his megaphone to help fill a vacuum left by a Democratic Party in disarray.
The governor urged Democrats to figure out how to become the party of the working class again and said Democrats need to “fill all the lanes” in the media environment to reach voters.
“I still have come to the conclusion that Trump fills so much space that you’ve got to fill all these new spaces. Do I think if we would have gone on, you know, Joe Rogan, would we have won? I doubt that, but I also don’t think it hurts,” Walz said. “If your message is good, you want to get out there.”
Walz backed the 2005-06 idea of former DNC Chair Howard Dean and his “50 State Project,” which sought to reach voters in areas not traditionally associated with Democrats.
“We’re probably never going to win Idaho, but … you got to be out there for it,” Walz said.
Walz said Democrats should rotate where they hold the early primary to reach more voters, which may not endear him to Democrats in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, the traditional early states that have long jealously guarded their first in the nation status.
When asked which state should be the first to hold the primary, Walz deadpanned “Minnesota.”

(Photo: John Partipilo)Tennessee’s private-prison operator lost nearly $45 million in state payments over three years for failing to meet contractual requirements, but it’s landing a nice windfall as part of the state’s business tax cut deal.
Newly-released records show Brentwood-based CoreCivic Inc. and its affiliate CoreCivic TRS LLC & Subs each received refunds of more than $10,000 for three years of tax rebates after lawmakers approved an estimated $1.9 billion franchise and excise tax reduction in 2024. 
Because of the wide range for payouts, the public will never be able to find out exactly how much the state returned to CoreCivic or 16,000 other companies, many of them based out of state, that received more than 10 grand each. Lawmakers approved categories of less than $750 for the list, between $750 and $10,000 and more than $10,000.
CoreCivic is one of the state’s biggest donors to lawmakers’ biggest donors, as well, even though we know that legislators don’t base their decisions on campaign contributions. At least that’s what they tell us.
Tennessee levied $44.78 million in penalties against private prison operator in three years

Release of the lists in the past week has spurred a bit of debate about whether it is transparent enough, especially since it doesn’t specify exact amounts refunded and will be up on the state’s website for only 30 days. 
Aside from that argument and discussion about whether this tax break was a giveaway to make the rich richer, it shows that numerous business entities got what some might call the old double dip.
Take, for instance, SmileDirectClub. The company landed a $300,000 grant from the state in 2017, then hit it big with $10 million from Tennessee in 2019 and the blessing of Gov. Bill Lee for a Nashville expansion. But the tooth-straightening company hit the skids and filed for bankruptcy in 2023, then closed up shop. Yet even though it’s no longer operating, SmileDirect is drawing a refund in excess of $10,000 from the state.
The list is long for companies receiving state grants over the last decade and now tax refunds.
FedEx netted a $10 million grant for a $44 million investment in Shelby County in 2019, and Hankook Tire landed $6 million in 2022 for a $611 million project in Clarksville. And don’t forget about Ford Motor Co., which received nearly a billion dollars worth of incentives for BlueOval City in West Tennessee and will draw a refund in excess of $10,000 under the new scheme (I mean law). Production at the electric truck plant is running more than a year behind schedule mainly because of concerns about the EV industry.
World’s top businesses, Lee Company receive biggest Tennessee tax rebates

The debate centers on whether this stuff is creating a business-friendlier state, putting Tennessee in the midst of economic recruiting wars or simply donating to corporate welfare.
The conservative Beacon Center puts out an annual Pork Report declaring the state’s biggest winners of government largesse. In December, it asked people to weigh in last year on three finalists: Memphis Area Transit Authority spending tens of millions on Grizzlies suites and a downtown office; Lebanon City Council approval of a $1.5 million for an unnamed restaurant; and the $2.3 billion from state and local taxpayers for a new Titans stadium at the same time $80,000 is going toward the old stadium.
Axing of the franchise tax on business property didn’t make the cut. But if that’s not a giveaway, what is? After all, these companies knew the rules when they started, and a letter to the state by businesses challenging the constitutionality of the franchise tax on property could be considered a form of extortion.
One lawmaker said this week if you consider the money as belonging to the businesses and then being turned over to the government in the form of taxes, then it’s not a giveaway. That begs the question, though, what about the sales taxes millions of people pay every time they buy a package of bacon? Where’s the love for the little people?
To which some might say, “What’s love got to do with it?”
Will the “Schwinn-anigans” ever end?
Former Tennessee Education Commissioner Penny Schwinn failed to list a new company called New Horizon BluePrint Group on her federal disclosure form, then dissolved it shortly before the U.S. Senate took up the confirmation hearing for her appointment as deputy secretary of the U.S. Department of Education.
Records show she started the business, a Florida LLC, with Donald Fennoy, former director of the Palm Beach County School District in Florida, in February, after President Donald Trump nominated her for the post. Schwinn’s sister took over the company in late March, before it was dissolved, raising questions about the timing.
Typically, folks don’t start businesses after they’ve been nominated for federal jobs, and they don’t forget to put them on their conflict of interest disclosure form either.
The74, an online education publication, reported the failure to disclose the business – which never really came to fruition – might cause Schwinn problems in her Thursday hearing.
Former Tennessee education leader promises feds she will cut conflicts

But that would be the least of her problems, if the Senate looks at her history and not just her work resume.
She spent most of her time Thursday bragging about gains Tennessee students made during her tenure. But Schwinn had some hiccups too during her time here working for Gov. Bill Lee.
The Tennessee Department of Education signed an $8 million contract in 2021 with TNTP, a teacher training company that employed her husband. She had to sign an ethics agreement promising not to discuss TNTP stuff with him.
Lawmakers also passed legislation removing the education commissioner from the textbook approval process because they felt Schwinn was directing business to favored companies. In addition, the Education Department saw an exodus of experienced people during her tenure.
This list could continue.
Not that anyone in Washington, D.C. cares much about conflicts of interest or questionable business dealings. Those are status quo. But at some point, the public will rebel against this type of corruption and put someone else in charge of lining pockets.
What’s next for Sexton?
Chip Saltsman sparked speculation about the political future of House Speaker Cameron Sexton this week when he posted a photo of a Crossville video shoot and said people should “stay tuned” for a “big announcement coming.”
Does this mean Sexton is leaving Nashville and moving back home to Cumberland County? It’s possible.

Great day of filming with @csexton25 in Crossville this weekend
BIG announcement coming
Stay tuned pic.twitter.com/mPRO14jD1n
— Chip Saltsman (@chipsaltsman) June 2, 2025
More than likely, Sexton will be announcing his intentions to run for Congress to replace U.S. Rep. John Rose, who is running for governor.
The Lookout asked Sexton more than a year ago if he was considering a run for the District 6 seat. His response was that Rose held the post. At that press conference, other House Republican leaders laughed and wondered why they weren’t being asked the same question. Probably because nobody cares?
Recently, though, state Rep. Johnny Garrett of Goodlettsville said he was considering seeking the District 6 seat. We haven’t heard much about it since then. Come to think of it, we haven’t seen much out of Rose, either, since the bitterly cold day he announced he was running for governor.
Whatever the case, we’ll be staying up nights to monitor X (formerly Twitter) to see Sexton’s forthcoming pronouncement. It could cause a bigger ripple effect than the time the Mississippi ran backwards.

SoMa Pride is co-hosted by Central Arkansas Pride, which also hosts LGBTQ+ events in October, and the SoMa 501 nonprofit, of which Michael is executive director. The nonprofit launched a crowdfunding campaign in March with a goal of $20,000 to “bridge the gap” after losing “a few major funding sources,” Michael said in May.
As of Thursday, the goal had been reduced to $10,000, and the campaign had raised $6,800, an increase of $4,480 in just under a month.
A May 29 article in The Guardian highlighted nationwide struggles to host Pride events, including SoMa Pride, in the current political climate. Michael said the publicity led to an influx in donations to the event’s crowdfunding campaign.
“It has been extremely uplifting to see the support, not only locally, but from across the country,” she said.
SoMa Pride will include a parade and performance art, such as live music and drag, on Saturday, as well as a Pride “pre-party” Friday evening at the Boswell Mourot art gallery. Saturday’s festivities will have one stage as opposed to two last year, Michael said.
“We did scale it back some, but we’re really going to have a great event,” she said. “We didn’t have to scale back nearly as much as I thought we were going to have to.”

Arkansas LGBTQ+ organizers crowdfund to make up for fewer Pride sponsors in time for June


SoMa is short for “South Main” and encompasses Little Rock’s business district on Main Street just south of Interstate 630.
SoMa Pride was not alone in its crowdfunding efforts. NWA Equality, which runs Northwest Arkansas Pride in Fayetteville, the state’s largest annual Pride festival, raised over $30,000 in early April to make up for lost event sponsors.
Michael and NWA Pride director Richard Gathright both said the current precarity of federal funds, such as grants for diversity initiatives, played a role in shortages of financial support for Pride.
Pride festivities in major cities nationwide this year have lost major corporate sponsors, such as Anheuser Busch in St. Louis. Minnesota’s Twin Cities Pride removed Target as a sponsor after the company dropped its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts. The changes have come as state and federal officials have targeted LGBTQ+ rights and DEI initiatives.

Last in a two-part series on Pennsylvania’s 28th Division and a new memorial to soldiers who were killed in the fight to liberate Gathemo, France. Read the first part here.



Tradition holds that for visiting family members, staff will place moistened sand on the engraving on the marker for Jerome Nadolny, who was killed in the fierce fighting around Gathemo, a small village in Normandy, using a wet sponge. The process brings the name out on the marble Latin cross, so it can easily be seen from 15 to 20 feet away.

An American and French flag – standing about knee high – will be placed in front of the grave. Traditionally, the U.S. marker is symbolically on the right side – as if it were in the soldier’s right hand and facing home. The French will be on the left – always toward inland territory.
Then, he and his cousin, Kurt, will travel to Gathemo, where nine soldiers of the 28th Division, including three from Pennsylvania, lost their lives as the Allies pushed inland from the beaches of Normany to liberate Europe.
They’ll be the sole American relatives of the fallen soldiers who will be on hand for a ceremony Saturday honoring their sacrifice during the fight for the town 81 summers ago. The gathering will include the dedication of a plaque and memorial and a renaming of a street in honor of the 28th Division, a Pennsylvania National Guard unit before the war. The trip is the culmination of an improbable sequence of events that began when Nadolny went in search of the war history of a long-lost great-uncle. Nadolny admits to feeling a little pressure, because he doesn’t want to let his family down or any of the other families.
“I know it’s going to be a heavy experience for me personally. I wish I could share this with my dad,” he said. “It was on my bucket list to just go to that cemetery, but now to actually go to the cemetery? It’s obviously a trip of a lifetime, right?“
 Gathemo today

Visitors to Normandy will notice Allied flags – American, British, and Canadian – hanging not just on poles, but in windows and on doors in village after village. This isn’t just a phenomenon that happens in the typical tourist areas around the landing beaches or landmarks made famous in the 1962 movie, The Longest Day, or the HBO miniseries, Band of Brothers.
The Battle of Normandy stretched beyond what happened on June 6, 1944. Allied troops applied relentless pressure in an effort to push the German occupiers back.
The clash lasted for more than two months, as it became a war of attrition. Allied troops had to constantly resupply the front lines, while the enemy dealt with losses – in terms of men and machines – it simply couldn’t replace
In the end, the Allies suffered 210,000 casualties,while the Germans dealt with losses of 400,000 men.
Town and after town touched by the Battle of Normandy has its own monuments or historical markers to pilots whose downed aircraft crashed nearby, soldiers who died in their streets or units that helped liberate them.
In Periers for example, The Four Braves memorial honors the 90th Infantry Division — which liberated the town as part of Operation Cobra. This was a piece of the successful U.S. breakout — which played a big role in the rapid collapse of the Germans’ defense in Normandy.
Two Pennsylvanians who lost  their lives — Private 2nd Class Andrew J. Speese III of Philadelphia and Sgt. Tullio Micaloni of Oneida — are immortalized as part of the memorial.

One tour group recounted how in the town of La Haye du Puits, a man noticed they were Americans. He hurried home and later found the group at a restaurant eating lunch. He excitedly, in French, described what it was like as a boy in the summer of 1944 to see his home liberated.
As his story was translated, he pulled a piece of silk parachute from his jacket — given to him by a U.S. soldier. He simply wanted to share his gratitude for the sacrifice made by the Allies.
Even in 2025, people in Normandy’s villages and towns still think there is history to be acknowledged and a debt owed.
Gathemo, with a population of 267, will join the others Saturday, with a permanent “thank you.”
Over several days in early August, 1944, the 28th attacked German troops occupying the town.
Progress was slow, measured in a few hundred yards at times, but by the afternoon Aug. 10, the 28th had liberated Gathemo. The division’s losses were nine men killed, including three from Pennsylvania, and an estimated 235 wounded.










For those few who bring up the Battle of Gathemo in some remote barroom in years to come – there will always be a lifting of glasses to our buddies whom we left behind in the orchards and wheat fields of that hallowed ground!


– From the Bloody Patch: A True Story of the Daring 28th Division


The 77-day Battle of Normandy came to an end on Aug. 19, after tens of thousands of German troopers were captured when the Falaise pocket was closed by Allied troops.
A mere 10 days after that, the men of the 28th Division were in Paris, taking part in the liberation day parade through the city.
Located nearly 90 minutes from the English Channel and Omaha Beach, Mayor Christelle Errard describes Gathemo as having all the hallmarks of a quaint Norman community – a bakery, a bar, gift shops and five farms.
The church, destroyed in the fight, was rebuilt after the war and features a pointed bell tower. According to the mayor, the granite used for the altar and the cross came from Gathemo’s quarries.

 ‘There are no words strong enough’

The town’s role in the Allied push to encircle and destroy part of the German Army in the final weeks and days of the clash has largely been forgotten – overshadowed by the fight in Mortain and Saint-Lambert-sur-Dives, among others. Errard became mayor of Gathemo in July of 2020 and has lived in the community for a decade. She was born in another historically significant part of France – Verdun. It’s the site of one the longest and most ferocious battles of the First World War.
“We have a mission in our world: to listen to our history, to transcribe it, so as not to forget Our duty to remember is here. And the witnesses of this period will soon all be gone. I also understood that many don’t want to share what they experienced,” she wrote in an email exchange using Google Translate to go from French to English. “My father never spoke about this period when he was 6-years-old, yet four years ago, on his deathbed, he relived the scenes he had witnessed.”

Now, she said, it’s Gathemo’s turn to pay tribute to the young Americans who fought to liberate Europe.
“Many returned home with physical and mental injuries, but many, like Pvt. Nadolny, did not return to their families,” Errard wrote. “My son will be 23 in June, the same age Pvt. Nadolny was when he lost his life in Gathemo, for Gathemo. I cannot remain indifferent. The tribute is small, but I hope it is the beginning of another story for Gathemo and all the people who will stop and pay their respects at this memorial.”
The monument with the names of the nine men killed will be located close to the back of the church in Gathemo. It will be on a granite stone with an M1 helmet featuring the division logo placed on top. A plaque honoring the entire division will be dedicated, and a street will be renamed in honor of the 28th Division, which, according to unit lore was nicknamed the “Bloody Bucket” by the Germans because of the red keystone patches worn on their uniforms.
The Mike Pride Museum in Normandy covered the 1,800 Euro price tag.
“Dear American friends, there are no words strong enough to express our gratitude and respect,” Errard said. “I would like to say BRAVO and THANK YOU.”
Two men who were just children at the time of the battle will be on hand for the ceremony – 87-year-old Guy Lelandais and 80-year-old Michele Golonde.
Errard says for Lelandais, whose cousin was killed by an exploding shell in front of his eyes, preserving the history of the liberation of his hometown has been a lifelong passion. He has – collecteding testimonies from around the region.

Galonde was just six months old when the 28th Division pushed the Germans out of Gathemo, hiding in a cellar with his family, according to Gerrard. His older sister was in front of the baby carriage he was in when a shell exploded – wounding her in the leg, which left her permanently disabled.  But as fate would have it, she likely saved Galonde’s life because of where she was standing.
Nadolny plans to have dinner with the mayor and hopes to shake Lelandais’ hand and ask him what he remembers about the fight to free the town.
“I mean sincerely, we are so thankful…my family and I are almost just unbelievably thankful,” he said. “(Jerome) was a blue-collar soldier that gave everything and moved us along, So to me, that’s what it’s about. A lot of forgotten stories. So, if we can share a little bit of it or be a part of it, I think it’s incredible.”
The commemoration is a reminder that “freedom has a cost and that true friendship endures,”  Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said in a letter to the event organizers.
“More than 80 years ago, the sons of Pennsylvania crossed an ocean to stand in defense of liberty and peace, forging a bond of courage and shared sacrifice. The soldiers of the 28th Infantry Division fought with extraordinary bravery, with some making the ultimate sacrifice,” Shapiro said. “The people of Gathemo have, across generations, honored the legacy of these brave men not only with gratitude, but with a deep and enduring partnership that continues to unite our communities. Pennsylvania is proud of the heritage of the 28th Infantry Division and of the shared history we hold with our friends in Gathemo.”
The ceremony is set to begin Saturday, June 7, at 5 a.m. EST and will be livestreamed on the Mike Pride Museum YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@grpicardie3945.

(Photo illustration by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)A year ago, Gov. Jeff Landry signed a bill into law that made Louisiana the first state in the country to reclassify pregnancy care drugs as controlled dangerous substances. Since then, the political assault on the medications has continued to ramp up on the state and national level.
The Louisiana law to reclassify mifepristone and misoprostol caused controversy, particularly when multiple medical professionals publicly criticized the measure saying the added burdens to accessing the medications could delay medical treatment in times of crisis. 
Misoprostol and mifepristone have been targeted because they are used in medication abortion, but both have multiple other uses. Misoprostol is used to prevent and treat postpartum hemorrhage. Since the state law went into effect in October, hospitals have changed how they store and dispense the drugs, locking them up in passcode-protected storage containers outside of labor and delivery rooms.

The New Orleans Health Department has been tracking complaints from health care providers and patients who have struggled with misoprostol access since October. The medical professionals and patients were provided anonymity to encourage feedback.
One doctor wrote they had trouble accessing the drug to provide to a patient going through a hysteroscopy, a medical procedure in which the doctor examines a woman’s uterus using a thin, lighted tube.
“I was unable to get misoprostol in pre-op for [a] patient undergoing hysteroscope,” the provider wrote. “Therefore [I] had to manually dilate [the] cervix multiple times causing unnecessary harm to the patient.”
Another doctor said they couldn’t complete a biopsy, so they prescribed misoprostol to a patient in order to try the procedure again after softening her cervix. The doctor included the patient’s diagnosis of abnormal bleeding on the prescription, and that the patient was not pregnant. The pharmacy refused to fill the prescription until the doctor got on the phone to confirm the medication was not being used to end a pregnancy. 
“This could lead to a delay in diagnosis of cancer,” the doctor wrote.
In another instance, a pharmacist refused to fill a prescription for misoprostol ahead of an IUD insertion, telling the patient “he thought she was going to use it for an abortion,” wrote the doctor. 
There were also multiple accounts of misoprostol being prescribed for miscarriages, but pharmacists delayed filling prescriptions until they spoke to the doctor on the phone. In one instance, the mother who miscarried filed a complaint with the city health department. 
“I was denied misoprostol, essentially leaving me with my dead baby inside of me even longer because the pharmacist said he couldn’t give it to me,” the mother wrote. “It was more horrific than it needed to be.”
Even among state lawmakers who approved the law, confusion reigns. 
At a Louisiana House committee hearing last month, Rep. Lauren Ventrella, R-Greenwell Springs, said that last year “we made it illegal to prescribe” mifepristone and misoprostol. However, both can still be legally prescribed by health care providers with the proper licensing for Schedule IV drugs. When the law reclassifying the medication passed, its supporters repeatedly stated they were not restricting access to the medication for people who needed it for reasons outside of abortion. 
When Ventrella misspoke, she was introducing House Bill 575, which would allow families to sue over suspected abortions. Attorney General Liz Murrill has referred to the law as “another tool in the toolbox” that could be used against out-of-state doctors who prescribe abortion medication to patients in Louisiana. 
Murrill is currently prosecuting at least two cases involving a New York doctor who allegedly prescribed medications to pregnant women in Louisiana. So far, New York’s shield laws, which protects abortion providers, have held up against states that have tried to prosecute doctors. 
Ventrella’s bill awaits Senate floor action with less than a week remaining in the legislative session.
Opponents of the reclassification of mifepristone and misoprostol have worried that, by labeling the drugs as controlled dangerous substances, it would confuse medical providers and the public as well as stigmatize medications that have been proven to be safe and effective. They are challenging the law, Act 246, in state court, and a judge ruled May 15 that the plaintiffs suing the state have a right to pursue their case. 
“Specifically, the judge agreed that the plaintiffs have sufficiently demonstrated the harm that the law is causing to their practice, and the patients that they serve, to be able to challenge the constitutionality of this law,” said Ellie Schilling, a New Orleans attorney representing the plaintiffs. 
The plaintiffs include the reproductive health advocacy group Lift Louisiana, the Birthmark Doula Collective and multiple women’s health advocates and Louisiana health care providers, including OB-GYNs, midwives and pharmacists.  
As the court fight plays out in Louisiana, another clash is occurring on the national stage. 
U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has ordered the Food and Drug Administration to conduct a “complete review” on misoprostol and mifepristone. It comes in the wake of a far-right organization publishing a paper — one that is not peer-reviewed and many critics view as unscientific — claiming the drugs cause adverse medical effects. 
The far-right think tank, the Ethics and Public Policy Center, claimed almost 11% of women experienced a “serious adverse event” from the medications, but peer-reviewed clinical studies have shown an overall 0.5% rate of serious adverse events. Other research in the report also doesn’t hold up to fact-checking, and its authors did not reveal where they sourced the data that was cited.
“It’s deeply troubling that Secretary Kennedy is elevating junk-science to justify reopening mifepristone’s safety review, especially at the behest of anti-abortion political operatives,” said Dr. Angel Foster, co-founder of the Massachusetts Abortion Access Project, which provides medication abortion care to all 50 states via telemedicine. “I know firsthand that mifepristone’s safety is backed by decades of rigorous data. Rolling back access to mifepristone would be a disaster.”

After a pandemic-era pause, repayments on defaulted student loans restarted last month, and many borrowers are running into barriers. (Seth Wenig | The Associated Press)Over the past few months, Celina Damian’s phone has been ringing off the hook with one bewildered, anxious question after another: “What kind of loan is this?” “Am I in default?” “Will the government really take my wages?”
“Sometimes they just don’t know where to start,” said Damian, California’s student loan servicing ombudsperson.
“I’m talking to borrowers from all ages, from new borrowers to — I have 80-, 90-year-old borrowers,” she said.
The federal government last month restarted collections on defaulted loans. State student loan ombudspersons such as Damian have become some of the only sources of contact for worried borrowers lost in a tangle of conflicting information at the federal level about their loan status and repayment options.
The U.S. Department of Education began collecting on defaulted student loans in May for the first time since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020.
Federal student loans issued by the U.S. Department of Education come with fixed rates, set repayment plans and borrower protections. Private servicers handle billing, repayment-plan enrollments and defaults.
More than 5 million borrowers are in delinquency, and nearly 10 million — about 25% of the federal student loan portfolio — are at risk of default within months, according to data from the U.S. Department of Education.
States can’t cancel that debt, but they do register and oversee servicers operating in their states, run ombuds offices, tweak tax rules and offer outreach or limited grants — actions aimed at reducing defaults and the economic fallout.
When borrowers default, states will likely feel the economic impact. They might lose tax revenue as homebuying stalls. They could end up paying more for Medicaid and social services if borrowers need to rely on them. And students with loan debt may be reluctant to go into lower-paying public-sector work, leading to staffing shortages at state agencies.
A borrower is considered delinquent after missing a payment to the servicing companies that handle billing, repayment plan enrollments, and defaults.
Damian’s office, established under California’s Student Borrower Bill of Rights, began as a narrow statutory role but now serves as a hub for outreach, “Student Loan 101” workshops and escalated complaints to federal agencies.
Roughly 16 states plus the District of Columbia have followed suit, creating ombuds offices to guide borrowers through confusing paperwork and misinformation. Damian believes these ombuds offices should be in every state, as borrowers across the country will likely have similar questions and little help at the federal level.
“If you don’t have an ombudsperson or even just a person at the state level who can educate borrowers, that will make a difference,” Damian told Stateline. “These borrowers are trying to pay, but the system is broken. No other financial product works this way.”
Student loans became a key issue during last year’s election race, with President Joe Biden blocked by the U.S. Supreme Court in his effort to offer relief to 40 million Americans. In its waning days, his administration did forgive loans for some 150,000 borrowers under previous programs.
But President Donald Trump opposes most loan forgiveness programs, and in May, the U.S. Education Department issued a “Dear Colleague” letter to higher education institutions, reminding them of their legal obligations to help former students understand repayment responsibilities and access support.











These borrowers are trying to pay, but the system is broken. No other financial product works this way.


– Celina Damian, California student loan servicing ombudsperson



Some conservative economists say that federal loan forgiveness and financial aid hurt all students, offering colleges an incentive to raise tuition or lower their own institutional aid.
Winston Berkman-Breen, the legal director at the Student Borrower Protection Center, a nonprofit aimed at protecting borrowers and improving the repayment system, said that more than 2 million borrowers are stuck in a backlog of unprocessed applications for income-driven repayment (IDR) plans — calculated pay structures meant to keep payments affordable based on a borrower’s income.
Other borrowers have called federal agencies for help only to find that U.S. Education Department staff, including servicer-oversight teams, have been laid off as the Trump administration works toward dismantling the department entirely.
“There was an expectation to repay,” Berkman-Breen said. “But there was also an expectation that people would have access to affordable plans. That promise has broken down.”
States now have three primary tools to address student loan debt, Berkman-Breen said: enforcement actions to protect consumers, such as the 39-state lawsuit against servicer Navient; legal oversight by suing to uphold or challenge federal policy; and direct outreach to help public servants access Public Service Loan Forgiveness and similar programs.
Nineteen states now require registration for companies that service student loans, he said. And more than a dozen states align with federal policy to exempt forgiven loan balances from state income taxes.
‘Can’t wait for Washington’
Connecticut state Rep. Eleni Kavros DeGraw, a Democrat, calls student debt “a drag on the economy,” and said states can’t afford to wait for Congress — mired in partisan gridlock over student loan forgiveness — to find common ground.
“[Student debt] is stopping people from buying homes, starting families and fully participating in the economy,” she told Stateline. “That hurts us as a state, as a city, and we can’t wait for Washington to figure it out.”
Last year, Connecticut created a bipartisan reimbursement program that provides up to $20,000 for graduates of local colleges who make payments and complete community service. The state has distributed more than $2 million so far.
Kavros DeGraw hopes the program can serve as a model, and has already talked with lawmakers in other states on possibly developing their own versions of it.
“These were people who were already paying,” Kavros DeGraw said. “It just made sense. I think it’s something that other states could explore this session, and it would provide an immense deal of relief.”
Lawmakers in other states also have considered student loan legislation. This year, New Jersey introduced bills to register education lenders and cap interest rates. Lawmakers in New Mexico, New York and North Carolina have proposed Borrower Bill of Rights legislation. Arizona has a registration bill for private servicers. None of these measures has advanced far.
According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, more than 20 states have enacted laws expanding loan forgiveness, repayment programs and servicer oversight in recent years.
Several states are also investing directly in workforce-aligned loan forgiveness: Georgia expanded its service-cancelable loan program to cover dental students working in rural areas. Idaho created a loan repayment incentive for rural nurses. Kentucky now offers $5,000 stipends to attract new teachers. Maryland authorized Anne Arundel County to launch a local forgiveness program for public school educators.
Repayment
Student loan stress is not evenly distributed. Seven states, all with Republican‐controlled legislatures, report delinquency rates above 30% among borrowers required to make payments.
Mississippi leads the nation with a conditional delinquency rate of nearly 45% — meaning borrowers who should be making payments are late. That’s just ahead of Alabama, West Virginia, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana, all of which have rates above 31%, according to recent data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
By contrast, Illinois, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Vermont and New Hampshire maintain delinquency rates below 15%.
Experts say this chasm reflects deeper systemic differences, such as lower median incomes in higher delinquency states, along with weaker consumer protections and a higher share of students attending for-profit institutions or leaving college without a degree.
States also have promoted the federal Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, established in 2007, that offers help to public service professionals. New Mexico has an outreach campaign that includes prospective teachers and health care workers. Maine has provided guidance to public defenders on how they can take advantage of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program and touts a related state tax credit on a marketing site to lure new residents.
“States can regulate and enforce, but they can’t fix the structural problems in how repayment is administered,” said Michele Zampini, senior director of college affordability at The Institute for College Access & Success, a research organization that advocates for students. “They’re helping around the edges, but the core system is still broken.”
A November report from the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau found at least 3.9 million borrowers received misleading or inaccurate bills from servicing companies.
“The repayment system is not in a good place to provide the services and repayment options borrowers are legally entitled to,” Zampini said.
The Student Loan Borrower Survey, conducted between October 2023 and January 2024, found that 61% of borrowers who received debt relief made a beneficial life change earlier than they otherwise could have. Yet borrower awareness remains dangerously low: Nearly 42% of federal borrowers have only been on the standard repayment plan, and 31% of those didn’t know other options, such as an income-based plan, existed.
In California, a major part of Damian’s job in the past few months has been to help borrowers access existing forgiveness programs.
Meanwhile, new federal policy proposals could reshape repayment entirely. The Trump-backed One Big Beautiful Bill Act would consolidate existing IDR plans into a single tiered structure, with lower-income borrowers paying flat monthly rates and higher earners contributing 8% of their income. The bill also proposes extending standard repayment terms to 30 years — raising concerns it could delay forgiveness and inflate total interest costs.
The bill passed the U.S. House and is pending in the Senate.
‘Incentive to hike prices’
Andrew Gillen, a Cato Institute research fellow who recently testified before Congress, argues that any meaningful fix must address the incentives driving rising tuition — namely, federal aid being tied directly to college sticker prices.
“The link between rising tuition and increasing aid is what drives the Bennett Hypothesis, where federal student aid, in the form of loans, can lead to higher tuition costs at colleges and universities,” Gillen said in an interview. “If we instead use the median cost of attendance to calculate aid eligibility, we remove colleges’ incentive to hike prices just to capture more aid.”
Even without agreement on blanket forgiveness, experts agree on smaller bipartisan steps: streamlined repayment, stronger servicer oversight and targeted help for borrowers with the greatest need.
“We don’t want people defaulting. We don’t want payments that are too high for people just out of school. That should be the bipartisan starting point,” Zampini said.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)MINNEAPOLIS – Gov. Tim Walz on Thursday said that communication between states and the federal government under the second Trump administration “is nonexistent,” opening the door to catastrophe in the case of a natural disaster or other emergency.
Walz, during an interview with Minnesota Reformer editor Patrick Coolican at a States Newsroom conference, said that the Trump administration is unprepared for the next disaster — like another global pandemic — and that leaves states particularly vulnerable.
“The flow of information has been disrupted between the states and the federal government, and we just can’t get answers … No one is allowed to talk to us, and that’s really problematic,” Walz said.
The Minnesota governor said the silence from the feds differs from the first Trump administration. At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Walz said then-Vice President Mike Pence would call him every few weeks to check in to see what he needed. He said he sensed Pence would call in “under the radar, so he didn’t draw anybody’s attention.”
“There were a lot of great people inside the first Trump administration that, in spite of the president, were doing good work,” Walz said.
Walz said one of his biggest fears is a cybersecurity attack. The Trump administration has cut millions of dollars for several cyber security initiatives and slashed jobs from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which helps protect the nation’s critical infrastructure.
Walz discussed the role of the states in opposing the Trump administration’s agenda — particularly on immigration — and the Democratic Party’s current malaise.
Minnesota is increasingly reliant on immigrants, who are needed to fill jobs being vacated by an aging workforce. “There’s not a cow in Minnesota that’s not being milked by an immigrant,” he said. Walz said Minnesota would not be commandeered into enforcing immigration law, which he said is a federal duty.
Walz repeated a spiel he’s given around the country, including at a recent Democratic Party event in South Carolina, which has traditionally been early on the presidential primary calendar, fueling speculation that he is considering a presidential run.
He said he’s not running, but merely using his megaphone to help fill a vacuum left by a Democratic Party in disarray.
The governor urged Democrats to figure out how to become the party of the working class again and said Democrats need to “fill all the lanes” in the media environment to reach voters.
“I still have come to the conclusion that Trump fills so much space that you’ve got to fill all these new spaces. Do I think if we would have gone on, you know, Joe Rogan, would we have won? I doubt that, but I also don’t think it hurts,” Walz said. “If your message is good, you want to get out there.”
Walz backed the 2005-06 idea of former DNC Chair Howard Dean and his “50 State Project,” which sought to reach voters in areas not traditionally associated with Democrats.
“We’re probably never going to win Idaho, but … you got to be out there for it,” Walz said.
Walz said Democrats should rotate where they hold the early primary to reach more voters, which may not endear him to Democrats in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, the traditional early states that have long jealously guarded their first in the nation status.
When asked which state should be the first to hold the primary, Walz deadpanned “Minnesota.”

(Perry Bennett | West Virginia Legislative Photography) David Kelly, a current leader in the House of Delegates and pastor from Tyler County, will take over as commissioner of the state’s troubled jails and correctional system.
He spent 20 years in law enforcement before serving in the Legislature, where the Republican chaired a committee on jails and prisons. Kelly championed raises for correctional officers during a staffing crisis that prompted a state of emergency from 2022 through last year.
“My passion is to get in there and see what we can do to build on what we’ve got to make it better,” said Kelly, 68.
West Virginia’s prison system is one of the deadliest in the country with an ongoing issue of overcrowding. The overpopulated jails can lead to safety and security issues, sometimes leading to people who are incarcerated sleeping in day rooms in the facility.
“The elephant in the room is the overcrowding, and so we’ve got to work on that,” Kelly said.
As of June 3, the regional jails were 425 over capacity of 4,265, according to a spokesperson for the state’s Division of Corrections and Rehabilitation. The prisons are 486 under capacity.
“West Virginia has one of the most overcrowded jail systems in the country. This leads to deplorable conditions like increased violence, lack of access to basic medical care and sanitation and degrading practices like requiring people to sleep on floors,” said Rusty Williams, advocacy director for the American Civil Liberties Union of West Virginia. “We hope Commissioner Kelly will use his new position to bring a more compassionate and humane approach to managing this system.”
This year, state lawmakers passed several bills that lengthened sentences for crimes including drug dealing and fleeing from a police officer. It costs $35,000 per year for state prisoners.
“There are crimes that when they are committed, we need to make sure that the punishment [and] the sentencing fits the crime,” Kelly said. “I look forward to working with the legislature in the future and trying to come up with possible ways to deal with sentencing, to deal with the overcrowding.”
Lesley Nash is an attorney with Mountain State Justice, a nonprofit legal firm that sued WV DCR over the mental health care and medical care provided in 10 state regional jails.
She said the state over-incareates, often jailing individuals with substance abuse problems for minor property crimes. Sometimes individuals end up incarcerated after a family member called 911 seeking helping for substance abuse, Nash said.
“There are huge numbers of people that we have in jails and prisons who are in those facilities as a result of mental health or addiction issues,” Nash said. “What they need is mental health assistance.”
State improved jail staffing, other issues persist
Gov. Patrick Morrisey announced Kelly’s appointment as commissioner of WV DCR on June 2. Lance Yardley had been serving as the acting commissioner.
“It’s hard to say no to the governor when he called you and asked you to join his team. I’m thankful that he did.” Kelly said.
The state has made headway in hiring correctional officers under the leadership of former DCR Commissioner Billy Marshall, who was recently appointed by President Donald Trump to lead the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Kelly praised Marshall’s work, saying he hopes to build on that momentum.
Lawmakers have increased salaries for uniformed officers and DCR offered special hiring rate increases. The state was able to remove National Guard members, who had been filling in as correctional officers, in 2024 after reaching full staffing levels.
But, other problems persist, and West Virginia is facing numerous allegations and lawsuits about jails conditions, including excessive use of force and insufficient medical care. A suit filed in May says “inadequate medical care” at Eastern Regional Jail in Martinsburg led to the death of a 25-year-old woman who had Type 1 diabetes along with a history of substance abuse.
  Southern Regional Jail and Correctional Facility in Beaver, W.Va. (Chris Jackson | West Virginia Watch)
In December, a federal court approved a more than $4 million settlement in a class-action lawsuit for inmates at Southern Regional Jail and Correctional Facility in Raleigh County who alleged deplorable conditions in the jail. The lawsuit was filed in 2023.
“I need to sit down with the team in Charleston and see where we are, and then talk with the governor and his folks and see if they’ve got any plans they want implemented, and then we’ll go from there,” Kelly said.
Webb called on Kelly to ensure the jails provide prompt access to quality health care, consistent and sanitary water and facilitate faster reentry programs.
Several counties are struggling to pay their jail bills, Kelly noted. West Virginia counties pay the state per inmate per day to house inmates at regional jails. In 2022, jail bills cost the state’s 55 counties a total of $45 million, with many local governments listing the charge as their largest annual expense. A 2023 bill meant to address county jail bill costs hasn’t solved the problem.
“I don’t know what the answer is right now for that. That is a problem. There are counties that just simply can’t pay,” Kelly said.
He will continue to pastor a church in Wetzel County while serving as DCR commissioner.
“My faith guides me every day,” he said.
Kelly, who was first elected in 2018, plans to resign from his seat in the House of Delegates late this month before he officially begins his role as commissioner.

(Capital-Star photo by Vincent DiFonzo)Last month, pharmacists from across the state travelled to Harrisburg for an urgent meeting with lawmakers. Their goal was to communicate a simple message — pharmacies are closing at an alarming rate, eliminating one of the few places customers can receive free, unscheduled consultations with medical professionals. 
They warned they’re being driven out of business by middlemen in the pharmaceutical supply chain called pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs. 
Lawmakers took aim at this problem last year by passing the Pharmacy Benefit Reform Act, which sought to decrease the costs of prescription drugs and regulate PBMs. The legislation was touted by Gov. Josh Shapiro as an example of successful bipartisan reform while he was being considered for the vice presidential nomination.
Nearly a year after the law’s passage, pharmacists say it has failed to prevent closures. Since January 2024, at least 200 pharmacies have closed across the state. Now, they’re asking lawmakers to act again.
“The current PBM system is aptly harming our local pharmacies, jeopardizing patient access to care and threatening the very fabric of our community health infrastructure,” Victoria Elliot, CEO of the Pennsylvania Pharmacist Association, told lawmakers during the meeting last month. 
What are PBMs and how do they impact Pa. pharmacies and patients?
Pharmacy benefit managers are companies hired by insurance providers to administer prescription drug benefits of a health plan. They negotiate drug prices, decide what drugs are covered under insurance plans and reimburse pharmacies for drugs dispensed. 
Theoretically, PBMs secure lower drug prices for patients by streamlining communication between insurance companies, drug manufacturers and pharmacies. Pharmacy advocates insist the opposite is true — that PBMs are raising drug costs and driving them out of business through anticompetitive practices that force them to dispense prescriptions at a loss. 
Prescription for trouble: Pennsylvania pharmacists say PBMs are driving pharmacy closures

The three largest PBMs — CVS Caremark, OptumRx and ExpressScripts — control about 80% of the market and are owned by companies that also own national pharmacy chains and insurance companies. That means pharmacies that don’t agree to accept the reimbursement rates they set are likely to lose customers whose insurance plans rely on them.
E. Michael Murphy, senior advisor for state government affairs at the American Pharmacists Association and assistant professor of clinical pharmacy at Ohio State University, says low dispensing and reimbursement fees paid to pharmacies by PBMs are a leading cause of closures.
“Oftentimes, when pharmacies dispense a medication for a patient, they’re taking a loss on that medication, either in the reimbursement for acquiring that medication from a wholesaler or in the professional dispensing fee,” Murphy said. “And unfortunately you can only do that for so long before the business model crumbles. That’s one of the big reasons that we’ve seen community pharmacies closing across the country.”
Murphy said community pharmacy closures not only hurt small business owners, but also impact the ability of patients to access medications as they have to travel further to pick up prescriptions.
“When a community pharmacy closes, it can have a pretty dramatic impact on the health outcomes of that community,” he said. “There’s concern that can disproportionately affect patients in more marginalized or socioeconomicly vulnerable communities.” 
Murphy voiced support for ensuring state agencies have the resources to enforce existing laws and regulate “anticompetitive” PBM practices.
Greg Lopes, a spokesperson for the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association, a D.C.-based trade group that represents the country’s largest PBMs, says PBMs help, not harm, Pennsylvania pharmacies. 
“PBMs recognize that pharmacies provide access for patients to get drugs, so it makes no sense to blame PBMs for pharmacy closures in Pennsylvania,” said Lopes. “PBMs aren’t trying to put pharmacies out of business, in fact, PBMs are supporting community pharmacies in Pennsylvania through programs that increase reimbursement and advocating to allow them to expand the additional clinical services they can offer.”

He pointed to “customer preferences for online options and changing demographics,” as factors driving pharmacy closures. 
Pharmacists urge further action
PBM reforms passed with bipartisan support in last year’s Act 77, which expanded the Pennsylvania Insurance Department’s regulatory power and created new transparency requirements for PBMs operating in the state. But pharmacy advocates say the law didn’t go far enough, and pharmacies are still closing at an alarming rate. 
Rob Frankil, executive director of the Philadelphia Association of Retail Druggists told the Capital-Star that out of approximately 225 pharmacies represented by his organization, 12 have closed since January and 25 closed in 2024. He pointed to low reimbursement as the primary cause. 
“Eleven of the 12 pharmacies that my association lost this year are in Philadelphia,” he said. “They all went out of business because they’re not being paid enough for the prescriptions they’re filling.”
He wants legislation that addresses reimbursement rates directly. One proposal is to require PBMs to reimburse pharmacies based on the average national cost of the medication they’re dispensing, plus a fee set by the state that accounts for a pharmacist’s time and materials used. 
Neighboring West Virginia passed a similar law in 2021.
A spokesperson for Shapiro, asked if the governor would support further PBM reforms, responded with a quote from the governor’s February budget address, highlighting last year’s PBM reform law.
“We knew it was a problem that shady middlemen could jack up the cost of prescription drugs while driving our community pharmacies out of business,” the statement said. “So we came together to pass landmark reforms that bring transparency to how pharmacy benefit managers operate, keep more money in Pennsylvanians’ pockets, and protect the small and independent pharmacies we rely on in our communities.”
The primary sponsor of that PBM reform law, Rep. Jessica Benham (D-Allegheny), told the Capital-Star that further PBM reform is necessary, but said, “We are somewhat limited on the state level with what we are able to do.”
Benham added that understanding the full impact of Act 77 will take time. She noted the bill required the state Insurance Department to conduct a study on the impact on consumers and pharmacies of future legislation to set a standard dispensing fee of $10.49.
They will also study the impact of patient steering and spread pricing on prescription drug costs and pharmacy access. 
Patient steering is a practice in which PBMs drive customers to their preferred pharmacies, often owned by the same parent company as the PBM. Spread pricing occurs when a PBM pays one price for a drug and reimburses a pharmacy less, profiting off the difference.  
An Insurance Department spokesperson said the study requires “specialized expertise.” The department will procure a vendor “to assist with the development and implementation of the study,” but have not begun this process yet.
“We will have to wait for the results to then move forward on further legislation,” Benham said.
As it stands, a number of PBMs are contracted by individual Medicaid providers, and are allowed to set their own reimbursement policies. Frankil told lawmakers last month that dispensing fees can be as low as a dollar. A 2020 study commissioned by a community pharmacy advocacy group found the average cost of dispensing a prescription for a pharmacy is $12.40. 
One proposal Benham said she supports would have the Department of Human Services, which oversees state Medicaid, use a single PBM to administer Medicaid benefits, an action pharmacy advocates are demanding that has precedent in other states. 
In 2022, the Ohio Medicaid Department moved to a single PBM to administer Medicaid, with one entity overseeing prescriptions covered by Medicaid. This forced Medicaid managed care organizations to work with a single PBM contracted through the state’s Medicaid Department, rather than procuring their own.
A 2025 study found this move saved Ohio’s Medicaid Department $140 million, saved the state $333 million in administrative costs and allowed $700 million dispensing fees to be paid to pharmacies in the two years since its implementation. 
Murphy, an Ohio resident, praised this move.
“Oftentimes, when I talk to pharmacists in Ohio, they’ll say that Ohio Medicaid is the best and most stable source of revenue for their businesses, which is just indicative of how positive this program has rolled out,” he said.

(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)Rhode Island has a major opportunity to modernize and reform its recycling system with two common-sense bills currently before the legislature.
H6207 sponsored by Rep. Carol Hagan McEntee, a South Kingstown Democrat, and S 996, sponsored by Sen. Mark McKenney, a Warwick Democrat, would establish a modern Deposit Return System –  a.k.a. “A bottle bill” – and Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) for packaging. EPR essentially requires producers of packaging to fund a program for collecting and recycling discarded packaging to help minimize their environmental impact.
Together, these proven policies would reduce litter, cut costs for the consumer, and build a cleaner environment. 
As the legislative debate continues, it’s clear that momentum is growing for recycling reform — not just among environmental advocates and local leaders, but within the private sector as well. Environmental champions like Save the Bay and Clean Water Action strongly support these initiatives. And you might be surprised to learn that  the beverage industry does too. Many beverage companies see a combined bottle bill and EPR system as a smart, forward-looking solution to address flaws with the way we handle recycling. 
Rhode Island’s recycling rate is stuck at just 26%. In Providence, it’s worse — recycling rates hover in the single digits, and nearly 650 pounds of recyclables per household are rejected each year due to contamination. That adds up to over 121,000 tons of collected recyclable material per year that the city pays $1.14 million to dispose of in the Central Landfill in Johnston, which is projected to run out of room in about 20 years. This represents both wasted resources and missed economic opportunity.
We can — and must — do better. Leading beverage companies who are part of the Coalition for High Performance Recycling (CHPR) agree. 
A growing number of beverage companies are publicly endorsing recycling reform in Rhode Island. These companies understand there’s a clear business case for the industry to support and fund improved recycling systems. 
A reliable, domestic supply of recycled materials is essential for both short- and long-term success. Brands can no longer rely on volatile global markets, unstable geopolitics, or imported raw materials to meet their production needs.  
Companies need a steady, local stream of recycled material — so that each can and bottle can be recycled into new cans and bottles. 
Who belongs to CHPR ? Primo Brands — whose trusted brands include Poland Spring and Saratoga. Other participating beverage and bottling companies are Diageo North America,whose brands include Guinness and Johnnie Walker New Belgium Brewing Company; Niagara Bottling; and Red Bull.
As Primo Brands recently testified at the Rhode Island State House in support of a modern bottle bill and EPR, “we need a greater supply of recycled materials, and we need it to be domestic.” 










A growing number of beverage companies are publicly endorsing recycling reform in Rhode Island. These companies understand there’s a clear business case for the industry to support and fund improved recycling systems. 


The current domestic recycling system doesn’t get the job done. One reason is that curbside recyclables are lumped into one single, albeit convenient, system. That inevitably leads to contamination, which reduces the value of the recycled products and the ability to turn them into food grade material. Another problem is that people are not sufficiently educated and incentivized to recycle. 
A modern bottle bill with an extended producer responsibility policy together provides an environmental improvement strategy and improves consumer education and recycling. Plus, they’re smart, complementary business strategies that support stable, domestic supply chains that produce higher-quality recycled materials and help keep costs down for the consumer.  
Rhode Island can become a national model for high-performance recycling.  
By passing H6207 and S996 — a modern bottle bill plus EPR — the state can significantly reduce litter, pollution, and waste, protect its natural beauty and resources, and create a more circular, resilient, and sustainable economy and environment. 
We need to tune out the scare tactics and outdated talking points of industry opponents and support recycling reform for Rhode Island.

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)The budget ax wielded by DOGE and the Trump administration fell on Job Corps last week, when the administration announced it was closing 99 of the program’s 123 centers across the country.
 Job Corps, which began as part of the War on Poverty in 1964, provides free education, job training and a place to live for low-income youth ages 16 to 24. The closings shutter three rural Kentucky locations that serve over 500 students: the Carl D. Perkins Job Corps Center in Prestonsburg, the Earle C. Clements Job Corps Academy in Morganfield and the Muhlenberg Job Corps Center in Greenville.
But why is Job Corps being terminated? Doing so harms the same “forgotten men and women of our country” that the administration says are its priority. Job Corps helps young people who are receiving public assistance or are homeless, in foster care, or qualify for free or reduced-price lunch. In 2017, 29% of the youth enrolling had a disability and 65% had left high school before earning a diploma. 
Trump shutdown of Job Corps will leave ‘big void’ in this rural Kentucky place

So is Job Corps being shuttered to “promote work?” Far from it. The Kentucky centers were putting students on paths to becoming welders, computer technicians, certified nursing assistants, pharmacy techs, culinary arts employees, automotive mechanics and more.
And just as importantly, Job Corps reaches those who face the biggest problems entering career-track employment. A recent report notes that Job Corps often draws from youth who have tried multiple times to earn a secondary or postsecondary credential but dropped out under the demands of low-wage jobs and financial, family or mental health challenges.
The program’s approach takes these students’ monumental barriers into account. It is typically a residential program, eliminating the worries of food, housing and transportation. It also offers small living stipends and health care, counseling services, life skills training, and post-program help in transitioning to employment or additional education.
Then maybe Job Corps is something our country just cannot afford? No one can say that with a straight face when Job Corps costs 0.02% of the federal budget while the administration is pushing tax cuts skewed to the wealthy that cost 400 times as much.
Neither can anyone credibly claim that the program does not work. The most rigorous study of Job Corps to date found that it helped improve employment, earnings and education outcomes. Not every hardship-facing young person comes out a roaring success, particularly in an economy that produces far too few living wage jobs. But it is easy to find testimonials of Job Corps graduates in Facebook posts:

“This place picked me up when I was broken. It gave me a reason to wake up in the morning. It gave me back the pieces of myself I thought I’d lost forever. I started to believe I could become someone,” said Jessica Williams, a current Job Corps student in Prestonsburg.
“My 21 year old son is on the autism spectrum. He is currently on Medicaid and is learning Information Technology (IT) at the Morganfield, KY Earle C. Clements Job Corps training center. He is approximately half-way through his education there … Just last week, we had discussed his plan to finish his IT program, enter into the AI/Robotics program and then obtain his advanced education … He has long wanted to work in Cyber Security, but he is now devastated,” said Dale K. Hart.
“Tearing down Job Corps, a place where you learn stability and free trades … is absolutely mind boggling. I was at Muhlenberg Job Corps Center from 2015-2016, I met amazing people from all walks of life, seen people who were on their very last strand of hope make something of themselves years later,” said Keeley Staples.

The young people in Job Corps, who have survived so many bumps in life, now face a new one. Many may lose hope and direction. Some will become homeless. And it is right to fear that cutting support for left-behind young people will further crowd our jails and juvenile detention centers and push up already obscene addiction rates.
It is important to ask why the administration is announcing these and other harmful cuts. But a more pressing question is for all of us: will we let them happen?

Allen Chesser (R-Nash) discusses a child welfare bill (Photo: Lynn Bonner)An expansive bill overhauling the child welfare system that aims to increase stability for children in foster care won approval from a Senate committee on Thursday.
House Bill 612 provides for increased oversight of local child welfare office decisions by the state Department of Health and Human Services. It sets out timeframes for court hearings on plans to move children in foster care to permanent homes. Courts would be allowed to authorize post-adoption contact agreements between biological and adoptive parents. 
Legislators have discussed comprehensive changes to child welfare and foster care laws for years. 
“It’s a long time coming,” Rep. Allen Chesser (R-Nash), one of the bill sponsors, told the Senate Health Committee during a Wednesday hearing. “I think it’s one of the most bipartisan issues we have.”
When they discussed the bill Wednesday, the Senate committee members heard concerns from a lawyer and adoptive parents that the bill would discourage infant adoptions.  
The bill gives a biological father up to three months after a child’s birth, when he is not married to the child’s mother, to acknowledge paternity or attempt to form a relationship with the child before his parental rights are terminated. If a possible father finds out that a woman has fraudulently concealed her pregnancy or a child’s birth, he would have up to 30 days after finding out to acknowledge paternity before his parental rights are terminated. 
“From an adoptive parent perspective, this bill is frankly terrifying,” said Natalie Carscadden, an adoptive parent. “Imagine the anxiety that comes when a person who’s never met or shown any interest in a child suddenly appears in requests for custody up to a three-month time span after that child is born. This would upset the status quo and put significantly more legal risk on potential adoptive families.”
In the committee discussion Thursday, Chesser referenced a court decision on a father’s right to act within a “timely manner.”
“What we are doing is defining what a timely manner means,” he said. 
The Senate combined the measure with three other bills that have passed the House:

House Bill 795, which extends financial assistance for guardians who are related to children who won’t be adopted or returned to their parents. Payments through the Kinship Guardianship Assistance Program could start when children are 10. Under current law, children have to be 14 or older. 
House Bill 162 would have cities and counties require criminal background checks for any person they plan to hire who would work with children. 
House Bill 182, which would allow judges to issue permanent “no contact” orders against people convicted of violent crimes.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_4469-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-06 06:06:12.742520

Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, D-Va., are slamming the Republican spending plan moving through Congress, warning that tucked among its billion-dollar tax cuts for the wealthy is a dangerous gift to the gun industry that rolls back long-standing safety rules for firearm silencers.

Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, D-Va., are slamming the Republican spending plan moving through Congress, warning that tucked among its billion-dollar tax cuts for the wealthy is a dangerous gift to the gun industry that rolls back long-standing safety rules for firearm silencers.
In a blistering joint statement Thursday, the senators said the proposal would weaken gun laws that have been in place since 1934 by eliminating registration and ownership requirements for silencers, also known as suppressors — devices that muffle the sound of gunfire and make it harder for law enforcement to respond to active shooter situations.
“The Republican tax plan being pushed through Congress not only cuts critical services Virginians rely on in order to give huge tax breaks to billionaires,” Warner and Kaine said, “but it also makes our communities less safe by weakening gun safety measures on silencers.”
Though the change occupies just 12 lines in the nearly 400-page bill, the senators say its implications are severe. 
If passed, the bill would repeal the $200 tax on silencer purchases, wipe out federal registration requirements for the devices and deliver millions in savings to gun manufacturers. The suppressor tax, part of the National Firearms Act of 1934, has been a core part of federal gun law for nearly a century.
The two lawmakers pointed to the 2019 Virginia Beach mass shooting — where a gunman used a silencer to kill 12 people — as a grim example of what can happen when these devices are used. 
“Part of the reason that these registration and ownership requirements exist is because silencers, like the one that was used in the Virginia Beach mass shooting, make it harder for law enforcement to locate and respond to an active shooter,” they said.
Silencers are designed to reduce the sound, flash and recoil of a firearm, but their public safety risks have made them a focal point of debate. Law enforcement groups have long supported keeping suppressors regulated, arguing that they undermine gunshot detection technology and make it far more difficult to locate shooters in an emergency.
According to the National Shooting Sports Foundation, 4.5 million suppressors were registered with the federal government by the end of 2024, including 113,046 in Virginia. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates repealing the tax would cost the federal government $1.4 billion over ten years.
But for gun rights groups, even this deregulation isn’t enough. 
The American Firearms Association called the move “nothing more than a crumb dropped from the King’s table,” and its Vice President Patrick Parsons said Republicans should go further by eliminating regulations on short-barrel rifles, abolishing the ATF and repealing the National Firearms Act altogether.
Warner and Kaine argue the silencer provision is just one piece of a broader bill they say would do massive harm to working families while lavishing the ultra-rich. 
They warn that the legislation would strip health insurance from more than 262,000 Virginians, cut food assistance to over 204,000 people, raise energy costs across the state, and threaten more than 20,000 Virginia jobs.
They also noted the bill would eliminate a program that allows Americans to file taxes for free, raise taxes on minimum-wage workers, and blow a $3.8 trillion hole in the federal deficit — all while handing the top 0.1% of earners an average tax cut of $188,000.
“Americans deserve to feel safe in their communities,” the senators said, vowing to push back against “this disastrous bill” when it reaches the Senate floor.

While the Virginia Freedom of Information Act presumes all government business is by default public and requires officials to justify why exceptions should be made, too many Virginia leaders in practice take the opposite stance, acting as if records are by default private and the public must prove they should be handled otherwise.
In this feature, we aim to highlight the frequency with which officials around Virginia are resisting public access to records on issues large and small — and note instances when the release of information under FOIA gave the public insight into how government bodies are operating.
Shortly before his late-May death, U.S. Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Fairfax, expressed concern about the termination of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention staffers who handled Freedom of Information Act requests. 
It was one of his final acts as a member of Congress before passing away following an extended battle with cancer. 
In his letter to the CDC’s acting director, Connolly said that “the elimination of staff responsible for facilitating FOIA strongly implies an effort by the administration to prevent the public from obtaining information about their government that they are entitled to request.”
The staff cuts come as FOIA officers at the Food and Drug Administration, National Institutes of Health, and other agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services were also let go. 
Connolly also pointed out that several outbreaks of infectious disease have been reported across the country. 
“Now more than ever, maintaining transparency about the operations of the broader HHS — and CDC in particular — is crucial to understanding the government’s capacity to respond to such crises.”
Some outbreaks are currently noted on CDC’s website, but with no FOIA-dedicated staff to handle records requests, it may be harder for journalists and citizens to seek further information that could aid public health.
 Former Richmond fire department employee under investigation for potential fraudulent spending

Records obtained by the Richmond Times-Dispatch show that a former Richmond Fire Department employee spent over $800,000 at a company registered to his home between 2017 and 2024. 
Reginald Thomas, a former analyst for RFD, used his city credit card, purchase orders and invoices to spend money at RPM Supply Co., LLC. The entity is registered to a house in Henrico County that he and his wife own. 
Though Richmond city officials did not say how much, if any, of the total was spent on legitimate products or services, they did confirm that he is no longer an employee. His conduct has since become the subject of two investigations — one by Richmond’s auditor and another by the city’s inspector general. 
The investigation into Thomas is among the latest actions the city has taken to address a history of funding issues tied to card misuse by employees. This spring, Mayor Danny Avula announced restrictions on employees’ use of purchasing cards for several months while leaders re-evaluate how employee spending is handled overall. Last year, the inspector general found that nearly $500,000 in RIchmond tax dollars were wasted or misused through use of employees’ cards. 
 
The Mercury’s efforts to track FOIA and other transparency cases in Virginia are indebted to the work of the Virginia Coalition for Open Government, a nonprofit alliance dedicated to expanding access to government records, meetings and other state and local proceedings.


 Recidivism rates touted by Virginia state prison system, contributing factors not fully disclosed

Recently, Virginia’s Department of Corrections announced and celebrated low recidivism rates, but not mentioned in the agency’s news release was a note from the department’s research team suggesting the achievement was due to the effects of COVID-19 on Virginia’s court system. 
Recividism — when former prisoners reoffend and end up back in prison — is a metric law enforcement agencies often use  to measure the success of rehabilitation programs or other efforts to lower crime rates. Prison reform advocates and rehabilitation advocates also view these metrics as either calls to action or reasons to celebrate programs that may benefit  incarcerated people, their families, and the communities to which they return. 
The latest announcement from the state focuses on recidivism among former prisoners released between July 2020 and June 2021 and only examines people who returned to prison within three years of release — not those who were rearrested during the same time period, Richmond Times-Dispatch reported. 
About 17% of released prisoners landed back in prison, while 44% were rearrested, according to the report. 
While rearrests were higher, those numbers aren’t counted as recidivism. Because the state’s definition ties recidivism to reincarceration, it is influenced by how quickly courts deliver verdicts — and Virginia’s courts were under emergency orders that slowed proceedings until the summer of 2022. 
“Re-incarceration rates are lower during follow-up years impacted by COVID-19 due to court closures and sentencing delays,” the research team wrote in its report.
Kyle Gibson, a spokesperson for VADOC, acknowledged that recidivism rates were lower due to COVID-19, “but VADOC cannot conclusively say that the pandemic was the sole cause of the lower rates.”
Attorney General Jason Miyares, who is seeking reelection this year, has emphasized on social media that the low recidivism rate supports his tough-on-crime approach as the state’s top lawyer. 
In a post to X, he said there are two approaches to lowering the rate: “hold violent repeat offenders accountable or let them out early.”
“For four years, I’ve fought to put violent criminals behind bars while leftist politicians demanded leniency and reduced sentences,” he added. “We see which approach works.”
While the recidivism rates have declined over the past decade, according to a Richmond Times-Dispatch analysis, the time frame that VADOC recently celebrated occurred prior to Miyares taking office. 
 Audit shows Roanoke spent $5 million over city’s general fund budget

Without city council approval, the city of Roanoke overspent by $5 million last year, WSLS reported. 
A recent audit of expenditures found that the city’s general fund exceeded the final budget.
“We are stewards of taxpayer dollars,” said newer council member Nick Hagen, who joined the city’s legislative body after the issues occurred. “They’re not ours — they’re the people’s.”
He suspected staff turnover might be part of the problem with lack of budget oversight. 
This is because the former city manager had stepped down, a successor was appointed, and a new city council took office.
The audit also revealed that much of the overspending came from the Children’s Services Act — which funds services for at-risk youth — and the city’s fire department, which faced rising overtime costs and implemented pay increases. 
Still, to ensure spending is justified and remains within budget, WSLS reported that the city claimed to be implementing reforms. There will be more frequent budget reviews going forward, new staff will be hired, and stricter internal protocols will be put in place.

(Ethan Miller/Getty Images)After a marathon day of floor votes, Senate Republican leadership tried multiple avenues to force a public hearing on a proposed red flag law, less than two weeks before the Maine Legislature is scheduled to adjourn. 
Senate Minority Leader Trey Stewart (R-Aroostook) attempted four maneuvers to force a public hearing for LD 1378, which was born out of a citizens initiative process. The proposal is already set to appear on the November ballot for voters to decide on. 
Red flag laws, formally known as extreme risk protection orders, are a mechanism to temporarily confiscate one’s guns if they are deemed to be a threat by law enforcement or their family members.
Arguing that they are obligated by state law to hold a hearing for the bill, Stewart put forth multiple proposals to waive the hearing requirement or have another body other than the Judiciary Committee hold it. When those attempts failed, Stewart proposed what he said was the only option left: adjourning the session early. 
The Maine Senate rejected all of the measures in party-line votes, with a few members absent. 
After a failed legislative attempt last year to pass a red flag law, the Maine Gun Safety Coalition collected more than 80,000 signatures in about two months in support of the initiative. 
The Legislature’s Judiciary Committee held a public hearing in April 2024 for a red flag bill amid criticisms of the state’s current yellow flag law, which has faced scrutiny after an independent commission found that it should have been triggered to remove firearms from Robert Card II, who perpetrated the October 2023 mass shooting in Lewiston.
In recent weeks, Republicans have raised questions about why the bill has not gotten a public hearing this session.
When Stewart previously asked about it on the chamber floor, Senate President Mattie Daughtry (D-Cumberland) said the Judiciary Committee still had possession of the bill, essentially saying it is up to the committee to decide what to do with it next. 
Sen. Susan Bernard (R-Aroostook) said on the Senate floor Thursday night that she hopes she and the people of Maine “won’t be duped.”
Daughtry also argued the current legislative rules take precedence over requirements put in place by previous legislatures. She specifically cited a rule that says public hearings and work sessions must be arranged by the speaker of the House and Senate president. If they can’t agree, the committee is to decide with a majority vote.  
Sen. Rick Bennett (R-Oxford) said he was concerned that this decision was setting a “reckless precedent.”
“A ruling like that, which is within the prerogative of the chair to make, is deeply disturbing because it kicks in the teeth that notion of fundamental openness and transparency on which this Senate and this Legislature relies,” he said.

(Photo by Arshia Khan for Arkansas Advocate, June 2025)Building in some of Arkansas’ fastest-growing cities hit a wall last spring after the Arkansas Department of Health ceased approving any significant new projects.
Centerton and Highfill, two communities in the booming Northwest Arkansas region, grew by 7.2% and 15.2%, respectively, between July 1, 2023 and last July 1, according to the Census Bureau.
Both towns remain relatively small — just shy of 26,000 for Centerton and just under 3,000 for Highfill — but their exponential growth over the past three decades now poses a significant problem as an estimated 34 people move to the region every day: what to do with the sewage all those new residents and businesses produce.
That’s why the health department hasn’t approved a project in Centerton since May 2024. In a December letter, the department stated it would be “unable to approve any additional projects that will increase the flow of wastewater” to Decatur’s sewage treatment plant “until there is capacity available at the facility.”
As one developer said: “You’ll be looking at 1,000 open acres just primed for development, and you can’t do nothing with it because it has no infrastructure.”
The issue came into focus March 10 in a Centerton Utilities building conference. The presence of the Centerton and Decatur mayors at a water and wastewater planning meeting of Centeron’s Utilities Board highlighted the seriousness of the stakes.
Centerton doesn’t treat its own sewage. It sends it all to Decatur, population about 1,727, and therein lay the problem.
Decatur had plans to expand its wastewater plant’s capacity from 3.8 million gallons a day (MGD) to 5.25 MGD. Officials estimated that getting the health department to sign off on the plan would take six months or more, and with the specter of tariffs potentially doubling the projected cost, an already significant delay threatened to become even more drawn out.

That’s why Centerton’s officials were looking at other solutions. The first option, with a $5.7 million price tag, would involve diverting some of Centerton’s sewage to Bentonville. But as utilities board members acknowledged, there were questions about whether Bentonville’s mayor would be amenable to the idea. 
The second option involved linking to the Northwest Arkansas Conservation Authority (NACA) wastewater collection system. The cost: $14 million — $10 million for connection and capacity fees and $4 million for capital costs like pipe. That doesn’t cover the cost of actually treating the sewage.
“Water, sewer building, it’s a hot subject around here,” said Jeff Dehnhardt, director of Water & Wastewater Engineering with ESI, Centerton’s engineering consultant. “I think everywhere in the region is experiencing the impact of all of the growth in Northwest Arkansas, and none of it is free.” 
“The day of reckoning has come,” said utilities board member Robert Anderson.
 Out of mind

More than three decades ago, Northwest Arkansas leaders saw the proverbial writing on the wall and began preparing the region for its current growth.
The Northwest Arkansas Council, a nonprofit established in 1990 by business leaders like Sam Walton, Don Tyson and J.B. Hunt to help promote the region, tackled infrastructure priorities like a new airport, XNA, because fog-bound Drake Field affected business travel. 
Because many small towns struggled with adequate water supply, the Two-Ton Water System (aka the Benton/Washington Regional Public Water Authority) became another council priority. 
Interstate 49 was a priority because businesses needed to be able to transport goods in and out of the region. 
But wastewater was a few rungs down the ladder of priorities.
Water and wastewater systems “especially the pipeline systems … they’re out of sight, out of mind,” said Celine Hyer, co-author of the wastewater chapter of the American Society of Civil Engineers’ 2025 Report Card for America’s Infrastructure. As a result, they’re not getting the money needed to refurbish or rehabilitate them “because nobody sees them,” she said. 
That’s part of the reason America’s wastewater infrastructure received a D+ in the report card, Hyer said.
But deficiencies and a lack of capacity underfoot begin to have effects aboveground.
 Wakeup call

Last fall, Northwest Arkansas Council CEO Nelson Peacock said he started hearing about a looming sewer system crisis from developers, city officials, businesses, the Arkansas Department of Health, and others. 
“That’s when we felt, ‘Wow, this is a little bit more than we saw.’ And so we need a regional approach,” he said.
“Every city, and every issue, has its own story of how and why it got there,” Peacock said. A master plan, which could take up to 24 months to complete, “is really the only way to help us get a handle on this and to help cities make the best decisions. Because all those decisions are going to impact others,” he said.

 Northwest Arkansas has been here before

In 2002, the region’s municipalities were facing pressure to expand water treatment plants and increase wastewater discharge to reduce phosphorus levels in the Illinois River and tributaries like Osage Creek. That prospect — coupled with 20-year growth projections showing the region’s population more than doubling, “run[ning] together to become like a regional metroplex” — was reason enough to look for solutions, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported.
Their solution? The Northwest Arkansas Conservation Authority, or NACA.
Arkansas Democrat-Gazette columnist Mike Masterson compared the authority to the development of Beaver Lake in the 1950s. Former 3rd District Congressman Jim Trimble “and other visionaries saw 70 years into the future when the Beaver Water District was formed to deal with the entire area’s projected water needs,” Masterson wrote. “Forming NACA is close to what occurred when the Beaver District was formed.”
The conservation authority was meant to encourage cities to pool their resources. At the time, area cities were considering as many as six new wastewater treatment plants in the Illinois River watershed (Fayetteville was the only one that had moved forward with a new plant, which opened in 2008). 
In the 1970s, the federal government offered grants for sewage plants with a regional focus. Those incentives went away during the Reagan years, but supporters could point to regional and local successes.
One was the Beaver Water District, which a Northwest Arkansas Conservation Authority organizer praised for “regionally allocating lake water to area towns and cities.”
When the conservation authority started up, Rogers and Springdale were the only members. By fall 2005, with talk of a regional treatment plant materializing, eight more municipalities had signed up: Bentonville, Bethel Heights, Cave Springs, Centerton, Highfill and Lowell in Benton County, and Elm Springs and Tontitown in Washington County.
But less than a week after the June 2009 groundbreaking, the Democrat-Gazette reported, Bentonville and Tontitown “will be the only cities initially served by Northwest Arkansas’ first regional sewer plant, and it’s likely to be a good while before others join the $68 million project.” 

Among the reasons: Rogers had finished an expansion of its own wastewater plant just two months before.
“NACA is way, way down the road,” said Mayor Perry Long of Lowell, which already sent its sewage to plants in Springdale and Rogers. 
Elm Springs and Cave Springs used septic-tank effluent pumps that still had plenty of capacity.
“We’re good for probably the next 20 years,” said Rene Langston, Springdale Water Utilities director.

  ‘No consequences’

Even though the NACA facility was “a very bold and good decision, there were no consequences” for the municipalities that pulled out, said Lane Crider, Beaver Water District CEO. 
  Lane Crider, CEO, Beaver Water District (Beaver Water District photo)
“I’m not gonna say [it was] a mistake, but you know, it was certainly something that has hampered the ultimate success and future development of that facility.”
George Spence, a member of the authority’s board from around 2003 to 2021, said coming together as NACA was a way to “take care of our own communities. But it was always going to be based on the individual cities wanting to come, not any kind of overriding authority to control that decision.”
Spence said he didn’t think a state-imposed regional plan would have worked “because you wouldn’t have had any political support. Nobody, nobody, nobody from the individual communities would have wanted to sign up for giving up their ability to control, to determine their future.”
Other pressures posed challenges to regional authority’s success. In early 2009, the EPA stated the plant could discharge no more than 0.1 milligram of phosphorus for each liter of treated sewage by 2012. The authority had been planning to build a plant that would discharge 10 times that amount into Osage Creek.
NACA’s plant was completed in 2010 in Highfill for $65 million with the capacity to treat 3.6 MGD.
Planners thought they’d need 80 MGD by 2060, but “you can’t go ahead and build that capacity because paying for it would start before that supply caught up to demand,” Spence said. They’d also have to consider the impact on rates, permit approval and accessing federal or state money, he said.
In 2017, the authority began exploring an expansion to double the plant’s capacity to 7.2 MGD, Plant Director Mike Neil said. A $55 million loan from the state was expected to cover the cost (plus the cost to fix a faulty pipeline). In 2022, the agency asked for an additional $20 million loan to cover rising building costs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.

Neil said they hope to have the expansion completed by mid-summer, with a final cost of $80 million.
Even as smaller communities have begun to tie into the conservation authority’s system — Cave Springs linked up this spring; Highfill is about a month and a half out — the problem has been a lack of master plans that project the needs of the entire region.
“One of the big issues that all of the littler cities have is that there’s not a master plan,” Neil said. Smaller cities “never had to contend with anything like this before. There just hasn’t been a need for it.”
 ‘Plenty of capacity’

Centerton Utilities Director Malcolm Attwood said the impending lack of capacity from wastewater infrastructure had really only been on their radar “since early 2024.” 
Centerton’s 1.27 MGD should have been a drop in the bucket for Decatur’s 3.8 MGD plant to handle. But Decatur also receives sewage from the Simmons Foods poultry processing plant, an average 3.05 million gallons a day, according to the latest available data. That, coupled with population growth, means Decatur can’t take any more sewage.
“I think the previous director and our commission thought they had plenty of capacity in Decatur,” Attwood said. “We knew we were all growing. I just don’t think we knew at the rate they were growing, and what Simmons was going to be doing … that’s kind of how we got in this position.”
Not everything has ground to a standstill, however. With Bentonville facing its own water woes — and $103 million in infrastructure improvements, according to the Bentonville Bulletin — Centerton had opted to tie into NACA, Attwood said in late May. It’s now a matter of funding. 
“We’ve got to figure out how we’re gonna come up with the money, whether it’s increased rates, or get a bond, or both.” It’s possible they could use the one-to-one match offered by the recently signed Act 812, which created a state matching grant program for shovel-ready water and wastewater infrastructure projects, but he said he expected it to be “very competitive.”

 Future growth and wastewater infrastructure

The Northwest Arkansas Regional Planning Commission is scheduled to meet Friday with city leaders from Bentonville, Centerton, Decatur, Gentry, Gravette and Highfill to discuss “future growth and wastewater infrastructure treatment planning in this part of Benton County.”
Planning Commission Executive Director Tim Conklin said the meeting is aimed at improving awareness and understanding. This becomes especially important as the smaller communities outside the larger cities absorb even more growth. Northwest Arkansas is projected to add 130,000 people between 2020 and 2030, compared to 100,000 in previous decades. Conklin noted that smaller communities like Pea Ridge and Highfill are seeing even higher growth rates, 17% and 15%, than Centerton. 
Communication matters more than ever, Conklin said, “because we can have very large national home builders show up and double the population of one of the small cities with one development.” 
“We don’t have one big central city that understands everything that’s happening within their community… we have multiple communities sharing the same infrastructure, and so people that own and operate and maintain that infrastructure need to have a really good understanding of what’s happening outside of their own city,” Conklin said.
Naturally, that brings up questions: Namely, who’s going to pay for the necessary infrastructure? And how fast will they be able to build it?
“Those are all very good questions,” Conklin said.  The commission is seeking a consultant to answer those questions over the next 18-24 months, he said. Once completed, the Northwest Arkansas Comprehensive Study of Wastewater Management and Needs in Benton and Washington counties will include:

Estimated costs of recommended capital improvements to accommodate projected employment and population growth, with a breakdown of responsibilities by city and/or utility over the next 25 years.
A prioritized implementation plan for wastewater improvements, including recommended public financing options.
Public presentations in multiple forums to communicate the region’s wastewater needs and priorities.

Asked how this might be different from previous regional efforts, including a similarly titled plan published in 1974, Conklin said, “When you get to the point of not being able to move forward with additional housing and additional employment growth, job creation, it has to. We’ll get together, and we will work together to figure that out.”",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Centerton-construction-aa-13-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-06-06 05:06:03.949955

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Medical experts are dismayed over a federal report’s claim that kids are overprescribed asthma medications, saying it minimizes how many lives the drugs save.
Safe treatment protocols for asthma management have been carefully studied over the years, said Dr. Perry Sheffield, a pediatrician and professor at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.
“The federal government actually has some really beautiful and clear guidelines and strategies, and things that are vetted by and carefully edited by many experts in the field,” said Sheffield, who co-directs a region of the federally funded Pediatric Environmental Health Specialty Units that serves New Jersey, New York, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
Asthma affects more than 4.6 million American children, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It’s one of the most common long-term diseases in U.S. children.
The Make America Healthy Again Commission report released in late May, parts of which have been widely criticized, alleges that American children are on too much medication of various kinds, including asthma treatments.
Experts worry that the administration will set policy based on the assessment, dissuading insurers from covering asthma prescriptions. They also say that the report’s assertions could worsen disparities that affect children’s access to those medications and undermine years of research around the drugs.
Blue Cross Blue Shield now requires prior approval for severe asthma drugs in some states

The MAHA commission has until August to release a strategy based on the findings in the report.
Black and Indigenous children as well as those living in inner cities or in lower-income households are among those with the highest rates of asthma. Pollution disproportionately shrouds communities of color and can be a trigger that exacerbates the disease.
The report’s message could heighten those disparities, said Dr. Elizabeth Matsui, a University of Texas at Austin professor and a past chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ Section on Allergy and Immunology.
“One thing that has been very clear is that kids of color are less likely to be appropriately managed in terms of their asthma medication management,” she said. “So a message of overprescription that is simply not supported by the evidence also could potentially exacerbate already-existing racial and ethnic disparities in asthma that we have really not made much headway on.”
The commission’s claims
The report touches on childhood prediabetes, obesity and mental health. However, firearm injuries — the leading cause of death for children and teens in 2020 and 2021, according to the CDC — weren’t mentioned.
The 70-page report from the commission, chaired by Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr., claims four main issues are the drivers behind childhood chronic disease: poor diet, aggregation of environmental chemicals, lack of physical activity and chronic stress, and “overmedicalization.”
Matsui and other experts said the report’s use of that word is “problematic.”
“The implication could be, unfortunately, that when a child has asthma — so, they have coughing, chest tightness, wheezing — that that is not really a disease,” said Matsui. “We know for a fact that that’s a disease, and we know that it is quite treatable, quite controllable, and that it has profound impacts on the child’s day-to-day life.”
Other scientists have similarly criticized the report, saying it makes sweeping and misleading generalizations about children’s health without sufficient evidence. The White House corrected the report after nonprofit news outlet NOTUS found that it cited studies that didn’t exist.











The implication could be, unfortunately, that when a child has asthma … that that is not really a disease. We know for a fact that that's a disease.


– Dr. Elizabeth Matsui, University of Texas at Austin professor



When it comes to asthma, the report says, “Asthma controller prescriptions increased 30% from 1999-2008.” That sentence originally cited a broken link to a study from 2011; the link was later replaced. Controller meds include inhalers.
The MAHA report also claims that “There is evidence of overprescription of oral corticosteroids for mild cases of asthma.” The original version of the report listed estimated percentages of oral corticosteroids overuse, citing a nonexistent study. The wording was changed and the citation was later replaced with a link to a 2017 study by pediatric pulmonologist Dr. Harold Farber.
The study was not a randomized controlled trial, which increases reliability. Farber  told NOTUS that the report made an “overgeneralization” of his research. Stateline also reached out to Farber, whose public relations team declined an interview request.
Oral corticosteroids are liquid or tablet medications used to reduce inflammation for conditions including allergies, asthma, arthritis and Crohn’s disease. For asthma, they’re used to treat severe flare-up episodes. The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America says the medications have been shown to reduce emergency room visits and hospitalizations, and that while they do come with risk of side effects, they’re mostly used in acute flare-ups. And while rare, asthma-related deaths in kids do occur, and are often preventable.
“Asthma medications, including oral steroids, are lifesaving,” said Dr. Elizabeth Friedman, a pediatrician at Children’s Mercy Kansas City. “I believe that physicians, not politicians, are best equipped and most effectively trained to make the determination of whether or not these medications are needed for our patients.”
Friedman worries that federal characterizations of asthma meds will affect how state Medicaid agencies cover the drugs. When Medicaid coverage changed for a common prescribed inhaler last year, many of her Missouri Medicaid patients were suddenly without the drug. They ended up hospitalized, she said.
Friedman directs Region 7 of the Pediatric Environmental Health Specialty Units, a network of experts that works to address reproductive and children’s environmental health issues. Region 7 provides outreach and education in Iowa, Kansas, Missouri and Nebraska.
She also said she’s concerned that the report is “making a broad, sweeping statement based on one epidemiologic study from one state.”
Increased use
An increase in inhaler prescriptions is not necessarily a bad thing, experts say. It’s a sign that kids are getting their medication.
There has been an increase in inhaler prescriptions, along with a corresponding decrease in the oral corticosteroids, which is what experts would want to see, said Chelsea Langer, bureau chief of the New Mexico Department of Health’s Environmental Health Epidemiology Bureau. She said that means kids are “following their asthma action plans and taking the controller medications to prevent needing the relief or treatment [oral] meds.”
Trump has canceled environmental justice grants. Here’s what communities are losing.

Asthma prevalence has increased over the years, meaning more people need medication, noted Dr. Alan Baptist, division head of Allergy and Clinical Immunology at Henry Ford Health in Michigan.
He said that because steroid tablets come with risk of side effects, it is best to limit them.
But for kids without access to a regular pediatric provider or to health insurance that covers an inhaler, cost can be an obstacle, he said. Fluticasone propionate, an FDA-approved medicine for people 4 and older, costs on average $200 or more for one inhaler without insurance.
“What often happens with kids, and especially kids who are in Medicaid, or who are in an underserved or disadvantaged population, they are not given appropriate asthma controller medication,” said Baptist, who helped write federal guidelines for asthma treatment best practices as part of a National Institutes of Health committee.
Baptist noted that while he was glad to see pollution mentioned in the report as a danger for kids, it’s at odds with the recent cuts to environmental health grants that aimed to address such asthma triggers.
“They’re somewhat cherry-picking some of the data that they’re putting down,” he said. “It says the U.S. government is ‘committed to fostering radical transparency and gold-standard science’ to better understand the potential cumulative impacts of environmental exposure. If that’s what they’re saying, then they should be funding even greater studies that look at the effects.”
Dr. Priya Bansal, an Illinois pediatrician and past president of the Illinois Society of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology, said she’s concerned the report doesn’t define mild, moderate or severe asthma to differentiate the different best-practice treatment plans.
Bansal also said she worries that federal officials’ characterization of an FDA-approved drug will lead to insurance companies refusing to cover inhalers or oral steroids for her patients who rely on them.
“I’m going to be worried about coverage for my asthmatics,” she said. “The question is, what’s the next move that they’re going to make? If they think that, are they going to now say, ‘Hey, we’re not going to cover inhalers for mild asthmatics’?”

It’s hard to fathom in a proposal that includes billions upon billions of dollars in tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, but one of the most significant changes included in the massive budget bill approved by the U.S. House late last month was this: big cuts to the nation’s main anti-hunger program.
Under the legislation, millions of people would lose SNAP food assistance benefits. Meanwhile, states would be saddled with 14 billion dollars in new costs.
And the impacts will be felt in the stomachs of families across the nation.
As Raleigh-area Congresswoman Deborah Ross explained last week, in her district – one of the state’s more affluent ones  – 20,000 of her adult constituents will lose all of their SNAP benefits.
Statewide, a total of almost half a million people will lose benefits and the cuts will ripple through grocery stores and the economy as a whole.
The bottom line: Rep. Ross is right. The Republican budget will cause irreparable harm to the people of our state. All caring and thinking North Carolinians should support her effort to push back.

(Photo by Ariana Figueroa/States Newsroom)In a unanimous decision Thursday, the U.S. Supreme Court has sided with an Ohio woman who claimed she was the victim of reverse discrimination by her employer.
The justices determined the lower courts improperly forced her to clear a higher burden of proof and sent the case back for further hearings.
How we got here
In 2019, after working at the Ohio Department of Youth Services for 15 years, Marlean Ames applied for a promotion. Instead, she claims her supervisors “conspired” to demote her and move her to a different facility.
The woman who got the job Ames wanted, and the man who took her old job both identify as LGBTQ+. Ames is straight.

In 2020, Ames filed a lawsuit in federal court claiming her supervisors discriminated against her on account of her sexual orientation. The district and appeals court both sided with the agency — Ames had not shown the “background circumstances” to demonstrate her bosses punished her because she was straight.
The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday rejected that background circumstances rule. Writing for the majority, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson stated it “cannot be squared with the text of Title VII or our longstanding precedents. And nothing Ohio has said, in its brief or at oral argument, persuades us otherwise.”

Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 holds that employers may not discriminate on the basis of “race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.” Importantly, Jackson wrote, the text draws no distinction between members of majority and minority groups.
“By establishing the same protections for every ‘individual’ — without regard to that individual’s membership in a minority or majority group — Congress left no room for courts to impose special requirements on majority-group plaintiffs alone,” Jackson wrote.
She added that the Circuit Court erred by rigidly enforcing an evidentiary standard, when court precedent holds there should be greater flexibility in proving discrimination cases.
Jackson noted Ohio “barely contests” the arguments Ames leveled against it. The state argued Ames’ Title VII claims would’ve failed even if they cleared the background circumstances test. But Jackson insisted that sits outside the scope of the case.
“We granted review to consider the validity of the ‘background circumstances’ rule, and we reject that rule for the reasons set forth above,” she wrote. “We leave it to the courts below to address any of Ohio’s remaining arguments on remand.”
Reactions
Following the ruling, both sides of the case portrayed it as a win. For Xiao Wang, a law school professor at the University of Virginia who represented Ames, that argument was straightforward.
“When Congress passed this law, it said, look, don’t discriminate,” Wang said, “don’t consider race, don’t consider religion, don’t consider sex, or some of these other characteristics.”
He argued the decision “reiterates and affirms” that message.
“If someone has a case, they’re subject to the same legal standards, and the same legal treatment as everyone else,” Wang argued.
Meanwhile Ohio Attorney General spokesman Dominic Binkley emphasized the fact that the Supreme Court didn’t decide the underlying discrimination claim.
“We are glad that the court agreed with what Ohio has said all along: ‘It is wrong to hold some litigants to a higher standard because of their protected characteristics.'”
Still, he said, “the court made clear that this case is not over,” referring to the opinion stating Ohio’s remaining arguments could be handled when they’re sent back to a lower court.
“We look forward to fully pressing those arguments as the case moves forward,” he said, “because the Ohio Department of Youth Services did not engage in unlawful discrimination.”
An Ohio Department of Youth Services spokesman declined to comment citing pending litigation.
As the case was considered by the Supreme Court, the NAACP Legal Defense Fund filed an amicus brief in the case, urging the court not to entertain Ames’ arguments. The LDF’s Assistant Counsel Avatara Smith-Carrington, warned the decision doesn’t shift the balance and grant majority groups some new advantage in court.
“Of course everyone is protected by Title VII,” she said in a statement. “However, there is a persisting legacy of discrimination targeting Black people and other historically marginalized groups that cannot be ignored.”
Equality Ohio downplayed the decision’s potential impact. In a statement, the group’s former legal director Maya Simek, cast it as a “technical and narrow correction.”
“What’s most important here is what the Court didn’t do,” she added. “It did not undercut or call into question the landmark Bostock decision, which affirms protections for LGBTQ+ people under federal employment law.”
Equality Ohio Executive Director Dwayne Steward insisted, “This ruling doesn’t roll back rights or erase hard-won protections. What it does is quietly reaffirm that Title VII means what it says: all workers are protected from discrimination.”
Drexel University Law Professor D. Wendy Greene has written extensively on anti-discrimination law and heads up the school’s Center for Law, Policy, and Social Action. She argued the most important factor going forward will be judicial perception.
When a judge believes racism is exceptional rather than commonplace, she said, workers of color often have to meet or exceed the evidence required by the “background circumstances test.” By the same token, if a judge believes “reverse discrimination” is the norm, litigants get greater leeway to make their case.
“These perceptions often shape judicial decision-making and the evidentiary burdens in intentional discrimination cases — with or without an express “background circumstances” evidentiary requirement,” she explained.

(Photo by PeopleImages/Getty Images)A proposal in the Ohio Senate’s budget would give additional funding to high-performing public school districts, ones typically in suburban and often wealthier areas.
Public school districts in Ohio are continuing to rally for more funding, which is why Scott DiMauro with the Ohio Education Association is fighting against the Senate’s newly proposed state budget.
“You have different public schools that are being, essentially, pitted against one another,” DiMauro said.
The senators increased the amount of money going to public schools from the House’s proposal.
The budget draft introduced by the Senate gives public schools about $100 million more than the House version. They follow most of the House’s proposed budget, which only gives schools about $226 million for school funding, but $550 million total. The Senate changed the funding “guarantee” amount. Currently, some districts have guarantees that a portion of their funding will not be reduced, even if their enrollment decreases.
Finance Chair Jerry Cirino (R-Kirtland) explained that this $100 million added back would only go to high-performing or “improving” districts.
“A new component has been added to recognize performance of the districts who have shown great progress or received a four or five-star rating in their last evaluation,” he said.
Schools with higher report card ratings, which are based on state testing, receive a funding boost from the state. Republicans say that this could increase the incentive for schools to do well.
“This was a necessary addition to the funding formula as we move forward and as we expect more and more out of our school districts,” the lawmaker said.
There are 68 schools with a five-star rating, according to data from the Department of Education and Workforce. Fifty-six are suburban, 25 are considered rural, and only one could be classified as a mix of suburban and urban (Steubenville City Schools).
Zooming in on Orange City Schools District, a five-star school, reveals that it has some of the wealthiest areas in Ohio, with median incomes exceeding $200,000 in Pepper Pike, Moreland Hills, and Hunting Valley. Orange also just passed its school levy in May.
All schools are facing financial challenges, DiMauro said, but noted that achieving a four- or five-star rating becomes that much harder when districts continue to be underfunded by the state.
The school districts for the 10 biggest cities in Ohio are all under four stars. Cleveland has three, Columbus has two and Cincinnati has 2.5.
“Rather than taking some money from an already underfunded system and reallocating it to districts that are already doing well and primarily serve higher-income students, why don’t we instead make sure that we are fully funding the formula and directing resources where they’re needed the most,” he said.
The budget will continue to be heard, and a final version will need to be agreed upon by the Senate and House by the end of June.

But an advocate for immigrants in the state said the mistake-riddled list should be cause for alarm.
It named 500 states, cities and counties that were allegedly not doing their duty in helping federal officials enforce immigration law. However, it didn’t say how.
The list included Warren County, northeast of Cincinnati, as a sanctuary county even though voters there went for Trump by a 65-33 margin on Nov. 5. The sheriff, Barry Riley, told WCPO television, “This report is wrong. A mistake has been made and incorrectly listed Warren County. We have reached out to representatives of the Department of Homeland Security to correct the issue.”
Warren County might have made it onto the Homeland Security list because in 2021, Lebanon, the county seat, attempted to ban abortion by declaring itself “a sanctuary for the unborn,” said Lynn Tramonte, founder of the Ohio Immigrant Alliance. She said other jurisdictions were mistakenly placed on the list after declaring themselves sanctuaries for gun owners.
“It’s like they’ve got some intern with an AI program searching for the word ‘sanctuary’ and popping up a list of names of counties and cities,” Tramonte said. “They’re just sloppy.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXAlso drawing laughs is that the list spelled Ohio’s oldest major city “Cincinnatti” and a Kentucky county just over the river “Cambell.” instead of Campbell. Officials in both jurisdictions told WCPO that they weren’t violating any immigration laws.
The errors might be comical, but in context, they’re really terrifying, Tramonte said.
“They took the list down because it was full of errors, and this is the Department of Homeland Security,” she said. “They can’t even get their spelling right. Everybody was making fun of Secretary (Kristi) Noem because she couldn’t keep her purse safe, but this is another example. They can’t publish a list of examples of cities in the United States and spell them correctly? How can we trust them to keep us safe?”
In April, Noem’s purse, containing multiple IDs and thousands in cash, was stolen from a Washington, D.C. restaurant.
Noem has faced further criticism in her new role as head of the agency. 
Habeas corpus is a fundamental right that dates at least back to the Magna Carta of 1215. It says that detained people have a right to appear before a judge and challenge their detention.
In a May congressional hearing, Noem got it exactly backward, saying, habeas corpus is “a constitutional right that the president has to be able to remove people from this country and suspend their rights,” the Associated Press reported.
Tramonte said the Ohio immigrants she talks to are terrified as the Trump administration seeks to squeeze “sanctuary” jurisdictions and deport ever more people — including hundreds of thousands who came legally. She said it’s deeply unfair that they’re trying to throw out people who came under a Biden-era program that allowed people to apply for asylum from outside the country. 
“We told them, ‘We don’t want you showing up at the border seeking asylum,’ even though that’s a perfectly legal process,” she said. “People in Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela said, ‘OK, I’ll find a sponsor in the United States, I’ll request advance permission from the United States government to come. I’ll fill out this form. My sponsor will show you all of their assets. They will promise to take care of me. I will not be a burden on the U.S. taxpayer. I’ll come in an airplane, pay for my own ticket and get a house and a job.”
Those using the program followed the rules and now they’re working and have kids in American schools, Tramonte said.
“And then Trump said, ‘You’ve got to go,'” she added. “If I’m from Haiti, what am I supposed to go back to? There’s no government.”
Tramonte urged people to try to put themselves in immigrants’ shoes.
“None of us did anything to earn the right to be born in the United States,” she said. “It was an accident that we were born here. I just feel like we need to have a bit of compassion for people who were born in countries that are in turmoil.”

(Eric Thomas for Kansas Reflector)If you talked to a college sports fan in Kansas over the past few years, you likely heard their frustrations: the transfer portal, 25-year-old quarterbacks still using COVID eligibility, the possibility of fading Blue Blood dynasties, conference realignment and student athletes getting paid more than their instructors.
This academic year seemed particularly sour and chaotic. 
To help me find context, I sat down with Mit Winter, a former college basketball player who now works as a Kansas-City area lawyer specializing in the legal issues of college sports. Winter has been named by legal groups and sports media outlets as a leading expert, especially in matters surrounding athlete compensation.
He also happens to be my friend, since our sons shared Leawood schools, athletic teams and neighborhood playgrounds. 
Below is a transcript of our conversation, edited for space and clarity.
Where do you feel like we are in terms of the seismic changes that have happened in college sports? Can you give me the 30,000 foot view?
For as long as college athletics had been around, with a few like exceptions and maybe like under-the-table payments, college athletes could not be paid beyond a valuable scholarship. Since July 1, 2021, college athletes have been able to receive the NIL compensation, so payment for the use of their name, image and likeness in connection with some activity. 
But that quickly morphed into payments that are called NIL payments but everyone knows the athletes are being paid to play a sport at a school
What’s supposed to happen in a month on July 1, is the schools are now just going to be directly paying the athletes NIL compensation.
Again, it’s still called NIL compensation, but really, in reality, they’re being paid to play their sport, right? They’re just calling it NIL compensation now because they don’t want them to be considered employees. So that’s really the biggest difference. Athletes are being recruited and enticed to come to a university with the promise of being paid beyond a scholarship.
Do you feel these last four years are coming to the end of a chapter on July 1? Do you feel like this is an interregnum period that’s ending?
Yeah, I would say it’s a transition. It’s another milestone, but it’s not going to be the ending place. But I don’t think that’s where ultimately it will land with schools paying NIL compensation to the athletes. I think eventually, at some point, we should be talking about — the highest level of football and basketball — probably some athletes are going to end up being employees.
What has been the reaction from the legislature in the state of Kansas to this? 
Kansas is unique because it’s one of a few states that has not passed any state law specific to college athlete NIL compensation. When California passed its law, a lot of other states started passing their own laws. Kansas has never passed one. There have been some bills introduced, but they’ve never passed one, which doesn’t mean that college athletes in Kansas cannot receive NIL compensation. 
You don’t need a state law. Kansas has been able to float along and change as things around the nation change, without having to have a (state) law. 
There have been some states where in 2020 or so, they passed a state law. They ended up being more restrictive than what was put in place by the NCAA eventually on July 1, 2021. Then they quickly either amended their law or repealed their state NIL law. So Kansas hasn’t had to deal with any of that, so they just had the flexibility to sit out there and not have any restrictions. 
How do you think we are going to remember these couple years of college athletics when we look back at it? What do you think is going to be the legacy of this moment?
I think people will probably look back at it and it’ll be a time when there’s the ultimate free market in college athletics. For the past four years, boosters have been able to pay athletes as much as they want in NIL compensation to attract them to their school. And right now we’re in this period where they’re trying to bring more regulation to it, and no one really knows how this regulation is going to go. 
I think people will look back at this time, the past four years, as the messy beginning of college athletes being paid for college sports, and there was not very much regulation. You could kind of do whatever you wanted. 
Now we’re moving into the more regulation space, and eventually we’ll get to real stability and more robust regulation.
And you think that robust regulation looks more like an employment model eventually? 
For some athletes, I think that’s where it will end up. In the NBA, NFL and lots of other pro sports, the regulatory structure exists and is not subject to antitrust law challenges because it was collectively bargained between the players associations under US law. 
When rules like that are collectively bargained, it makes an exemption from antitrust law. So that’s why you’re able to have things like salary caps, minimum salaries, maximum salaries, even the draft. All that stuff would otherwise violate antitrust law if it wasn’t collectively bargained between the players and leagues. 
So I think we’ll eventually end up with some sort of structure like that, at least in some college sports.  
I’m sure that you hear fans saying that this fan experience stinks. Do you think this is kind of a low point for the college sports fan experience? Do you predict that it’s gonna get even more messy? 
I think the biggest issue that fans have in college sports now is not necessarily the athletes are being paid. It’s about how easy it is for them to hop around from team to team.
What fans have the biggest issue with is they don’t know who’s going to be on their team from year to year. And as a college sports fan, a lot of people like to know a guy who would come in as a freshman, see him get better as a sophomore, junior, senior and graduate, and have their senior night. You got to know the players. 
Now, I think a lot of fans feel like players are just mercenaries looking at who’s going to pay them the most. They don’t have any loyalty to their school or even much connection to their schools, and the fans don’t feel like they get to know them.
You could have (rules about transferring) with a collective bargaining model. 
Or the other way to do some of this stuff — what the NCAA and conferences are trying to do now — is get Congress to pass a law that gives them an antitrust exemption, (to allow them to) put in rules (about transferring). 
How does the weather look for each of those things?
They’ve been trying to get Congress to pass a law for at least five, six years, and there hasn’t been much progress there. A bill’s never even gotten out of a committee. 
On the collective bargaining side, that’s still a ways off too, because under the current state of law, we have to have employees. And college athletes are not currently employees. And no university has stuck their neck out there to say we’re going to treat our athletes as employees.
In what ways do you feel like this current landscape is flawed or unjust at the moment?
There really needs to be some agent regulation in the college articles world. If you talk about NBA or NFL — to be an agent in those sports, you have to be registered with the players associations. You have to have certain minimum levels of education and pass certification tests, and you’re subjecting yourself to regulation by those players associations. In college athletics that does not exist. ‘
So there are lots of people who are now NIL agents who have zero experience as an agent. That doesn’t mean that necessarily they’re not good at what they do, but there are still some people out in the college sports agent world who don’t necessarily have the best interests of a lot of the athletes at heart. So I think that is potentially, like the biggest issue I see right now and then,
We were used to seeing powerhouse teams that were underwritten by generations of boosters that would hold up a particular college football program or college basketball program for decades. Now it seems easier to swoop in and install like an incredible set of players and all of a sudden they win. Do you think that has a corrosive effect? 
It has brought more parity college athletics, as you just described. There have been the “blue bloods” in college athletics, and they have had this built-in advantage, just because they have the historical success and capital and the boosters that provide financial support. They couldn’t pay players — at least not above board. 
For other schools that maybe didn’t have that historical capital, it was hard for them to compete. Well, now if they want to compete, they can just say, “All right, we’re going to pay you more than this other school even if they’re a blue blood.” 
So I think it creates more parity in terms of teams that have a chance to be competitive. 
I think we’ve seen some instances of schools that are blue bloods that have lost some of that built-in cache. You can say KU basketball the last two years.
Do you think (your children’s) college athletic experience would look distinguishably different from what your college athletic experience looked like?
Definitely a lot different. I think the biggest difference is just the continuity of your teammates. There were definitely a few kids at William and Mary who transferred out or transferred in on my team, but not at the level that you see now. 
I had the same roommate for four years in college with another guy on the basketball team. And lots of other teammates were there with me for four years or three years, if they were a year below me. We’re still friends to this day. 
The biggest difference is continuity. 
And then there definitely are some college athletes who are very focused on, “how much money can I make? Where’s the school that’s gonna pay me the most?” 
Everybody’s circumstances are different, and you can’t say you’re wrong for doing that. For a lot of people, being a college athlete is gonna be their most marketable time as an athlete and their time to monetize that. They are making a lot of money for universities and coaches and commissioners. So I can’t begrudge college athletes for thinking that way. 
So I can imagine a fan of college sports saying that we need to get lawyers and courts out of college sports. It just should be more pure than this. How would you respond to the argument that having courts and lawyers involved is only muddying everything.
I would say I agree with him. That’s why I’m an advocate of a model that has collective bargaining like you see in the pros. That’s the way to bring stability and certainty of the rules to college sports without all these lawsuits continuing to happen. I agree with the fans.
It’s just a question of how we can get there, and right now, a lot of people in college sports are just hoping that Congress helps them and not working on this other solution. So I think everyone’s on the same page with that sentiment — the fan’s sentiment. It’s just, how do we get to that place?

(AP Photo/Seth Wenig, File)Over the past few months, Celina Damian’s phone has been ringing off the hook with one bewildered, anxious question after another: “What kind of loan is this?” “Am I in default?” “Will the government really take my wages?”
“Sometimes they just don’t know where to start,” said Damian, California’s student loan servicing ombudsperson.
“I’m talking to borrowers from all ages, from new borrowers to — I have 80-, 90-year-old borrowers,” she said.
The federal government last month restarted collections on defaulted loans. State student loan ombudspersons such as Damian have become some of the only sources of contact for worried borrowers lost in a tangle of conflicting information at the federal level about their loan status and repayment options.
The U.S. Department of Education began collecting on defaulted student loans in May for the first time since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020.
Federal student loans issued by the U.S. Department of Education come with fixed rates, set repayment plans and borrower protections. Private servicers handle billing, repayment-plan enrollments and defaults.
More than 5 million borrowers are in delinquency, and nearly 10 million — about 25% of the federal student loan portfolio — are at risk of default within months, according to data from the U.S. Department of Education.
States can’t cancel that debt, but they do register and oversee servicers operating in their states, run ombuds offices, tweak tax rules and offer outreach or limited grants — actions aimed at reducing defaults and the economic fallout.
When borrowers default, states will likely feel the economic impact. They might lose tax revenue as homebuying stalls. They could end up paying more for Medicaid and social services if borrowers need to rely on them. And students with loan debt may be reluctant to go into lower-paying public-sector work, leading to staffing shortages at state agencies.
A borrower is considered delinquent after missing a payment to the servicing companies that handle billing, repayment plan enrollments, and defaults.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXDamian’s office, established under California’s Student Borrower Bill of Rights, began as a narrow statutory role but now serves as a hub for outreach, “Student Loan 101” workshops and escalated complaints to federal agencies.
Roughly 16 states plus the District of Columbia have followed suit, creating ombuds offices to guide borrowers through confusing paperwork and misinformation. Damian believes these ombuds offices should be in every state, as borrowers across the country will likely have similar questions and little help at the federal level.
“If you don’t have an ombudsperson or even just a person at the state level who can educate borrowers, that will make a difference,” Damian told Stateline. “These borrowers are trying to pay, but the system is broken. No other financial product works this way.”
Student loans became a key issue during last year’s election race, with President Joe Biden blocked by the U.S. Supreme Court in his effort to offer relief to 40 million Americans. In its waning days, his administration did forgive loans for some 150,000 borrowers under previous programs.
But President Donald Trump opposes most loan forgiveness programs, and in May, the U.S. Education Department issued a “Dear Colleague” letter to higher education institutions, reminding them of their legal obligations to help former students understand repayment responsibilities and access support.














These borrowers are trying to pay, but the system is broken. No other financial product works this way.


– Celina Damian, California student loan servicing ombudsperson






Some conservative economists say that federal loan forgiveness and financial aid hurt all students, offering colleges an incentive to raise tuition or lower their own institutional aid.
Winston Berkman-Breen, the legal director at the Student Borrower Protection Center, a nonprofit aimed at protecting borrowers and improving the repayment system, said that more than 2 million borrowers are stuck in a backlog of unprocessed applications for income-driven repayment (IDR) plans — calculated pay structures meant to keep payments affordable based on a borrower’s income.
Other borrowers have called federal agencies for help only to find that U.S. Education Department staff, including servicer-oversight teams, have been laid off as the Trump administration works toward dismantling the department entirely.
“There was an expectation to repay,” Berkman-Breen said. “But there was also an expectation that people would have access to affordable plans. That promise has broken down.”
States now have three primary tools to address student loan debt, Berkman-Breen said: enforcement actions to protect consumers, such as the 39-state lawsuit against servicer Navient; legal oversight by suing to uphold or challenge federal policy; and direct outreach to help public servants access Public Service Loan Forgiveness and similar programs.
Nineteen states now require registration for companies that service student loans, he said. And more than a dozen states align with federal policy to exempt forgiven loan balances from state income taxes.
 ‘Can’t wait for Washington’

Connecticut state Rep. Eleni Kavros DeGraw, a Democrat, calls student debt “a drag on the economy,” and said states can’t afford to wait for Congress — mired in partisan gridlock over student loan forgiveness — to find common ground.
“[Student debt] is stopping people from buying homes, starting families and fully participating in the economy,” she told Stateline. “That hurts us as a state, as a city, and we can’t wait for Washington to figure it out.”
Last year, Connecticut created a bipartisan reimbursement program that provides up to $20,000 for graduates of local colleges who make payments and complete community service. The state has distributed more than $2 million so far.
Kavros DeGraw hopes the program can serve as a model, and has already talked with lawmakers in other states on possibly developing their own versions of it.
“These were people who were already paying,” Kavros DeGraw said. “It just made sense. I think it’s something that other states could explore this session, and it would provide an immense deal of relief.”
Lawmakers in other states also have considered student loan legislation. This year, New Jersey introduced bills to register education lenders and cap interest rates. Lawmakers in New Mexico, New York and North Carolina have proposed Borrower Bill of Rights legislation. Arizona has a registration bill for private servicers. None of these measures has advanced far.
According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, more than 20 states have enacted laws expanding loan forgiveness, repayment programs and servicer oversight in recent years.
Several states are also investing directly in workforce-aligned loan forgiveness: Georgia expanded its service-cancelable loan program to cover dental students working in rural areas. Idaho created a loan repayment incentive for rural nurses. Kentucky now offers $5,000 stipends to attract new teachers. Maryland authorized Anne Arundel County to launch a local forgiveness program for public school educators.
 Repayment

Student loan stress is not evenly distributed. Seven states, all with Republican‐controlled legislatures, report delinquency rates above 30% among borrowers required to make payments.
Mississippi leads the nation with a conditional delinquency rate of nearly 45% — meaning borrowers who should be making payments are late. That’s just ahead of Alabama, West Virginia, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana, all of which have rates above 31%, according to recent data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
By contrast, Illinois, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Vermont and New Hampshire maintain delinquency rates below 15%.
Experts say this chasm reflects deeper systemic differences, such as lower median incomes in higher delinquency states, along with weaker consumer protections and a higher share of students attending for-profit institutions or leaving college without a degree.
States also have promoted the federal Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, established in 2007, that offers help to public service professionals. New Mexico has an outreach campaign that includes prospective teachers and health care workers. Maine has provided guidance to public defenders on how they can take advantage of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program and touts a related state tax credit on a marketing site to lure new residents.
“States can regulate and enforce, but they can’t fix the structural problems in how repayment is administered,” said Michele Zampini, senior director of college affordability at The Institute for College Access & Success, a research organization that advocates for students. “They’re helping around the edges, but the core system is still broken.”
A November report from the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau found at least 3.9 million borrowers received misleading or inaccurate bills from servicing companies.
“The repayment system is not in a good place to provide the services and repayment options borrowers are legally entitled to,” Zampini said.
The Student Loan Borrower Survey, conducted between October 2023 and January 2024, found that 61% of borrowers who received debt relief made a beneficial life change earlier than they otherwise could have. Yet borrower awareness remains dangerously low: Nearly 42% of federal borrowers have only been on the standard repayment plan, and 31% of those didn’t know other options, such as an income-based plan, existed.
In California, a major part of Damian’s job in the past few months has been to help borrowers access existing forgiveness programs.
Meanwhile, new federal policy proposals could reshape repayment entirely. The Trump-backed One Big Beautiful Bill Act would consolidate existing IDR plans into a single tiered structure, with lower-income borrowers paying flat monthly rates and higher earners contributing 8% of their income. The bill also proposes extending standard repayment terms to 30 years — raising concerns it could delay forgiveness and inflate total interest costs.
The bill passed the U.S. House and is pending in the Senate.
 ‘Incentive to hike prices’

Andrew Gillen, a Cato Institute research fellow who recently testified before Congress, argues that any meaningful fix must address the incentives driving rising tuition — namely, federal aid being tied directly to college sticker prices.
“The link between rising tuition and increasing aid is what drives the Bennett Hypothesis, where federal student aid, in the form of loans, can lead to higher tuition costs at colleges and universities,” Gillen said in an interview. “If we instead use the median cost of attendance to calculate aid eligibility, we remove colleges’ incentive to hike prices just to capture more aid.”
Even without agreement on blanket forgiveness, experts agree on smaller bipartisan steps: streamlined repayment, stronger servicer oversight and targeted help for borrowers with the greatest need.
“We don’t want people defaulting. We don’t want payments that are too high for people just out of school. That should be the bipartisan starting point,” Zampini said.

Although the term didn’t come into common usage until the 21st century, DEI is best understood as the latest stage in a long American project. Its egalitarian principles are seen in America’s founding documents, and its roots lie in landmark 20th-century efforts such as the 1964 Civil Rights Act and affirmative action policies, as well as movements for racial justice, gender equity, disability rights, veterans and immigrants.
These movements sought to expand who gets to participate in economic, educational and civic life. DEI programs, in many ways, are their legacy.
Critics argue that DEI is antidemocratic, that it fosters ideological conformity and that it leads to discriminatory initiatives, which they say disadvantage white people and undermine meritocracy. Those defending DEI argue just the opposite: that it encourages critical thinking and promotes democracy − and that attacks on DEI amount to a retreat from long-standing civil rights law.
Yet missing from much of the debate is a crucial question: What are the tangible costs and benefits of DEI? Who benefits, who doesn’t, and what are the broader effects on society and the economy?
As a sociologist, I believe any productive conversation about DEI should be rooted in evidence, not ideology. So let’s look at the research.


	Who gains from DEI?    
In the corporate world, DEI initiatives are intended to promote diversity, and research consistently shows that diversity is good for business. Companies with more diverse teams tend to perform better across several key metrics, including revenue, profitability and worker satisfaction.
Businesses with diverse workforces also have an edge in innovation, recruitment and competitiveness, research shows. The general trend holds for many types of diversity, including age, race and ethnicity, and gender.
A focus on diversity can also offer profit opportunities for businesses seeking new markets. Two-thirds of American consumers consider diversity when making their shopping choices, a 2021 survey found. So-called “inclusive consumers” tend to be female, younger and more ethnically and racially diverse. Ignoring their values can be costly: When Target backed away from its DEI efforts, the resulting backlash contributed to a sales decline.
But DEI goes beyond corporate policy. At its core, it’s about expanding access to opportunities for groups historically excluded from full participation in American life. From this broader perspective, many 20th-century reforms can be seen as part of the DEI arc.
Consider higher education. Many elite U.S. universities refused to admit women until well into the 1960s and 1970s. Columbia, the last Ivy League university to go co-ed, started admitting women in 1982. Since the advent of affirmative action, women haven’t just closed the gender gap in higher education – they outpace men in college completion across all racial groups. DEI policies have particularly benefited women, especially white women, by expanding workforce access.
Similarly, the push to desegregate American universities was followed by an explosion in the number of Black college students – a number that has increased by 125% since the 1970s, twice the national rate. With college gates open to more people than ever, overall enrollment at U.S. colleges has quadrupled since 1965. While there are many reasons for this, expanding opportunity no doubt plays a role. And a better-educated population has had significant implications for productivity and economic growth.
The 1965 Immigration Act also exemplifies DEI’s impact. It abolished racial and national quotas, enabling the immigration of more diverse populations, including from Asia, Africa, southern and eastern Europe and Latin America. Many of these immigrants were highly educated, and their presence has boosted U.S. productivity and innovation.
Ultimately, the U.S. economy is more profitable and productive as a result of immigrants.


	What does DEI cost?    
While DEI generates returns for many businesses and institutions, it does come with costs. In 2020, corporate America spent an estimated US$7.5 billion on DEI programs. And in 2023, the federal government spent more than $100 million on DEI, including $38.7 million by the Department of Health and Human Services and another $86.5 million by the Department of Defense.
The government will no doubt be spending less on DEI in 2025. One of President Donald Trump’s first acts in his second term was to sign an executive order banning DEI practices in federal agencies – one of several anti-DEI executive orders currently facing legal challenges. More than 30 states have also introduced or enacted bills to limit or entirely restrict DEI in recent years. Central to many of these policies is the belief that diversity lowers standards, replacing meritocracy with mediocrity.
But a large body of research disputes this claim. For example, a 2023 McKinsey & Company report found that companies with higher levels of gender and ethnic diversity will likely financially outperform those with the least diversity by at least 39%. Similarly, concerns that DEI in science and technology education leads to lowering standards aren’t backed up by scholarship. Instead, scholars are increasingly pointing out that disparities in performance are linked to built-in biases in courses themselves.
That said, legal concerns about DEI are rising. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and Department of Justice have recently warned employers that some DEI programs may violate Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Anecdotal evidence suggests that reverse discrimination claims, particularly from white men, are increasing, and legal experts expect the Supreme Court to lower the burden of proof needed by complainants for such cases.
The issue remains legally unsettled. But while the cases work their way through the courts, women and people of color will continue to shoulder much of the unpaid volunteer work that powers corporate DEI initiatives. This pattern raises important equity concerns within DEI itself.


	What lies ahead for DEI?    
People’s fears of DEI are partly rooted in demographic anxiety. Since the U.S. Census Bureau projected in 2008 that non-Hispanic white people would become a minority in the U.S by the year 2042, nationwide news coverage has amplified white fears of displacement.
Research indicates many white men experience this change as a crisis of identity and masculinity, particularly amid economic shifts such as the decline of blue-collar work. This perception aligns with research showing that white Americans are more likely to believe DEI policies disadvantage white men than white women.
At the same time, in spite of DEI initiatives, women and people of color are most likely to be underemployed and living in poverty regardless of how much education they attain. The gender wage gap remains stark: In 2023, women working full time earned a median weekly salary of $1,005 compared with $1,202 for men − just 83.6% of what men earned. Over a 40-year career, that adds up to hundreds of thousands of dollars in lost earnings. For Black and Latina women, the disparities are even worse, with one source estimating lifetime losses at $976,800 and $1.2 million, respectively.
Racism, too, carries an economic toll. A 2020 analysis from Citi found that systemic racism has cost the U.S. economy $16 trillion since 2000. The same analysis found that addressing these disparities could have boosted Black wages by $2.7 trillion, added up to $113 billion in lifetime earnings through higher college enrollment, and generated $13 trillion in business revenue, creating 6.1 million jobs annually.
In a moment of backlash and uncertainty, I believe DEI remains a vital if imperfect tool in the American experiment of inclusion. Rather than abandon it, the challenge now, from my perspective, is how to refine it: grounding efforts not in slogans or fear, but in fairness and evidence.

(Courtesy of NPPD)In February 2021, thousands of Nebraskans found themselves in the dark of rolling blackouts. A brutal polar vortex froze wind turbines, strained natural gas supplies and exposed serious weaknesses in our energy grid. However, even as multiple power sources failed, one remained steadfast — nuclear energy.
That moment was a wake-up call. We can no longer afford to treat energy policy as a matter of convenience or short-term cost. To avoid future blackouts and maintain affordable, resilient, firm and reliable power, Nebraska needs nuclear energy. Wind and solar are intermittent. Natural gas is a vital bridge fuel, but it is vulnerable to supply shocks in extreme weather. This is about building a reliable and resilient energy source that can deliver for Nebraska families, farmers and businesses when it counts.
Nuclear energy, which currently generates 17% of Nebraska’s power, brings unique strengths. It provides carbon-free baseload power that runs around the clock regardless of whether the wind is blowing or the sun is shining. During the 2021 deep freeze, Nebraska’s lone nuclear plant kept running at full strength while other sources faltered. The United Nations 2021 report, “Life Cycle Assessment of Electricity Generation Options,” shows that nuclear has the lowest overall impacts on human health and the environment by any measure and from any perspective.
The cost of new nuclear energy is within a penny per kilowatt-hour of other forms of new energy sources, including natural gas, wind and solar. Is that one cent too much to have a resilient, reliable power source for Nebraska?
We’ve seen what happens when nuclear gets overlooked. Omaha Public Power District’s Fort Calhoun plant and Nebraska Public Power District’s Cooper Nuclear Station accounted for about a quarter of Nebraska’s net generation capabilities before Fort Calhoun was shut down in 2016. The shut down was nearly two decades ahead of schedule, a casualty of market conditions that failed to account for long-term reliability and energy needs. Hundreds of skilled jobs were lost. Our energy safety net shrank.
And just a few years later, that decision looked shortsighted as the grid buckled under pressure. To avoid repeating that mistake, policymakers should ensure that energy markets properly value reliability and resilience.
As 26 House Republicans made clear in a late April letter to congressional leadership, protecting the federal nuclear production tax credit (PTC) is one way to do so. It has proven a huge help in incentivizing the development of nuclear power at a time when NPPD is exploring options. For Nebraska, the credit helps create and protect hundreds of high-paying, skilled jobs, generating local tax revenue and sustaining a stable source of affordable power.
Another step Congress could take is expanding investment incentives for next-generation technologies like small modular reactors (SMRs). These compact, scalable reactors can serve Nebraska’s rural areas and industrial parks where large traditional plants aren’t practical, offering flexibility and grid stability. Policies like the Advanced Nuclear Production Credit and bipartisan permitting reform proposals can help accelerate local deployment.
U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., has advocated for nuclear’s role in America’s energy future on the Senate Environment and Public Works Subcommittee, where it helps Nebraska to have a voice in ensuring that our state’s long-term energy interests remain protected.
Nebraska’s energy future isn’t just about keeping the lights on. It’s about protecting lives during extreme weather, powering our farms and factories and anchoring high-skilled jobs in our communities. If we want to avoid another round of blackouts, we should encourage policies that keep every reliable tool in the toolbox — including nuclear.

A federal judge heard arguments this week on a Georgia law aimed at restricting social media use for minors and requiring Georgians to confirm their age before viewing adult websites.
Judge Amy Totenberg of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia announced at the Tuesday hearing that she will determine soon whether to hear more evidence regarding a lawsuit by a group called NetChoice to stop the law. NetChoice represents various internet-based services, including powerful businesses like Google and Meta, as well as smaller companies like online journal site Dreamwidth Studios. On the same day, a Florida judge blocked sections of a similar Florida law.
Children under the age of 16 would need parental consent to open social media accounts under the new Georgia law, which is set to go into effect July 1.
NetChoice filed a lawsuit in May seeking to prevent that from happening. The companies claim the rules violate young people’s First Amendment rights, as well as place unnecessary burdens on social media companies. Attorneys also argued the revised rules strip away some of the flexibility of parents monitoring what online sites their children are accessing.
Jeremy Maltz, an attorney representing NetChoice in the lawsuit, argued at Tuesday’s court hearing that many people using online websites affected by the Georgia law would consider it an invasion of privacy if they had to use sensitive information to create an account.
The plaintiffs argue that adults could face a burden if companies require them to potentially give companies driver licenses, banking or credit card information or use facial recognition software in order to access user-generated online sites.
Data breaches and other cyber security threats could be increased by the new age guidelines, Maltz said.
“We know people are going to have to provide some sort of information to access protected speech,” he said.
And despite the law exempting educational, public safety, and professional networking platforms, Martz said it would also create new verification hurdles even for innocuous sites such as college football and recipe message boards.
“This bill targets minors at the places where minors go to engage in free speech,” Maltz said.
Republican state lawmakers push for Georgia law to require proof of adulthood to view adult websites

Georgia lawmakers passed SB 351 in 2024 with bipartisan support. Logan Winkles, a state deputy attorney general, said that social media is designed to drive engagement and promote addiction, and the intent of legislators in passing the law was to protect children from adult bad actors online.
“Everyone agrees that social media poses some risk to children,” Winkles said.
NetChoice successfully overturned similar laws in Arkansas and Ohio after arguing they unfairly censored free speech on online platforms.
What’s my age again?
The bill requires social media companies to make commercially reasonable efforts to verify the age of their users, which can be done through methods including banking and credit card accounts, facial and fingerprint recognition software scanning.
The Age Verification Providers Association, which supports third-party age verification businesses, reports that about a dozen states have passed laws restricting or requiring parents to consent to minors accessing social media. In several states, including Arkansas, California and Ohio, court orders have been issued to block the provisions of the law.
As of May, the age verification group listed Georgia among the 24 states that have passed laws requiring age verification to access online pornography.
Opponents say such laws could create privacy concerns and prevent people from accessing constitutionally protected speech.
Winkles said at Tuesday’s hearing that legislators and Gov. Brian Kemp backed the law to protect more kids and teens from social media sites that lead to higher rates of bullying and mental health problems such as depression and that technology can estimate a person’s age without revealing their identity.
“What we know is there are many other ways to verify ID other than showing government ID,” Winkles said.
But Totenberg questioned the verification processes.
“It doesn’t seem very precise,” Totenberg said. “It’s a highly subjective standard and I’m not sure what it ultimately means.”
The law allows parents and guardians to file complaints with the attorney general office if they believe a company isn’t complying with age verification. Violations of the law may result in a fine of up to $2,500 per violation.
Pending U.S. Supreme Court age restriction ruling
On Tuesday, federal Judge Mark Walker of the northern district of Florida blocked sections of Florida’s law banning children under 14 from having social media accounts and requiring parents’ approval for teens as old as 16 while expressing concerns about social media’s adverse effects on children.
Georgia attorneys contend that the state’s new social media rules stand up to legal scrutiny and differ from states like Florida, which limited companies’ ability to control user-posted content. Right wing officials from several states have expressed concerns about social media companies blocking conservative viewpoints.
John Acevedo, an Emory University constitutional law professor, pointed out that when it’s pornography, there has been a legal history showing a legitimate interest in protecting children.
“Really, it’s not controversial to put an age requirement in, but the controversy is the manner in which the age requirement is implemented,” he said Wednesday. “Conversely, in social media there’s a controversy over whether we should even limit social media at all to any age group.”

Casper residents showed up in force to oppose a mining operation that they say could cause economic and recreational harm.
The post State board rejects renewal of contested gravel leases at base of Casper Mountain appeared first on WyoFile .","CHEYENNE —Prism Logistics suffered another blow Thursday to the company’s gravel mining plans near the base of Casper Mountain when the State Board of Land Commissioners voted not to renew six of the company’s leases in the area.
The denial comes after the Natrona County Commission voted two days earlier to advance a policy limiting heavy truck traffic on certain county roads, including Coates Road, the only way to access the lands Prism Logistics had leased.
Prism Logistics CEO Kyle True argued that county road blocks to the gravel operation violate the Wyoming Constitution. Besides battling to keep its leases, True and Prism are seeking a declaratory judgement in a lawsuit the company filed against Natrona County for using zoning regulations to halt its operations on state land. Natrona County Commissioner Dave North defended his elected board’s actions at Thursday’s meeting in Cheyenne.
The community’s reaction to the mining proposal, including the Casper Mountain Preservation Alliance’s petition to block the pit, shows there are just some pieces of land that are important enough to people to merit protection, North said.

“I’m not saying that we need to know every lease that goes on, on every piece of state property, but there are some that are more critical to us and that is a prime example of that,” North said. “The number of people we have that utilize this for recreational purposes — there’s a lot of them.”
North made his case to the Wyoming Board of Land Commissioners, which includes Gov. Mark Gordon, Superintendent of Public Instruction Megan Degenfelder, Secretary of State Chuck Gray, Treasurer Curt Meier and Auditor Kristi Racines. The board unanimously approved the leases in 2023 on a consent agenda without discussion, commissioners admitted in public meetings in 2024.
Racines made the motion to reject Prism’s request to renew six of the eight leases on the basis that Prism did not move forward in adequate time with licensing and permits from the Department of Environmental Quality and Office of State Lands and Investments. Gray and Degenfelder voted in favor of that motion.
Gordon, having already counted the votes necessary to deny the renewal, did not vote. The one dissenting voice, Meier, argued that the approximately 20,000 or so signatures on the petition to block the gravel operation were still a minority voice impeding what could be a great economic opportunity for the county and state.
“You figure maybe 20% or 25% of the people of Natrona County are making the decision, not only for Natrona County, but for the state,” Meier said. “Every time this board goes up against one, we know there’s two more coming. Converse County is going to pull the same stuff on wind. Niobrara County is going to pull the same stuff on wind.”
Turning away from these opportunities is going to keep poor communities poor, take away funding opportunities for public instruction and, all the while, pit neighbor against neighbor, Meier said.
“We have to think about Wyoming. We have to think that we have a culture here,” Meier said. “If we ignore who we are, we are destined to do the wrong thing again and again and again. I’d like to do the right thing together, but that’s not going to happen today.”

While red tape ultimately amounted to the final nail in the coffin for True’s hopes regarding his leases, Casper residents, mostly representatives of the Casper Mountain Preservation Alliance, flooded the public comment period of the meeting with a laundry list of other environmental, cultural and health-related concerns.
Some opponents of the gravel pit, such as nearby landowner and former Casper City Engineer Jason Knopp, argued that any repair or mitigation work Prism may do after the fact to provide Coates Road residents with fresh water would be ineffective. For example, Knopp’s ranch relies on a trench to direct water flow to his ranching operation that would be cut off by the gravel pit.
“There’s absolutely not a way you could actually mine this to not change the contours or the flow of that water that go from point A to point B,” Knopp said. “It’s not really actually possible.”
Gray also raised questions over the company’s violation of a regulation stipulating that an industrial disturbance should be 300 feet from any water. True said that violation was remediated and shouldn’t be considered in the decision to renew the leases.

“It’s our position that there was no live water. We went out there and there were dry creek beds,” True said. “We were not within 300 feet, when we dug those test holes, of a stream. We went back after those allegations had been made, and we looked and conditions had changed and there was live water.”
An Office of State Lands and Investments field inspection found Prism dug one of its 18 exploratory,13-foot-deep holes within 167 feet of the flowing stream.
“OSLI considers activities that are contrary to a standard stipulation the Board hasconditioned a lease upon to be a default of the lease terms,” a board document stated.
However, when Prism was served a 30-day notice to remedy the violation or have its lease revoked, it appeared to have already done so.
Later during public comment, Coates Road area resident Paulette Bray said she drives over the creek twice a day for work and it is perennially full.
“The water flows all the time. It doesn’t matter if it’s winter or summer or spring, it is always flowing,” Bray said.
North added that violations now don’t bode well for compliance with regulations in the future.
“If you violate your exploration permit right off the bat — which is the most simple — then you’ve got other problems,” North said.
Another concern was the loss of recreational opportunities in the area. Maria Katherman, a biology and botany instructor at Casper College, praised the Coates Road area for its unique biology and utility as a giant hands-on teaching tool within a short drive of campus.
“I’ve had so many students come up to me in the grocery store or in town or whatever and they say, ‘You know, I still go back to those state sections,’ or they say, ‘I decided to be a biology major, and it wasn’t because of your lectures. It was from those times in the state sections out there,'” Katherman said.
Additional concerns, including how the churning up of soil would encourage noxious weed growth; how higher-altitude industrial activity would impact Casper Mountain views and how outdoor tourism might be dampened all contributed to a clear message from Casper that a gravel pit at that specific location is not welcome. There were no public comments in favor of the operation.
When the idea was raised to pursue a recreational land use lease on the state parcels, Treasurer Meir compared many of the residents’ concerns to ‘not in my backyard talk.’

Now that leases for six of the eight parcels have not been renewed, Casper residents have the opportunity to find another use for the area. Auditor Racines implored members of the Casper Mountain Preservation Alliance to make their own proposal to the state before another interested party jumps at the chance.
“A gravel mine will not be the last thing proposed on this set of state lands,” Racines said.
Casper residents haven’t necessarily won anything and can’t call it a day, Rancines said, making a dusting-of-the-hands motion.
“I do think that the community of Casper, at least some of the folks in this room,  some of you very much understand state lands, have probably learned a lot through this process,” Rancines said. So residents should be aware, “anything could end up there.”
Because only six of the eight leases originally granted to Prism Logistics were approved in June 2023 — with the remaining two granted in October 2023 — there are still some areas near Coates Road that Prism has not yet lost.
Parties on both sides of the Casper gravel fight are awaiting rulings in two separate cases. Even if the judge comes back with a decision affirming the Natrona County commissioners’ actions, True has indicated he will likely appeal the decision to the Wyoming Supreme Court.

Yet here we are,","Connecticut environmentalists raised their reusable water bottles for a toast when Public Act 19-117 was passed six years ago, phasing out single-use plastic bags at checkouts.
The law was structured in two phases: a mandatory 10-cent charge on plastic bags from the summer of 2019 to 2021, and then an outright ban. The CT League of Conservation Voters called the passage “a bloody battle,” hard-won against opposition from retailers, the plastic lobby, and conservative lawmakers characterizing the ten cent charge as a tax.
In spite of the noise, the bill was ratified and became enshrined in the Connecticut General Statutes § 22a-246a(c): “On and after July 1, 2021, no owner or operator of a store shall provide or sell a single-use checkout bag to a customer.”
Here we are, nearly four years later, and I’m still offered a plastic bag nearly every time I visit an establishment that serves food.
So, what happened? 
For starters, the Governor’s Office suspended the bag fee between March and June of 2020 as a measure to protect retail workers from handling reusable bags during COVID-19. When the ban itself rolled around, the focus was on grocery store chains – and to their credit, it seems to have stuck with them. Although the law does not require reporting once the ban is in place, similar bans in New Jersey, Vermont, Philadelphia, Pa.; Portland, Ore.; and Santa Barbara, Calif., are estimated to save an average of 296 bags per person per year. Cumulative pressure from all the jurisdictions that have adopted bag bans across the country have surely influenced these large chains to comply.
The problem comes in with the smaller retailers, who don’t have strategists and compliance officers at their national headquarters planning for the ban. What I’ve experienced over the past years is that many have reverted back to using plastic bags – delis, bodegas, takeout establishments, etc. Of note, the law is clear in its definition of “store” that it applies to any retailer, regardless of size, that sells physical goods in Connecticut.
But to whom does it fall to enforce this law? During the two year phase-out that required store owners to charge a fee for plastic bags, retailers were required to report to the CT Department of Revenue Services (DRS). In that case, DRS was clearly the agency tasked with enforcement. They created a reporting form, published guidance, and even put up a Q&A on their website. But now that there is no longer money changing hands, DRS appears to be out of the equation. 
The Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP) or perhaps the Department of Consumer Protection (DCP) would be likely candidates to oversee this law — DEEP especially, given that the statute falls within the chapter on Environmental Protection. Yet both departments’ webpages remain silent on the issue.
The reason I bring this up instead of leaving well enough alone is the same reason so many environmental advocates fought for this ban in the first place. Plastic bags are a cancer so ubiquitous, we’ve forgotten how dangerous they are. So let’s talk about it. Here are three reasons we need to do something about single use plastic bags… again.
1) Public Health: When plastic products break down, they leave behind microplastics in our air, water, and food. The majority of humans and many, many animals – even those in remote environs – have microplastics in their system. These insidious particles are very poorly understood in terms of their impact on our health, but studies have found correlations to subfertility, organ damage, and cancer.
2) Wildlife: (*Note: the webpage linked in the next sentence contains disturbing imagery.) The well-documented harm that plastic pollution causes wildlife – from ingestion to entanglement – is exacerbated by rampant consumption of single-use bags. Moreover, because plastic is made from crude oil, enormous swaths of habitat become collateral damage, forcing animals into dangerous roadways or stressing them to the point of population decline. The Bureau of Land Management reports that over 12 million acres of public land are currently used for oil and gas drilling, in part to keep up with our addiction to plastic.
3) The waste crisis: Over 40% of waste produced in Connecticut is shipped out of state, because we have run out of room to bury or burn our trash. This capacity shortage has led to higher tipping fees (price per ton to get rid of waste), hauling costs, and greenhouse gas emissions. Connecticut desperately needs to cut its waste generation, either through source reduction (make less trash in the first place) or diversion (send it to be used for something other than burying or burning). It can be difficult to see the financial impact of these rising costs given that they are buried in our property taxes, but the truth is that the average fee to dispose of one ton of trash went from around $60 in 2010 to around $110 in 2024.
And here’s the microplastic in the wound – bag bans across the United States have been hugely effective in reducing waste, just like we promised. A 2024 research report found that “In the last 20 years, 12 states covering more than one-quarter of the U.S. population have prioritized reducing plastic waste by banning plastic bags.” The report states that in jurisdictions with bans, billions of plastic bags have been prevented from entering circulation (see pg. 17), plastic bag litter on beaches has gone down 33% – 50% (pg. 10), and one city even saw a 48% reduction of plastic bags in its residential waste stream (pg. 10). These stats have direct relationships to lower municipal costs and better environmental outcomes, as explained above.
I wish I had a clearer call to action to resolve this. Even if the Office of Legislative Research or one of the legal eagles at the state could clarify which agency is responsible for enforcement, I can already hear the canned response we would get: “Due to a lack of staff and resources, limited capacity is available to devote to enforcement.” 
And even if the law was perfectly enforced, the language itself contains loopholes – a single-use plastic bag is defined as having a thickness of 4 mil or less, which might explain why the small mom & pop grocery store down the street from me switched to sturdier single use plastic bags and continues to give them out for free.
For now, the best we can do is support the establishments that respect the ban, bring reusable bags everywhere we go, and contact state leadership about the lack of enforcement. Because this ban matters – for our wallets, for wildlife, and for the wellbeing of Connecticut.

We’re here. We’re fighting for you. And we’re not going anywhere.","When I first ran for office, I was one of only two openly gay members of the Connecticut General Assembly. Today, I’m proud to serve as co-chair of a growing LGBTQ+ Caucus, one that’s not only increasing in number but in impact.
That growth matters. Because while we gather this June to mark Pride Month, we do so at a time when LGBTQ+ rights, especially the rights of trans people, are under coordinated attack across the country. Under the current federal administration, we’ve seen efforts to erase LGBTQ+ history from classrooms, target trans youth in healthcare and sports, and target our identities to distract from real issues.

State Rep. Raghib Allie-Brennan
Connecticut has chosen a different path. We’re showing what it looks like when a state leads with dignity and action, not division.
This year, we passed bipartisan legislation that prohibits discrimination against LGBTQ+ residents in long-term care facilities, ensuring our elders can live openly and receive the care they deserve without hiding who they are. No one should be forced back into the closet just to access basic services.
We also protected funding for the LGBTQ+ Justice and Opportunity Network, which provides grants to LGBTQ+ nonprofit, healthcare, and advocacy organizations across the state. The network collaborates with local affinity groups and advocates to inform the legislature on the evolving needs of our community. I’m especially proud of this program, because it was the first bill I introduced and took to the House floor back in 2019.

But we didn’t stop there. In a year when states are criminalizing gender-affirming care and restricting access to abortion, we passed legislation to shield providers in Connecticut who offer this care. This sends a clear message: if you’re under attack in your home state, Connecticut will stand with you.
And while other states are banning books and threatening librarians, we’re doing the opposite. We advanced legislation to protect public libraries, librarians, and the freedom to access information without intimidation or censorship. We did this because defending free expression and the right to learn is foundational to a healthy democracy and to a truly inclusive society.
For me, Pride is deeply personal. I spent 18 years in the closet, raised by an immigrant father and an Irish Catholic mother. That combination came with its own set of challenges, but today, after many difficult conversations and a lot of growth, they’re two of my biggest supporters. I’m grateful for that, and I know not everyone is so fortunate.
And even within our own community, we don’t always get it right. I’m a gay man, I don’t know what it’s like to be trans or nonbinary, and sometimes I get it wrong. We all do. But we’ve got to give each other the space and grace to keep learning, and to keep showing up.
That’s true for allies, too. Allyship isn’t seasonal. It doesn’t stop at a pin, a post, or a parade. It’s about using your voice when it matters, especially when it’s uncomfortable. It’s about backing up your values with real action, not just words.
To every LGBTQ+ person across Connecticut and beyond, especially those feeling exhausted, afraid, or unseen right now, I want you to know: you’re not alone. We’re here. We’re fighting for you. And we’re not going anywhere.
We’ve come too far, and the stakes are too high, to go quiet now.

(Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — The “Downing Brothers” — Chicago firefighter twins known for their HGTV show on real estate investment — were in Omaha for a brief appearance and committed to an encore visit they hope will electrify local efforts aimed at boosting affordable housing.
In town to speak Thursday at a conference, Anthony and Anton Downing toured a few housing sites and visited with nonprofit leaders working in the industry.

During the event luncheon, they also clicked with Omaha’s Mayor-elect John Ewing Jr., a fellow first responder and affordable housing advocate who helped persuade them to return. 
Beckoned to the stage by Ewing, the twins in a sort of spontaneous moment agreed to come back and work with the Omaha Municipal Land Bank on a still-to-be-determined project.
“It’s important to shine a big light on government and nonprofit organizations whose work is in affordable housing,” Anthony said later, in explaining the decision.
“We’re connectors,” said Anton, who hopes the future project can arouse funding and other opportunities, including perhaps an Omaha role in one of their shows.
Omaha’s alliance with the Downing Brothers represented the kind of networking and relationship-building that conference organizers hoped for during the two-day Reignite2Unite development symposium, which aimed to provide emerging developers and others with tools and resources to turn vacant properties into community assets.
 Assurance from HUD head

Hosting the event that drew more than 250 people to the Marriott at the Capitol District was Omaha Municipal Land Bank, Spark CDI and Front Porch Investments. 
Workshops featured other national and local experts who shared tips on such topics as access to capital, innovative policies and construction that promote integrated and affordable housing, land banks and community land trusts.
Joe Mitchell, newly appointed administrator for the Great Plains four-state region of U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, which includes Nebraska, also spoke and assured the group that the Omaha HUD office was not slated for closure. He said he’d like to see developers have more access to funding and capital.
Big demand for affordable housing calls for big approach in suburban Nebraska

During the luncheon, Ewing — who moves into the mayor’s office Monday, after defeating three-term Mayor Jean Stothert in May — told the crowd he is a longtime supporter of affordable housing efforts, having served on boards such as Habitat for Humanity Omaha. The former Douglas County treasurer said homeownership is a priority issue he often talked about on the campaign trail and wants to promote as mayor. 
Ewing recalled the pride he, his siblings and parents felt when he was 15 years old and the family bought their first home. The initials carved into the cement by the Ewing kids remain nearly 50 years later at the house where his parents still live.
“That was one of the most motivating, inspiring things that happened in my life,” said Ewing, adding that homeownership offers hope.
The new mayor said he wants Omahans to have the opportunity to own homes.
“Not only does it inspire our young people, it allows families to build generational wealth,” he said.
He referred to something former Omaha City Councilwoman Brenda Council, who was in the audience, once told him: “To a young person without hope, consequences mean absolutely nothing.”
 Not a one and done situation

The Downings said they are unsure of the project they’ll help tackle in Omaha but said they are committed to a return. 
“This is not a one and done situation,” Anthony said.
The twin brothers, age 43, star on “Backyard Bar Wars,” on truTV. Raised on the south side of Chicago by a Bahamian mother and an African-American father, they headed to the Bahamas after their Omaha stay, where they are working on a housing project.

The brothers said they still fight fires in Chicago, and began real estate ventures after witnessing the need for community development while on that job. 
Through their “Homecoming with the Downing Brothers” podcast, TV and a comic-style super heroes book about real estate, they said they stir conversations about real estate investment that didn’t previously exist in many Black households.
During their talk at the conference, the Downings recommended that communities launch programs early, teaching young teens about investing and financial literacy. 
Leslie Smith, executive director of the Omaha Municipal Land Bank, said organizers chose the duo as keynote speakers because of their motivation and advice.
“They speak of a call for action — to galvanize resources available to us — and they do it from a practical lens,” Smith said.
 Award winners 

Several developers were recognized Thursday with awards:
Outstanding Emerging Developer: Ernesto and Penny Marquez of the Marquez Co., for their Pinkney Street Duplex rental project financed with a Spark Capital rehab loan. 
Community Impact Award: Omaha Economic Development Corp., for The Larimore at 3483 Larimore Ave. The 45-unit repurposed commercial building, aided by sources including public tax-increment financing and low-income housing tax credits, is for seniors that make 30% to 60% of the area’s median income.
Public-Private Partnership Award: Canopy South, Omaha Housing Authority and City of Omaha, for the first phase (92 units, mixed-income residential) of the Southside Terrace-Indian Hill Choice Neighborhoods Transformation Plan.
Community Advocate Award: Jeff Spiehs, an urban planner and real estate developer focused on community engagement. His involvement includes being a faculty member of Spark’s Developer Academy and ChangeMaker programs.

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)It’s suddenly a very crowded race in the Democratic primary for Colorado’s most competitive congressional seat.
One day after Colorado State Treasurer Dave Young announced his bid, former teachers union president Amie Baca-Oehlert became the latest Democratic hopeful in the 8th Congressional District, a key battleground in the nationwide battle for control of the House of Representatives.
Baca-Oehlert, who served as president of the Colorado Education Association from 2018 to 2024, launched her campaign in front of a crowd of about 50 supporters Thursday evening at Adams City High School, where she got her first teaching job.

“When I look at Congress, I don’t see people like me,” Baca-Oehlert said. “I don’t see enough teachers, Latinos, moms, union members or middle class Americans. What I do see is a broken system, a system that caters to the wealthy and well-connected, where plenty of politicians are looking out for themselves and their billionaire donors.”
Drawn by an independent redistricting commission in 2021, the 8th District includes parts of Denver’s northern suburbs as well as more rural areas in southern Weld County. Four in 10 residents of the district are Latino.
The seat is currently held by U.S. Rep. Gabe Evans, a Fort Lupton Republican who unseated former Democratic Rep. Yadira Caraveo by a margin of fewer than 2,500 votes in the 2024 election. Despite representing one of the nation’s most evenly divided congressional districts, Evans has remained a steadfast supporter of President Donald Trump’s historically extreme anti-immigration agenda, his chaotic efforts to launch a global trade war and a sweeping GOP budget bill that would cut $625 billion from Medicaid.
“Nearly all of us are hurting right now, because of the fear, division and economic turmoil that Trump has created,” Baca-Oehlert said. “And Evans is literally standing by — standing beside his friends like Lauren Boebert, to promote this disastrous agenda, and not fight against it.”
Boebert, a staunch Trump supporter, is the Republican representative of Colorado’s 4th Congressional District.
Caraveo has launched a bid to win back her seat in 2026, joining a Democratic primary that also includes Young, state Reps. Manny Rutinel of Commerce City and Shannon Bird of Westminster.
Baca-Oehlert’s campaign launch featured endorsements from Adams County Commissioner Emma Pinter and former state Reps. Judy Solano and Joe Salazar.
“I know all the candidates that are running, I know all of them,” Solano told the crowd. “But Amy’s the one.”

(Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)The New Hampshire Senate approved a roughly $15.9 billion two-year state budget Thursday.
The Senate passed House Bill 1 — the budget — and House Bill 2 — accompanying legislation that adjusts policy necessary to implement the budget — on votes of 15-9 and 14-10, respectively. Leading up to the second vote, Democrats proposed a series of amendments to remove or curtail Republican priorities, such as the voucher-like education freedom account program, and provide funding for their priorities, such as the renewable energy fund. All the amendments were voted down by the Republican majority.
The Senate’s budget vote comes two months after the House passed its version of the budget. In April, the Republican-controlled House approved a roughly $15.5 billion budget. The Senate’s budget marks a more optimistic outlook and cuts state services less harshly, though it is a far cry from the larger budget Gov. Kelly Ayotte requested.
The House, pessimistic about how much revenue the state would receive from business tax revenues, made heavy reductions to state services. That includes entirely eliminating the Office of the Child Advocate, the Housing Appeals Board, the Commission for Human Rights, and the State Commission on Aging. In their budget, the Senate, which was slightly more bullish about tax revenues, restored those agencies, but reduced them to save money. For example, the House had laid off the entirety of the Office of Child Advocate’s staff of nine; the Senate restored the office, but eliminated four positions.
The Senate also rolled back the House’s layoffs in the Department of Corrections from 190 positions to 60 civilian positions, many of which are currently vacant. It also set aside more money to a settlement fund created in response to a massive abuse scandal at the state-run Youth Development Center, in which courts are compelling them to pay settlements to victims. The Senate also reversed a 3% cut to Medicaid reimbursement rates made by the House. However, there were some places where the Senate cut more deeply than the House, such as special education in public schools and $32 million of general “back of the budget” cuts that gives Ayotte’s administration the flexibility to decide where to cut.
The House and Senate are now set to enter a process called committees of conference, in which they’ll hash out the differences between their two budget proposals. They’ll have two weeks to merge their budget proposals into one before their deadline to send a budget to Ayotte’s desk. Ayotte, the state’s Republican governor, will then have the choice of whether to sign, veto, or allow the budget to pass without her signature.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/SenateDebatingBudget-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-05 22:03:51.274349

Joseph Roemmich, most recently the warden of the Cibola County Correctional Center in Milan, New Mexico, will begin his service in South Dakota June 24.
“Joseph has extensive experience working in the corrections field in a variety of correctional and detention settings,” Secretary of Corrections Kellie Wasko said in a press release. “His work in all areas of security operations as a warden, assistant warden, chief of security, investigator, and officer will be valuable as he helps our corrections staff develop and incorporate modern correctional practices.”
Tumultuous period at penitentiary culminates in warden’s departure

Roemmich has been warden of the Milan facility for a little over a year. The jail is operated by CoreCivic, the for-profit company formerly known as Corrections Corporation of America. The company website says Roemmich joined the CoreCivic after several years serving in law enforcement in California.
The site says the company is “the nation’s largest owner of partnership correctional, detention and residential reentry facilities, and one of the largest prison operators in the United States.”
Milan is a village in western New Mexico with a population of about 2,500 people, located about 80 miles west of Albuquerque. The CoreCivic website says the Milan jail’s main customers are the U.S. Marshals Service, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Cibola County.
South Dakota DOC’s press release on Roemmich’s hiring says that in addition to his correctional service, he has 11 years of law enforcement experience.
“I look forward to working with penitentiary staff to help positively affect the safety and security of the staff, our offenders, and the people of South Dakota,” Roemmich said in the release.
DOC Director of Prison Operations Amber Pirraglia had been serving as interim warden of the penitentiary since the departure of Teresa Bittinger. 
Bittinger resigned near the end of a troubled year for the facility in Sioux Falls. March 2024 saw two rounds of unrest at the penitentiary, which followed the temporary shutdown of tablet-based communications between inmates and their families for an investigation the corrections department has never fully explained. Former Gov. Kristi Noem, now head of ICE for the Trump administration, said at the time that inmates had been using their tablets for “nefarious purposes.”
Private employers say they were pushed out of state prisons

Just before her departure, Bittinger oversaw a lockdown that lasted more than a month and saw prison officials tear down multiple sweat lodges on the prison grounds, a move that drew scrutiny from Oglala Sioux Tribal President Frank Star Comes Out.
Bittinger’s tenure also coincided with the controversial loss of Metal Craft Industries, a private company that spent more than 20 years employing maximum security inmates at a metal fabrication shop inside the penitentiary’s Jameson Annex. The company’s owners say they were forced out in spite of serving to better the lives of inmates by paying market wages – one of its former inmate employees paid off his restitution and had enough in the bank to put a down payment on a home upon his release – and by serving customers across the region. 
When asked about the situation by lawmakers in multiple hearings last year, DOC Secretary Wasko said the company had taken advantage of cheap inmate labor and accused Metal Craft of covering up contraband. 
Department of Corrections pledges to rebuild sweat lodges dismantled during prison lockdown

Bittinger, who resigned one day after a closed-door meeting with lawmakers, was the third penitentiary warden in fewer than three years. Former DOC administrator Doug Clark served as interim warden in 2021 before the state hired Dan Sullivan, who served less than two years before being replaced by Bittinger, who began as an interim warden and took the permanent position in April 2023.
The leaders began to rotate through after a Noem-initiated shakeup in 2021 led to the ouster of several long-serving prison administrators, including then-warden Darin Young.
Bittinger had served as warden of the entire penitentiary complex. Upon her departure, Sec. Wasko told the public she intended to hire separate wardens for the penitentiary and the Jamison Annex. The DOC has yet to name a Jameson warden. 
A prison construction workgroup voted in April to replace the penitentiary, which was built in 1881, but not the Jameson Annex, a separate building erected in the 1990s.
The group voted this week in Pierre to ditch the original site for that replacement, in rural Lincoln County near Harrisburg, to cap construction costs for a replacement prison at $600 million, and to study the feasibility of sites near Worthing, Mitchell, and on land near Sioux Falls already owned by the DOC.

Jason Knight, a Barrington Democrat, defends his bill to ban assault-style weapons during debate on the House floor on June 5, 2025. (Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)The Rhode Island House of Representatives on Thursday approved much-anticipated legislation banning the sale and manufacturing of a range of semiautomatic weapons in Rhode Island starting in July 2026.
The 43-28 vote came after nearly five hours of debate and nine failed attempts by House Republicans to change the bill sponsored by Rep. Jason Knight, a Barrington Democrat. All 10 Republicans voted against the bill, along with 17 Democrats and the chamber’s lone independent. 
“We have an obligation to protect the community we live in,” Knight said on the House floor. “Mass shootings are a real problem — it could happen here and we have a chance to minimize the chances.”



Who voted ‘no’
Twenty-three state representatives voted against the assault-style weapons ban bill.
Opponents included all 10 chamber Republicans: House Minority Leader Mike Chippendale, Richard Fascia, Marie Hopkins, George Nardone, Brian Newberry, Christopher Paplauskas, David Place, Robert Quattrocchi, Sherry Roberts and Paul Santucci
Another 17 Democrats also opposed the ban: Samuel Azzinaro, Jacquelyn Baginski, David Bennett, Stephen Casey, Gregory Costantino, Megan Cotter, Deborah Fellela, Brian Kennedy, Charlene Lima, Thomas Noret, William O’Brien, Ramon Perez, Robert Phillips, Earl Read, Patricia Serpa, and Joseph Solomon. Also opposed was Rep. Jon Brien, the only independent.



In introducing Knight’s legislation to the floor, House Judiciary Chairman Robert Craven, a North Kingstown Democrat, said the legislation is justified if just one life is saved by banning assault-style weapons.
“One of the things I learned as a prosecutor many years ago was there’s no undoing someone being dead,” Craven said. “There’s no retreat from that — dead is dead.”
But opponents argued the bill’s language is too broad and would not reduce gun violence. Many said it would criminalize responsible gun owners.
“This piece of legislation’s true goal, as evidenced by its language, is clouded at best and disingenuous at worst,” said Rep. Arthur Corvese, a North Providence Democrat. 
The legislation, which was already revised before advancing out of committee earlier this week, would prohibit the sale and manufacturing of assault-style shotguns, handguns, and rifles beginning July 1, 2026. Weapons are defined as any semiautomatic firearm that has the ability to accept a detachable magazine and has at least one attachment such as stocks, pistol grips, and barrel shrouds. Certain .22 caliber rimfire rifles and Olympic-style target pistols would still be allowed.
Assault-style firearms purchased before July 2026 would also be exempt from the legislation, along with weapons passed down through family.
Violators of the proposed ban would face up to 10 years in prison, a fine of up to $10,000 and forfeiting their assault-style weapons.
Gun owners could voluntarily register their weapons with police to receive a certificate of possession — a provision that has drawn the ire of opponents.
“If you are found to be in possession of one of these firearms and do not have this voluntary certificate you are handcuffed, you are printed, you are booked, you are arraigned, you go to pre-trial, you go to a trial,” said House Minority Leader Mike Chippendale, a Foster Republican. “After maybe two years you can provide proof you owned the firearm before July 1, 2026.”
Chippendale also argued that the bill’s language is unclear on where gun owners could use their grandfathered weapons, saying that it would bar hunting. Rep. Joseph McNamara, a Warwick Democrat, said weapons subject to the proposed ban are not meant for hunting.
“If you need an AK-47 to hunt ducks, maybe you should take up bowling,” he said.
House Republicans introduced nine floor amendments to address their issues with Knight’s bill, but each were rejected.
Democratic Reps. Mia Ackerman of Cumberland, John Edwards of Tiverton, Raymond Hull of Providence, and Alex Marszalkowski of Cumberland were not present for the vote. Rep. Kathleen Fogarty, a South Kingstown Democrat, voted by proxy in favor of the bill.
The policy now rests with the Senate for consideration. 
Companion legislation introduced by Sen. Lou DiPalma, a Middletown Democrat, has 23 additional sponsors, including Senate President Valarie Lawson. DiPalma’s bill was heard by the Senate Committee on Judiciary on May 14, where it remains under review.
Three Democrats who serve on the committee voiced opposition to the proposal during the initial hearing on DiPalma’s bill. Senate Majority Leader Frank Ciccone, a Providence Democrat and federal firearms dealer, has also said he does not support  banning assault-style weapons as drafted. 
Knight’s changes have not swayed his stance, Ciccone said in an interview Thursday.
Lawson remains committed to seeing the proposal hit the Senate floor, chamber spokesperson Greg Paré said in an email.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s annual energy conference included visits from three of the Trump administration’s top officials, but it didn’t include any major developments on the financing of the proposed 800-mile trans-Alaska natural gas pipeline.
U.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright, and Lee Zeldin, administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, traveled to the North Slope and to Anchorage this week during a visit that coincided with the fourth annual Alaska Sustainable Energy Conference.
Despite the conference’s name, oil and gas development took top billing, with all three officials saying that they hope to increase oil and gas production in Alaska under the direction of President Donald Trump.
“President Trump wants to see the flows through (the trans-Alaska Pipeline System) doubled,” Wright said during a speech on the North Slope this week. “The oil is here. The discoveries are here. If we free Alaska and the people here (from regulation), we’re going to more than double the oil flow through the pipeline and build the big, beautiful twin, the natural gas pipeline, from the North Slope.”
Despite the week’s enthusiasm for the Alaska Liquefied Natural Gas pipeline, better known as AKLNG, it still isn’t clear who will pay for it to get built.
The natural gas pipeline and associated processing plants are expected to cost $38.7 billion, but that estimate was published in 2020, and it predates inflation-driven and tariff-driven cost increases under the Biden and Trump presidencies.
Energy developer Glenfarne, which is pursuing AKLNG on behalf of the state, announced this week that 50 firms had formally expressed interest in AKLNG contracts worth more than $115 billion. 
Those contracts include possible supply agreements — people interested in selling things to AKLNG for construction — as well as possible investors.
An expression of interest isn’t a firm commitment, and no investors said this week that they will back the project. Officials from Japan, Korea and other nations — possible customers for Alaska gas — visited the state this week but made no announcements.
Taiwan’s state-run energy company, CPC, signed a non-binding agreement in March stating that it would buy liquefied natural gas from Alaska and invest in the project.
As currently envisioned, AKLNG would be constructed in two phases — the first would be a pipeline from the North Slope to Fairbanks and Southcentral Alaska for domestic, in-Alaska gas customers.
The second phase would involve facilities and equipment needed to export gas overseas.
Glenfarne is expected to announce a go/no-go final investment decision on the first phase by the end of the year.
Speaking to NBC reporters in Prudhoe Bay, Burgum said that the U.S. military could be a key customer for the first phase of the project.
“They’re ready to sign on to take an offtake agreement from this pipeline to get gas to our super strategic, important bases across Alaska,” he said on CNBC.
Actually signing a customer agreement could make financing easier to come by.
“If you get the commercial offtakers for the gas, financing is pretty straightforward,” Wright told CNBC. 
Legislation passed by Congress and signed by President Joe Biden allows $30 billion in federally guaranteed loans for the project.
This week, Wright told reporters in Anchorage that the U.S. Energy Department could make additional loans available.
“They’re going to get details of the project to come together, but I think it’s quite likely that you will see loan guarantees provided by the loan program office at the Department of Energy to build the pipeline part of that project,” he said.
Under the Biden administration, the DOE’s Loan Programs Office grew into a major financier for green-energy projects. The Trump Administration has halted most of that work, and Wright suggested that it could be redirected to the natural gas pipeline.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)A bipartisan group of lawmakers released on Thursday the final draft of their plan to cut $270 million over the next two years from programs that serve the elderly and disabled.
The two-year, approximately $17 billion compromise human services budget will cut future spending on nursing homes and home care programs, though it will raise pay for nursing home and home care workers. The bill largely avoids pushing costs on to county governments, which was a core piece of the House plan.
The Department of Human Services currently accounts for around one-third of the state budget, and spending is expected to rapidly grow in the coming years as the population ages and the cost of providing care increases. The majority of the agency’s budget goes toward Medical Assistance, Minnesota’s Medicaid program. 
Agreeing on a DHS budget was one of the biggest hurdles lawmakers needed to clear before they reconvene for a special session to pass the remaining budget bills.
Legislative leaders and Gov. Tim Walz are aiming to hold a special session on Saturday, but there’s been no official announcement, and they’ve missed self-imposed deadlines before. If they don’t finish the budget by the end of June, large parts of state government will shut down. Some state workers have already received furlough notices.
Throughout the legislative process, leaders agreed to target DHS for cuts, though both chambers passed very different plans. The DFL-backed Senate budget focused on reducing payments to nursing homes; the House version pushed costs onto counties while cutting spending on programs that provide care to people with disabilities.
The compromise budget bill makes the following cuts over the next two years: 

$186 million by capping inflation adjustments for long-term care waivers, which pay for in-home care for people with disabilities, at the federal urban inflation rate (CPI-U) or 4%.
$51 million from changes to “rate exceptions,” higher-than-usual payments for the care of people with extraordinary needs. The bill would create new limits on what is covered by the rate exception, and introduce new paperwork requirements. 
Around $46 million by putting tighter limits on what Medical Assistance covers for day and unit based services, which help people with disabilities maintain life skills and participate in a community and activities. It also would cut pay for caretakers when they are sleeping on an overnight supervision shift.
$41 million from nursing homes by making a series of changes to how patients are classified, removing an incentive to create more single-bed rooms and capping some inflation adjustments. 

It also generates more than $56 million in savings by increasing yearly fees paid to the state by nursing homes, and also increasing a reimbursement rate that corresponds to the fees, which pushes some costs onto the federal government.
The budget spends money on raises for nursing home and other care workers ($88 million) and on setting up a new licensing and oversight system for autism service providers ($11 million), some of which are under investigation by the FBI on suspicion of fraud.
The bill does not include a House proposal that would have shifted more than $150 million in costs to counties to pay for rate exceptions.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NN250507_0817-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-06-05 20:05:00.559029

The company plans to pay the $150,000 fine by June 20.Clark is not the first attorney general to go after the company. Last summer, Rhode Island Attorney General Peter F. Neronha filed a complaint against UPP Global LLC — Unified Parking Partners’ parent company — accusing it of “a pattern of unfair and deceptive conduct including charging customers fees disguised as a ‘tax,’ charging junk ‘service fees,’ failing to disclose parking rates until customers have already parked, and issuing ‘citations’ that mimic government-issued parking tickets and falsely threaten consequences from the Division of Motor Vehicles.”United Parking Partners has faced criticism from Vermonters for years. In 2017, Seven Days wrote a column about the company’s potentially deceptive ticketing practices.When reached for comment, United Parking Partners spokesperson Bev Drivin said, “UPP is committed to complying with all applicable local laws and regulations.

(Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)LEAVENWORTH — A Kansas district court barred CoreCivic Wednesday from reopening its shuttered prison until the company goes through Leavenworth’s development process to receive a special use permit.
Judge John Bryant, Leavenworth County District Court, was unconvinced by arguments from CoreCivic attorneys that the company was grandfathered into the city’s zoning codes and did not need a special use permit to hold U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainees.
He ruled in favor of the city of Leavenworth, which had asked for a temporary restraining order to stop the reopening of CoreCivic’s prison, the Midwest Regional Reception Center.
After nearly two hours of arguments in front of a courtroom packed with Leavenworth city officials and community activists, Bryant made an immediate ruling. He said his decision was not affected by CoreCivic’s history in the community, which has been openly criticized by former employees, inmates and residents, and in submitted court documents.
The request for a restraining order was a procedural issue, he said.
“The posture of this case is a little bit different in that the city has acted here because CoreCivic has stated its intent to ignore or not give any effect to the March ‘25 administrative decision,” Bryant said, referring to the city’s requirement that CoreCivic get a special use permit before reopening.
Bryant said that if CoreCivic disagreed, company attorneys could have gone through the Kansas judicial review process to argue zoning decisions. Such a move needed to be made within 30 days, he said, and CoreCivic did not take that action.
 What’s next?

“We are reviewing the court’s decision and considering next steps,” said CoreCivic spokesman Steve Owen in response to emailed questions. “We maintain the position that our facility, which we’ve operated for almost 30 years, does not require a special use permit to care for detainees in partnership with ICE. We look forward to presenting our arguments to the court.”
He did not answer questions about whether the company is housing any ICE detainees in Leavenworth or what is happening at the facility, which had a parking lot full of cars on Wednesday.
Leavenworth city manager Scott Peterson was pleased with the court’s decision. Although CoreCivic could continue litigation on the issue, he said the company was welcome to go through the city’s planning and zoning process to get a special use permit.
Joseph Hatley, attorney for Leavenworth, said the next step today would be writing the temporary restraining order and then circulating it to all parties.
“If we have a disagreement about it, the judge can resolve the disagreement, but essentially it will say they cannot house detainees without a special use permit,” he said.
 Three months

The typical special use permit process in Leavenworth takes about three months, Peterson said, in part to allow time to set up public hearings to allow Leavenworth area residents to have input.
In its motion to the court asking for the temporary restraining order, the city’s attorneys laid out significant issues they had when CoreCivic previously operated a prison in Leavenworth. The national private prison company operated the Leavenworth Detention Center from 1986 to 2021, when CoreCivic’s federal contract was not renewed.
The city opened its petition with quotes from a 2021 court transcript. U.S. District Court Judge Julie Robinson called CoreCivic’s Leavenworth prison a “hell hole.”
“All that’s going on there and causing trauma to everybody – guards are being traumatized. Guards have been almost killed. Detainees are being traumatized with assaults and batteries, and not long ago a detainee was killed. So I’m well aware of the situation at CoreCivic and very troubled by it as well,” Robinson said at the time.

In the petition, the city also noted the Leavenworth Police Department had issues with CoreCivic in the final years before the prison closed, citing roadblocks when investigating violent crimes within the facility, lack of planning for major crises such as riots or hostage situations and difficulty getting access.
The city’s special use permitting process would allow the city to set guidelines that would address those situations, Peterson said.
“Cities generally have broad abilities to impose additional requirements on a special use permit, so long as they are applicable to the use that we’re discussing,” he said. “Obviously, property owners are protected in some regards in that we can’t make outlandish requirements.”
If CoreCivic would disagree with city requirements, Peterson added, they could then access the judicial review process to argue those points.
CoreCivic had initially applied for a special use permit in March but withdrew that application. Peterson said the process had begun and CoreCivic and city officials were meeting.
“I would note that with internal conversations the city was having with CoreCivic, we were in agreement with the things the city was going to propose in terms of protecting the city services moving forward,” he said.
In the hearing, CoreCivic attorney Taylor Hausmann said the company withdrew from those proceedings because the city did not schedule a hearing within a 60-day period, as required.
“It became clear to CoreCivic that there was not a cooperative relationship happening there, and thus CoreCivic fell back on its position that it was not required to have it (the special use permit), and that this was not going to work, to move together cooperatively,” she said.
City officials are adamant that the city is not stalling the prison’s reopening.
“From the perspective of the city, this was never about stopping something from happening,” said David Waters, an attorney for the city. “This is about following the city’s rules and regulations and going through those processes, giving everybody the same fair hearing that we afford all special use permits.”
 Community concerns

Esmie Tseng, spokeswoman for the American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas, attended the hearing. She was pleased the judge heard the city’s concerns but is worried about what will happen in the future.
“I think that’s the core of the case,” she said. “There is a lot of distrust. And CoreCivic definitely hammered very hard on past conduct should not be an indicator of future conduct, but I don’t think we have to rely on past conduct.
We have cases across the country of CoreCivic’s current conduct that sort of speak to concerns about local distress, about their business practices, about shortcuts,” Tseng said.

(Photo credit: Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)Louisiana lawmakers are trying to change the state constitution to wrestle power away from the Civil Service Commission to eliminate state worker protections and allow for the quick firing of thousands of employees for any reason, creating fear among critics that some dismissals could be politically motivated.  
Senate Bill 8, sponsored by Sen. Jay Morris. R-West Monroe, is nearing final passage in the Louisiana Legislature, though voters will get the final say on a constitutional amendment on a ballot that could have significant consequences for how state government operates.
Morris’ proposal would give state lawmakers power that currently rests with the Civil Service Commission, a seven-member independent review panel that oversees the hiring and firing of 28,000 “classified” state workers. The commission hears complaints from classified employees and appeals from any who want to contest their dismissal or demotion, affording them due process when it comes to discipline and terminations. 
In an interview Tuesday, Morris said his bill would let lawmakers “unclassify” state employees, removing them from the oversight of the commission. An unclassified employee does not have Civil Service protections and can be fired “at will” for no reason. The bill’s current version would also apply to local civil service workers such as municipal police and firefighters, but Morris said he intends to change his measure to exclude them and restrict it to only state employees. 
“If you believe in democracy or republicanism — [because] we’re a republic — then the Legislature should have some ability to alter how our civil service system works,” Morris said. “Right now we can’t do anything because the constitution prevents it.”
Some Democrats have taken issue with the latest iteration of the ballot language in Morris’ bill because it doesn’t explicitly mention classified employees and could mislead voters into thinking the amendment doesn’t affect those state workers who are currently protected under Civil Service. When asked about the proposal following Tuesday’s meeting of the House Committee on Civil Law and Procedure, Rep. Wilford Carter, D-Lake Charles, said the ballot language doesn’t align with what’s in the bill.   
The ballot language states: “Do you support an amendment to allow the legislature to remove or add officers, positions, and employees to the unclassified civil service?”
Critics have pointed to other issues that have not been addressed or debated in any of the committee hearings on Morris’ proposal.
One of those is the vague use of the word “remove,” which could be interpreted to mean “fire” or “terminate,” said Peter Robins-Brown, who opposes the bill on behalf of Louisiana Progress, which advocates for low and middle-income people. He said lawmakers have not drafted any kind of companion measure that would establish statutes or regulations to implement the specific necessary changes.
“No one has really been paying attention to the details,” Robins-Brown said. “I’m not sure how the average voter will be able to figure it out, especially when the bill doesn’t have a statutory companion to prove the goal of this exercise.” 
Gov. Landry fails to remove civil service protections from 900 state jobs

Rep. Nicholas Muscarello, R-Hammond, who chairs the House Committee on Civil Law and Procedure, said the intent of the amendment is to give lawmakers the power to unclassify state employees, not fire employees. Hiring and terminating decisions would be left up to the executive branch, he said.
The Civil Service Commission, a nonpartisan entity, has taken a neutral position on Morris’ proposal. When asked about it Wednesday, commission administrators said they assume “remove” means the act of changing an employee’s classification status, but they pointed out the word is not actually defined in the bill.
State Civil Service Director Byron Decoteau said Morris’ civil service amendment amendment, if adopted, could technically allow lawmakers to simply “remove” an unclassified job position with no intention of classifying it, leaving a current employee in a limbo with neither a classified nor unclassified status.
Sherri Gregoire, Civil Service general counsel, said the lack of a clear definition invites different interpretations, including that the amendment gives lawmakers the power to remove governor’s staff members, and creates a situation that would certainly end up in court. 
The more likely course of events, if voters decide to approve the amendment, would be that the legislature designates all future hires as unclassified employees — a move that would eventually end the classified civil service system altogether, Gregoire said. The Civil Service Commission, itself, would still exist under the constitution but would effectively become pointless because it would no longer have anything to oversee.
“Eventually you won’t have any classified employees, so why do you need a commission?” Gregoire said.
Morris said he doesn’t yet have a vision for how lawmakers would exercise their new power if voters approve the amendment.   
Republican Gov. Jeff Landry has tried repeatedly to exert authority over the commission. In February, he tried unsuccessfully to revoke civil service classifications from 900 state jobs, mostly positions for engineers, shortly after President Donald Trump made a similar move at the federal level. The state Civil Service Commission rejected Landry’s request in a 4-2 decision in February. 
Because unclassified workers can be subject to political punishment and coercion, removing such a large number of engineers from the classified service could create ethical conflicts and unnecessary risks to the public, the commissioners said.
A similar version of Morris’ bill stalled on the House floor last year, but some Republicans who likely would have supported the bill were absent when the final vote took place. 
Morris’ bill is expected to earn final passage before the regular session ends June 12 and will be placed before voters on the Nov. 3, 2026, statewide election ballot.

(Screenshot from City of Boulder livestream)The man accused of attacking a group of demonstrators with incendiary devices on Boulder’s Pearl Street Mall returned to court on Thursday, where prosecutors charged him with 118 criminal counts that could add up to a prison sentence of hundreds of years.
The suspect, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, appeared for a brief administrative hearing at the Boulder County Jail. A preliminary hearing in his state case was set for July 15.
Three victims in the attack remained hospitalized as of Thursday, Boulder officials said, while other victims met with law enforcement at the Boulder County Justice Center. Authorities have identified a total of 15 victims in the attack, some of whom experienced an attempted assault and did not sustain injuries.

Boulder County District Attorney Michael Dougherty said in a news conference following the hearing that the charges against the defendant include 14 counts of attempted murder with intent, and 14 counts of attempted murder with extreme indifference. Other charges include attempted assault, the use of an incendiary device and the attempted use of an incendiary device, as well as an animal cruelty charge for a dog that sustained injuries during the attack.
“The charges reflect the evidence that we have regarding this horrific attack that took place, and the seriousness of it,” Dougherty said.
The suspect allegedly told police that he targeted a demonstration on Boulder’s Pearl Street Mall held by Run For Their Lives, which organizes events calling for the immediate release of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, because he wanted to “kill all Zionist people.”
He also faces a federal hate crime charge, and is set to make his first appearance in federal court on Friday. Additional federal charges are expected to follow.
Federal authorities say the suspect, a Colorado Springs resident, was living in the U.S. unlawfully after overstaying a visa that expired in 2023. A federal judge in Denver has temporarily blocked the deportation of his wife, Hayam El Gamal, and their five children, after the Department of Homeland Security announced that it had taken them into custody and was “processing (them) for removal proceedings from the U.S.”
Dougherty said that he was “absolutely committed” to fully prosecuting the defendant in the U.S.
“Obviously, making sure he remains in the country is a top priority, so that he can be fully prosecuted and held fully responsible,” Dougherty said. “And I know the U.S. Attorney’s Office, the Federal Bureau investigation and the Boulder Police Department — not to speak for them, but I think we’re all equally committed to that goal.”
Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn said during Thursday’s press conference to expect enhanced security and a “very visible law enforcement presence” at Sunday’s Boulder Jewish Festival, which was planned long in advance of the attack and will take place on the same block of the Pearl Street Mall where it occurred.
“We are bringing in SWAT elements, we will have drones, we will have a lot of people there,” Redfearn said. “We want people to feel safe, we want people to feel at ease, and right now the best way we can do that is ensure that we have a large number of officers there to be ready to respond to anything.”

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)Members of North Dakota law enforcement updated the public on new alerts that will go into effect Aug. 1 to help locate members of Native communities and other adults who are reported missing.
During the seventh annual Government-to-Government conference in Bismarck on Thursday, a member of the state Highway Patrol outlined how the feather and missing, endangered alerts will be added to the already established Amber, Silver and Blue Alert systems.
North Dakota Highway Patrol Lt. Jenna Clawson Huibregtse, special programs coordinator for safety and education for the department, said Feather Alerts will specifically be used for missing members of the indigenous community.
“The phone blast, as we call it, or when we wake you up at 3 a.m. on your cellphone, we try not to, but when someone’s life is in danger, we’re going to do it,” Clawson Huibregtse said. “That piece will only be used in abduction cases.”
She added website, social media, electronic billboards and media releases will be used in Feather Alert cases not involving abduction or threats of bodily harm.
“To get that word out, that’s the most important piece is galvanizing the public to help us find somebody,” she said. Once alerts are issued to the public, the person is usually found within a couple of hours, she said.
North Dakota tribes push for more autonomy amid federal cuts

Phil Packineau, public safety administrator for the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation, said MHA has an emergency response agreement with state law enforcement to assist tribal law enforcement, if the need ever arises.
“We’ve identified numerous resources that we can bring to bear when there is somebody missing and that includes Highway Patrol,” Packineau said. He added Highway Patrol has been able to deploy its airplane with infrared capability within 45 minutes of being notified of a missing person.
He said of the 86 missing persons reports from tribal lands in North Dakota this year, 83 of those individuals have been found so far.
Packineau praised the tribal relationship with local and state law enforcement despite some tense times, like during the protests that erupted in 2016 and 2017 over the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline north of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in rural Morton County.
“Even after DAPL, and everything that kind of soured a little bit in the Standing Rock area, when we’ve had missing persons, we’ve called Morton County and they said they could gather six to seven deputies and send them down. It’s really that kind of a close relationship,” Packineau  said.
Clawson Huibregtse said a Missing, Endangered Persons Alert will also be added to the state’s system Aug. 1 that will focus on abducted individuals between 18 to 65 years old.
“Right now in the alert system from 18 years old to 65, if you are abducted or your life is in serious danger of bodily harm or death, there is not an alert type that serves you right now,” she said.
Clawson Huibregtse cited examples of Savanna LaFontaine-Greywind, Dru Sjodin and Sherry Arnold who went missing over the last 25 years, but law enforcement did not have a direct alert message system to notify the public of their disappearances.
“So, it will now. The missing, endangered persons alert will do that,” she said.

She said the Amber Alert is used to notify the public when a child 17 years old or younger is abducted. Clawson Huibregtse added that about 90% of amber alerts in the state are issued to locate missing Native children. 
“That’s not just Native American kids that are on tribal lands, that’s across the state from Bismarck, Fargo, et cetera,” she said. “I always want to relay that statistic because it is kind of a staggering statistic because that is a really high representation in the amber alerts program.”
Silver Alerts, she said, are not just for missing people aged 65 and older, but also people with functional and mental impairment or developmental disabilities. 
Blue Alerts are issued to notify the public of a suspect search for a person who attempts, or succeeds, to injure, harm or kill a law enforcement officer, including federal and tribal officers.
House Bill 1535, sponsored by Rep. Jayme Davis, D-Rolette, created the new alerts and passed both legislative chambers with overwhelming support, 74-17 in the House and 45-1 in the Senate. The bill was signed into law by Gov. Kelly Armstrong on May 2. 
Rep. Christina Wolff, R-Minot, pushed back against the Feather Alert bill during debate on the House floor, saying too many alerts reduces their effectiveness. 
“This is a feel good bill that does not guarantee to help the situation, but will absolutely dilute the effectiveness of our current alert systems,” Wolff said on May 1.

DemasUnderfunded public schools continue to be a political football in the Michigan Legislature, but a new coalition announced Thursday has a potential solution: taxing wealthy Michiganders and using the money to pay for schools.
The coalition, Invest in MI Kids, is seeking to place a proposal on the November 2026 ballot that would change the Michigan Constitution’s flat tax rate of 4.25% for individuals earning more than $500,000 and couples earning more than $1 million, increasing that to a surcharge of 5% on their income in state taxes.
Invest in MI Kids noted in a news release that currently, average Michiganders – including the state’s own teachers – and billionaires pay the same rate.
The state’s schools are estimated to be underfunded at $4 billion to $5 billion annually, the coalition said. The ballot measure, which needs 600,000 signatures to be placed on the statewide ballot in the next election cycle, would direct new revenue to Michigan’s School Aid Fund and allow funding for things like career and technical education, attracting and retaining teachers, and reducing class sizes. That would have a positive impact on underfunded and underserved communities, the coalition added, with the revenue estimated to generate $1.7 billion annually for public K-12 schools.
Rachelle Crow-Hercher is director of the Michigan Education Justice Coalition and part of the Invest in MI Kids ballot committee. In an interview with Michigan Advance, she said that most people agree that Michigan’s education system needs to be fixed, but the main question she hears is whether that’s a funding or a policy fix.
“I think it’s a ‘both/and’ situation,” Crow-Hercher said. “We’re addressing the funding situation with this ballot initiative, but the other part of what we’re doing is we’re strapping our shoes on and going out to meet folks where they are and get their ideas for what they think we should change at the state level to make our schools better for all our kids.”
The coalition described the ballot initiative as an admittedly bold plan, one that could shore up existing “tax the rich” sentiments but could face headwinds from anti-tax and ultra-wealthy residents.
Crow-Hercher said the momentum behind making those ultra-wealthy individuals pay their fair share in taxes to fund things like education is strong enough to get the initiative over the finish line, but she also believes that Michganders realize that the Legislature has failed continually to address adequate funding for schools.
“Between those two things, my sense is Michiganders across the state, rural and urban, are sort of ready for this type of bold plan,” she said.
Molly Sweeney, organizing director of 482 Forward, said in a statement that Michigan’s flat tax system was designed to benefit wealthy residents, not working families.
“That’s why we’re coming together to rewrite the rules so those who aren’t paying what they owe in taxes finally chip in to support the services we all rely on – especially public education,” Sweeney said.
Charlie Cavell, an organizer with Fund MI Future, said it was a matter of fairness.
“When you include sales tax and other taxes, working and middle-class families in Michigan actually pay a higher percentage of their income in state taxes than the top 1%,” Cavell said in a statement. “That’s upside-down. Our ballot initiative will restore balance and ensure that those at the very top finally contribute to our schools and communities like the rest of us already do.”
The campaign is being backed by Michigan Education Justice Coalition, the American Federation of Teachers Michigan and dozens of grassroots organizations.
“We know that for years Michigan schools have been underfunded and students are feeling forgotten and unheard,” Christina Yarn, a senior at Heritage High School in Saginaw and a member of the Michigan Education Justice Coalition’s Youth Collective, said in a statement. “We have been suffering in schools that are falling apart, with little to no school transportation, schools that have poor water and air quality, where students aren’t safe in their own classes.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/IMG_0983-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-05 19:03:05.647330

(Photo by Christine Condon/ Maryland Matters)Though there were some rumblings, no one turned in petitions to challenge actions of the Maryland General Assembly via referendum this year, state elections officials say.
At least two laws, both focused on energy policy, were in the crosshairs this year.
One group — which registered itself as the Maryland Environment, Labor and Industry Coalition — planned to challenge the Next Generation Energy Act, and focus its campaign on trash incinerators, which will no longer receive a renewable energy subsidy under the law.
Another group, led primarily by Maryland farmers, started collecting signatures to challenge the Renewable Energy Certainty Act, which focuses on solar farm siting in the state.
But ultimately, neither group submitted signatures before the May 31 deadline, when they needed 20,053. To actually get on the ballot in 2026, groups would have needed to assemble about 60,000 signatures by June 30.
The lack of submissions means Maryland will go another year without a statewide referendum on the ballot. The last one was in 2012, when voters petitioned to get same-sex marriage on the ballot, and ultimately the electorate approved it.
This year, both groups had pushed for Gov. Wes Moore (D) to veto their bills, but he signed each during his final bill signing session of the year, on May 21.

With just 10 days until the deadline, a representative of the MELIC group said a formal signature campaign was unlikely.
But the farming community decided to throw the Hail Mary, and collected thousands of signatures in an attempt to hit the cutoff.
The solar bill essentially prohibits local governments from establishing zoning rules that preclude large solar fields, and sets uniform statewide standards for solar sites.
But farmers are particularly concerned by a provision that caps solar facilities to 5% of “priority preservation areas,” or agricultural land, in any one county. They argue the ceiling is too high, and could take too much farmland out of production. Many believe that no farmland should be used for solar panels whatsoever.
“While this cap is certainly better than nothing, it still leaves thousands of acres of farmland open to commercial solar development,” wrote Maryland Farm Bureau President Jamie Raley in a recent statement. “The result of this bill is concerning, but it only strengthens our resolve to keep fighting for Maryland’s farmland.”
Jay Falstad, a leader of the solar energy petition effort, said that his group amassed just under 20,000 signatures before they ran out of time. They estimated that they would have needed at least 23,000 to meet the state’s cutoff, because signatures are frequently tossed out for non-compliance with a strict set of state rules.
But Falstad, who is a founder of Farmers Alliance for Rural Maryland, or FARM, said that a State Board of Elections official initially informed him that he’d have until Monday, June 2 — the next business day after the May 31 deadline — to make the submission.
Falstad was shellshocked when officials reached out on May 30 to say he’d only have until midnight on the 31st. He’s confident he could have reached the cutoff number with a few extra days.
“We would have made the necessary number, had it not been for this accelerated timeline,” said Falstad, who is also the executive director of the Queen Anne’s County Conservation Association. “The momentum was on our side.”
Jared DeMarinis, Maryland’s state administrator of elections, said that the initial communication, allowing until June 2, was in error. While other state election deadlines, such as business contribution filings, can move to the next business day, the ballot petition filing deadline cannot move, under the state constitution, he said.
“When we found out of a mistake, we made sure that they were aware of it,” DeMarinis said. “It is in the Maryland constitution, so it’s not like it was hidden in any sort of fashion.”
Regardless of the outcome, Falstad said he was impressed by the strong response to the petition drive. Organizers received signatures from each Maryland county, he said, although the effort was focused in rural areas on Maryland’s Eastern Shore, as well as in Montgomery, Harford and Carroll counties, Falstad said.
Falstad himself collected signatures on the Eastern Shore at fairgrounds and ballfields, farm stores and local parks.
“We had people running from their car to the pavilion to sign the petition through rain and thunder,” Falstad said. “The level of commitment and dedication on the part of people that wanted to sign the petition was inspiring.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/HEADSHOT-92-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-05 19:03:05.647330

The rift between the White River Valley Supervisory Union and the association reflects opposing views among school districts statewide about the role of supervisory unions and private schools in the public education system.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  A supervisory union’s break with the Vermont School Boards Association reveals statewide fault lines[...]","First Branch Unified District Board Chair Kathy Galluzzo during a board meeting in 2019. File photo by Dylan Kelley/White River Valley HeraldThe White River Valley Supervisory Union last week moved to withdraw its membership from the Vermont School Boards Association, highlighting deep divisions among the state’s school districts and supervisory unions over the trajectory of education reform.The White River board’s decision marks an overt break in unity with a prominent advocacy organization at a critical time for public education in Vermont.State lawmakers are working overtime to strike a deal on legislation that would lay the groundwork for major systemic reform in the coming months. House and Senate members were locked in strained negotiations last week, but leaders in both chambers, along with Gov. Phil Scott, said they were committed to working out a compromise on the bill, H.454, by June 16, when lawmakers are scheduled to reconvene for a vote.The Vermont School Board Association collects annual membership dues from every school district in the state and lobbies on behalf of its members. The supervisory union, a collection of six school districts that serves students from 10 central Vermont towns, was paying the association roughly $10,000 a year in membership dues, according to Kathy Galluzzo, chair of the supervisory union’s board.But in recent weeks, board members with the supervisory union questioned the association’s lobbying efforts. At a May 27 meeting, board members had strong words for the association’s support for legislation that would do away with supervisory unions.“They don’t believe in us, so they can’t lobby for us,” supervisory union board member Bill Edgerton said at the meeting.Leaders of the Vermont School Boards Association said the majority of the organization’s members support its position on supervisory unions.  In a press release announcing the decision, supervisory union board members said their withdrawal arose from disagreements around the association’s support for versions of H.454 that they said would result in “long bus rides for students, the dissolution of supervisory unions, no community involvement in decisions surrounding the future of rural schools, and no path to tax relief for Vermonters.”The statement went on to say that the association’s advocacy went “against the communities that WRVSU serves and the children they educate.” The White River Valley Supervisory Union is the first to break with the association, but it may not be the last.Districts within the Lamoille South, Twin Rivers and Great Rutland County supervisory unions have had similar discussions and plan to consider resolutions this month to suspend their dues or withdraw their membership, according to board meeting minutes and interviews with board members.In Windham County, board members with the Windham Southeast Supervisory District — one of two districts in the Windham Southeast Supervisory Union — voted on a resolution calling on the association to refrain from supporting legislation “not grounded in sound research or lacking clear fiscal impact modeling, especially on consequential issues like school governance and consolidation.”Timothy Maciel, a board member with the southern Vermont school district, in an interview said the board would consider suspending their dues to the association “if basic standards of democratic representation and accountability are not met.”“There’s really good folks in the VSBA,” he said. “But primarily, they have to represent our values and positions. If they aren’t representing those values, then we, in my opinion, shouldn’t continue with them.”READ MORE
Why supervisory unions?Vermont has 52 supervisory unions or supervisory districts — two different governing and administrative models for the state’s 119 school districts. State law only gives school districts the power to set budgets and to raise money through bonding. A supervisory union or supervisory district generally provides back office functions such as accounting and payroll and may oversee the provision of special education services and curriculum coordination, though their specific roles differ across the state.The supervisory union structure, which proliferated during the push for school district consolidation driven by Act 46, provides a unifying structure for school districts with vastly different operating structures — a way for them to share resources while maintaining independence.The White River Valley Supervisory Union is a particularly diverse example, with six districts following four different operating models. One of the school districts — the White River Union District, for the towns of Bethel and Royalton — operates all grades from pre-kindergarten through high school. Another, serving Granville and Hancock, operates none, and provides tuition to its resident students to the public and private schools they choose. Of the other four districts, two pay tuition and allow choice for middle school and high school for the towns of Rochester, Sharon and Stockbridge, while two provide tuition and choice just for high school for the towns of Chelsea, Strafford and Tunbridge. The school choice allowed in five of the six districts in the White River Valley Supervisory Union lets students attend private schools like the nearby Thetford Academy and Sharon Academy.Flor Diaz Smith, the president of the Vermont School Boards Association, said supervisory unions make it difficult to “have aligned outcomes and support for all our students.”“We’re trying to create coherence through this system,” she said.Complicating matters is the number of public school students that districts across the state are paying to send to private schools. There were around 3,500 students using public money for private school tuition in the 2022-23 school year — a small fraction of the almost 83,000 students educated in public school that same year, according to the Vermont Agency of Education.But that smaller group has played a big role in the education debate, and supervisory unions that allow students that publicly funded choice want to keep it that way.Galluzzo said that school choice is an important factor for her supervisory union, and the region’s independent schools provide educational options that are often closer to home for some families.“Families make that choice,” she said. “Kids find their fit in some of the independent schools for different reasons. I think more choice is better than less choice.”Scott’s education proposal, unveiled in January, would have eliminated the supervisory unions governance structure and instead established five regional districts of roughly 10,000 to 15,000 students each, except for the Champlain Valley region district, which was more than twice that size. In another change, the new districts’ board’s would have been empowered to designate certain private schools as “choice schools” available to all students in the larger district via lottery.Sue Ceglowski, the executive director of the Vermont School Boards Association, said during the White River Valley Supervisory Union Board’s meeting that the organization came out strongly against the governor’s plan.However, the association could not publicly support legislation that required the inclusion of supervisory unions because it was “paired with allowing for the continuation of a tuitioning system that provides continued access to independent schools,” she said.Ceglowski said most of the organization’s members supported its position on supervisory unions and that its stance was “based on resolutions that have been passed by our members.”In an interview, Diaz Smith also said there was “a lot of interest from the supervisory union advocates to stay with (school choice), to have everybody change but them, to have this system change around them.”“That is not collaborative,” she said. “That is not all coming to the table.”A rural school lobbyAfter their vote to leave the association, the White River Valley Supervisory Union Board voted during their May 27 meeting to shift the funds that would have gone to the Vermont School Board Association to the Rural Schools Community Alliance, an organization formed in January that has quickly emerged as an advocate and lobbying arm in the Statehouse for Vermont’s rural schools.The board in its press release said the alliance “has established itself as a strong ally, helping rural schools vocally oppose legislation that forces school closure.”“We were paying an entity to lobby for us, but they were lobbying for us to be closed,” Galluzzo said in an interview Thursday. “I think at this point in time, we need to put our money toward somebody in Montpelier that is going to fight for us.”As fears mount over the possible closure of small, rural schools, the White River Valley Supervisory Union and others have turned to the Rural Schools Community Alliance to advocate on their behalf as education reform has progressed this session.Since its formation in January, the alliance has grown to include more than 100 school districts in the state, according to Margaret MacLean, a steering committee member with the organization.She said the alliance sees supervisory unions “as essential structures for rural schools,” that offer more democratic representation and local control for smaller communities.MacLean and her organization have come out against Scott’s proposal for five regional districts, and said that consolidated structures won’t work “when you have towns that are distinct and separated by geography and mileage.”“We don’t see that as more efficient. We see that as less democratic,” she said. “Yes, democracy can sometimes be messy, but the benefits of it pay off in terms of engagement and involvement and community voice in support of schools.”Officials with the rural alliance and the school boards association have met and discussed their visions for Vermont’s public education system, both sides said. But disagreements remain between the two organizations over the efficacy of supervisory unions.“It’s not to be difficult. It’s not to be inflexible,” Diaz Smith said. “It’s just the data was not there to support supervisory unions.”Not everyone is on board with ditching the Vermont School Board Association. In Peacham, the school board will also take up a resolution to discuss reducing the amount of money they sent to the association.But Mark Clough, the district board’s chair and the vice chair of the school board association, said he’s “heard over and over again from a lot of districts and (supervisory unions) around the state that they really want tighter controls” of schools and districts under their purview.“The state feels, in general, that districts are the way to go, because it just provides more control to get costs and student outcomes in a better place than allowing it to just go off on its own with supervisory unions,” Clough said in an interview. “The (supervisory union) model, as good as it is for rural areas — and it does fit for some rural areas — it doesn’t fit for all regions.”Galluzzo left open the possibility of rejoining the association at some point in an interview. But at the May 27 meeting, board members with the supervisory union concluded they had no other choice but to withdraw their membership.Stacey Peters, the chair of the Granville-Hancock Unified School District, which is part of the supervisory union, said during the meeting last week she considered it a matter of “life or death” for the future of their schools.“You’re asking us to kind of sign away our livelihood here, and I think that that is not a simple difference of opinion,” she said at the meeting. “Being asked to pay for our own execution does not feel like a position that I think we should be supporting.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  A supervisory union’s break with the Vermont School Boards Association reveals statewide fault lines in education reform.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Kathy-Galluzzo-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-06-05 19:03:05.647330

Days after the Utah State Board of Education switched managers to run the program and the application portal closed, families are learning that they may have to apply again.
Odyssey, a New York-based technology company that won the bid in May to run the voucher program, announced Friday on its website that after reviewing the application data the outgoing administrator provided, it found that in many cases the information was incomplete, inconsistent, or lacked proper verification.

The company “will need to take additional steps to ensure accuracy, consistency, and compliance with the Utah Fits All law,” Odyssey officials wrote. They said those actions include re-running applications for families participating in the second year application cycle. 
“We understand that this may be frustrating, but we believe this is the best path forward to determine eligibility accurately,” company officials said.
The announcement comes after the Board of Education canceled early its multiyear contract with the program’s previous third-party manager ACE Scholarships, citing “convenience” reasons. The move was made possible by a 2025 bill that, among other changes to Utah Fits All, opened the door for a switch should the Board of Education need to change its current program administrator.

Odyssey officials said ACE Scholarships’ previous records make it impossible to determine students’ eligibility since those records only show a small percentage of second year applicants successfully completed their income verification — a step on their application that’s required by law. 
Those eligibility determinations will be delayed past the initial May 31 deadline, according to Odyssey. However, the company hasn’t set a new timeline for the new process.
Reconciling scholarship balances for current Utah Fits All participants is also underway, with “a large population for whom Odyssey cannot determine their current balance because there are thousands of pending reimbursements, receipts, and transactions, many of which were received by Odyssey as recently as May 29th.”
The company won’t authorize any additional spending until pending purchases undergo further analysis, according to its website. As of Thursday, Utah Fits All’s website listed June 30 as the last day to use 2024-2025 funds.



Let us know what you think...


 


Among the changes to Utah Fits All the Legislature approved this year is a 20% cap on extracurricular activities and physical education, in addition to tightened expense guidelines to explicitly prohibit the use of  scholarship money to pay for ski passes, furniture, musical instruments, apparel, and other uses.
While lawmakers approved more money to fund additional scholarships, bringing the total annual allocation for the program to $100 million, they also voted to reduce the amount some students could receive. This year, homeschooled children of ages 5 to 11 would have access to $4,000 a year, while those aged 12 to 18 years old could get up to $6,000. That’s down from the $8,000 that was allowed during the program’s first year.
Private school students are still eligible for $8,000 a year to help cover their tuition or other expenses.
Meanwhile, Utah Fits Alls is also facing other challenges that may threaten its existence. A 3rd District Court judge recently ruled the program to be unconstitutional, a win for the Utah Education Association, the state’s largest teacher union. 
The union sued the state for diverting “funds from already underfunded public schools,” union leaders said. They alleged the program violates the Utah Constitution, which explicitly says income tax revenue should be used to fund public education, among a few other limited uses. State leaders said they will appeal the decision to the Utah Supreme Court.
While the case plays out in court, the program will continue to operate.

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)In addition to the right to minimum wage, agricultural workers in Maine may soon be protected from retaliation for talking about work conditions.
On Thursday, the Maine Senate cast a final enactment vote for LD 588, which would give agricultural employees the right to engage in certain concerted activity, which includes talking about wages, working conditions and other employment matters with other employees or the employer. 
The House of Representatives initially rejected the bill, but narrowly decided Wednesday to change course and join the upper chamber in passing the measure. It now goes to Gov. Janet Mills for final approval.
Opponents argued the bill is unnecessary and opens the door to unionization, which they said would be difficult for the agricultural industry given the seasonal nature of the work and other nuances. Sen. Scott Cyrway (R-Kennebec) said the proposal “just puts another layer of difficulty for farmers.”
However, Rep. Amy Roeder (D-Bangor), who co-chairs the Labor Committee, said the bill only asks for “this very baseline concerted activity because we know unionization poses a lot of challenges.”
Earlier this week, the chambers also approved legislation that would give farmworkers the right to state minimum wage.

Jim Kofalt, a Wilton Republican, speaks in favor of Senate Bill 72, a parental rights bill passed by the House, June 5, 2025. (Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)The House and Senate passed a pair of parental rights bills Thursday, sending one to Gov. Kelly Ayotte’s desk, as Republicans advanced a yearslong goal to strengthen parents’ control over public schools. 
Both bills, House Bill 10 and Senate Bill 72, would enumerate a number of powers parents have to request information from teachers about their children, including the courses they are taking, the materials being taught, and what their children are saying at school. 
The House passed another bill, Senate Bill 96, that would also require teachers and school employees to answer questions from parents, and could impose stiff penalties for teachers who don’t provide the information. Under that bill, a teacher or administrator could be investigated by the Department of Education for violations and face disciplinary sanctions by the department. Teachers found to have “willfully violated” the law would face a mandatory one-year suspension of their teaching license.
Republicans said the legislation is meant to establish a state policy that parents direct the upbringing of their children — not their schools. 
“Today, it’s time that we deliver on our promises to Granite Staters by affirming that parental rights are fundamental,” said Rep. Jim Kofalt, a Wilton Republican. 
But Democrats have denounced the bills, noting that they could force teachers to disclose information about students to their parents that the students do not want shared, such as their sexual orientation or gender identity, and remove supportive spaces for kids.
Rep. Peter Petrigno, a Milford Democrat, said SB 72 would destroy trust in schools and leave children who don’t feel safe sharing things with their parents with few options. Should they confide in teachers, those teachers might be compelled to share that information to parents who inquire, Petrigno said. 
“If troubled kids cannot talk with their parents for any reason, and they know they now cannot talk to their trusted adults at school, then where will they turn?” Petrigno said. 
But Republicans argued that in most cases, a child’s parent is the best person to receive sensitive information about their children, not a teacher.
“If I know that most parents are way more trustworthy than teachers like Pamela Smart, then I will vote to pass this bill as amended,” said Rep. Debra DeSimone, an Atkinson Republican, referring to a former high school employee convicted in 1991 for killing her husband. 
Republicans also pointed to provisions in two of the bills, HB 10 and HB 72, that allow teachers to withhold information to parents if they have “clear and convincing” evidence that the infringement upon parental rights is necessary to prevent the child from being abused.
Democrats denounced that language, noting that “clear and convincing” is a higher legal standard than is typically required to report a child to the Division for Children, Youth, and Families and arguing that it would effectively bar teachers from withholding information from parents even if they had suspicion that it could lead to abuse. RSA 169-C:29 currently requires any teacher, school staff member, or other professional who interacts with children to make a report to DCYF if they have “reason to suspect” abuse or neglect.
In regard to that exception, one of the bills that passed, SB 96, differs from the other two. While HB 10 and SB 72 require “clear and convincing” evidence of abuse for a teacher to opt not to share information with parents, SB 96 allows a teacher to refrain from giving the information “if a reasonably prudent person would believe that disclosure would result in abuse, abandonment, or neglect.”
But SB 96 allows the exception only if the child has been physically harmed or has been threatened to be harmed “of such a grave nature by the actions or inactions” of a parent that it justifies withholding information. The bill states the exception does not apply to “potential or actual psychological or emotional injury” that a parent imposes on a child upon learning information about their child. It does not apply to “emotions such as anger, disappointment, sadness, disapproval or other behaviors.” 
HB 10 passed the House and the Senate Thursday and will head to Ayotte in the coming weeks; SB 72 and SB 96 both passed the House but had not yet received a final green light from the Senate as of Thursday afternoon.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/P6053828-Kofalt-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-05 19:03:05.647330

Tim Walz said Thursday Democrats need to take a broader approach to the states they are targeting during elections — which could mean further changes to the presidential nominating calendar.
Speaking with Minnesota Reformer editor Patrick Coolican at a States Newsroom conference in Minneapolis, the 2024 vice presidential candidate tackled multiple topics related to President Donald Trump’s time in office. He also discussed ways for the Democratic Party to bounce back after significant Republican wins in 2024, including Trump’s win over his and Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign.
One of the major questions leading up to the 2028 presidential election season — especially for Iowa — is the Democratic presidential nominating calendar. Following issues in the 2020 Democratic caucuses and Democratic National Committee concerns about the accessibility of the caucus system, Iowa was booted from it’s longtime first-in-the-nation position in the Democratic nominating calendar in 2022, replaced by South Carolina.

When asked by Iowa Capital Dispatch Editor-in-Chief Kathie Obradovich which state should go first, Walz immediately quipped, “Minnesota.” But in a longer response, the Democratic governor said he believes Democrats should rotate which states kick off the nominating process each presidential election cycle — a process he said may not be popular in states that may not traditionally have held early contests, but could improve Democrats’ odds in elections.
He reflected on how in his 2024 run with Harris, winning the presidency came down to winning a handful of contested states.
“On the calendar, I think you can’t be too rigid,” Walz said. “And it was … I don’t know if the word is depressing, but going to the seven states over and over and over again, and recognizing that you could win a presidential election or lose one doing that — I think we’ve got to be broader.”
Iowa Democrats made changes to the caucus system, moving from in-person events to a mail-in presidential preference contest in 2024, but there is not any indication the DNC plans to reinstate Iowa as an early state in the next nominating cycle. However, Iowa and other states that were not a part of the early state lineup in 2024 will have a chance to take a top position in 2028. Iowa Democratic Party Chair Rita Hart and other Iowa officials have said the DNC plans to revisit the calendar leading up to the next presidential election.
Though Iowa is still in the running, a potential blow was dealt to the state with Iowa Democrat Scott Brennan losing his longtime seat on the DNC Rules and Bylaws committee, the body overseeing the nominating calendar, the Des Moines Register reported.
Walz said he is not running as a Democratic presidential candidate, he has made visits to many of the traditional early states, including a May Democratic Party event in South Carolina and March event in Des Moines. He is not the only speculated 2028 Democratic presidential candidate to visit Iowa in recent months — former U.S. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg, who won the 2020 Iowa Democratic caucuses, held an event in Cedar Rapids in May.
Walz is also not the only person who thinks changes Democratic presidential nominating calendar would serve the party well in future elections. Chris Cillizza, a political commentator who formerly worked for CNN, said during a Potluck Podcast episode Monday with members of the Iowa Writers’ Collaborative that it was “very clear” former President Joe Biden moved South Carolina to the front of the calendar in 2024 “because South Carolina and Jim Clyburn got him elected president” in 2020.
However, Biden ultimately was not the Democratic presidential candidate in 2024, Cillizza said, and recent Democratic losses for the presidency with Harris and Hillary Clinton in 2024 show states like Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania are crucial to winning the general election. He said he believes Iowa should go first because “if you’re if you’re a Democrat trying to solve your broader problems, I think Iowa going first would help, not hurt” in the fight to win Midwestern states.
He said he believes this strategy has been reflected with the potential 2028 Democratic presidential candidates visiting traditional early states like Iowa.
When I look at travel schedules now, they’re acting as though we’re back to the pre-Joe Biden nominating calendar — Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, South Carolina,” Cillizza said. “And I wouldn’t be surprised if it went back to that. I mean, look, I actually think there’s a case to be made.”
However, he said he is not sure about the DNC chair Ken Martin’s strategy heading into 2028. Martin, elected in February, is from Minnesota, which Cillizza said “probably helps a little bit in the case for the Midwest.”

(Lori Kersey | West Virginia Watch)While West Virginia employees prepare for their health insurance to take up more of their paychecks this summer, a special session may be coming in July — the same month those increases take effect — to deal with ongoing cost and sustainability challenges at the Public Employees Insurance Agency.
At the finance board’s regular meeting Thursday, Chairman Eric Householder said the agency has been working with Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s office as he prepares to call the special legislative session.
“I know currently … we are working providing data to the governor,” Householder said. “There’s been no decision on what to do, just providing data, having roundtable discussions. That’s all we’re doing right now.”
Householder said Morrisey tentatively intends to call a special session for PEIA in mid July.
Beginning in July, PEIA premiums are increasing by 14% for state employees and by 16% for local government employees. Out-of-pocket and copay costs will also go up. The agency will also raise premiums by 12% for retirees.
PEIA leaders have said that the rising cost of health care — particularly inflation on prescription GLP-1 drugs that treat obesity and diabetes — are a major driver of the rate increases.
Union leaders and state employees have repeatedly called on the Legislature to come up with a solution to PEIA’s rising costs, but the issue largely went unaddressed during the 2025 regular session.
Morrisey said in April that he plans to call a special session for PEIA, but he has not said how exactly the issue of increasing costs will be addressed..
“That was kicked down the road for many, many years,” the governor said in April. “I don’t intend to kick it down the road. We have to bring everyone together, all the stakeholders: listen, learn and then you’ll be seeing some activity.”
In a news release Thursday, leadership from the West Virginia Democratic Party blamed Morrisey for “falling to act” and letting “devastating” PEIA increases go into effect.
“Pay-Cut Patrick failed to take action to stabilize PEIA premiums,” Democratic Party Chair Mike Pushkin said in the statement. “So now, state employees, including law enforcement officers, school teachers, school service personnel, CPS workers, and retirees will soon be paying a price for his inaction. Morrisey had a choice — he could have fought to protect working West Virginians. Instead, he did what he always does: protect his political donors and let working families bear the burden.”
In an email Thursday, Morrisey spokesman Drew Galang said the governor has emphasized that the state “must address the inherited challenges facing PEIA and its long term sustainability.” He said Morrisey had “already indicated” that a special session to do so would occur in “mid to late July.”
Galang did not respond to an email asking to clarify when, publicly, the July timeframe had been set by Morrisey and no such references to it have been made clear in previous PEIA meetings or announcements prior to Thursday.
A spokeswoman for the House of Delegates and one for the state Senate said the governor has not formally told lawmakers the special session will be in July.
Dale Lee, president of the West Virginia Education Association, told Householder the discussions about PEIA solutions should include public employees and their representatives.
“The employees can’t be the ones providing all of this,” Lee said of the cost increases. “We have to have the Legislature. There has to be not only the Legislature but also the providers. That’s why I continue to ask that we all go back to the table and that we come up with a plan that people can agree on.”
Lee, who has repeatedly criticized state leaders for failing to act on the recommendations of a task force called by former Gov. Jim Justice after statewide teacher strikes in 2018 and 2019, said it’s important that the Legislature act upon a plan for PEIA this time.
“[It] never even got on a committee agenda,” he said of the recommendations. “That’s just disingenuous.”",https://westvirginiawatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/PEIA-sign-scaled-e1732553302111-1024x414.jpeg,,,2025-06-05 19:03:05.647330

Photo via Adobe StockNext week, Benningtonians might catch a glimpse of people suspended in midair, repelling from the state’s tallest manmade structure, as a crew works to clear away crumbling stone from the Bennington Battle Monument.Starting Monday, a group plans to scale the 306-foot obelisk to execute the next step in the state’s effort to restore and maintain the memorial to the Battle of Bennington.Spectators are welcome to gather below to watch the aerial feat of a safety inspection team as they repel and remove loose stone from the weather-worn monument, said Laura Trieschmann, the state’s historic preservation officer.The monument has become saturated with an estimated 66,000 gallons of water, causing cracks to form and debris to fall from the structure, Trieschmann said. The problem spans back decades.“Cracking of the stone occurred almost immediately upon construction,” Trieschmann said. “By the 1920s, we know from primary documentation that materials were falling off, and that was exacerbated by the ineffective and incomplete restoration efforts taken in the latter part of the 20th century.”This is the fourth annual effort to remove debris from the monument, and the cost of this year’s proactive maintenance is $72,000, Trieschmann said. The company the state Division for Historic Preservation contracts with, Vertical Access, has “already documented every crack and issue on the exterior of the monument,” she said.After years of deferred maintenance, the division’s study of the monument found that restoration would require at least $40 million. The price tag sparked debate over whether restoration of the state’s historic monument is worth the cost or whether other innovative plans should be considered to commemorate the Battle of Bennington.READ MORE
An idea to enclose the monument in copper, proposed by state Rep. Shawn Sweeney, D-Shelburne, gained attention in recent months, and Trieschmann said the division would study the impact and cost of the suggestion. The monument will close for the team to dislodge loose stone between June 9 and 12, but the site is set to reopen just in time for the annual Vermont Days, a weekend of free entry to all state parks.During its closure, Trieschmann said the division plans to erect a roadside historic marker to Seth Warner, a Vermonter and a member of the Green Mountain Boys who was crucial in the Battle of Hubbardton and the Battle of Bennington.Trieschmann said that the division’s maintenance plan and effort to monitor cracks and remove rubble is about the safety of guests, staff and residents who continue to visit the second tallest unreinforced masonry structure in the nation and a key symbol of Vermont’s Revolutionary past. “This is our greatest visited monument of the state’s historic sites, and we want to make sure that it remains open, but first and foremost is safety,” Trieschmann said.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Bennington Battle Monument to close for maintenance in midair.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Bennington-Battle-Monument-1024x575.jpeg,,,2025-06-05 19:03:05.647330

(Micah Drew/Daily Montanan)A newly formed political committee is beginning a campaign to enshrine nonpartisan judicial elections in the state constitution, after a multitude of efforts by the Montana Legislature to attach party labels to judges failed.  
Pepper Peterson, the political director for Montanans for Fair and Impartial Judges, said the goal of putting a constitutional initiative to voters in 2026 came after watching the repeated rebuffing of those actions during the session.
“I think the people of Montana can see the system here is fair,” Peterson told the Daily Montanan. “This is a common sense idea to have in our state constitution. Anything else is just raw partisanship, and I don’t think most Montanans are on that train.”
Throughout the 2025 session, legislators introduced more than a half-dozen bills aimed at allowing, or requiring, judicial candidates to declare a party label, a stated goal of Republican leaders in the Legislature and Gov. Greg Gianforte, who argue that the judicial branch is “nonpartisan in name only.”
One bill passed — House Bill 39, which allows political parties to donate to judicial candidates — but a majority failed to gain traction in at least one chamber. 
Five separate bills attempted to allow, or require, judges to run under a partisan label. Some bills would have only applied to the Montana Supreme Court, others would have included any judicial candidate, including district and municipal judges, and justices of the peace.
Lawmakers who supported those measures said that allowing candidates to align with a political party would bring transparency to the process and help educate voters. 
While a majority of lawmakers didn’t seem to have an appetite for changing the system, it was a point of discussion all the way until the final day, with Gianforte’s office considering adding the partisan judicial issue into an amendment of a spending bill.  
Despite the thwarted attempts to alter the judicial selection process, Republican leaders in the Senate said they had laid a foundation for future reform. 
“I think that judicial reform is critical, continuously. It’s important for our judges to have accountability. It’s important for preventative transparency, and what we did this session helps start that process,” said Senate Majority Leader Tom McGillvray, R-Billings, during a press conference at the end of the session. 
But Peterson said seeing lawmakers pushing partisan judicial elections get “slapped down over and over and over again” set the stage for bringing the issue to the ballot box. 
“That’s what we anticipate the people to do as well. We’re going to put this in the Constitution, and we’re going to stop this,” he said. “The people are going to have to send this message very loud and very clear so that lawmakers know this is what Montanans want.”
Peterson is working with Ted Dick, a former executive director of the Montana Democratic Party more than a decade ago, on the ballot issue — the same team behind the successful ballot initiatives in 2020 designed to legalize adult use of recreational marijuana. 
Peterson said their experience on that campaign, as well as his decades of political work in the state on issues from coal mining to gun rights, make them the right group to bring forward the ballot initiative, despite not working on judicial issues during the session. 
“My career has been nonpartisan activism for the rights of citizens. I consider myself a civil rights activist over anything, whether that’s the rights of the 2nd amendment, 1st amendment, 4th amendment,” Peterson said. “I can get signatures and get this issue across the finish line … It’s a complicated process, there’s only a few people who are experts, and we’re some of them.”
To get the issue onto the ballot as a constitutional initiative in 2026, the committee must collect valid signatures representing 10% of votes cast for governor in the last election stateside, as well as 10% in at least 40 legislative districts. 
If the issue makes it onto the ballot, a simple majority of votes will enshrine it as a part of the state constitution. 
Two new laws passed by the Legislature make changes to the process for gathering signatures for ballot initiatives.  
Senate Bill 226, sponsored by Sen. Mike Cuffe, R-Eureka, requires signatures be submitted incrementally, rather than by a single deadline. 
House Bill 201, by Rep. Braxton Mitchell, R-Columbia Falls, mandates that a paid signature gatherer must verbally disclose their first name, state where they legally reside, and position as a paid gatherer to anyone they approach. They must also wear a nametag with that information. 
Peterson said the committee intends to have “thousands of conversations” during the early stages of building out their campaign with lobbyists, special interest groups, and most importantly, citizens. 
“Polling done on this issue shows overwhelming support from Montanans for nonpartisan elections,” Peterson said. “I don’t think it’s our uphill battle to fight at all — I think it’s an uphill battle for the other side to convince people the system we have in place is flawed.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Old_Supco2-1024x717.jpg,,,2025-06-05 19:03:05.647330

Mori Hosseini, chair of the UF Board of Trustees and a proponent of Ono,  defended the UF trustees’ decision to forward Ono to the BOG for final approval.
“Our Board of Trustees stands by the integrity of the search, the strength of the candidates it produced, and the principles that guided our work,” Hosseini said during a lengthy board meeting. “This outcome is deeply disappointing to our Board of Trustees.”
Ono was rejected by the Board of Governors in a 6-10 vote after he was questioned for hours about his conflicting stances on diversity, equity, and inclusion. The UF board voted unanimously in favor of Ono the week prior.

Had he received the job, Ono’s contract would have provided him about $3 million annually.
“We believe Dr. Ono was uniquely qualified to lead this university at this moment,” Hosseini continued. “The symbolism and substance of the sitting president of a university as prestigious as University of Michigan, choosing to come to University of Florida should not be lost. It was a powerful signal that Florida’s model for higher education grounded in merit, academic excellence, institutional neutrality, and accountability to students and taxpayers is earning the trust and interest of top team leaders across the country who are ready to advance this vision.”
The UF presidency is being filled on an interim basis by former President Kent Fuchs. The permanent job has been open since July, when former U.S. Sen. Ben Sasse resigned from the presidency.
“We will continue to pursue the kind of bold principle and forward thinking leadership that Gator nation deserves,” Hosseini concluded.

It may be slippery.
Water leaks flood the concrete path connecting the House and Senate office complexes, making for a slick trek.
Water is also eating away at the structural integrity of the roughly 85-year-old passageway between the John A. Cherberg and John L. O’Brien buildings, and could potentially damage the latter building because it is on the walkway’s downhill side.
This year, lawmakers earmarked $4 million in the state capital budget to essentially rebuild the tunnel.
“Without repairs, the entire tunnel will eventually fail,” the Department of Enterprise Services wrote in its request for money to make repairs.
Guy Bergstrom said it’s been a problem since he joined the House Democratic Caucus staff three decades ago.
“It’s always damp, if not a little river running through it,” he said. “You have to make the water drain away. That’s the whole damn ball game.”
The project will require excavating the tunnel and installing new waterproofing and external drainage. Reinforcing the structure will also be needed, the agency wrote in its budget request.

It will take about two years to finish. Site evaluation will begin in July. Design would come next, likely between November and next March. Digging would start after the 2026 legislative session, with construction expected to last until May 2027. 
The tunnel connects the basements of the two buildings. It is about 10 feet wide, 8 feet high, and a little under 150 feet long. It was built in the same period as the two buildings.
Cherberg houses offices of Democratic senators and Senate committee hearing rooms. It was completed in 1937 and originally named the Public Lands and Social Security Building. O’Brien is where most state representatives have offices. House committee rooms are located there, too. When it was completed in 1940, it was known as the Transportation Building.
The Department of Enterprise Services first noted damage to the concrete in 2011 and problems have significantly increased since, according to the department’s request.
Doing nothing, the agency memo concluded, “will result in a costly emergency response when the tunnel ultimately fails and threatens the life and health safety of legislators and their staff, the historic integrity of the West Capitol Campus, and continuity of government operations.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_2806-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-06-05 18:04:23.424855

Tennessee House Speaker Cameron Sexton has publicly called on Nashville Mayor Freddie O’Connell to rescind an executive order that requires city emergency personnel to report interactions with immigration officials within 24 hours.
“While Metro has refused to assist federal agents with ICE; they decided to escalate it by forcing all employees to act as big brother,” Sexton posted Thursday to the social media platform X.
“The time is now to rescind the big brother executive order and return to normal communications with state and federal authorities,” Sexton’s post read. Sexton tagged Tennessee Congressman Mark Green, Tennessee Attorney General Jonathon Skrmetti and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in his post.
Sexton’s post is the latest in a series of public criticisms in recent weeks targeting O’Connell, a Democrat who leads Tennessee’s most populous city, which also serves as the seat of the GOP-controlled General Assembly.
  Tennessee House Speaker Cameron Sexton’s June 5 post on X.
Last week, Tennessee Republican Congressman Andy Ogles accused the mayor of obstructing the work of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials, citing O’Connell’s public statements criticizing mass enforcement activities that swept up nearly 200 people in the heart of the city’s immigrant neighborhoods in early May.
Ogles’ Memorial Day press conference excoriating O’Connell was followed in short order by Trump Administration officials’ appearances on conservative television programs to denounce the mayor. 
White House “border czar” Tom Homan appeared on Fox News and threatened to “flood the zone” with immigration enforcement efforts in retaliation for O’Connell’s comments about the joint enforcement action between the Tennessee Highway Patrol and agents with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
Then, Tricia McLaughlin, Department of Homeland Security assistant secretary for public affairs, accused O’Connell of “harboring” immigrants without legal status and “doxxing” immigration enforcement agents, in video of her appearance on Newsmax that was posted on the agency’s official X account. 
Last Thursday, two Republican-led U.S. House committees launched an inquiry into the response by Nashville’s mayor to federal immigration enforcement activities. 
A letter sent Thursday by the House Judiciary and Homeland Security Committees demanded a series of documents from O’Connell by June 12. The letter accused the mayor of actions that  “threaten to chill immigration enforcement in the City of Nashville and Davidson County.”
The accusations against O’Connell center on the mayor’s public statements condemning the Nashville immigration sweeps – and a longstanding executive order requiring city departments to report interactions with immigration officials within three days.

“What’s clear today is that people who do not share our values of safety and community have the authority to cause deep community harm,” O’Connell said at the time. 
“Their approach is not our understanding of what a Nashville for all of us looks like, and we’re grateful to our community partners who make all of our residents feel welcome,” he said.
O’Connell also issued a revision to the existing executive order in early May, amid mass immigrant detainments in the city’s largely immigrant neighborhood of South Nashville, to require the reporting of interactions between city personnel and federal immigration officials take place within 24 hours.

The order requires all emergency and some non-emergency city agencies and officials to report these interactions to the Mayor’s Office of New and Indigenous Americans, a department created to foster civic participation.
That department posted a spreadsheet with summaries of the interactions on its website. 
The initial public posts identified three federal immigration officials by their full names, and one by her first name, posts that were inadvertent, the mayor’s office later said. 
“It is not the normal practice to include the names of individuals in EO30 (the executive order) reporting. Any names mistakenly included have been removed,” a statement from the mayor’s office last week said.
A request for comment from O’Connell’s office about Sexton’s remarks was not immediately returned Thursday.

Haaland, who is running as a Democratic candidate for governor, told attendees at a water summit 'the future of our communities depends on us using water wisely.' (Danielle Prokop / Source NM)While New Mexico faces threats from climate change, the Trump administration poses a much greater threat to the state’s water supplies, former U.S. Interior Secretary and 2025 Democratic primary gubernatorial candidate Deb Haaland said Thursday.
“Right now we face a much larger challenge,” she said during her keynote speech at a Santa Fe water conference. “The Trump administration is putting our progress at risk. Haaland listed the White House firings of federal staff; cancellations of grants to federal projects; and proposed budget reductions for water, public lands and tribal communities, as examples.
“Cuts, cuts, cuts — that’s all they do,” Haaland said. “When drought conditions strike, we need these systems to be resilient enough for us to rely on. Our future will count on us holding the line and leaders who can fight back.”
Haaland, in her signature white sneakers and a cornflower blue suit, addressed the crowd of about 100 attendees seated inside a committee room at the Roundhouse for a two-day water summit hosted by the City of Santa Fe.
Most of Haaland’s speech focused on the need for collaboration, conservation and working closer with tribal governments on water issues, as climate change has rapidly stressed the Colorado River and Rio Grande.
Haaland, a member of the Laguna Pueblo, opened her speech with memories of hauling buckets for cooking and washing at her grandmother’s house in Mesita, saying the experience instilled a deep respect for water.
“We must manage the water resources with every community in mind collaboratively and above all, respect one another,” she said.
But further conservation will be needed, she said, such as additional watershed restoration, infrastructure needs and better metering and sustainability processes for aquifers.
“We need to modernize and expand groundwater management, our basins are long overdrawn, and we must be dedicated to managing this,” she said. “We must think in terms of generations and not budget years.”
Haaland said Pueblo and tribal involvement needs to be a priority, saying that her experience in negotiations on the Colorado River offered creative solutions such as the Gila River Tribe’s idea to float solar panels on canals to prevent water loss.
“I will say that bringing the tribes to the table was the best thing that we could have ever done, because they brought ideas. They brought generations of experience in water stewardship with them to the table,” she said.
Haaland took two questions from the audience. One asked about the recent U.S. Supreme Court decision to refuse to hear the Apache Stronghold’s case to stop a copper mine from destroying Oak Flat, a sacred site.
She encouraged nonprofits to ask the tribal governments involved in the case for direction, and said it wasn’t under her power during her time in the U.S. Department of the Interior.
“I wasn’t able to do anything to stop that, and it’s regrettable that this has happened, but more of these things are going to happen during this administration,” she said. “I think it’s on all of us to be as strong as we can and fight back where and when we can.”
A second question from the audience asked about the “elephant in the room” of how she might approach water-intensive crops as governor.
She said the state needs to encourage research and development into technologies such as underground irrigation (often called deep-root irrigation).
“I feel very strongly that in order to save our agricultural tradition here in New Mexico that we really need to look at the ways that we can help move those things forward and assist farmers in implementing some of these techniques, buying equipment,” she said.
In February, Haaland announced her 2026 bid for governor. If elected, she would be the first Native American person to head the state government in its 113-year history. She is facing challengers including 2nd Judicial District Attorney Sam Bregman and Ken Miyagashima, the former mayor of Las Cruces, running as Democrats and Rio Rancho Mayor Greggory Hull running as a Republican.

(Photo by Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)A federal appeals court on Thursday upheld lower court decisions barring counties from imposing safety standards on a pipeline subject to federal safety standards. 
The cases involved Summit Carbon Solutions, the company proposing to build a carbon sequestration pipeline through the state, and county supervisors from both Story and Shelby Counties. 
Summit sued the counties in 2022 for enacting ordinances that required county-specific setback requirements and other regulations the company argued were preempted by federal pipeline safety laws. 
A federal judge ruled in favor of Summit in Dec. 2023 and issued permanent injunctions, stopping the counties from enforcing the regulations, which would have impacted the carbon sequestration pipeline and other pipelines. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The county supervisors appealed the decision and presented oral arguments in November 2024 to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. The counties argued that local land use and zoning regulations are not “preempted standards” under the Pipeline Safety Act. 
Writing for the appeals court, U.S. Circuit Judge Duane Benton wrote held that the county ordinances “focus” on safety and “repeatedly” mention safety risks associated with the pipeline, which “undermines” the Pipeline Safety Act’s goal of preempting state regulations on safety. 
“This holding does not prohibit local governments from considering safety, nor prevent them from enacting all zoning ordinances, as the counties suggest,” Benton said in the opinion. “This court emphasizes the distinction between safety standards — which the PSA preempts — and safety considerations — which the PSA does not preempt.” 
The county ordinances also included emergency response requirements and abandonment provisions which the court ruled were also preempted by federal regulations. 
Circuit Judge Jane Kelly, however, dissented on those elements and wrote she does not believe that PSA preempts setback and abandonment provisions. Kelly said that while the counties’ setback requirements are “animated in part by safety considerations” they do not have the “direct and substantial” effect on safety that is reserved for federal regulation. 
Kelly also wrote that per her understanding, the Pipeline Safety Act “does not cover pipelines that have been abandoned” and therefore the Shelby County abandonment provision is not “expressly preempted.”
The court affirmed the lower court’s decision in both cases, but ordered the federal court for the Southern District of Iowa to reconsider an additional ordinance that’s at issue in the Story County case. 
Jason Craig, the attorney representing the counties, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the decision. 
Sabrina Zenor, on behalf of Summit Carbon Solutions, said the ruling “confirms” pipeline safety regulation set by the federal government and the Iowa Utilities Commission’s role in route and permit decisions. 
“This supports a consistent, lawful permitting process for critical infrastructure projects like ours,” Zenor said in a statement.

Ned Lamont describes his current thinking on seeking a third term. (Photo by Mark Pazniokas/CT Mirror)Gov. Ned Lamont said Thursday that the challenges of navigating the economic uncertainties and political chaos generated by President Donald J. Trump only increase the chances he will seek a third term as governor of Connecticut in 2026.
“If you had asked me a year ago, I would have said, ‘No, I think the state’s on a good trajectory. We’ve stabilized things. We’re growing again. Time to pass the mantle,’” Lamont said.
He said he no longer is so eager to step aside.
“It’s also an incredibly complicated time right now, starting with all the uncertainty of Washington, the increased possibility of a recession,” Lamont said. “So, maybe a time where experience makes a difference. That’s a way of saying I’m thinking about it seriously.”
Lamont, 71, a self-described centrist Democrat, stopped well short of declaring his candidacy, but he gave his strongest indication to date of an inclination to seek another four-year term with Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz.
“I love the job,” he said. “I think we’ve had extraordinary progress compared to where we were, say, 10 years ago. I think Susan and I are a pretty good team.”
Lamont met with reporters in his Capitol office at midday, just 12 hours after the General Assembly reached its constitutional adjournment deadline of midnight Wednesday.
“We got some extraordinary folks and Democrats, and I work very closely with each and every one of them,” he said.
But sees himself with an edge.
“I think it’s executive experience, having sat in this chair for the last six and a half years, having been through the Trump administration, having been through COVID, having worked closely with the leadership on both sides of the aisle,” Lamont said.
He defended the granular details of the recently adopted budget and the broad strokes of his record as a governor overseeing a remarkable series of budget surpluses that have filled the state’s budget reserves and allowed the state to pay down unfunded pension debt.
With those surpluses has come pressure from the political left to address unmet needs, including low Medicaid reimbursement rates for medical providers. Lamont, they say, is too concerned with keeping spending within the state’s fiscal guardrails.
The criticism is not discouraging him as he finalizes a decision whether to run, he said.

“I’m a lot more inclined and interested in keeping going, keep this positive momentum going, than I was, say, six months or a year ago. That said, I still have some conversations to make. I put everything on hold during this last four or five months. We had a pretty tricky budget session to get through.”
The “tricky” part was finding ways to satisfy Democrats lawmakers within the constraints of spending caps.
“I think it’s an honestly balanced budget,” Lamont said, adding it’s based upon “a pretty conservative set of assumptions.”
The budget assumes that household income will grow about 4% annually over the next two years. But it also stretches Connecticut’s budget controls without breaking them legally.
The largest initiative, a new $220 million endowment to grow early education and child care services dramatically over the next decade, will be established outside of the formal budget and spending cap.
In doing so, the leaders of the Republican legislative minorities say Lamont is losing his credibility as a fiscal centrist, a theme the GOP will try to develop if Lamont runs.
“Fiscal moderation has officially left the state Capitol,” Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, proclaimed recently.
House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, said, “This budget eviscerates all of our fiscal guardrails.”
House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, smiled Wednesday when asked about the GOP efforts to define Lamont as a born-again, tax-and-spend liberal.
“The governor is being attacked by the left and the right, and so he’s probably here,” Ritter said, pointing to the center of the table. “And the answer is, always here.”
On Thursday, Lamont concurred: the political center is his comfort zone. He noted that Republicans regularly have claimed his two-year budgets were built on shaky foundations.

“‘You’re going to be in deficit within two years. You’re going to be raising taxes.’ Well, at six years later, stop crying wolf,” Lamont said.
Despite the off-budget spending on early childhood education, the governor estimated that at least $1.2 billion of this fiscal year’s $2.4 billion projected surplus still would be used to cover more unfunded pension liabilities
He reiterated his intention to veto a bill that would give jobless benefits to strikers, a source of tension with the Connecticut AFL-CIO. He also announced an intention to veto a bill sought by Republicans — and opposed both by the building trades unions and the Connecticut Business and Industry Association.
The measure, House Bill 7004, is intended to give Plainfield, a small town in eastern Connecticut, the ability to hold a referendum over a proposed trash-to-energy plant and possibly influence the state Siting Council to block the project. He briefly deferred a question about the bill to a senior staff, who confirmed it indeed would be vetoed.
“I’m vetoing that,” Lamont said, laughing. “I just made that strong decision by myself.”
Lamont said he welcomed passage of a bill encouraging housing construction, though he had yet to finish reviewing it.
“We’re never going to get economic growth [and] keep it going if we don’t have a place for people to live, young people to live, workforce housing, getting our cities growing again,” he said.
Opponents in Fairfield County have urged him to veto the bill.
“I think there’s some red flags in it, and I know why it makes people nervous,” he said. “But it’s basically gross misrepresentation from the anti-growth people down there that are stirring people up. They’re saying it’s a big mandate. You’re gonna forcing me to build housing, you know, in my backyard, which is not what the strategy is at all. It’s trying to tell towns, you take the lead, you show us where you want that housing to go. It’s important for your community.”

Accounting for births and deaths, the net population gain from immigration in those years was about 4.4 million, CBO said.Across the country, state and local governments spent about $19.3 billion in goods and services for those immigrants, with costs concentrated on providing education and shelter, CBO estimated.The $9.2 billion direct net cost amounts to 0.3% of state and local spending, CBO said.“State and local governments saw both their tax revenues and their spending increase in 2023 as a result of the surge in immigration,” the CBO report said. “In CBO’s estimation, the increase in spending was greater than the increase in taxes.”In an alternative calculation, CBO estimated that when accounting for indirect effects — for example, increases in property taxes and economic activity, greater demand for government services — the surge led to a spending increase of $28.6 billion and increased revenue of $18.8 billion for state and local governments, netting a loss of roughly $9.8 billion.More than half of newly arrived immigrants resided in six states: California, Florida, Illinois, New Jersey, New York and Texas.CBO estimated that in 2023, about 550,000 children in public schools, or 1.1% of students, were immigrants who’d arrived since 2021. “In CBO’s estimation, the surge in immigration directly increased spending for public primary and secondary education by $5.7 billion, or 0.7 percent, in 2023,” according to the report.Those higher costs were “due to lower English proficiency among the surge population.”“Because recent immigrants are often English-language learners, they tend to need additional instructional and support services,” according to the report. “CBO estimates that those services cost state and local governments $1.2 billion in 2023.”Another high cost was shelter services, CBO found. Four states — New York, Massachusetts, Illinois, and Colorado — “spent a total of $3.3 billion to provide shelter and related services, including food and legal support, to the surge population in 2023,” according to the report.In 2021, the Biden administration dealt with the highest levels of migration at the southern border in 20 years. In an effort to ease the increase at the U.S.-Mexico border, several programs were created to allow migrants to obtain work permits or enter the country while their asylum cases were pending before immigration court.A nonpartisan New York think tank that studies domestic and international migration, the Center for Migration Studies, released a report that found the population of people in the United States without permanent legal status increased to by 2 million to 12.2 million by 2023, using the most recent Census Bureau American Community Survey data.",,,,2025-06-05 18:04:23.424855

Idaho will participate in the jail enforcement model under the 287(g) program, which allows ICE to delegate specific immigration officer functions to state and local law enforcement officers, according to a news release Gov. Brad Little issued Thursday. 
State officials said Idaho State Police will only be targeting and transporting people who have been convicted of a crime and are finishing their incarceration sentence. Instead of releasing the inmates to the community after they complete their sentence, they will be directly transported to ICE facilities in Idaho for detention, state officials said.

“Idaho is stepping up to help the Trump administration transport dangerous illegal alien criminals to ICE facilities instead of being released back into our communities,” Little said in a written statement. “These are people who have committed crimes such as domestic violence, robbery, driving under the influence, and other dangerous activities that threaten Idaho families. Idaho has taken many steps to increase our coordination with the Trump administration in the enforcement of our nation’s immigration laws, and I want to further strengthen our state’s partnership with President Trump to help address the national emergency posed by years of reckless border policies under the Biden-Harris administration.”
  Idaho State Police seeks funding to transport immigrants to deportation facilities 

Idaho State Police is seeking $300,000 in funding to pay for the transports, state officials said. The money would be used to provide up to 100 transports from Idaho jails or prisons to ICE facilities for deportation, such as the Jefferson County Detention Center in Rigby, state officials said. 
Idaho State Police will not be able to carry out any ICE transfers until the Idaho State Board of Examiners approves the funding request, which could occur as early as next week.

“I’m really encouraged to see Idaho making its communities safer by signing on with our 287(g) program,” Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons said in a written statement. “You have to remember that we’re talking about criminals — and often, they won’t take an arrest sitting down — so when local jails are allowed to turn them over to ICE in a safe setting, we don’t need to send dozens of federal law enforcement officers into the public to make arrests. Partnerships like this one keep offenders out of communities and protect our families, friends and neighbors.”

The new Idaho State Police/ICE partnership essentially implements the transport aspects of House Bill 83, a Texas-style immigration bill that the Idaho Legislature passed and Little signed into law earlier this year. 
However, a judge temporarily blocked House Bill 83 from taking effect in March after ACLU of Idaho filed a lawsuit against the state, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. 
Under the 287(g) program, ICE is allowed to partner with local law enforcement agencies and the state does not need to resolve the legal challenge over House Bill 83 before moving ahead with transporting people convicted of a crime to ICE detention centers for deportation, state officials said. 
Earlier this year, Little also issued an executive order that called for state agencies to continue collaborating with ICE and called on state agencies to consider formal procedures to assist with the enforcement of immigration law. 
Idaho State Police officials began discussing the partnership with ICE after Little issued the executive order in February, state officials said. 
It was not exactly clear how many people convicted of a crime in Idaho would be subject to transfer to ICE facilities for deportation under Idaho’s new partnership. However, state officials used the term “hundreds” several times and said that each of the up to 100 transports to ICE facilities would include multiple people.

AESC is now pausing construction. (Provided by Florence County Economic Development)A battery cell maker is pausing work on its manufacturing plant under construction in the Pee Dee, delaying its pledge of 1,600 new jobs for South Carolinians.
Envision Automotive Energy Supply Co. (AESC) announced the work stoppage Thursday, two years after breaking ground on the facility near Florence.
“AESC has informed the state of South Carolina and our local partners that due to policy and market uncertainty, we are pausing construction at our South Carolina facility at this time,” spokesman Brad Grantham said in a statement. “We anticipate being able to resume construction once circumstances stabilize.”
The Japanese-headquartered firm already has invested more than $1 billion into the Florence facility, Grantham said.
He said the company “fully intends to meet our commitments to invest $1.6 billion and create 1,600 jobs in the coming years,” but did not indicate what the new timeline might be. The company declined to provide further comment.
Gov. Henry McMaster, while speaking to reporters, pointed to uncertainty over rising tariffs enacted by the Trump Administration, as well provisions in Republicans’ massive bill on taxes and spending that could eliminate electric vehicle tax credits — both for people who purchase new or used electric vehicles and those that install EV charging stations at their homes or business.
“We hate to see that happen, but a pause is OK,” McMaster said.
“We’re just urging caution. Let things play out, because all of these changes are taking place,” the governor added. “We believe that give it some time and it’ll work out.”
Electric vehicle sales have continued to rise, both nationally and globally. Still, the speed of that growth has not met with early expectations.
Electric vehicle battery companies in SC among the latest to hit speed bumps

The lag has led to multiple setbacks for the fledgling industry, with canceled investments both nationally and in the Palmetto State, as well as automakers easing away from goals of going all-electric in favor of a mix of electric and plug-in hybrids. A repeal of consumer tax credits could further slow progress.
AESC’s pause comes just four months after the battery cell manufacturer pulled back on earlier plans to expand the plant beyond its original scope.
BMW contracted with AESC to produce battery cells for the German auto giant’s U.S. manufacturing facilities in the Upstate. The automaker has already invested $700 million dollars in its own battery plant in Woodruff, planning to place the cells it receives from AESC into the batteries it assembles there.
BMW spokesman Steve Wilson said those battery assembly plans are still on schedule to begin in 2026.
Between the initial announcement in 2022 and March 2024, AESC rolled out three separate rounds of investment and promises of jobs in Florence. In addition to supplying BMW’s Spartanburg County assembly plant, the company made plans for a second building the was supposed to produce battery cells for a BMW plant in Mexico.
But in February, AESC told the state the first factory would be enough to meet the demand for both of BMW’s facilities. It pulled out of plans for a second, $1.5 billion building, along with the 1,080 jobs that came with it.
In turn, South Carolina withdrew its offer of $111 million in state funding for that particular phase.
The incentives claw back was a rare move for the state. But even with the pull back, AESC’s remaining plant had still been on track to become the largest economic development deal in the Pee Dee region, according to the state Department of Commerce.
The remaining $121 million in bonds and $135 million in grants Commerce offered as an initial incentive to lure AESC to South Carolina are so far unaffected by the shutdown, Commerce spokeswoman Alex Clark.

(Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)Discussions about rising energy costs may have dominated this past Maryland General Assembly session. But even higher bills are on the way.
Beginning June 1, elevated rates took effect for utilities across Maryland, from Baltimore Gas & Electric to Delmarva Power and Pepco. The reasons go back to economics class: low supply and high demand. But who is to blame depends on who you ask.
Ratepayer advocates are quick to point the finger at PJM Interconnection, which operates the power grid in a 13-state region, including Maryland, for policies that have driven rates higher. They argue it has been slow to bring renewable energy projects online, constraining the supply, and it failed to account for skyrocketing demand from data centers.
PJM says it’s been warning of the impending supply crunch since “early 2023,” and that a combination of other market forces are at play — including climate change policy shuttering coal plants.
Years of market changes and policy choices have landed Maryland ratepayers in their current predicament, said Laurel Peltier, chair of the Maryland Energy Advocates Coalition, which focuses on low-income utility ratepayers.
“It’s like a teapot that’s been simmering — and it’s been simmering for a decade,” said Peltier, who is also an AARP Maryland utility advocate.
How much are my bills going up this time?
The exact amount of the increase differs depending on where you live. A report from the Maryland Office of People’s Counsel, released last August, estimated that Delmarva Power households could see a $4 monthly increase, Pepco and SMECO customers could see a $14 increase and Potomac Edison customers could see an $18 increase.
BGE customers would fare the worst, with a $21 jump. But BGE ratepayers got some welcome news last week, when Maryland’s utility regulator, the Public Service Commission, ordered the utility company to spread out the increase, dulling the impact this summer, when bills will already be soaring due to higher energy use, and sharpening the impact in the fall, when bills are typically lower.

As a result, the increase will be $10 to $15 less than expected on customer’s bills from June through August. But from September through November, bills will be $10 to $15 higher than expected, according to Kathy Fueston, a spokesperson for the PSC.
But ultimately, BGE customers will pay the same total amount.
What’s the reason for this latest increase?
The story starts with PJM Interconnection, which runs an annual auction called the capacity market auction, which essentially ensures there is sufficient power during peak times.
Last year’s auction, which covers 2025, cleared at a record high price — an 800% increase compared to the year before, costing ratepayers a total of $14.7 billion in capacity costs, compared to $2.2 billion previously.
PJM blames the shutdown of costly coal and oil plants, and energy demands from data centers and the electrification of homes and cars, among other factors.
“These higher prices are the result of a loss in electricity supply caused primarily by decarbonization policies that have led to an uptick in generator retirements, coupled with an unprecedented spike in electricity demand due largely to the advancement of data centers to power artificial intelligence, the electrification of vehicles and heating systems, and the onshoring of U.S. manufacturing,” wrote Jeffrey Shields, a spokesman for PJM, in a statement.
But Maryland People’s Counsel David Lapp, who represents Maryland ratepayers, argued that PJM is “not being straightforward.”
He argues that power-hungry data centers, largely in Virginia, are the primary reason for the increase in demand. If it weren’t for those facilities, the demand, or load, on the PJM grid might not be increasing at all — even with the rise of EVs and electric heat pumps.




What can customers do to lower their own bills?
Laurel Peltier, who volunteers to provide energy advice to ratepayers in Baltimore, said her first suggestion is always for Marylanders to “know their numbers,” and check their latest utility bill, which often means heading online.
“If it’s telling you that you’re an outlier and you’re using a lot more energy than your neighbors – it’s true,” Peltier said.
Through Maryland’s EmPOWER program, which all customers already pay for with a line item on their utility bills, Marylanders can get a free “quick home energy check.”
“That right there sometimes can alert somebody,” Peltier said. “More than likely what it is, is you have a leaky house and you have an old HVAC system.”
BGE spokesperson Nick Alexopulos said the utility is also trying to advertise energy-saving methods for customers amid the higher rates, everything from the EmPOWER programs to using blinds to keep the sunshine from warming your home during the summer months.
“Our big thing right now is to make sure that customers are aware of ways to save energy,” he said.
Customers who are behind on bills, especially low-income ratepayers, may also be eligible for financial assistance, Alexopulos said.
“The big refrain here is, customers that are struggling to pay their bills, please contact us,” Alexopulos said. “We have these programs and we can help connect them with energy assistance.”
Whether it’s an old refrigerator sitting in the garage, or an energy-gobbling space heater (Peltier recommends an electric blanket instead), Peltier said customers need to think more carefully about their energy use amid climbing rates.
“Make this a priority. Find the low-hanging fruit,” Peltier said.




“Those load forecast changes are really driven by data-center growth,” Lapp said. “There has been very little growth in demand for quite some time, because of efficiency technologies. More efficient light bulbs, that sort of thing.”
It’s true that Maryland fossil fuel power plants are retiring, and this is impacting energy markets, Lapp said. But Lapp lays some of this blame at PJM’s feet.
Faced with a capacity shortage, PJM is requiring two fossil fuel power plants that were going to be retire this year, Talen Energy’s Brandon Shores and H.A. Wagner, to keep operating through 2029. It will cost ratepayers about $145 million annually to keep coal-fired Brandon Shores running and $35 million annually for oil-powered Wagner.
But when it held its annual capacity auction in 2024, PJM did not include the output from the two Talen Energy plants in the mix. That caused prices for 2025 to go up: The Office of People’s Counsel estimates that costs rose $5 billion in the auction because of the exclusion of the two plants.
Since last summer’s auction, PJM has changed its policy, with the approval of federal regulators. The electricity generated from “reliability must-run agreements,” like the ones for Brandon Shores and H.A. Wagner, must be included in the auction.
“Everyone knows that that’s not fair, to require customers to pay twice, and yet, that’s exactly what’s going to happen starting June 1,” Lapp said.
Emily Scarr, a senior adviser at Maryland PIRG who focuses on energy issues, said PJM also should have predicted that coal plants would retire, and it is responsible for planning adjustments to the electric grid accordingly.
“They say it’s a supply and demand imbalance. But what they don’t explain is: ‘Oh, we’re actually the ones who are in charge of controlling supply and demand, and we haven’t done our job,’” Scarr said.
Peltier, the low-income ratepayer advocate, worries about the customers who have been swept up in the recent price hikes, and are now behind on their bills. For instance, BGE recently reported that residential customers were a total of $171 million in arrears, compared to $97 million just last June. In a statement, BGE spokesman Nick Alexopulos cited cold temperatures in January and February 2025, which forced customers to use more energy to heat their homes.
But Republicans in the General Assembly say state policymakers are to blame for the supply shortage, and the resulting rate increases, which they attribute to the state’s policies to reduce carbon emissions. They note that all the state’s coal plants have announced plans to shut down in the years ahead.
“Maryland’s soaring electric rates are not a mystery — they’re a direct result of bad policy choices made by Democratic leaders,” wrote Senate Minority Whip Justin Ready in a recent statement.
“Their obsession with ‘green goals’ has come at the expense of energy reliability and affordability,” Ready wrote. “Now, plants they forced offline are still running because the grid can’t survive without them, and ratepayers are stuck paying hundreds of millions for that mistake.”
Lapp disagrees that Maryland policies played a role. Perhaps some of the blame could be chalked up to federal Clean Air Act policy requiring changes to how plants are operated, he said, but largely, it’s economics.
“Gas is a lot cheaper. Renewables don’t require fuel,” Lapp said. “So, there’s a reason why most of the PJM queue is wind and solar and battery.”
But a backlog in PJM’s queue for new power generation to come online has also influenced the supply curve, Scarr said.

“They’ve created this whole problem themselves, and if they just let clean energy connect, we wouldn’t be in this situation,” Scarr said.
A recent report predicted that Maryland ratepayers could save an average of $546 a year on their electric bills from 2025 to 2040 if PJM implements a laundry list of reforms to clear the bottleneck.
For its part, PJM argues that it is already making a number of reforms to the queue, including a new initiative to expedite “shovel-ready” projects.
In early May, PJM released the list of 51 projects it will expedite through the program, including 22 in Virginia and two in Maryland: a battery storage project in Harford County and an upgrade at a natural gas plant in Prince George’s County.
What happens next?
Lapp and the PSC, backed by 87 Maryland lawmakers, have asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to provide relief from rising rates, by overturning the $5 billion worth of auction costs associated with the Talen Energy deal.
“You just can recalculate the results of the auction, by counting the [Talen Energy] units,” Lapp said. “They could do that quickly.”
A FERC spokesperson declined to comment on when the commission might issue a ruling.
Lapp’s office asked FERC for expedited consideration before June 1. With a decision now coming later than that, Lapp said it’s possible that consumers could receive a future credit on their bills, if FERC rules in his favor.
All Maryland ratepayers are already due to receive a rebate on their utility bills next month. The rebate is estimated at $40 per household, though it depends on a customer’s electricity usage. A second payment is scheduled for January.










It’s like a teapot that's been simmering — and it's been simmering for a decade.

It comes from the Maryland General Assembly, which passed an energy reform package just before it adjourned in April. The total sum, about $200 million, is coming from the Strategic Energy Investment Fund, which is fueled by electricity generators, who submit “alternative compliance payments” when they do not purchase the required amount of renewable energy credits to comply with state law.
But the main thrust of the General Assembly’s energy reforms was increasing power generation and energy storage in the state, by creating streamlined permitting processes for both at the Maryland Public Service Commission. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have highlighted the fact that the state imports more power from other states than it generates within its borders.
Lapp questions whether increasing power generation in the state is needed, especially given that improvements are underway to transmission infrastructure, including to accommodate the eventual closure of Brandon Shores and Wagner.
“The fact that Maryland is a net importer, that’s nothing new, and it’s nothing to be alarmed about, especially because the amount that Maryland imports does not reflect a limitation on Maryland’s ability to generate energy,” he said. “It’s economics.”
He also wonders whether the legislature’s streamlined permitting process at the PSC is a big enough carrot to actually spur significant new power generators to set up shop in Maryland.
“Private companies, they already are able to build plants in Maryland, if the economics work out. So the question there is, does a little easier siting process — Does that change the economics?” Lapp said. “I’m not sure that it will.”

(Photo by Patrick Lohmann / Source NM)The U.S. government’s import taxes could significantly cut the amount of goods coming through New Mexico, and thereby reduce how much money the state government has to maintain its highways, the state transportation agency’s head economist told lawmakers on Thursday.
At the legislative Transportation Infrastructure Revenue Subcommittee’s first interim meeting since this year’s legislative session, New Mexico Department of Transportation Chief Economist Michael Morrison said the tariffs enacted by the Trump administration so far could impact revenues used to pay for road maintenance.
Making it more expensive to import and export goods could shrink the amount of imported goods into the country; reduce the number of commercial vehicles travelling through New Mexico to and from ports; and bring down commercial trucking and diesel fuel tax revenues, according to Morrison’s presentation to the committee.
Two major interstate highways, I-40 and I-10, carry goods from the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach through New Mexico to Texas and other states to the east.
Morrison told the committee he expects a decrease of imports that travel through New Mexico between 3% and 11%, depending on the overall tariff rate. He said he is still developing an estimate for exports.
“Additionally, we expect to see some impacts on national income and New Mexico income that should have ripple effects in terms of lowering our consumption of all goods, which will also reduce weight-distance and diesel taxes,” Morrison told the committee. “There’s less consumption of all goods, less freight.”
That tracks with analysis released Wednesday by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which found that while Trump’s tariffs would decrease the federal government’s deficit, they would also shrink the U.S. economy overall and raise consumer costs.
Trump doubles tariffs on steel and aluminum

Rep. Rod Montoya (R-Farmington) told the committee he is incredulous about the tariffs’ potential impact, called Morrison’s presentation “vast speculation” and said he doesn’t think the tariffs will stay in place long-term.
“It’s interesting to me that we’re doing this level of handwringing over tariffs, when what we’ve seen is from the President going in like he does — and like in his books — negotiating as high as he possibly can, and then getting a deal, and then there’s disruption for a period of time, but then it normalizes.”
Part of why the tariffs haven’t yet resulted in increased prices and empty store shelves is because most retailers and importers planned ahead by rushing orders before the tariffs took effect, Morrison said.
A 20- to 40-day delay occurs as ships travel across the Pacific, so a decision made by importers now won’t show up in freight changes or on store shelves for up to a month or more, he said.
Long before the second Trump administration, the department has been doing less roadwork because its road maintenance budget has stayed flat while construction costs have increased, said Transportation Secretary Ricky Serna.
Money raised from state taxes on gasoline and diesel fuel, vehicle sales and commercial trucking taxes and fees goes into the State Road Fund, which pays for highway maintenance, according to legislative analysts. New construction is paid for using the General Fund, the state government’s largest pot of money.
Morrison projects the State Road Fund’s spending power will decline by 51% by 2050 due to inflation and increased construction costs, while road construction costs in the same period will increase by 160%. The cost of building new roads has tripled since 2003, according to his presentation.

“We’re not hinging the demise of the State Road Fund relative to construction costs on tariffs,” Serna said.
He said the department started shifting to buying American-made aluminum and steel during the Biden administration after the U.S. enacted the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which includes a provision requiring all iron, steel, manufactured products and construction materials used in some infrastructure projects to be produced domestically.
On Tuesday, Trump signed a directive doubling tariffs on steel and aluminum from 25% to 50%.
Also putting a strain on the department’s roadwork efforts was the Legislature’s failure to pass House Bill 145, which would have provided the state Transportation Commission with $1.5 billion in bonding authority to pay for major construction projects.
Serna said the bill would have covered New Mexico’s road construction needs for the next eight to 10 years.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG-0709-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-05 18:04:23.424855

The symbolism, they hope, is the continued momentum around rebuilding the historic but largely abandoned downtown Jackson neighborhood.
Nonprofits 2C Mississippi, Farish Street Community of Shalom, and the city’s urban renewal group, Jackson Redevelopment Authority, held the groundbreaking for a new green space between Amite Street and James Meredith Drive. Organizers see the project as both a communal gathering place as well as a shelter and heat sponge.
“This is a historic moment on Farish Street,” said Dorothy Davis, executive director of the Farish Street Community of Shalom.

The groups first announced the green space project last year, building off a 2020 study they did identifying Jackson’s “heat islands,” or urban areas that are much hotter because they lack tree coverage and bodies of water. The study found that parts of downtown Jackson got up to 10 degrees hotter than outer parts of the city during the summer.
Davis said the project’s next phase will be tearing down brick walls and planting new grass and trees, which she said they’ll start in the next couple of weeks. Volunteers will continue to monitor temperatures over the next five years. Davis added they’ll hope to have a new stage built by early next year and then begin work on an amphitheater.
The groups are funding the project with a $1.5 million grant through the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service. 
The ceremony followed another groundbreaking in April for the Leonard Court project, which will rebuild 67 old homes into new affordable housing in the Farish Street Historical District. That project is set to finish by summer 2026. 
Christopher Pike, executive director of JRA, which owns and will continue to manage the space, said they’ll use the park to host events such as the neighborhood’s annual Juneteenth celebration.
“It’ll just be a park for people to come and hang out,” Pike said. “We’ve been talking to people about maybe doing yoga, that type of stuff. So it’ll be an activated space.
“Obviously there’s an environmental component, which is (tackling the) heat island, but there’s also the quality of life component because most communities you see that are really vibrant have these very activated green spaces.”

Pike teased other new projects in the works along Farish Street: in “eight to 12 months” Pike hopes to have another groundbreaking for the Soul City Market, which includes plans for a food hall, stand-alone restaurants, a Farish Street history museum, and loft apartments on the buildings’ second floors. Pike said the projects would together cost around $30 million, which JRA hopes to fund through both tax credits and rebates as well as private sources.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/05115849/Farish-Street-Green-Commons-1.jpg,,,2025-06-05 18:04:23.424855

(Getty Images)A coalition representing universities, environmental conservation nonprofits and more has released what it says is a roadmap to protecting and conserving waterways in the Ohio River basin.
The 96-page draft plan released Thursday details numerous challenges ranging from industrial and coal mining pollution to the proliferation of invasive species and extreme flooding driven by climate change. 
The report also calls for more funding for water infrastructure and water quality monitoring and for more collaboration among the federal government and local, tribal and state governments. 
Jordan Lubetkin, the senior director of Ohio River restoration at the National Wildlife Federation, during a Thursday press conference said trying to fix “serious and complex environmental problems across vast geographies” is hard, expensive and takes time. 
“This report is premised on a concept that has proven wildly successful in other parts of the country. That is namely, when local, state and tribal governments partner with the federal government to restore large landscapes, good things happen,” Luketkin said. 
The coalition points to coordinated efforts that have worked to restore waters and wetlands such as the Chesapeake Bay, the Everglades, the Great Lakes and Puget Sound as examples of what could be possible. Democratic U.S. Rep. Morgan McGarvey of Louisville introduced a bill last year, co-sponsored by Republican U.S. Rep. Erin Houchin of Southern Indiana, that sought to create a new federal office overseeing the restoration of the Ohio River basin. 
The plan was released by the Ohio River Basin Alliance, the University of Louisville’s Christina Lee Brown Envirome Institute and the National Wildlife Federation but had contributions from hundreds of people across West Virginia, Ohio, Kentucky, Illinois, Tennessee and other states. The plan also pulled feedback from community listening sessions in the Ohio River Basin over the course of 2022 and 2023. 
The problems facing waterways and wetlands across the 204,000 square miles of the Ohio River basin are multifold: Waterways have been altered through the digging of ditches, drainage of wetlands and construction of dams and levees. Wastewater, stormwater and drinking water infrastructure is complex, aging and failing. Pollution into waters comes from acid mine drainage, agriculture, fracking and other industries. 
Ted Smith, director of the Center for Healthy Air, Water and Soil at the University of Louisville’s Christina Lee Brown Envirome Institute, said hundreds of toxic Superfund sites in the Ohio River basin have yet to be fully remediated. 
“We’ve all experienced more extreme weather events, and here in Kentucky we’ve had regular, significant flooding, 100 year floods every few years,” Smith said. Not cleaning up those Superfund sites, he said, puts “the whole water system at significant risk every year.” 
“The future of the country is really going to hang on our ability to address the integrity of these water systems and do it in a way that’s going to work for generations to come,” Smith said.
Despite waters throughout Kentucky and the Ohio River basin already being impaired by pollution, Smith said he’s optimistic that “this is something that can be addressed.” 
The report also notes the need to strengthen and enforce water quality regulations. 
“The failure to update and enforce clean water protections threatens to not only undermine restoration progress (e.g., investing in wetland restoration while allowing wetlands to be filled and destroyed), but also jeopardizes public health, restricts outdoor recreation activities, and suppresses economic growth,” the report states. 
When asked how the current weakening of federal and state water quality regulations played a role in the coalition’s plan, Ohio River Basin Alliance chair Chris Lorentz said “regulations to couple with these recommendations are absolutely necessary.” 
“We’re focusing on showcasing the benefits that these investments will result in and hopefully gain stronger support for tighter regulations,” said Lorentz, a professor of biological sciences at Thomas More University in Northern Kentucky. 
Kentucky state lawmakers passed a law this year that significantly limited the state’s ability to regulate water pollution, and the Trump administration is looking at scaling back oversight of waters and wetlands under the Clean Water Act.
The coalition is seeking public comments on the draft plan through July 7.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2157326213-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-05 18:04:23.424855

Gov. Tim Walz on Thursday said that communication between states and the federal government under the second Trump administration “is nonexistent,” opening the door to catastrophe in the case of a natural disaster or other emergency.
Walz, during an interview with Minnesota Reformer editor Patrick Coolican at a States Newsroom conference in Minneapolis, said that the Trump administration is unprepared for the next disaster — like another global pandemic — and that leaves states particularly vulnerable.
“The flow of information has been disrupted between the states and the federal government, and we just can’t get answers … No one is allowed to talk to us, and that’s really problematic,” Walz said.

The Minnesota governor said the silence from the feds differs from the first Trump administration. At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Walz said then-Vice President Mike Pence would call him every few weeks to check in to see what he needed. He said he sensed Pence would call in “under the radar, so he didn’t draw anybody’s attention.”
“There were a lot of great people inside the first Trump administration that, in spite of the president, were doing good work,” Walz said.
Walz said one of his biggest fears is a cybersecurity attack. The Trump administration has cut millions of dollars for several cyber security initiatives and slashed jobs from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which helps protect the nation’s critical infrastructure.
Walz discussed the role of the states in opposing the Trump administration’s agenda — particularly on immigration — and the Democratic Party’s current malaise.
Minnesota is increasingly reliant on immigrants, who are needed to fill jobs being vacated by an aging workforce. “There’s not a cow in Minnesota that’s not being milked by an immigrant,” he said. Walz said Minnesota would not be commandeered into enforcing immigration law, which he said is a federal duty.










The flow of information has been disrupted between the states and the federal government, and we just can’t get answers … No one is allowed to talk to us, and that’s really problematic.


– Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz


Walz repeated a spiel he’s given around the country, including at a recent Democratic Party event in South Carolina, which has traditionally been early on the presidential primary calendar, fueling speculation that he is considering a presidential run.
He said he’s not running, but merely using his megaphone to help fill a vacuum left by a Democratic Party in disarray.
The governor urged Democrats to figure out how to become the party of the working class again and said Democrats need to “fill all the lanes” in the media environment to reach voters.
“I still have come to the conclusion that Trump fills so much space that you’ve got to fill all these new spaces. Do I think if we would have gone on, you know, Joe Rogan, would we have won? I doubt that, but I also don’t think it hurts,” Walz said. “If your message is good, you want to get out there.”
Walz backed the 2005-06 idea of former DNC Chair Howard Dean and his “50 State Project,” which sought to reach voters in areas not traditionally associated with Democrats.
“We’re probably never going to win Idaho, but … you got to be out there for it,” Walz said.
Walz said Democrats should rotate where they hold the early primary to reach more voters, which may not endear him to Democrats in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, the traditional early states that have long jealously guarded their first in the nation status.
When asked which state should be the first to hold the primary, Walz deadpanned “Minnesota.”

(Larry Palmer/USFWS)Citing a population decline and degraded habitat, South Dakota officials have advanced a plan to halt beaver trapping in the Black Hills for two years.
The plan will block trapping during the 2025 and 2026 seasons in the Black Hills Fire Protection District. Trapping would remain open in the rest of the state. The state legislature’s Rules Review Committee will need to approve the moratorium. 
In 2012, biologists saw 60 food caches — piles of woody vegetation built by beavers for winter — in the Black Hills. By 2023, they recorded only 16. Beavers occupied 52% of Black Hills watersheds in 2012, but just 23% in 2023.
Rodent or riparian restorer: East-west views diverge as state considers beaver protections

Beavers once numbered in the thousands in the Black Hills and the millions nationwide, but their numbers began to decline with the onset of fur trapping by European settlers. Officials said habitat loss, not modern trapping, is to blame for current population declines. But they also said they don’t want trapping to contribute to the problem.
“The limiting factor is habitat degradation,” said John Kanta, section chief with the South Dakota Department of Game, Fish and Parks. 
Only one beaver trapping was reported in the Black Hills last season.
Without beaver dams, faster-flowing water cuts stream channels too deep for beavers to work with. Cattle also trample streambanks, leaving  fewer willow and aspen for beavers to feed on.
A closed trapping season will help protect the beavers that are being reintroduced, officials say. Game, Fish and Parks is working with the U.S. Forest Service and volunteer groups to restore habitat through tree planting and manmade dams, and nuisance beavers from urban areas are being relocated to the improved habitats.
“It’s a wonderful step,” said Hans Stephenson, owner of Dakota Angler & Outfitter in Rapid City and a volunteer for the restoration efforts.

Beaver dams raise the water table, slow water flow, and create habitat that supports everything from aquatic insects to the brown and rainbow trout favored by anglers, Stephenson said.
Alex Solem, senior wildlife biologist with Game, Fish and Parks, emphasized the broader ecological role beavers play. 
“Any time there’s beaver around, usually, it signals a really healthy ecosystem,” Solem said.
If more Black Hills streams had beaver dams, he said, floodplain soils would hold more water, support grazing, mitigate flooding and lessen the dangers of drought and wildfires.
In addition to the moratorium, officials adopted a new threshold-based framework to guide future decisions. Under that framework, trapping season would reopen if  beaver occupancy in monitored watersheds rose above 80%, Occupancy between 50% and 79% would open the door to resident-only, private-land trapping. Levels below 50%, like now, would trigger automatic closure.

Tim Walz speaks June 5, 2025, to a group of States Newsroom journalists meeting in Minneapolis.  (Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Gov. Tim Walz on Thursday said that communication between states and the federal government under the second Trump administration “is nonexistent,” opening the door to catastrophe in the case of a natural disaster or other emergency.
Walz, during an interview with Minnesota Reformer editor Patrick Coolican at a States Newsroom conference in Minneapolis, said that the Trump administration is unprepared for the next disaster — like another global pandemic — and that leaves states particularly vulnerable.
“The flow of information has been disrupted between the states and the federal government, and we just can’t get answers … No one is allowed to talk to us, and that’s really problematic,” Walz said.
The Minnesota governor said the silence from the feds differs from the first Trump administration. At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Walz said then-Vice President Mike Pence would call him every few weeks to check in to see what he needed. He said he sensed Pence would call in “under the radar, so he didn’t draw anybody’s attention.”
“There were a lot of great people inside the first Trump administration that, in spite of the president, were doing good work,” Walz said.
Walz said one of his biggest fears is a cybersecurity attack. The Trump administration has cut millions of dollars for several cyber security initiatives and slashed jobs from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which helps protect the nation’s critical infrastructure.
Walz discussed the role of the states in opposing the Trump administration’s agenda — particularly on immigration — and the Democratic Party’s current malaise.
Minnesota is increasingly reliant on immigrants, who are needed to fill jobs being vacated by an aging workforce. “There’s not a cow in Minnesota that’s not being milked by an immigrant,” he said. Walz said Minnesota would not be commandeered into enforcing immigration law, which he said is a federal duty.
Walz repeated a spiel he’s given around the country, including at a recent Democratic Party event in South Carolina, which has traditionally been early on the presidential primary calendar, fueling speculation that he is considering a presidential run.
He said he’s not running, but merely using his megaphone to help fill a vacuum left by a Democratic Party in disarray.
The governor urged Democrats to figure out how to become the party of the working class again and said Democrats need to “fill all the lanes” in the media environment to reach voters.
“I still have come to the conclusion that Trump fills so much space that you’ve got to fill all these new spaces. Do I think if we would have gone on, you know, Joe Rogan, would we have won? I doubt that, but I also don’t think it hurts,” Walz said. “If your message is good, you want to get out there.”
Walz backed the 2005-06 idea of former DNC Chair Howard Dean and his “50 State Project,” which sought to reach voters in areas not traditionally associated with Democrats.
“We’re probably never going to win Idaho, but … you got to be out there for it,” Walz said.
Walz said Democrats should rotate where they hold the early primary to reach more voters, which may not endear him to Democrats in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, the traditional early states that have long jealously guarded their first in the nation status.
When asked which state should be the first to hold the primary, Walz deadpanned “Minnesota.”

Teitelbaum, who now homeschools her children, said she used to be extremely involved in her child’s school — she was a member of the Parent Teacher Association, worked on a community garden project and developed a food-saving program. She even tried to bring in an FBI agent to teach the children cybersecurity. Eventually, she got frustrated. 
“ It’s not that I don’t want the schools to thrive, I just had to say, at what point do I need to say this is not the best environment for my kids to be in?” she said. 
Teitelbaum was one of a group of homeschooling parents who gathered at the state Capitol Wednesday, where lawmakers and advocates praised them for their successful advocacy against state regulations for homeschooling. They also warned that the battle was not yet won. 
“Homeschool freedom doesn’t mean rejecting traditional schools. It means recognizing that one size does not fit all,” said Rep. Anne Dauphinais, R-Killingly. “We live in a society that champions diversity in almost every area, so why should education be any exception?”
[RELATED: In CT, homeschooling debate heats up as parents plan daily protests at Capitol]
Homeschooling has been a topic of intense debate in Hartford since the Office of the Child Advocate released a report in early May that found withdrawals of children from public schools for homeschooling had been used to hide abuse.
Out of an analysis of about 750 children over the age of 7 who were withdrawn to be homeschooled between 2021 and 2024, about a quarter were in families where there had been at least one report of abuse or neglect accepted by the Department of Children and Families. 
The child advocate recommended that homeschool families be required by law to provide annual documentation of enrollment and that the children be given an independent evaluation on their academic progress each year. 
The report’s release occurred shortly after a case came to light of a Waterbury man who escaped his home after allegedly being held captive by his stepmother for two decades. The man was reportedly withdrawn from public school at around age 11. 
But the parents and advocates said that case had nothing to do with homeschooling, and they pushed back against what they felt was “scapegoating” of their community. Instead, they alleged that the state of Connecticut had failed to properly investigate cases of child abuse. 
“ This pattern of failed police investigations into child abuse by state providers, followed by scapegoating innocent families, must stop. Our lawmakers have failed us on both sides. We urge them to change,” said Sheila Matthews, the co-founder of AbleChild, a nonprofit that advocates against the use of psychotropic medications for children. 
A wide demographic
Peter Wolfgang, the executive director of the Family Institute of Connecticut, said at the press conference Wednesday families who homeschool in Connecticut cut across a wide swath of beliefs, demographics and political parties. 
“ Homeschoolers are atheists, Christians, Democrats, Republicans, Black people, Hispanic people, white people, liberals, conservatives, independents. Every ethnic and socioeconomic group in the state of Connecticut that you can imagine includes within it people who homeschool. And so when you attack the right of parents to homeschool here in the state of Connecticut, you are attacking everybody,” said Wolfgang. 
Families who spoke with The Connecticut Mirror offered a variety of reasons that they decided to homeschool. Some, like Teitelbaum, referenced the coronavirus pandemic. Others cited their children’s struggles in public schools. Some said they disagreed with the public school philosophy. 
Teitelbaum told CT Mirror that one of her daughters had been struggling in school because of complications from Lyme disease, which left her exhausted. She described an incident in which a student wrote something inappropriate in her daughter’s yearbook, and she said the child was never disciplined. And she criticized what she saw as the school’s philosophy of teaching all students at the same level. She said she felt the school didn’t want the parents to be involved in their child’s education. 
Stamford Public Schools spokesperson Kathleen Steinberg said in an email that it was “understandable” that involved parents like Teitelbaum would feel disconnected from the school community during COVID, when access to buildings was limited. She said the student discipline issue, which was confidential, was “handled in accordance with the Board of Education’s discipline policy.” She further said the school worked hard to differentiate instruction based on children’s needs, and that they had developed a new curriculum with this goal in mind in the years since Teitelbaum had left.
Ashley Murcia, a mom of four children ages 12, 11, 7 and 10 months, said she’d always considered homeschooling. The pandemic was the final straw. She said she disagreed with the way in which Gov. Ned Lamont oversaw the coronavirus pandemic in the state, as well as the lack of discretion given to local towns. She also said she felt her local school administration’s view of a parent’s role didn’t match her own. 
“ It was communicated to me very clearly that the administration believed that they owned my child,” she told CT Mirror. 
Mary Owens, a Goshen resident, told CT Mirror that she had always wanted to homeschool her son, who is now 8.
“ He’s been reading since 3, so we know we’re doing something right,” Owens said. 
Owens said the biggest reward of homeschooling was being present for her son’s milestones. When her son learned to read, she said, she burst into tears, startling her son. She reassured him that they were “happy tears.” 
“That was my moment, that I would’ve missed if somebody else taught him,” she said. 
The right to choose
Christina Ghio, the acting child advocate, told CT Mirror in an email that the report’s recommendations were based not on one case, but on two separate reviews of data and individual cases — one in 2018 and one in 2025 — both of which “raised serious concerns.”
“While many people successfully homeschool their children, not every parent who withdraws their child for the stated purpose of homeschooling is, in fact, providing their child with an education. Worse, some take advantage of Connecticut’s complete lack of oversight to isolate children and abuse them,” Ghio said. 
The isolation and the state’s lack of regulation — specifically the lack of required follow-up after a parent informs a school that they’re removing a child for homeschooling — puts children at risk, Ghio said.
“We must address that reality, and we must meet the dual obligation that we have to children: to ensure that they receive an education and that they are safe,” she said. 
Peter Yazbak, spokesperson for the Department of Children and Families, said while homeschooling has been a factor in some cases that DCF has investigated, the department looks at situations on a case-by-case basis when determining whether a child has been neglected or abused. 
He said regardless of what type of school setting a child is in, family, neighbors or teachers who have a “reasonable suspicion” that a child is being abused or neglected should call the department. 
“We believe every parent has the right to choose the setting in which to educate their children. Removing a child from school to be homeschooled does not, in and of itself, constitute neglect,” Yazbak said.
Parents at Wednesday’s press conference, meanwhile, underscored the positive results they’d seen from homeschooling — like strengthened relationships within their families. 
“There is a bond and a connection that the children develop with each other and with me as their mother. That’s the kind of connectivity that stays with you after you leave home. And those are the kinds of bonds and deep ties that we’re really looking for,” Murcia said. 
Parents also praised the flexibility of letting children explore their interests and learn at their own pace. 
Katherine Prescott, a mother of seven children between the ages of 2 and 25, said she had to homeschool each of her children in a different way.
“We learn different ways, we have different interests, and we were created that way because we all have different jobs to do on this planet,” she said. “So when you shove them all into a box and educate them one way, you’re actually — with a wrecking ball — tearing down their destinies.” 
Prescott said that parents were the only ones who would devote themselves completely to their children’s success, and would do so for free. She also said she didn’t like the word “homeschool” — a phrase she said evoked the image of sitting at home — and suggested “life school” as a better term. 
“ This stuff is more applicable when you’re living life and learning it instead of being stuck in a room,” she said, adding that the amount of book work her children do is minor compared to more hands-on education. 
The state legislature chose not to pursue any changes to laws around homeschooling this year. But Republican lawmakers at the press conference warned that regulations could be coming in the future and pledged their support for the homeschoolers. 
Rep. Lezlye Zupkus, R-Prospect, ranking member on the Education Committee said she had heard the legislature might form a committee to look at homeschooling and that she had requested to be on it. 
At a press conference Wednesday morning, Speaker of the House Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said he thought homeschooling would likely come up again during next year’s legislative session. He said whatever bills are brought forward, the public would be welcome to testify.
Rep. Jennifer Leeper, D-Fairfield, co-chair of the Education Committee, told CT Mirror Wednesday that no committee had been formed with the purpose of studying homeschooling, but she expected that lawmakers would talk with homeschooling agencies and other community leaders throughout the summer and fall in order to hear a range of perspectives on the topic.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_9057-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-05 18:04:23.424855

SPRINGFIELD — Minutes before the clock hit midnight and the calendar flipped to June 1, the Illinois Senate advanced a much-watched legislative proposal to reform and fund public transportation in the Chicago area and prevent dire cuts to service.

But Chicago Democrat Sen. Ram Villivalam’s Hail Mary attempt to avoid cuts was downed short of the end zone as opposition mounted to the bill’s revenue plan, particularly its creation of a $1.50 package delivery fee in the state. The House declined to take up the transit funding bill, as the stroke of midnight meant the chamber required a three-fifths majority vote to advance any legislation that would take effect before June 2026.

Chicago’s public transit agencies are now entering an uncertain future. Public hearings on service cuts could begin this summer, but lawmakers say they are dedicated to finding solutions.

“The funding doesn't run out until Dec. 31 of this year,” House Speaker Chris Welch, D-Hillside, told Capitol News Illinois for the latest episode of the “Illinois Lawmakers” program. “We have time, so I think it's important to take our time and get it right.”

The transit agencies will each run out of pandemic relief funding at various points in 2026, creating deficits in their budgets if lawmakers don’t find new funding sources.

Meanwhile, Senate President Don Harmon, D-Oak Park, acknowledged he had reservations about the proposal’s revenue-generating measures, which include the delivery fee as well as a statewide tax on electric vehicle charging and the expansion of a Chicago tax on real estate transfers to the suburbs.

“Frankly, I don't like them all that much,” Harmon said of the revenue measures in an interview with Capitol News Illinois. “I wish there were better alternatives. But if you don't like them, come and tell us how you'd pay for it, because this is going to be expensive and most of the stakeholders seem to be worried about protecting or expanding their own power and having somebody else pay for it.”

The impending cliff

While there’s technically time before the funds run dry, transit agencies say they’re planning next year’s budgets now.

Regional Transportation Authority spokesperson Tina Fassett Smith said in a statement Sunday that agencies will move forward on evaluating their budgets based only on funding that the systems are “confident” they will receive in 2026. Right now, those budgets collectively contain a $771 million shortfall as pandemic relief funds expire.

Both the RTA and Chicago Transit Authority have meetings scheduled next week where talks will presumably focus on how the agencies will maintain a balanced budget in 2026. The RTA previously projected that if lawmakers fail to deliver funding, it would lead to thousands of layoffs and 40% service cuts.

Civic Federation President Joe Ferguson told Capitol News Illinois the end of October appears to be a clearer deadline for legislative action, because the agencies finalize budgets in November.

“This is a sooner-than-later exercise because the closer we get to the next budget cycles of the service boards themselves, the more that this gets driven by doom-and-gloom scenarios – which are correct scenarios – but they’re going to be an effort to drive the revenue imperatives without the reform imperatives,” Ferguson said.

The agencies are federally required to have public hearings before enacting service cuts.

Why reform failed

Both legislative chambers introduced separate plans late in the final week of May, which although similar in many ways, contained key differences showing lawmakers were still apart on a deal. The differences only became more magnified as labor organizations and suburban communities opposed a series of taxes designed to plug the funding shortfall.

That new funding proposal surfaced in the Senate on Saturday afternoon, hours before the legislature was scheduled to adjourn. The plan did away with proposed toll increases and a diversion of sales tax revenue away from collar county governments. Instead, it proposed the new statewide tax on deliveries, and kept a statewide tax on EV charging, as well as suburban taxes on real estate transfers and rideshares.

Lawmakers negotiating the bill had vowed “no funding without reforms,” a pledge they remain committed to, Villivalam told Capitol News Illinois, noting they should be tackled at the same time.

The two chambers are generally in agreement on transit reform, which includes giving new decision-making authority to the RTA to set fares and schedules and renaming the agency to “Northern Illinois Transit Authority.”

But when the adjournment deadline came, the House wasn’t prepared to take up a bill addressing funding even after months of negotiations, Rep. Eva-Dina Delgado, D-Chicago, who is leading transit reform for House Democrats, told Capitol News Illinois.

“We spent hours and hours and hours in negotiation, so our reform bills were very similar,” she said. “What we didn’t spend hours and hours and hours talking about was the revenue.”

Villivalam said the tax increases and other revenue solutions in his plan would raise $1.5 billion – enough to plug the budget hole and fund transit at a level that the RTA says would significantly improve public transportation. But House Democrats didn’t have time to review the funding options.

“Based on my conversations with members, they needed to know more,” Delgado said. “They needed to understand more and, you know, that is now my job is to make sure that whatever revenue plan we come up with, it’s communicated, and people understand what it is.”

Despite facing an uncertain future in the House, Villivalam said the Senate voted on the bill because “we believe in responsible governance, and we believe in avoiding 40% cuts to service and more than 3,000 workers getting layoff notices.”

Reaching a deal to stop cuts

With November being the next pressing deadline for action, lawmakers could return to Springfield for a special session this summer or wait until the annual fall veto session to act on transit reform.

Whenever the General Assembly reconvenes, they will need broader agreement, as the three-fifths vote requirement remains in effect through the calendar year. While the House could still send Villivalam’s bill to the governor’s desk, it passed the Senate on a 32-22 vote – short of three-fifths of the chamber. Several Democrats voted against the plan, foreshadowing the headwinds in the House.

Gov. JB Pritzker hasn’t expressed an opinion on the proposed taxes. He told reporters on Sunday he learned about the taxes at the same time Villivalam unveiled them to the public.

“We were not the leaders of that endeavor, but we were at the table, listening and helping whenever we were asked to,” Pritzker said. “And again, I think there's significant work that will need to be done over the summer and in the fall to make sure that it gets across.""

The tax increases were nonstarters for Republicans, who haven’t proposed their own funding plan – and Democrats don’t need their votes to reach a three-fifths majority.

“We need to look at things holistically and restructure rather than continuously adding more taxes to pay the bills,” House Minority Leader Tony McCombie, R-Savanna, told Capitol News Illinois.

Senate Minority Leader John Curran, R-Downers Grove, told Capitol News Illinois lawmakers should not be depending so much on new taxes.

“We would put out a much more constrained proposal ... there'd be a little more skin in the game on efficiencies and fares, and then we would be coming to taxpayers last in that,” Curran said. “And, quite frankly, we'd be taking a more regional approach on that, and not a statewide approach.”

(Micah Drew/ Daily Montanan)An analysis of Montana’s budget for the 2025-27 biennium showed a 2.1% increase over the previous biennium, the Legislative Fiscal Division reported this week. 
Some members of the state’s legislature said during the session the increase was double-digits, focusing specifically on the general fund, which House Appropriations Chair Llew Jones said was a misrepresentation of the budget.
“Sadly, members of Montana’s Freedom Caucus have been deliberately misleading constituents, citing as much as an 18% increase in our state budget by including General Fund spending from the previous session and transfers to other state funds in their calculations,” Jones said in a press release. “Instead, the total state budget will grow by just over 2% in the next two years, which we accomplished while also giving historic income and property tax cuts to Montana families and small businesses.”
Jones stated the calculations factored in “transfer of General Fund resources to special trusts and the distribution of significant income and property tax reductions” when coming to the 2.1% number. That growth rate is less than inflation, the release noted, an often repeated goal of Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte. 
Some Freedom Caucus members are skeptical about the calculations. Rep. Jerry Schillinger, R-Circle, said an effort had been made to cut certain items out of the budget toward the end of the session to “make it look better” and added that the money would still be spent anyway.
“I just haven’t verified their numbers yet, but I’m highly skeptical of what Representative Jones is talking about,” Schillinger told the Daily Montanan.
The fight over the budget was bitter during the session and a coalition of Democrats and Republicans pushed through the $16.6 billion spending package. Schillinger said some “big government” Republicans, instead of working with fellow conservatives, sought out Democrats to work with instead.
He said this has been happening for several sessions.
“It just came out more and more into the open this session,” Schillinger said.
He added that if the legislature had done its job, Gov. Gianforte, a Republican, wouldn’t have to be spending the time “vetoing all these bills.”
Not all spending bills have been signed or vetoed, meaning the calculations could change depending on spending, the Legislative Fiscal Division analysis stated. Schillinger said that it appeared likely the Governor would also be signing the mega-trust bill discussed heavily near the end of the session. 
HB 924, for example, was touted by Jones as critical money for housing, childcare, and disaster resiliency. It became a touch point for spending hawks in the legislature who repeatedly decried the spending.

Earlier Thursday, they approved Senate Bill 14, which institutes mandatory minimums for fentanyl possession. (Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)The New Hampshire House of Representatives voted, 214-167, Thursday to pass Senate Bill 14, which creates mandatory minimums for fentanyl possession and reduces the penalty for people caught with psilocybin mushrooms.
If enacted, SB 14 would create mandatory minimum sentences for people convicted on fentanyl charges. That includes manufacturing, selling, transporting, or possessing the drug with the intent to sell. People convicted with 20 grams or more of the drug would face at least 3½ years in prison under the bill. People convicted with 50 or more grams would face no less than seven years. There is currently no minimum sentence under state law, which gives judges leeway to decide. There is, however, a maximum of 30 years on the first offense and life imprisonment for repeat offenders. The bill was previously approved by the Senate in February.
“The people asked us for law and order,” Rep. Terry Roy, a Deerfield Republican, said on the House floor. “Let’s give them law and order.”
One Republican lawmaker doubted the bill’s minimums would actually be impactful.
“Twenty grams plus of fentanyl possession is almost certainly gonna be prosecuted as a federal crime,” Rep. Kevin Verville, a Deerfield Republican, said. “The odds of the state actually using this bill when it becomes law is infinitesimally small in my opinion.”
The representative characterized the mandatory minimums as something being done for show.
“You can campaign on law and order on this,” Verville said. “In my opinion, that’s what this is.”
However, the bill was amended on the House floor to add a provision that aligns with one of Verville’s biggest priorities as a legislator. That provision reduces the penalty for possession of psilocybin, a psychedelic drug commonly known as magic mushrooms or shrooms. 
Under the amended bill, possession or use of less than three-quarters of an ounce of psilocybin would be a misdemeanor on first offense as opposed to a felony, which is currently state law under the Controlled Drug Act. Verville is the sponsor of another bill, House Bill 528, that would reduce the penalty to a simple violation. Verville and his colleagues have argued it’s less dangerous than other harder drugs and that it has medicinal benefits such as treatment for PTSD or migraines. 
HB 528 was approved by the House in March. Verville is a vocal proponent of fully legalizing psilocybin, though he has acknowledged he doesn’t believe he can convince enough of his colleagues of that, so he settled for this measure. Verville urged his colleagues to approve SB 14.
“What this bill now has in it is it has real psychedelic reform for the citizens of New Hampshire,” he said. “Compounds that help people beat alcoholism, opioid addiction, other drug addiction, depression, post-traumatic stress syndrome.”
Verville said SB 14 “finally ends a felony charge for simple possession for a small amount of psilocybin,” which he called “an excellent trade.” He also argued that the minimum sentences outlined by the bill were “fairly short.”
“The benefit of the psilocybin far outweighs — far outweighs — any mandatory minimums,” he said. “I’m begging you.”
Eight Democrats joined Republicans to pass the bill, while six Republicans bucked their party to vote against it. Most Democrats were opposed to the legislation.
“I want to be clear, SB 14, like several other bills, is not about crime,” Rep. Linda Harriott-Gathright, a Nashua Democrat, said.
Harriott-Gathright pointed out that fentanyl possession is already illegal and punished severely by law. She, and many of her Democratic colleagues, argued that mandatory minimums were ineffective at hindering crime.
“The question before us today is whether we think adopting mandatory minimums and maximums, an outdated one-size-fits-all solution, is going to be an effective use of taxpayer dollars to address the many substance issues in our state,” she continued. “The bottom line is that our country has already tried that approach. … We all know that it has failed.”
She said the bill “robs judges of their ability to fully consider all relevant facts and circumstances and “undermines basic principles of justice.” She also argued the psilocybin provision was “likely to vanish in committee of conference,” the process where House and Senate members negotiate the differences between their bills.
Because the bill was amended by the House, it will return to the Senate to be reconsidered. The Senate can now either accept the amendment, enter the committee of conference process to hash out its differences with the House, or reject the bill outright.
Enacting the mandatory minimums has been a priority for Gov. Kelly Ayotte, who publicly called on lawmakers to bring the legislation to her desk. A similar bill, Senate Bill 15, would’ve created even harsher minimum sentences for cases where a death was involved.

Tim Walz speaks with Minnesota Reformer Editor in Chief Patrick Coolican in front of States Newsroom leaders and reporters Thursday, June 5, 2025 at the Royal Sonesta in downtown Minneapolis. (Nicole Neri | Minnesota Reformer)Gov. Tim Walz on Thursday said that communication between states and the federal government under the second Trump administration “is nonexistent,” opening the door to catastrophe in the case of a natural disaster or other emergency.
Walz, during an interview with Reformer editor Patrick Coolican at a States Newsroom conference in Minneapolis, said that the Trump administration is unprepared for the next disaster — like another global pandemic — and that leaves states particularly vulnerable.
“The flow of information has been disrupted between the states and the federal government, and we just can’t get answers … No one is allowed to talk to us, and that’s really problematic,” Walz said.
The Minnesota governor said the silence from the feds differs from the first Trump administration. At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Walz said then-Vice President Mike Pence would call him every few weeks to check in to see what he needed. He said he sensed Pence would call in “under the radar, so he didn’t draw anybody’s attention.”
“There were a lot of great people inside the first Trump administration that, in spite of the president, were doing good work,” Walz said.
Walz said one of his biggest fears is a cybersecurity attack. The Trump administration has cut millions of dollars for several cyber security initiatives and slashed jobs from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which helps protect the nation’s critical infrastructure.
Walz discussed the role of the states in opposing the Trump administration’s agenda — particularly on immigration — and the Democratic Party’s current malaise.
Minnesota is increasingly reliant on immigrants, who are needed to fill jobs being vacated by an aging workforce. “There’s not a cow in Minnesota that’s not being milked by an immigrant,” he said. Walz said Minnesota would not be commandeered into enforcing immigration law, which he said is a federal duty.
Walz repeated a spiel he’s given around the country, including at a recent Democratic Party event in South Carolina, which has traditionally been early on the presidential primary calendar, fueling speculation that he is considering a presidential run.
He said he’s not running, but merely using his megaphone to help fill a vacuum left by a Democratic Party in disarray.
The governor urged Democrats to figure out how to become the party of the working class again and said Democrats need to “fill all the lanes” in the media environment to reach voters.
“I still have come to the conclusion that Trump fills so much space that you’ve got to fill all these new spaces. Do I think if we would have gone on, you know, Joe Rogan, would we have won? I doubt that, but I also don’t think it hurts,” Walz said. “If your message is good, you want to get out there.”
Walz backed the 2005-06 idea of former DNC Chair Howard Dean and his “50 State Project,” which sought to reach voters in areas not traditionally associated with Democrats.
“We’re probably never going to win Idaho, but … you got to be out there for it,” Walz said.
Walz said Democrats should rotate where they hold the early primary to reach more voters, which may not endear him to Democrats in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, the traditional early states that have long jealously guarded their first in the nation status.
When asked which state should be the first to hold the primary, Walz deadpanned “Minnesota.”

(Photo by Patrick Lohmann / Source NM)Federal prosecutors this month charged fewer people for allegedly trespassing on the newly established military base along New Mexico’s border with Mexico, according to a Source New Mexico review of federal court records.
Over the last two months or so, 570 people have been charged for “unauthorized entry” into what is now effectively a military base along the border, Source’s review shows. On April 15, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum announced the transfer of land from the Bureau of Land Management to the military, effectively making the 180-mile border New Mexico shares with Mexico into an extended military base tied to Fort Huachuca in Arizona. 
Along with empowering the United States Army to patrol the border and temporarily detain people they found, the transfer exposed people arrested to a new criminal charge of unauthorized entry, a misdemeanor punishable by up to a year in jail. The area transferred to the military is a little more than 400 square miles, minus state and private land, running roughly along the New Mexico Panhandle and south of Highway 9 before Hachita. 
Prosecutors announced the new type of criminal charge in late April and began filing charging documents soon after, with as many as 58 people facing the new misdemeanors in a single day in early May. 
But the charges quickly proved vulnerable to legal challenges based, partly, on whether people knew they were illegally entering a military base. The military has posted small warning signs in English and Spanish along the northern and southern borders of the so-called National Defense Area that entry is prohibited.
On May 14, a federal judge dismissed more than 100 of the charges, after federal public defenders raised the issue on behalf of their clients. 
The dismissals coincided with a one-day dip in the number of unauthorized entry charges being brought, according to Source’s review. The number of daily charges picked up again before beginning to decline early this month.
Since May 30, just 11 people have been charged with unauthorized entry, according to federal filings.
The reason for the decrease is unclear, including whether it’s because fewer people are crossing or whether federal prosecutors have changed their strategy. Tessa Duberry, a spokesperson for the office, did not respond to a request for comment on the decrease. 
In addition to the judge’s dismissals, the U.S. Attorney’s Office dismissed at least three of its own unauthorized entry charges due to confusion about where the boundaries of the NDA lie. 
Confusion reigns in New Mexico’s militarized border zone

Meanwhile, the Army has warned hunters and hikers that they could be prosecuted if they enter the area, but per an informal agreement, ranchers can drive past the signs without issue as they tend to cattle they graze on former BLM land they lease in the NDA.
Public defenders are also challenging the charge in a couple of individual cases, including one instance in which the charging documents suggest the arrestee was picked up in Arizona, and another involving a citizen of Uzbekistan who, her attorneys argue, didn’t read or speak English or Spanish and therefore couldn’t have known she was entering a restricted area. 
U.S. Rep. Gabe Vasquez (D-NM) this week questioned Army Secretary Daniel Driscoll in a Congressional committee hearing, saying widespread confusion exists about who can enter the area and “where the boundaries of this military zone actually start and where they end.”
Driscoll said the Army would work on improving signage and communication with people in the area and members of Congress. 
“The army is working incredibly hard with our soldiers to put out signage. We have taken it over recently,” he responded.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_9645-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-05 17:09:22.686927

(Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – Passenger rail service between Oklahoma City and Fort Worth is expected to end on or before Oct. 1, transportation officials said Thursday.
The announcement comes after the Texas Legislature declined to continue funding for its share of the 206-mile route. 
The Heartland Flyer is jointly funded by Oklahoma and Texas.
The service, operated by Amtrak, was reestablished in 1999 after ending in 1979.
In a statement Thursday, Amtrak said the Heartland Flyer faces imminent suspension no later than Oct. 1 unless Texas secures its share of funding. 
A more specific suspension date is expected to be announced later.
“Reliable rail service provides a vital transportation option for residents and visitors alike, strengthening regional mobility, economic development, and tourism,” said Amtrak President Roger Harris. “With service that supports Texas’ continued economic growth and the region’s connectivity, sustaining the Heartland Flyer is essential to maintaining momentum and ensuring long term mobility in the region.”
The Heartland Flyer makes stops in Oklahoma City, Norman, Purcell, Pauls Valley, Ardmore, Gainesville and Fort Worth.
“The Heartland Flyer is key to ensuring Fort Worth’s continued success as a global destination and is central to the city’s tourism industry, business community, and thriving economy,” said Fort Worth Mayor Mattie Parker. “Fort Worth is the busiest Amtrak station in Texas – generating millions in economic impact annually – and as people continue to move to our region, travel reliability, mobility choices, and connectivity will be key to our competitiveness.”
Gainesville Mayor Tommy Moore said he believed a solution could be found to keep the service.
“I’ll keep fighting to make sure this critical service stays in place for years to come,” Moore said. 
Officials had been planning on extending the route into Newton, Kansas, to link to the Southwest Chief between Chicago and Los Angeles.
Suspension of the Heartland Flyer would impact expansion efforts, said a spokesman for the Kansas Department of Transportation.

(Screenshot from livestream)Arkansas PBS would lose $2.5 million in programming and operational funds if President Donald Trump’s desired cuts to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting come to fruition, interim executive director Sanji Kumpuris told the network’s governing board at its quarterly meeting Thursday.
Trump’s Tuesday proposal calls on Congress to eliminate $1.1 billion from the entity that provides funding for National Public Radio and the Public Broadcasting Service. Lawmakers have 45 days from Tuesday to consider the request.
In the meantime, Kumpuris told the Arkansas PBS Commission, the agency should formulate a plan in case it loses 22% of its total funding.
“We will have to adjust and figure out what that means to us and tell you guys, ‘This is what it means as far as the services we offer without having that [money],’” Kumpuris said.
About half of the at-risk $2.5 million community service grant goes toward purchasing PBS programs to air, 30% of which is chosen by PBS’ national headquarters, and the other half covers operational expenses, such as running the public media network’s Conway studio and its statewide emergency weather alert system, Kumpuris said.
The commission has requested but not yet scheduled a meeting with Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders and her senior staff “to discuss and brainstorm what the future of PBS is,” Chairman West Doss said.
“[Kumpuris] and staff have some ideas, but we felt like we might need to run it by the governor first,” Doss said.
Commissioners select interim Arkansas PBS director

The commission chose Kumpuris as interim executive director in May, succeeding Courtney Pledger. Kumpuris is Arkansas PBS’ education director and production director.
After an executive session, the commission voted Thursday to grant Kumpuris the minimum executive director salary of $155,000 as of July 1.
The network’s planned nationwide search for a permanent director is still getting underway, Doss said. The headhunting firms PBS’ national office has recommended are “too expensive for us right now,” but the network plans to advertise the job opening in “several national boards and publications,” he said.
“We’re not exactly sure how we’re going to handle it right now, but we’re still researching it,” Doss said.

Greg VanWoerkom (R-Norton Shores) raises concerns on delays in the rollout of a new state unemployment insurance system during a June 5, 2025 meeting of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on General Government. | Kyle DavidsonAs state agencies collaborate with contractors to craft a replacement to Michigan’s outdated unemployment insurance system, individuals overseeing the effort offered an update on their progress, with plans to begin rolling out the system before the end of the year.
The subject of those enhancements to the system were up for discussion Thursday before the House Appropriations Subcommittee on General Government.
Testifying before the committee was Brett Gleason, chief of staff with the Michigan Unemployment Insurance Agency, who noted the current system is more than 10 years old and has placed limits on the agency’s ability to adapt, support self-service, detect fraud and use data effectively.
The agency selected the tech and strategy consulting firm Deloitte to lead the project in November of 2022, with the project costs estimated at $78 million, according to a report from the Detroit Free Press. Work on the project launched in May 2023, with the first component of the project expected to go live on Sept. 30, 2024.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXDavid Parent, a managing partner of Deloitte, told the subcommittee on Thursday that while the project had faced challenges with management, scope and technology, the service for employers is expected to launch in December with the claimant side of the program rolling out in May 2026.
As of Tuesday, test cases in the new system were passing at a 97% rate, Parent said, with the part of the system set to go live in May logging an 88% pass rate, Parent said.
With the project set to launch 14 months later than initially promised, members of the committee pressed Parent and members of the Unemployment Insurance Agency and the Michigan Department of Technology, Management and Budget on why the state requested an additional $20 million for the project despite the delays.
Gleason explained that the state pays roughly $2.5 million a month to maintain the old system, and that the costs for maintaining the old system had been higher than anticipated due to the project delays. As a result, the additional $20 million would be used to maintain the current system and to cover costs for independent verification and validation services on the new system.
With the Unemployment Insurance Agency paying out an estimated $8.5 billion in fraudulent claims during the COVID-19 pandemic, Rep. Greg VanWoerkom (R-Norton Shores) voiced concern, saying the delays had cost the state millions and put its unemployment safety net at risk.
Gleason said the state has pursued an aggressive timeline in crafting and implementing the new system, and that the project still fell within the four to six year timeline that is typical in putting new systems like this in place.
Laura Clark, the chief information office for DTMB, also noted the new system was expected to save the agency $5 million annually.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_3038-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-05 17:09:22.686927

Kim Reynolds, joined by lawmakers, business owners and Iowa Workforce Development staff, signed into law a bill reducing the taxable wage base for Iowa's unemployment insurance system at U.S. Erectors in Pleasant Hill June 5, 2025. (Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds has signed into law a bill cutting the taxable wage base for Iowa’s unemployment insurance system, one of her goals from the 2025 legislative session.
The governor held a bill signing event Thursday for Senate File 607, at U.S. Erectors in Pleasant Hill, one of the businesses she said the new law is intended to help. The measure, which goes into effect July 1, will cut in half the taxable wage base used in collecting unemployment insurance taxes, from 66.7% to 33.4%. It also modifies employer contribution rates and excludes wages from the unemployment insurance system’s definition of “taxable wages” paid by employers when the employees work in another state in cases where reciprocity applies.
“It’s a signature piece of legislation, one of my top priorities this session, and a key part of our ongoing efforts make Iowa’s economy stronger, more competitive and built for the future,” Reynolds said.
Reynolds said the changes are “long overdue,” saying Iowa’s unemployment insurance taxes have “needlessly over-collected from our businesses” for years. With $1.95 billion in the Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund, the governor said Iowa had the ninth largest unemployment trust fund in the country despite being 32nd in state population.
By lowering the amount employers pay into the fund, Reynolds said businesses are projected to save nearly a billion dollars over the next five years. U.S. Erectors, which hosted the event, is projected to keep $85,000 in the next year due to the change, she said.
Brad Churchill, CEO and co-founder of U.S. Erectors, thanked Reynolds for moving the measure forward, saying it “provides meaningful relief to employers across Iowa, while maintaining a full scope of benefits for employees for their time of need.”
“Early projections and estimates are that the bill would generate the savings of up to $800 million for businesses statewide,” Churchill said. “For companies like ours, those savings can be reinvested directly into our workforce through hiring, wage increases, purchasing of new equipment and expanding our facilities for growth.”
While supporters of the bill said the new law is correcting overpayments into the Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund, Democrats argued the change will mean less money is available to help Iowans when they lose their job, tying it during floor debate on the measure to other changes made to Iowa’s unemployment system in recent years.
Rep. Daniel Gosa, D-Davenport, said in a statement Thursday the change is providing more money to employers who cut jobs in Iowa.
“While Iowa families struggle and Iowa’s economy ranks dead last, Gov. Reynolds and Republican lawmakers are handing out a $1 billion tax break to big corporations, paid for by raiding funds meant for laid-off workers,” Gosa said. “In 2022, Iowa Republicans slashed unemployment from 26 weeks to 16. Now they’re handing out tax breaks to corporations that lay off workers and ship jobs overseas. Iowa workers shouldn’t be footing the bill for corporate tax breaks.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/reynolds6.5.1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-05 17:09:22.686927

Ron DeSantis suspended Osceola County Sheriff Marcos Lopez from office on Thursday shortly after he was arrested on felony charges of racketeering and conspiracy to commit racketeering.
Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier’s Office of Statewide Prosecution charged Lopez and four other individuals in a “massive Central Florida gambling operation,” according to a press release issued by the attorney general’s office.
“Initially engaging the operation for campaign contributions and personal payments, Sheriff Lopez played a multifaceted role in expanding and protecting this illegal enterprise, using his office to shield the enterprise from law enforcement,” the release said.
DeSantis has appointed Christopher Blackmon to take over the Osceola County Sheriff’s Department. Blackmon has been serving as the Central Region Chief for the Florida Highway Patrol since November 2023 , and before that served as a troop commander and major in the FHP. Between 2007-2016 he worked as a resident security agent for Major League Baseball, according to his LinkedIn account.
Lopez began serving in the Osceola County Sheriff’s Department in 2003 while he was still serving in the U.S. Navy Reserve. He rose up the ranks before ultimately being elected sheriff in 2020, becoming the first Hispanic in Osceola County to do so. A Democrat, he was re-elected last fall.
There had been scandals under Lopez’s tenure, including a 2022 sheriff deputies’ killing of a man who drove a car carrying two passengers accused of shoplifting $46 in pizza and Pokemon cards. A grand jury report later said the killing could have been avoided if not for their faulty judgement and their department’s “poorly crafted policies on the use of appropriate force in response to minor crimes,” the Orlando Sentinel reported.
Lopez also ended up agreeing to pay a $250 fine last December in a plea deal with then-State Attorney Andrew Bain for inadvertently posting a photo on social media of a crime victim who was a minor. That later led Bain to add Lopez’s name to his office’s Brady Identification System, which lists the names of law enforcement officers who have a history of misconduct.
The AG’s press release says a multi-agency investigation led by Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) and joined by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement began looking into Lopez and his associates starting in 2023. The investigation ultimately uncovered “a criminal organization operating an illegal gambling enterprise throughout Central Florida, particularly in Lake and Osceola Counties.”
Lopez and his associates ran a lottery, slot machines, and a “gambling house out of a business known as Fusion Social Club,” according to the charging document filed in Florida’s Fifth Judicial Circuit. The alleged criminal operation generated $21.6 million in profits, according to the AG’s office.
According to an official with the Lake County Jail, Lopez is being held without bond pending a June 30 arraignment.

Phil Murphy announces a plan to give ratepayers $100 minimum to defray a sudden, sharp increase in electricity prices in Newark on June 5, 2025. (Courtesy of the governor’s office)New Jersey will send ratepayers at least $100 to defray the impact of a steep rise in electricity prices that took effect this month, top Democrats announced Thursday.
The $430 million program, which is not yet approved by state energy regulators, would provide each of the state’s 3.9 million ratepayers with $100, with an additional $150 for low- and moderate-income residents.
“We’re taking this step today because the fact is the people of New Jersey are being battered by the rising cost of energy, and by the way, this is not unique to New Jersey,” Gov. Phil Murphy said at a press conference in Newark. “You can look all around the country right now, and certainly all around this region to see that we are not alone. Wholesale electricity prices are up multiples of what they were even a year ago today.”
Christine Guhl Sadovy, president of the state Board of Public Utilities, suggested residents enrolled in the state’s winter termination program would be eligible for the $150 payment. That program bars utility shutoffs between Nov. 15 and March 15.
Officials were deliberating a second $100 payment but had not reached a decision as of Thursday afternoon, Murphy said.
It was not immediately clear when or how the benefits would be paid. Murphy suggested they could come in September or October but cautioned that the timeline is hazy as the aid still needs approval from the Board of Public Utilities, whose next meeting is set for June 18.
Lawmakers’ announcement comes just days after electricity prices rose by roughly 20% at the start of June, pushed upward by the results of price-setting auctions held in July and February, and as hot weather pushed temperatures to roughly 90 degrees in much of the state Thursday.
It also comes as all 80 seats in the state Assembly — which Democrats control by a 52-28 majority — are on the ballot in the fall (the primaries are on Tuesday).
Funding for the payments would come from the state’s Clean Energy Fund, the state’s share of Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative money, and the Solar Alternative Compliance Payment, which is paid by electricity suppliers that are unable to meet the state’s renewables standard.
Some progressive groups took exception to the funding sources.
“We appreciate that the governor and lawmakers are taking seriously the strain high energy costs place on families, but how we deliver relief matters. Diverting funds from RGGI and the Clean Energy Fund risks weakening the very programs that lower long-term costs, strengthen our grid, and create local jobs,” said Alex Ambrose, a policy analyst for New Jersey Policy Perspective.
The price of electricity rose sharply after being roughly level for more than a decade as supply tightened and demand shot upward, driven higher by power-hungry artificial intelligence data centers proposed throughout the footprint of PJM Interconnection, the grid operator for New Jersey, 12 other states, and the District of Columbia.
Democrats have blamed PJM for the price spike, charging yearslong delays in its interconnection queue had depressed supply by leaving projects, including 79 in New Jersey, without a line into the grid.
“We in the Legislature have a tone of outrage that New Jersey is being held hostage,” Sen. John Burzichelli (D-Gloucester) said.
Murphy said he and legislative leaders would meet with PJM CEO Manu Asthana next week.
Republicans have blamed the Murphy administration’s renewables-heavy energy plan and the sunsetting of some existing fossil fuel plants for the increases. They and some Democrats have said the state should pursue a more diverse energy mix to stall further price hikes.
“It simply delays the pain to avoid political fallout in an election year,” Sen. Tony Bucco (R-Morris), his chamber’s minority leader, said of the plan announced Thursday. “This is not relief, it’s a cover-up. Trenton Democrats are once again trying to deflect the consequences of their own failed energy policies.”
Legislators and regulators are considering other methods of reining in energy prices. The Board of Public Utilities is fielding proposals that could delay electricity price increases, leaving ratepayers with deferred balances they would be responsible for paying later.
Guhl-Sadovy declined to comment on the status of that proposal or the effect Thursday’s announcement would have on it.
In recent weeks, legislators have advanced bills that would change how state regulators set utilities’ profit margins, require they study data centers’ impact on energy rates, and create a new rate-setting process for data centers, among others.
“Like so many states across the country, we recognized early on that the rates would not be sustainable, more importantly, that they just certainly weren’t fair. That’s why we went to work,” said Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin (D-Middlesex).",https://newjerseymonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/54569953460_0e5b86ab66_c.jpg,,,2025-06-05 17:09:22.686927

Wyoming approved the location anyway.,Mike Koshmrl,,,,,https://wyofile.com/state-biologists-warned-of-wildlife-conflicts-at-proposed-shooting-complex-site-wyoming-approved-the-location-anyway/,"

Crucial mule deer range and sage grouse core habitat caused wildlife managers to ask that the large commercial operation be relocated, but the requests, which haven’t been discussed publicly, have had little bearing on plans so far.
The post State biologists warned of wildlife conflicts at proposed shooting complex site. Wyoming approved the location anywa[...]","When a task force of lawmakers and appointed citizens decided last summer where best to locate a state-funded destination shooting facility, they chose a picturesque 3-square-mile tract of state land nestled into the Absaroka Range foothills. Their rationale, in part, was that the site evoked wild Wyoming. 
Rolling hills blanketed in sagebrush, the location is home to elk, mule deer, pronghorn and sage grouse, among other species. It boasts spectacular views of high peaks leading to the Yellowstone plateau and, off to the east, the Bighorn Basin. Bisected by Sulphur Creek, the site feels like it’s in the middle of nowhere despite being just an 8-mile drive from Cody. 
Those same attributes concerned Wyoming’s wildlife managers, according to an agency review of the proposal acquired by WyoFile through a Wyoming Public Records Act request. 
Seven days before the 12-member task force voted 8-4 in favor of the location, the Wyoming Game and Fish Department issued a memo that effectively recommended the complex go elsewhere. Specifically, Habitat Protection Supervisor Will Schultz asked that it be moved outside of “core” sage grouse habitat and “crucial” range for struggling mule deer, which exhibited “high use” of the site throughout the year according to GPS collar data. Pronghorn and elk also used the 2,036-acre property, which is slated for development into a world-class shooting operation, and is expected to draw gun enthusiasts from far and wide.

“Ground-disturbing activities and extensive human presence can result in the disturbance or displacement of wintering big game and loss of habitat, potentially impacting the viability of local populations,” stated the July 15, 2024 letter signed by Schultz.
One week later, the state agency’s concerns surfaced shortly before the task force voted.
“Is this cleared for that wildlife aspect?” Republican Rep. Pepper Ottman of Riverton asked her fellow members. “It looks to me as though that is still a concern. What would that look like, to alleviate that concern? I’m not sure. That is of grave concern.”
Nobody attempted to answer the questions.
‘Of grave concern’
Ottman, who’s no longer on the task force voted with the minority for the runner-up site, near Gillette. She told WyoFile in an interview that she asked about the wildlife concerns because she wanted to get ahead of them — and wants the Wyoming State Shooting Complex to be successful. 
“I’m going to support the decisions that were made,” Ottman said. 
No one other than Ottman, including the agency itself, raised Game and Fish’s wildlife concerns with the Cody site to the committee. Nor did the state agency’s review of the alternative Campbell County site, which detailed far fewer concerns with wildlife, make much of an appearance in the debate. Publicly, there has been little to no discussion about requests to avoid the crucial mule deer range and the Oregon Basin sage grouse core area, or of any other wildlife-friendly guidance that’s been issued for the Park County shooting complex site, where construction crews could break ground as soon as July.

Powell resident Greg Mayton, who spent 14 years working for Wyoming Game and Fish, said that the wildlife concerns were minimized because of a “top-down push” that has kept the agency’s Cody Region personnel muzzled. 
“It wouldn’t look good,” Mayton said, “if Game and Fish was against this site.”
WyoFile’s attempts to talk with regional personnel were not successful — an in-person inquiry at the Cody office in early May prompted a phone call from the agency’s Cheyenne headquarters.

An avid hunter, Mayton is among the few Park County residents who’ve spoken out against the shooting complex. The former aquatic invasive species biologist has spent ample time hunting elk and mule deer and looking for shed antlers on the selected state land, which abuts a much larger expanse of Bureau of Land Management property west of Highway 120 between Cody and Meeteetse. He feels local residents have to unfairly subsidize a commercial enterprise they might not want in the first place. 
“We have to pay for it three times,” Mayton said. “Through county money I’m paying to build the road, through Game and Fish dollars, and then through all the state tax dollars.” 
Wildlife managers were more forward about their concerns earlier in the Park County site-selection process, according to Andy Quick, a former Cody town councilor. 
“They were going to pursue a different area north of town [near Skull Creek] that was really a bad idea,” Quick said. “That was a designated elk partition area. The Game and Fish was a little more vocal about that one.” 
An event center associated with the Wyoming State Shooting Complex has been tentatively slated where the yellow star is located on this map. The large facility will include an information center, retail shop, ATV and firearm rental, administrative offices, classrooms, shooting area, archery and air rifle range and more. (Park County)

Like Mayton, Quick isn’t a fan of planned commercial operation, which the Wyoming Legislature funded to the tune of $10 million last session. The allocation required some last-minute maneuvering after the supplemental budget, which included funding for the complex, unexpectedly died. 
“It’s just going to fracture more habitat and it’s just one more step in the wrong direction, as far as I’m concerned,” Quick told WyoFile. “I think recreation and hunting are also going to lose out. I know that the state land can be managed as de facto private land, which is inherently a problem in and of itself.” 
“It’s just going to fracture more habitat and it’s just one more step in the wrong direction.”Andy quick
There’ve been several more visible scuffles of late over industrial and commercial use of state lands. Those include opposition to a gravel pit just outside of Casper, a lawsuit over a commercial wind farm in Converse County and a fight over a glamping operation at the foot of the Tetons that has spurred calls for reform and possibly legislation. 
The Wyoming State Shooting Complex has so far advanced with comparatively little controversy, at least in public. Quick, the former Cody town councilor, said that he was well in the minority among local elected officials. 
“I was probably the only one that was against it,” he said. 
A defense
Former Park County Commissioner Lee Livingston, who works as a big game outfitter, championed the project. He helped shepherd it through the county board, and was a part of the county working group that helped prepare a 241-page proposal pitching a complex south of Cody. Livingston told WyoFile in May that Game and Fish gave the location the “green light.”
“I think anywhere you go in Wyoming, you can call it habitat,” Livingston said. “Overall, I think it’s probably about the best location it can be in that Cody area.” 
Other project proponents made similar contentions. Nephi Cole, a Sheridan-based lobbyist for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, said it’s hard to find a location in Wyoming that doesn’t have wildlife impacts. He also expressed hope that species would adjust to the gunfire, infrastructure and human activity likely soon to be added to the Absaroka foothills.
“Other large ranges, they’re typically fairly non-invasive, believe it or not, for wildlife,” Cole said. “They accustomize to it, they don’t view it as a hindrance. You end up getting deer, antelope and elk all over ranges, to the extent you have to move them for competitions to make sure that they’re not around targets.”

Baggs Republican Sen. Larry Hicks, whose 2023 legislation spearheaded state planning and funding for a Wyoming State Shooting Complex, said he has witnessed the harmony between wildlife and recreational shooting at Colorado’s Cameo Shooting Complex. 
“They got bighorn sheep, mule deer on the shooting range,” Hicks said. “Chukars all over the place.” 
Hicks expects something similar in Park County. Long-range shooting on the state site’s west end — there are plans for mile-long targets — are “probably going to have almost no impact” on wildlife, he said.   
“That’s not going to be an everyday, ongoing type of activity,” he said. “Seasonal use makes a difference. We can work around some of that just by event scheduling. We’ve got to put together a mitigation plan.”

Glenn Ross, who chairs the Wyoming State Shooting Complex Joint Powers Board, said that Wyoming’s concerns about wildlife impacts have been considered from the get-go and baked into the plans. 
“Our planning with our site has been making every attempt to be wildlife friendly,” Ross told WyoFile.  
Wildlife impacts, he said in a follow-up email, were a “primary consideration” in selecting the more southern Park County site before the local working group submitted its formal application to the state in June 2024. That proposal does include some wildlife-focused plans. 
For example, core sage grouse habitat, which covers about a square mile of the site, would receive “minimum development” to avoid exceeding the 5% threshold authorized by Wyoming’s policy for the embattled bird, which is particularly sensitive to noise.

Mule deer, whose designated “crucial” range covers almost the entire 2,036-acre site, would be accommodated by adjusting management west of a ridgeline during the winter, “minimizing the overall impact.” 
“Mule deer, although quite adaptive to human presence, still need areas of shelter and forage in the critical winter months,” Park County’s application stated.
Elk and pronghorn, meanwhile, would be encouraged to stick around. “Because having these species on site can be of tremendous value to our customers, the complex will recognize that value and work to operate the facility in harmony with these species,” the planning document reads. 
Next steps unclear
A month before a likely groundbreaking — Ross expects to receive the $10 million authorized by the Legislature in July — it’s unclear what actually will be required to minimize harm to wildlife along 3-plus square miles of the Absaroka front. 
Although wildlife managers’ site review of the Park County location is printed on Wyoming Game and Fish Department letterhead and addressed to an outside legislative task force, the document was described as “internal department correspondence” when it was conveyed to WyoFile via a records request. It’s not considered an “official project letter,” Game and Fish officials said. 
“We have not submitted any formal comments on the Cody shooting complex,” Wyoming Game and Fish Chief Warden Dan Smith told WyoFile. “And we haven’t been requested for any [comments].”
The Office of State Lands and Investments will decide whether Game and Fish formally comments, he said. 
“It’s up to them,” Smith said, “whether they request us to make comments on their project.”

Because the Wyoming State Shooting Complex is set to occupy state trust land, the permitting authority is the Office of State Lands and Investments. Its oversight board, the State Board of Land Commissioners, has already approved the Cody complex, according to Melissa DeFrantis, a public information officer for the state agency. 
“They’ve approved going forward with it,” DeFrantis said. “We will take the lease to them once it’s complete.” 
The State Board of Land Commissioners consists of Wyoming’s five statewide elected officials: Gov. Mark Gordon, Superintendent of Public Instruction Megan Degenfelder, Secretary of State Chuck Gray, Treasurer Curt Meier and Auditor Kristi Racines.
Until the board approves the lease, the draft version and its contents — such as wildlife stipulations — are not considered public information, DeFrantis said.
“We don’t know what the negotiations may be,” she said. “A draft, it really wouldn’t benefit you right now.”

The Office of State Lands and Investments had a different interpretation of what triggers a formal Wyoming Game and Fish Department project letter. Those are typically prepared by default for state land leases, DeFrantis said. 
But DeFrantis also said she was unaware if Game and Fish would formally review the Wyoming State Shooting Complex’s lease near Cody. 
“I can’t say, I’m not drafting the lease,” she said. “But I can say that that’s generally the process, and I don’t know why we would avoid that.” 
The Office of State Lands and Investment’s lead on the project, Cody Booth, did not return a phone call requesting an interview. 
If Wyoming Game and Fish does proceed with a formal review and the requested stipulations mirror those in its existing site review, the Wyoming State Shooting Complex could be saddled with significant restrictions that inhibit its construction and operations.

Because the project isn’t being moved outside of the core sage grouse area, construction and development “should not occur” between March 15 and June 30 in that designated core habitat and within 2 miles of a nearby non-core area lek, according to Game and Fish’s existing guidance.
Furthermore, Game and Fish asked shooting complex proponents to develop “a noise mitigation plan” so gunfire doesn’t compromise an occupied core-area lek that’s three-quarters of a mile south of the complex.
“Research has indicated that the declines in male lek attendance in response to increased noise are immediate and sustained,” the state’s letter stated. “Further, sage grouse do not appear to habituate to increased noise levels over time.” 
Crucial year-round range used by the Upper Shoshone Mule Deer Herd could impact shooting complex operations even more if requested wildlife stipulations are heeded. The herd has struggled mightily: The estimated 6,850 deer in the herd fall more than 40% short of the herd’s 12,000-animal population target, according to Game and Fish’s latest assessment. 
Because the complex wasn’t relocated outside the “crucial” deer range, which overlapped almost the entire site, Game and Fish’s instruction was to “avoid ground-disturbing activities and extensive human presence” from Nov. 15 to April 30. Mule deer-friendly practices, in other words, could theoretically shutter the destination shooting complex nearly six months a year.

Tim Walz speaks with Minnesota Reformer Editor in Chief Patrick Coolican in front of States Newsroom leaders and reporters Thursday, June 5, 2025 at the Royal Sonesta in downtown Minneapolis. (Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Gov. Tim Walz on Thursday said that communication between states and the federal government under the second Trump administration “is nonexistent,” opening the door to catastrophe in the case of a natural disaster or other emergency.
Walz, during an interview with Minnesota Reformer editor Patrick Coolican at a States Newsroom conference in Minneapolis, said that the Trump administration is unprepared for the next disaster — like another global pandemic — and that leaves states particularly vulnerable.
“The flow of information has been disrupted between the states and the federal government, and we just can’t get answers … No one is allowed to talk to us, and that’s really problematic,” Walz said.
The Minnesota governor said the silence from the feds differs from the first Trump administration. At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Walz said then-Vice President Mike Pence would call him every few weeks to check in to see what he needed. He said he sensed Pence would call in “under the radar, so he didn’t draw anybody’s attention.”
“There were a lot of great people inside the first Trump administration that, in spite of the president, were doing good work,” Walz said.
Walz said one of his biggest fears is a cybersecurity attack. The Trump administration has cut millions of dollars for several cyber security initiatives and slashed jobs from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which helps protect the nation’s critical infrastructure.

Walz discussed the role of the states in opposing the Trump administration’s agenda — particularly on immigration — and the Democratic Party’s current malaise.
Minnesota is increasingly reliant on immigrants, who are needed to fill jobs being vacated by an aging workforce. “There’s not a cow in Minnesota that’s not being milked by an immigrant,” he said. Walz said Minnesota would not be commandeered into enforcing immigration law, which he said is a federal duty.
Walz repeated a spiel he’s given around the country, including at a recent Democratic Party event in South Carolina, which has traditionally been early on the presidential primary calendar, fueling speculation that he is considering a presidential run.
He said he’s not running, but merely using his megaphone to help fill a vacuum left by a Democratic Party in disarray.
The governor urged Democrats to figure out how to become the party of the working class again and said Democrats need to “fill all the lanes” in the media environment to reach voters.
“I still have come to the conclusion that Trump fills so much space that you’ve got to fill all these new spaces. Do I think if we would have gone on, you know, Joe Rogan, would we have won? I doubt that, but I also don’t think it hurts,” Walz said. “If your message is good, you want to get out there.”
Walz backed the 2005-06 idea of former DNC Chair Howard Dean and his “50 State Project,” which sought to reach voters in areas not traditionally associated with Democrats.
“We’re probably never going to win Idaho, but … you got to be out there for it,” Walz said.
Walz said Democrats should rotate where they hold the early primary to reach more voters, which may not endear him to Democrats in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, the traditional early states that have long jealously guarded their first in the nation status.
When asked which state should be the first to hold the primary, Walz deadpanned “Minnesota.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/NN250605_0152-1536x1024-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-05 17:09:22.686927

“The flow of information has been disrupted between the states and the federal government, and we just can’t get answers … No one is allowed to talk to us, and that’s really problematic,” Walz said.
The Minnesota governor said the silence from the feds differs from the first Trump administration. At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Walz said then-Vice President Mike Pence would call him every few weeks to check in to see what he needed. He said he sensed Pence would call in “under the radar, so he didn’t draw anybody’s attention.”
“There were a lot of great people inside the first Trump administration that, in spite of the president, were doing good work,” Walz said.
Walz said one of his biggest fears is a cybersecurity attack. The Trump administration has cut millions of dollars for several cyber security initiatives and slashed jobs from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which helps protect the nation’s critical infrastructure.
Walz discussed the role of the states in opposing the Trump administration’s agenda — particularly on immigration — and the Democratic Party’s current malaise.
Minnesota is increasingly reliant on immigrants, who are needed to fill jobs being vacated by an aging workforce. “There’s not a cow in Minnesota that’s not being milked by an immigrant,” he said. Walz said Minnesota would not be commandeered into enforcing immigration law, which he said is a federal duty. 
Walz repeated a spiel he’s given around the country, including at a recent Democratic Party event in South Carolina, which has traditionally been early on the presidential primary calendar, fueling speculation that he is considering a presidential run.
He said he’s not running, but merely using his megaphone to help fill a vacuum left by a Democratic Party in disarray. 
The governor urged Democrats to figure out how to become the party of the working class again and said Democrats need to “fill all the lanes” in the media environment to reach voters.
“I still have come to the conclusion that Trump fills so much space that you’ve got to fill all these new spaces. Do I think if we would have gone on, you know, Joe Rogan, would we have won? I doubt that, but I also don’t think it hurts,” Walz said. “If your message is good, you want to get out there.”
Walz backed the 2005-06 idea of former DNC Chair Howard Dean and his “50 State Project,” which sought to reach voters in areas not traditionally associated with Democrats.
“We’re probably never going to win Idaho, but … you got to be out there for it,” Walz said.
Walz said Democrats should rotate where they hold the early primary to reach more voters, which may not endear him to Democrats in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, the traditional early states that have long jealously guarded their first in the nation status.
When asked which state should be the first to hold the primary, Walz deadpanned “Minnesota.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/NN250605_0152-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-06-05 17:09:22.686927

Sarah Huckabee Sanders will travel to Europe this month for an overseas trade mission that will include stops in France and Switzerland, according to a Thursday press release from her office. 
Sanders’ trip, which is scheduled for June 14-19, will include appearances at a Paris Air Show panel hosted by the Aerospace Industries Association and a fireside chat organized by the Swiss-American Chamber of Commerce. 
The governor’s first stop is Normandy to honor fallen soldiers, including U.S. Army Private Rodger D. Andrews whose remains were recently identified and will be laid to rest in Arkansas on June 9. 
She’ll continue on to the Paris Air Show to meet with aerospace and defense companies, and then to Switzerland to discuss “investing in Arkansas with several large corporations,” according to the release. 
“International trade missions are a great way to pitch Arkansas to companies that might not otherwise have our state on their radar and have a proven track record of bringing in jobs and investment,” Sanders said in a statement. 
The governor’s visit to the Farnborough International Airshow in England last summer helped secure Taber Extrusions’ $60 million, 70 job expansion in Russellville, according to the release. 
During her trip to the Paris Air Show in 2023, Sanders’ discussions helped facilitate Dassault Falcon Jet’s $100 million, 800 job expansion in Little Rock and RTX’s new $33 million manufacturing facility in East Camden, which was later expanded to a $63 million investment. 
The governor’s 2023 Paris trip also led to what became known as Lecterngate. A series of public information requests submitted that summer by a blogger investigating Sanders’ travel expenses revealed a state-issued credit card was used to purchase a $19,000 lectern and carrying case from a Virginia-based company with political ties to Sanders. 
The discovery prompted lawmakers to request an audit, which found several instances of “potential noncompliance” with state law. The report was sent to the Arkansas attorney general and Pulaski County’s prosecuting attorney, the latter of whom declined to pursue charges.

,Mississippi Today,2025-06-05 20:34:06+00:00,Mississippi Today,New UMMC tool helps women on Medicaid find prenatal care and family planning,Sophia Paffenroth,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/06/05/ummc-tool-helps-women-on-medicaid/,A new database created by the University of Mississippi Medical Center is designed to ease the health care search for women covered by Medicaid.,"At the University of Mississippi Medical Center, one researcher’s full-time job for the past nine months has been to find out which clinics around the state offer different kinds of women’s health care, and whether they accept various forms of Medicaid. 
The final result is a recently-launched database aimed at helping women locate the nearest clinic that can offer the care they need. The work that went into creating it highlights a pervasive problem: Even making an appointment can be a barrier that keeps women from improving their lives. 
“We Need to Talk” is a compilation of all Mississippi clinics offering prenatal care – specifying which ones also offer family planning, and whether they take Medicaid insurance, Medicaid waivers and see women whose Medicaid applications are pending. There is also a hotline designed to give additional support to anyone having questions or feeling overwhelmed about the process.
“Having gone through the work, it was remarkable. It wasn’t easy to figure out where you should go for care,” said Dr. Thomas Dobbs, former state health officer and dean of the John D. Bower School of Population Health at UMMC, who oversaw the project. “And that should be one of the most basic bits of information we have.”
The idea was born from the recent 900% increase in babies born with syphilis, Dobbs explained, which he called a “canary in a coal mine” signaling more danger to come.
An investigation into the epidemic showed that one of the driving factors was delayed prenatal care,  caused in large part by inaccessible information and concerns about cost, Dobbs said.
Finding reproductive and prenatal care can be difficult for several reasons. 
For one thing, there are many different kinds of clinics in Mississippi, making it hard for patients to know what to search for. The list includes federally qualified health centers, county health department clinics and private OB-GYNs. Another reason is that many clinics don’t specify online whether they take Medicaid, much less what their policy is on specific or temporary Medicaid coverage. Calling doesn’t always guarantee patients a comprehensive or accurate answer.
The new database is an initiative of UMMC’s Myrlie Evers-Williams Institute – housed in the Jackson Medical Mall – which is committed to eliminating health disparities by studying the intersection of health and social issues. The institute has a clinic on site that practices what’s called “social medicine,” a key element of eliminating those disparities, the institute’s executive director Victoria Gholar explained.

“If you have a patient who has asthma and they’re living in a situation where mold is in their environment, it will really be hard for them to get better,” Gholar said. “Or, if we have a patient who has to use an electronic (medical) device, and their electricity is no longer available because they weren’t able to take care of their utility bill, then we try to work with them and connect them to resources that might be able to help.”
The institute employs a wide range of professionals who work on health from a non-clinical standpoint, such as researchers, community engagers, social workers and registered dietitians. It hosts events like food drives and offers free support from budgeting strategies to meal preparation for those with conditions like diabetes or high blood pressure. 
Aside from knowing what to search for, finding clinics that accept Medicaid can also be complicated because Mississippi Medicaid eligibility is constantly changing for a woman based on her age and circumstance – what kinds of services she’s seeking, as well as whether she’s pregnant. 
Medicaid eligibility in Mississippi is among the strictest in the nation, with one exception – pregnant women. That means many low-income women only become eligible for Medicaid once pregnant. And since an application can take up to eight weeks to be processed, the chances that a woman in this situation will be able to use her newly-acquired Medicaid insurance in the first trimester are slim. 
A law that would cut out this interim period and allow low-income pregnant women to be immediately seen by a doctor passed the Legislature in 2024, but was never implemented because of legislative errors. The policy went back through the Legislature in 2025, passed overwhelmingly again, but is not yet in effect. 
Some doctors already see women whose Medicaid application is pending, and the UMMC tool specifies at which clinics that’s the case. 
Women of reproductive age seeking reproductive health care are also eligible for leniency in the typical Medicaid stipulations. These women can apply for a Medicaid family planning waiver, which allows them to access Medicaid for family planning purposes, even if they don’t qualify for general Medicaid coverage. 
The income requirement for pregnancy Medicaid and the family planning waiver is a household income of less than 194% of the federal poverty level, or about $2,500 for one person  in 2025. 
Dobbs, who has been the main point person on the project, said he hopes  the online database is one more resource improving health care accessibility and women’s health metrics in Mississippi. 
“This isn’t about getting patients to UMMC at all,” Dobbs said. “It’s about empowering patients to be able to get the care they need where they live.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/04120917/3X0A4199.jpg,,,2025-06-05 17:09:22.686927

(Photo by Jackie Llanos/Florida Phoenix)Acknowledging the uncertainty of how profound the federal funding cuts could be and the possibility of a recession, Florida legislative leaders want to set aside $1.5 billion over the next two fiscal years.
As Florida lawmakers continue meetings this week in Tallahassee to pass a budget after the process fell apart earlier in the year, Senate President Ben Albritton and House Speaker Daniel Perez are touting the plan to bolster a $4.4 billion fund, called the Budget Stabilization Fund.
A dispute over the state budget, the only bill lawmakers must pass, caused the Legislature to extend the 60-day regular session, and lawmakers voted Thursday to extend their time to finish the budget until June 18. Although lawmakers agreed to spend $50 billion in general revenue the next fiscal year, they’re still working out the details of how that money will be spent.
The Legislature started advancing on Thursday a 2026 ballot amendment to increase the cap on how much money can sit in the BSF from 10% to 25% of revenue collections. At least 60% of voters will need to approve the proposed constitutional amendment, but lawmakers still plan to set aside $1.5 billion over the next two fiscal years in the meantime.
Anticipating the unexpected
Federal funding made up a third of the state budget last year, and Albritton told reporters Thursday that the state shouldn’t expect to receive the same level. His comments come as Congress considers hundreds of billions in cuts to Medicaid and food assistance over the next decade.
Medicaid cuts could rock state’s budget, provider pay, and the care being delivered

“Should we have the expectation that if the federal government is spending less to get their budget and their debt more under control, that we should be held harmless? I don’t think it works that way,” he said. “We’re the third-largest state in the country.”
Lawmakers want authorization to dip into the emergency reserves when revenue falls to the point that the BSF’s balance is more than 20% of net revenue going into the state’s primary general revenue fund to cover “critical state needs,” a term that hasn’t been defined. The last time the state withdrew money from the fund was during the Great Recession, according to a legislative analysis.
Meanwhile, Perez said the BSF serves as a way to prevent lawmakers from having to raise taxes in the future in case of a recession.
“None of us know what the future holds,” he said Thursday. “I think this is just a preparation of being prepared for the unexpected, and none of us know what the unexpected is, but we have a sample to look at in the 2000s when we had a recession. The state of Florida was not prepared for that recession.”
Regarding federal assistance during the Atlantic hurricane season, which started June 1, Perez said decisions at the state level would come as the federal government solidifies a plan. The federal fiscal year starts on Oct. 1.
“The federal government right now is somewhat of a moving target. I think we’re seeing decisions transpire in real time, not knowing all of the effects at the same moment. Us as a state, and I don’t just say us, I say that the Senate as well, will make decisions on how to deal with federal laws that are coming into play as they kind of come along,” he said.
Democrats view move as restricting future budgeting
But Democrats view the resolution to annually place $750 million aside in the BSF as tying the state’s hands to respond to economic downturns and current needs because accessing the fund is not as easy as spending money in the state’s normal reserves. Accessing the funds would take a two-thirds vote in each chamber.

House Democratic Leader Fentrice Driskell voted against the resolution to grow the BSF, saying the state needed to invest in stimulating the economy.
“You don’t get to talk about saving money for a rainy day when it’s still raining, and it’s already raining on the people in Florida,” she said.
Rich Templin, director of politics and public policy for the Florida AFL-CIO, likened the resolution to bolster the BSF to having to pay $1,000 rent and placing that money in a savings account instead.
“When we consider this joint resolution in the midst of this budgeting process that we are in, it seems that what we value is putting money into an account that may or may never be used as opposed to funding kids having access to healthcare, or education, or teacher salaries.”
Tax cuts and exemptions
Both Albritton and Perez say their plan to eliminate taxes on business rent coupled with $350 million in permanent sales tax exemptions will help Floridians save money. However, they haven’t reached an agreement on what items will be included in the sales tax exemptions and when.
Eliminating the tax for commercial leases, which is expected to cost $900 million, doesn’t translate to direct savings to the average person, but it would be good for the state as a whole, Albritton said.
“I’ll be the first one to say, of course, that doesn’t apply to everyone in every situation, but the fact of the matter is, nothing we do, nothing you do, is perfect, and nothing we do can be perfect for every single Floridian,” he said. “But in totality, when you are lowering what is a competitive disadvantage in Florida compared to other states, you’re doing good for Florida as a whole.”

The Senate voted in favor of two of these bills on Thursday. Others have already passed both chambers but still need to be funded.  
“As legislators, we consistently hear that one of the top issues on the minds of Maine people is access to safe, affordable housing,” Sen. Chip Curry (D-Belfast), co-chair of the Housing and Economic Development Committee, said during a press conference following Thursday’s votes. “That’s why our committee has been focused on two deeply connected challenges: how to build more housing in Maine, and just as urgently, how to protect the affordable housing we still have. It has become very clear to us that a critical component of this mission is protecting the residents of mobile home parks.”

The upper chamber voted 25-7 on Thursday to pass LD 1145 — after much discussion and a motion to table the measure failed. This bill would give a group of mobile home owners or a mobile home owners’ association the right of first refusal to purchase a mobile home park if the owner intends to sell. 
“This bill is about giving Mainers a fighting chance, a chance to protect their homes, a chance to protect their communities,” Sen. Tim Nangle (D-Cumberland) said on the floor.
Nangle’s father bought a mobile home park in Massachusetts and ran it as a community, with the philosophy “pay what you can and communicate,” Nangle said. 
Since his father died, he and his siblings have tried to keep that spirit alive, however they started getting calls from out-of-state private equity firms recently interested in purchasing. But Massachusetts has a right of first refusal law, so the park residents were afforded the time to purchase the park themselves. 
Last session, lawmakers passed a law that requires mobile home park owners to notify residents of their intent to sell and give them at least 60 days to make an offer.
“But it really didn’t go far enough,” Nangle said. “Right now, even if residents organize, raise the money and match or even exceed the offer, they can still be turned away with no explanation. The bill says, if you can match the offer, you have the right to pay.”
The version passed by the Senate was amended to include an emergency preamble, which was the version also passed by the majority of the Housing and Economic Development Committee. If enacted as an emergency, which will require the support of two-thirds of the Legislature, the bill would take effect immediately. 
Having the bill take effect sooner would be beneficial for the newly created Friendly Village Cooperative, said cooperative president Dawn Beaulieu, a 30-year resident of the park. Residents formed the cooperative after being notified in March that the park was for sale.
“[We] have since made a counteroffer to purchase the park,” Beaulieu said during the Thursday press conference. “As of today, we are still waiting for a response to that offer. Our livelihoods should not be in the hands of an out-of-state conglomerate that sees us not as a community, but as an investment. The legislation being considered here in Augusta will help us put our fate in our own hands.”
Whether other related bills become law will likely be a matter of funding priorities. 
Both chambers already backed LD 255, which would allocate $3 million in one-time funding to create the manufactured and mobile home park preservation and assistance program to help preserve parks as affordable housing and support residents in purchasing their parks.
However, it now sits on the appropriations table, where bills with fiscal notes that are backed by the full Legislature are placed to vie for remaining funds after the budget is set. 
To save affordable housing, states promote resident-owned mobile home parks

Though, the bill could still be funded in the two-year budget addition, which lawmakers have yet to set with less than two weeks remaining until their expected end date. 
That’s also the case for LD 554, which aims to encourage resident-owned communities through tax deductions. Another bill, LD 1768, which would amend the real estate transfer tax in an effort to protect mobile home parks, has also been backed by both chambers. But it would result in a decrease to state revenue and need a one-time appropriation so it may also land on the table.
On Wednesday, the Senate also passed LD 1016, which would establish the assistance program fund but also a fee to help with ongoing funding. The fee would be paid by certain park buyers equal to $10,000 for each lot in the community. 
“I want to be very clear, I have no intention to de-incentivize the purchase of these parks by everyone,” said Sen. Cameron Reny (D-Lincoln), the bill sponsor. “There are exceptions to this fee to state and municipal housing authorities, for resident owner cooperatives and for smaller businesses and individuals with net worths of less than $50 million.”
However, Sen. Rick Bennett (R-Oxford), who supported the minority committee report recommending against the bill’s passage, said he finds some of the carveouts troubling, specifically the one based on net worth. 
“It is treating people unfairly based on an arbitrary amount of money that that person or entity owns,” Bennett said. “I believe this is unconstitutional for that reason, although it’s very well intentioned.”

Ned Lamont said Thursday that economic uncertainties and political chaos only increase the chances that he will seek a third term.,"Gov. Ned Lamont said Thursday that the challenges of navigating the economic uncertainties and political chaos generated by President Donald J. Trump only increase the chances he will seek a third term as governor of Connecticut in 2026.
“If you had asked me a year ago, I would have said, ‘No, I think the state’s on a good trajectory. We’ve stabilized things. We’re growing again. Time to pass the mantle,’” Lamont said. 
He said he no longer is so eager to step aside.
“It’s also an incredibly complicated time right now, starting with all the uncertainty of Washington, the increased possibility of a recession,” Lamont said. “So, maybe a time where experience makes a difference. That’s a way of saying I’m thinking about it seriously.”
Lamont, 71, a self-described centrist Democrat, stopped well short of declaring his candidacy, but he gave his strongest indication to date of an inclination to seek another four-year term with Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz.
“I love the job,” he said. “I think we’ve had extraordinary progress compared to where we were, say, 10 years ago. I think Susan and I are a pretty good team.”
Lamont met with reporters in his Capitol office at midday, just 12 hours after the General Assembly reached its constitutional adjournment deadline of midnight Wednesday.

The governor said the Democratic bench was well stocked if he didn’t run.
“We got some extraordinary folks and Democrats, and I work very closely with each and every one of them,” he said. 
But sees himself with an edge.
“I think it’s executive experience, having sat in this chair for the last six and a half years, having been through the Trump administration, having been through COVID, having worked closely with the leadership on both sides of the aisle,” Lamont said.
He defended the granular details of the recently adopted budget and the broad strokes of his record as a governor overseeing a remarkable series of budget surpluses that have filled the state’s budget reserves and allowed the state to pay down unfunded pension debt.
With those surpluses has come pressure from the political left to address unmet needs, including low Medicaid reimbursement rates for medical providers. Lamont, they say, is too concerned with keeping spending within the state’s fiscal guardrails.
The criticism is not discouraging him as he finalizes a decision whether to run, he said.
“I’m a lot more inclined and interested in keeping going, keep this positive momentum going, than I was, say, six months or a year ago. That said, I still have some conversations to make. I put everything on hold during this last four or five months. We had a pretty tricky budget session to get through.”
The “tricky” part was finding ways to satisfy Democrats lawmakers within the constraints of spending caps.
“I think it’s an honestly balanced budget,” Lamont said, adding it’s based upon “a pretty conservative set of assumptions.”
The budget assumes that household income will grow about 4% annually over the next two years. But it also stretches Connecticut’s budget controls without breaking them legally.
The largest initiative, a new $220 million endowment to grow early education and child care services dramatically over the next decade, will be established outside of the formal budget and spending cap.
In doing so, the leaders of the Republican legislative minorities say Lamont is losing his credibility as a fiscal centrist, a theme the GOP will try to develop if Lamont runs.
“Fiscal moderation has officially left the state Capitol,” Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, proclaimed recently.
House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, said, “This budget eviscerates all of our fiscal guardrails.”
House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, smiled Wednesday when asked about the GOP efforts to define Lamont as a born-again, tax-and-spend liberal.
“The governor is being attacked by the left and the right, and so he’s probably here,” Ritter said, pointing to the center of the table. “And the answer is, always here.”

On Thursday, Lamont concurred: the political center is his comfort zone. He noted that Republicans regularly have claimed his two-year budgets were built on shaky foundations.
“‘You’re going to be in deficit within two years. You’re going to be raising taxes.’ Well, at six years later, stop crying wolf,” Lamont said.
Despite the off-budget spending on early childhood education, the governor estimated that at least $1.2 billion of this fiscal year’s $2.4 billion projected surplus still would be used to cover more unfunded pension liabilities
He reiterated his intention to veto a bill that would give jobless benefits to strikers, a source of tension with the Connecticut AFL-CIO. He also announced an intention to veto a bill sought by Republicans — and opposed both by the building trades unions and the Connecticut Business and Industry Association.
The measure, House Bill 7004, is intended to give Plainfield, a small town in eastern Connecticut, the ability to hold a referendum over a proposed trash-to-energy plant and possibly influence the state Siting Council to block the project. He briefly deferred a question about the bill to a senior staff, who confirmed it indeed would be vetoed.
“I’m vetoing that,” Lamont said, laughing. “I just made that strong decision by myself.”
Lamont said he welcomed passage of a bill encouraging housing construction, though he had yet to finish reviewing it.
“We’re never going to get economic growth [and] keep it going if we don’t have a place for people to live, young people to live, workforce housing, getting our cities growing again,” he said.
Opponents in Fairfield County have urged him to veto the bill.
“I think there’s some red flags in it, and I know why it makes people nervous,” he said. “But it’s basically gross misrepresentation from the anti-growth people down there that are stirring people up. They’re saying it’s a big mandate. You’re gonna forcing me to build housing, you know, in my backyard, which is not what the strategy is at all. It’s trying to tell towns, you take the lead, you show us where you want that housing to go. It’s important for your community.”

The program outlines certification requirements for health care providers and pharmacies to dispense mifepristone, plus paperwork that patients must sign.About 65% of abortions in Massachusetts in 2023 were medication abortions, according to the 64-page citizen petition Campbell co-filed Thursday.The FDA says REMS programs are used for drugs with “serious safety concerns to help ensure the benefits of the medication outweigh its risks.” Campbell’s office contends the mifepristone requirements impose “burdensome restrictions on access to medication abortion while not meaningfully improving patient safety, and that these restrictions severely impede patient access by reducing the number of prescribers and pharmacies authorized to dispense this FDA-approved medication.”“The Mifepristone REMS Program also imposes an undue burden on pregnant patients experiencing miscarriage and early pregnancy loss who seek treatment at emergency departments,” the petition says. “For instance, the administrative requirements imposed by the REMS can effectively discourage emergency departments from carrying mifepristone in their pharmacies.”Reduced access to mifepristone can particularly impact patients in rural and medically underserved areas, the petition added. The Democratic AGs teamed up in response to US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert Kennedy recently instructing FDA Commissioner Martin Makary to pursue a “complete review” of mifepristone and labeling requirements.In response to the Trump administration, Beacon Hill lawmakers are escalating their focus on shoring up protections for reproductive and transgender care. A Sen. Cindy Friedman bill (S 2522) that’s gaining traction would tighten the 2022 abortion shield law, including by requiring hospitals to provide emergency abortion care and allowing provider practices, rather than specific prescriber names, to appear on medication abortion labels.The post AG pushes back on federal abortion medication restrictions appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/repro.webp?fit=1000%2C667&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-05 17:09:22.686927

Fuel shortages affected businesses like his in western Kansas and other Midwest states. (Submitted)TOPEKA — Multiple factors merged to create a fuel shortage affecting western Kansas and three other Midwest states, and one expert expects it to take months for fuel storage capacity to return to normal.
Brian Posler, executive director of Fuel True, said the complex system that maintains fuel stores to avoid shortages was hit by several unusual events this year. Fuel True is a nonprofit trade association representing Kansas fuel distributors and convenience stores. 
Although the storage tanks that hold as much as 500,000 gallons of fuel may take some time to replenish, Charlie Robinson, owner of Robinson Oil Co. in Garden City, is grateful fuel supplies at terminals started returning to normal last week.
Robinson’s company markets fuel, buying it from fuel terminals and then delivering it to the end user, typically smaller users such as farms and feedlots. Typically he buys fuel from the Scott City terminal located closest to his business. There also are terminals in McPherson, Salina and Concordia that serve western Kansas, which is the challenge, he said. 
“What accentuates our problem out here is the logistical distance between terminals,” he said. 
Beginning in March, nearby terminals began to have low or no supplies of diesel and eventually even regular gasoline, Robinson said. These last two months have been “absolutely unusual”during his 40 years in the oil business, he added.
“The Scott City terminal, we did not go there for six weeks to two months to get product. They had nothing to offer us up there,” Robinson said. “We pulled product out of Enid, Oklahoma, which would be about 250 miles, and then McPherson, which is a couple of hundred miles.”
Because of lines at the terminal as truckers waited to fill up, a driver who could usually get two loads of fuel in one day would only have time to get one because they’re only allowed to drive a certain amount of time before taking a break, Robinson said. 
To address that situation, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration issued an emergency declaration in mid May for Kansas, Nebraska and Iowa, and then updated it May 23 to include South Dakota. The declaration temporarily lifts some regulations, such as how many hours a truck driver can be on the road before taking a mandatory break, so that motor carriers can better respond to the shortages. 
Truck drivers were spending hours waiting in line and needed flexibility in driving hours, which the emergency declaration offered, Posler said. The declaration only affects those drivers providing direct assistance supporting emergency relief efforts.
“Under normal circumstances, we have really important safety rules and drivers can only be behind the wheel a total of 11 hours (per day),” Posler said. “But if you are driving a great distance and then sitting in line for hours waiting your turn, all of a sudden you’re bumping against those hours of service really quickly.”
Posler said Gov. Laura Kelly originally made an emergency declaration for the state that lasted 14 days in the hopes the fuel situation would be alleviated. 
“It quickly became apparent that instead of that, shortages started getting farther and wider,” Posler said. He said distributors were going as far away as Amarillo and Denver to find fuel. 
There was either no fuel available or if it was, it was strictly allocated, often to big contracts for stores like Casey’s and Love’s, he said.  
Because it looked as though low supplies would continue, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration acted after Kansas, Nebraska and Iowa petitioned for a regional waiver. 
 
Slow recovery
“I am very impressed with how our members have navigated this environment over the last month or two, with as few fuel outages at gas stations that we have seen,” Posler said.
Distributors have delivered partial loads to different customers, adapting to billing everything separately instead of delivering a full load and billing as they normally do, he said. 
Recovery, though, is likely to take months. 
“They depleted the stores, which are maybe 500,000-gallon tanks, so those are not going to get replenished quickly and easily at a time of peak demand,” Posler said. 
Robinson pulled up a website that looks at supplies at terminals across the country. As of Thursday, the Scott City terminal is “borderline” on diesel fuel, but the Wichita area and Great Bend terminals have all products, he said. 
Enid, Oklahoma, though, has no diesel fuel, Robinson said. 
Buying patterns
Posler said numerous factors came together to create this year’s shortage. 
Farmers typically stock up on fuel in the fall because prices are sometimes lower and they can reduce tax liabilities, Posler said.
“This year, because of where prices were and the incoming change of administration, the word on the street is that a lot fewer farmers stocked up and then needed to buy in the spring,” he said. 
That shift, added to the usual annual surge in fuel use in the spring as more people are on the road, shifted demand patterns. 
 
Maintenance challenges
Kansas has three refineries and each one, at some point during the year, does what is called “turnaround,” Posler said. Normally, they operate year-round and 24 hours a day, but during turnaround, crews come into the refinery to perform annual maintenance. 
CHS Refinery in McPherson was undergoing its turnaround at the same time these other factors were affecting fuel supplies, Posler said. 
Repairs on the Magellan Pipeline, a 9,000-mile pipeline that crosses 14 states, also were taking longer than expected, he said.  
“ONEOK owns the Magellan pipeline,” Posler said. “The Magellan is a very important pipe that runs in the east-west direction in Kansas. ONEOK was doing stress testing and they found some repairs and blowouts that needed to be done, and the repairs are taking longer than anticipated.”
ONEOK spokesperson Charlsey Phillips said the company had completed routine maintenance and resumed operations on a segment of the company’s Kansas pipeline.
Refineries also shifted their fuel blends from winter to summer blends, Posler said, which can slow processes. Summer blends have less butane in them, making them less volatile. 
 
Strong infrastructure
Robinson’s company and customers were affected by the shortage, seeing increased freight costs. 
“It came at a cost,” he said, adding that he appreciated Posler’s work at Fuel True to reach out to the Kansas Corporation Commission and Kelly, who were all responsive.
“I would say, in general, we have a very strong infrastructure relative to other countries around the world,” Posler said. “Here in the Heartland, we’re fortunate that we have three refineries in our state, and we have more than one pipeline option that moves through the state. We are blessed compared to some states, under normal circumstances.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Charlie-Robinson-garden-city-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-05 17:09:22.686927

Tim Walz speaks with Minnesota Reformer Editor in Chief Patrick Coolican in front of States Newsroom leaders and reporters Thursday, June 5, 2025 at the Royal Sonesta in downtown Minneapolis.Gov. Tim Walz called Tuesday’s major law enforcement presence in south Minneapolis “chaotic” and said his Department of Public Safety had no advance notice. 
“I think any professional, especially in law enforcement or the military, tells you you do not want chaos,” Walz told a gathering of States Newsroom editors Thursday. 
On Tuesday, dozens of federal officers raided a taco restaurant in Minneapolis, drawing community members and activists in protest. The Minneapolis Police Department and Immigration and Customs Enforcement were among those present. MPD only assisted with crowd control, Mayor Jacob Frey said. 
The operation has drawn widespread criticism from some local elected officials and Attorney General Keith Ellison for spreading fear in a community already on edge due to President Donald Trump’s aggressive use of deportation of immigrants, including some here legally. The incident has reupped an ongoing debate about the proper role of local police in immigration enforcement, though law enforcement officials say the operation wasn’t related to immigration. 
The operation was the first in Minnesota carried out by Trump’s Homeland Security Task Force. Frey said the raid was based on “a criminal search warrant for drugs and money laundering” unrelated to immigration enforcement. 
Walz said he was supportive of stopping possible criminal activity but criticized the lack of information he received and the way the operation was carried out. 
“I don’t see how anybody can think it’s a good situation to see a heavy militarized presence in a residential neighborhood,” Walz said. “We’ll follow the law federally, but we want to make sure that our folks are protected and that human dignity and due process is followed.”  
Ellison commented on the raid to States Newsroom reporters on Wednesday. 
“If they want to inflict fear, and they wanted to discourage cooperation, they achieved both those goals yesterday,” Ellison said. 
Walz also spoke more broadly about the need for immigrants in Minnesota amid low unemployment rates, addressing the crucial role immigrants play in the workforce. In 2023, foreign-born workers made up 10.9% of Minnesota’s labor force. 
“There’s not a cow being milked in Minnesota that’s not being milked by an immigrant,” Walz said.
Walz will be testifying before the House Oversight Committee on June 12 about Minnesota’s “sanctuary” immigration policies.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/NN250605_0100-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-06-05 16:15:10.525344

Two adults resided at the home in the Bunker Hill Community Cooperative just south of Frazer’s Place diner off Route 12, according to officials.The identities of the occupants have not been released and no charges have been filed, although the matter remains under investigation, police said.Removed from the residence were a total of 165 animals, including 28 dogs, 14 cats, 11 guinea pigs, 40 sugar gliders, four rabbits and 68 birds, Windsor police said in an emailed news release Tuesday.Joining Windsor police in the operation were Windham County Humane Society, Lucy Mackenzie Humane Society, Humane Society of Chittenden County, Springfield Humane Society, along with a veterinarian, a wildlife removal specialist and animal control officers from the Brattleboro and Springfield, Vt.Also enlisted for advice were Humane World for Animals, Vermont Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets, Vermont Fish & Wildlife, Windsor Fire Department and the town’s health officer, police said.“This turned out to be a very complex operation to put this together once police found out about it because of all the regulations involved,” Tom Marsh, Windsor town manager, said on Tuesday. “It required a pretty wide network and support from state agencies.A rescued guinea pig rests in a box of hay at the Lucy Mackenzie Humane Society in West Windsor on Wednesday, June 4. “They were really loved, it was just a sad situation,” executive director Jackie Stanley said of the animals who were surrendered.

(A sugar glider is a squirrel-size, tree-dwelling nocturnal marsupial).“The remarkable thing about this household was the multiple species. So the coordination of relocating them among all the shelters in Vermont and humane organizations was the huge effort,” she said.Stanley said the dogs are being evaluated in the same manner as any incoming potential pet and will be treated for parasites, vaccinated, spayed or neutered and “evaluated for behavior.” She said they could be ready for adoption in “one or two weeks.”Program coordinator Amy Woodman cleans out sugar glider cages at the Lucy Mackenzie Humane Society in West Windsor, on Wednesday, June 4. The shelter is working to find placements for the 12 nocturnal marsupials and they have already been in contact with several experienced sugar glider owners interested in adopting. “They’re very unique creatures,” Woodman said. Photo by Alex Driehaus/Valley News“We’ve already had inquiries about the sugar gliders,” Stanley said.Windsor police said the investigation began last April when they received a complaint “from a citizen” about “the number of animals living inside the residence and feared for the health of the occupants.”When police investigated, they found animals in cages in each of the rooms of the residence with some cages “stacked up on others” and all the animals located inside the residence, the Tuesday news release said.The occupants “cooperated with authorities and willingly allowed the removal of the animals,” police said.On-scene veterinarians assessed the animals prior to their removal and most “appeared to be in good overall health, with a few needing medical attention going forward.”The occupants are cooperating with the ongoing investigation, police said.Marsh said it does not appear that the residents were breeding animals to sell.“The intention was more: ‘We’re giving a home to these animals that don’t have a home,’ ” Marsh said.He likened the animals inside the residence to a “hoarding situation as opposed to a nefarious breeding operation.”“Unfortunately they thought they were doing something good and they weren’t,” Marsh said, adding “there’s a mental health aspect.”Windham County Humane Society posted on its Facebook page on Saturday that they took in 16 dogs and two “sphinx cats” from the Windsor rescue operation and that the next day one of the dogs gave birth to six puppies.Within days, some of the Windsor dogs had already found new forever homes, the Society announced, noting that they are “basking in the warm sunshine, happily romping around and napping together in the fresh air, and loving their newfound freedom from the cramped space they called home for too long.”The society launched a special fundraising campaign to help “create a happy ending to a hoarding case” with a goal of raising $5,000.By Tuesday afternoon, the Windham organization had raised $3,626 toward its goal.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Authorities relocate more than 160 animals from ‘hoarding’ situation in Windsor.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/animal-shelter-1.jpg,,,2025-06-05 16:15:10.525344

The D.C. region’s largest Salvadoran festival — and one of the area’s largest Latino heritage events — has been canceled due to fears surrounding immigration policies put on by the Trump administration.
Organizers for Salvadoreñisimo Festival told WTOP the annual event, which was set to take place at the Montgomery County Agricultural Fairgrounds in Gaithersburg, has been canceled for this year. It normally takes place in September around the time of Independence Day in El Salvador, Sept. 15, and Hispanic Heritage Month.
Organizers told WTOP they did not want to put those in the audience in danger of possible raids from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers.
The event welcomes thousands of people for musical performances, comedic skits and food. The festival was set to celebrate its 20th anniversary this year.
The D.C. region is home to one of the largest Salvadoran populations in the country. The U.S. Census reports Salvadorans represents more than a quarter of the Latino population in Maryland and D.C.
Local outlet Telemundo 44 was the first to report the event’s cancellation.
Concerts and events around the country have been affected because of immigration policies being pushed by the Trump administration. In April, Michelada Fest — a two-day music festival in Chicago — was canceled after performers experienced issues with visas.

SPRINGFIELD – Gov. JB Pritzker got some of what he requested from the General Assembly in the area of higher education, but some of his biggest requests fell short.

Pritzker’s wins include a $10 million increase in need-based student financial aid and passage of a direct admission program to make it easier for eligible Illinois high school and community college students to apply to public universities.

But lawmakers did not approve the overall funding increase that Pritzker requested at the start of the session, settling on a 1% bump in their operational budgets instead of the 3% the governor proposed, Pritzker’s office, however, has said there are contingencies to provide an additional 2% in the event of significant cuts in federal funding.

They also did not pass other major higher education policy initiatives, including Pritzker’s plan to allow community colleges to offer four-year bachelor’s degrees in certain high-demand career fields, and a long-sought overhaul in the way Illinois funds its public universities.

“You don’t get everything done in one year,” Pritzker said during a post-session news conference when asked about several of his initiatives that failed to pass this year. “Sometimes they (lawmakers) spend two years, four years, six years, trying to get something big done.”

Community college proposal

In his State of the State address in February, Pritzker called for allowing community colleges to offer baccalaureate degrees as a way of expanding access to those programs, especially for older, nontraditional students who may not live close to a four-year university.

“With lower tuition rates and a greater presence across the state — especially in rural areas — community colleges provide the flexibility and affordability students need,” Pritzker told the General Assembly. “This is a consumer-driven, student-centered proposal that will help fill the needs of regional employers in high-need sectors and create a pathway to stable, quality jobs for more Illinoisans.”

In the legislature, however, the proposal ran into stiff opposition from several sources, including universities that  said the plan lacked sufficient safeguards to prevent community colleges from offering duplicative programs that would siphon prospective students away from their campuses.

Amid that opposition, House Bill 3717, which was carried by Rep. Tracy Katz-Muhl, D-Northbrook, failed to advance out of a key committee before a mid-session deadline in March. And even after amendments were negotiated that led to universities dropping their opposition and the bill was reassigned to a different committee, it still failed to gain enough traction to advance to the House floor.

That was mainly due to opposition from the Legislative Black Caucus, whose members said it still posed a threat to the three universities in Illinois that serve primarily Black and Latino students — Chicago State University; Governors State University, and Northeastern Illinois University — which are all located in the Chicago metropolitan area alongside multiple community colleges.

“Chicago State is hemorrhaging,” Rep. Curtis Tarver, D-Chicago, said during a May 23 House Executive Committee hearing. “And you all, as an administration, are handing them Band-Aids and they need stitches. And then you come in and you provide a bill that's going to be even worse for them, with 11 community colleges within 25 miles of them. And I'm saying as we sit here that the Black Caucus has an issue with the bill.”

Funding overhaul

Another proposal that failed to advance  called for establishing a new formula for funding public universities.

House Bill 1581 and its companion Senate Bill 13, known as the Adequate and Equitable Public University Funding Act, called for establishing a funding structure like the Evidence-Based Funding formula used for K-12 education.

That formula would use objective standards to determine an adequate level of funding for each university. The bills then called for adding as much as $1.7 billion in new funding for universities over the next 10-15 years, with most of the funding going toward schools furthest away from their adequacy target.

The proposal grew out of a commission formed in 2021 within the Illinois Board of Higher Education. That commission worked for nearly three years to develop a proposal and issued its report and recommendations to the General Assembly in March 2024.

Under the proposed formula, Western Illinois University in Macomb would have earned top priority for new funding because it is currently funded at only 46% of its adequacy target. Northeastern Illinois University and Southern Illinois University-Edwardsville, at 47% of adequacy, would have been next in line.

But the state’s flagship institution, the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, currently at 89% of adequacy, would rank at the bottom of the priority list. For that reason, the U of I System opposed the plan.

“The University of Illinois System is absolutely dedicated to expanding equitable access, enhancing student success and promoting statewide economic growth,” Nick Jones, executive vice president and vice president of academic affairs for the U of I System, told a Senate committee in April. “The proposed legislation penalizes institutions that provide the most support for underrepresented and rural students while failing to ensure long-term access.”

Senate Majority Leader Kimberly Lightford, D-Westchester, who sponsored the Senate bill and was a cochair of the study commission, said she was disappointed it did not pass this year, but vowed working for a more equitable funding formula.

“While it is far past time to pass an equitable funding model, I am reminded that many of the comprehensive plans I’ve passed have taken years of research, input and negotiations,” she said in an email statement. “This legislation is no different.”

Robin Steans, president of the education advocacy group Advance Illinois, who also served on the commission, said in a separate statement that she expects lawmakers to continue discussing the bill over the summer. Action could come during the fall veto session or early in the 2026 regular session, she said.

“Eventual adoption of the Adequate & Equitable Funding bill represents a significant change, one that requires new investment by our state in what remains the surest path to greater mobility and opportunity for Illinois families,” she said. “The questions and comments made during legislative committee meetings indicate that Illinois lawmakers get that, and powerful testimony from the state’s university leaders drove home the urgency of this issue.”

Kevin Stitt on Thursday announced the launch of new security protocols for major events developed by the Secure Oklahoma NOW advisory council.  
The guidelines were crafted over five months by a 12-member advisory council who are “subject matter experts” on emergency preparedness and response. The tool is currently available online for use in planning large events and in case emergency response is needed. 
  Tim Tipton, commissioner of the Department of Public Safety, explains the new safety guidelines for Oklahoma events developed by an advisory council. (Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)
Oklahoma Commissioner of Public Safety Tim Tipton said having this set of standards will help to prevent emergency events and allow for proper responses. 
“Prevention is always our primary goal, but then we also have to be prepared for response,” he said. “If that bad thing happens, then how do we respond? How do we mitigate the amount of damage or harm or hurt that our citizens might be affected by?” 
The guidelines are a “living document” that will change as threats and technology evolve, Tipton said. 
“It’s one of those deals that there’s really no room for failure on our part, we’ve got to make this work every time,” he said. 
The nine-page guide creates a rating system based on various factors at an event like attendance, venue, traffic and event type. Recommendations for steps to take are offered based on an event’s rating, with resources provided to implement the guidelines. 
The council is made up of Oklahoma’s public safety, law enforcement, emergency management and counterterrorism officials who helped craft the recommendations. 
Stitt established the council with an executive order Jan. 13 following an attack on Bourbon Street in New Orleans on New Year’s Day that killed 14 people. 
“We’re just seeing some of these kind of attacks happen,” he said. “And as we look forward to the big events here in Oklahoma, I just want to make sure that that as Oklahoma, we’re as well prepared as we can to address it in these threats. So tonight, we have the Oklahoma City Thunder game coming up and then we’re going to have a championship parade, hopefully, in a couple of weeks. And so the whole world’s going to be looking at our city.”
Local officials will have a better understanding of what state resources are available to them, Stitt said, including threat assessments from the Oklahoma Counter Terrorism Intelligence Center and a drone response team from the state Department of Public Safety. 
Both Stitt and Tipton encouraged Oklahomans to use the Protect OK app to report concerning or suspicious activity. Submissions to the app are constantly monitored, Tipton said.

(Photo by Eesha Pendharkar/ Maine Morning Star)Both chambers of the Maine Legislature advanced a version of a bill that would make it easier for school staff to restrain and seclude students, weakening a law passed in 2021 restricting the use of practices that experts say cause lasting trauma.
Maine has historically led the country in its use of these practices, which include physically immobilizing students and placing them in small rooms, with educators predominantly using them on students with disabilities. Restraint and seclusion practices have been used more than 22,000 times in Maine in some years, and the real number is even higher, since many large districts do not submit their data to the state despite reporting being required by the 2021 law. 
This year, citing increased issues with student behavior, some teachers and administrators pushed to relax the restrictions. 
‘It broke him, and it broke me’: Parents, educators describe trauma from restraint and seclusion

Despite disability rights advocates sounding the alarm at the public hearing for the bill, lawmakers in both the Maine House of Representatives and the Senate voted to pass LD 1248. 
“While most states are looking at bills this session that provide greater protections for students and more resources for educators, Maine is one of the few states that is looking to roll back protections for students,” said Ben Jones, director of legal and policy initiatives for Lives in the Balance, a Maine-based national nonprofit that offers training for schools on how to move away from restraint and seclusion.“It is a serious disappointment.”
Under Maine law, restraint and seclusion are only supposed to be used in case of emergencies, where the student’s behavior poses “imminent risk of serious physical injury” to themselves or others. The original proposal changed that to risk of injury after some educators said they interpreted the law to mean they couldn’t use these practices to prevent a potentially dangerous situation unless a teacher could be injured severely enough to seek outside medical care. 
“Staff are being hit, they’re being bit, but it doesn’t meet the threshold of serious imminent danger, because a 5-year-old isn’t going to [cause] an injury that requires medical care,” said Gardiner-area Superintendent Patricia Hopkins during the April 23 public hearing.
The amended version of the bill defines “serious physical injury” to mean “any impairment of the physical condition of a person, whether self-inflicted or inflicted by someone else, that requires a medical practitioner, including, but not limited to, a school nurse, to evaluate or treat the person.” This definition was already included in Chapter 33, the Maine Department of Education rules governing restraint and seclusion.
Another aspect of the bill allows educators to move students without their consent without having to document the incident as a restraint.
Atlee Reilly of Disability Rights Maine told lawmakers at the work session for LD 1248 that if the bill passes, schools will no longer have to report these kinds of incidents where staff forcibly move students, which he explained will likely mean the number of documented restraints could decrease.
“What we’re going to do is take a whole class of stuff — like the physical management of students that I think most people would look at and say, that child’s being restrained — and say it’s no longer restraint,” Reilly said.
He added, “It doesn’t mean that people are going to be putting their hands on kids less.”
Jones said these changes “were conjured up by schools’ lawyers who will surely use the new language as legal cover to protect schools, not kids.”

U.S. District Judge Deborah L. Boardman granted a temporary block on the agency’s cancellation of grants and early discharge of corps members, but only for the states that sued the administration in April. Connecticut was among them. 
The federal lawsuit, filed by Democratic state officials across the country, accused President Donald Trump’s cost-cutting efforts through the Department of Government Efficiency of reneging on grants funded through the AmeriCorps State and National program, which was budgeted $557 million in congressionally approved funding this year.
Boardman also said all AmeriCorps National Civilian Community Corps members that were discharged from their service terms early should be reinstated, if they are willing and able to return.
[RELATED: CT AmeriCorps programs shut down by Trump administration cuts]
But Boardman allowed the 30-year-old federal agency for volunteer service to proceed with its reduction in force, denying the states’ request to restore the majority of staff that were put on administrative leave in April. The agency employs more than 500 full-time federal workers and has an operating budget of roughly $1 billion.
AmeriCorps did not immediately respond to request for comment. The Department of Justice declined to comment.
In a statement Thursday, Connecticut Attorney General William Tong said, “The work that AmeriCorps members and senior volunteers do in Connecticut to keep food pantries running, tutor children, assist homebound seniors, and support our veterans is vital, and the Trump administration’s attempt to dismantle it was both cruel and lawless. This victory will allow AmeriCorps workers to continue to serve some of Connecticut’s most vulnerable residents.”
The 30-year-old agency created to facilitate volunteer service across the country oversees several programs that dispatch hundreds of millions of dollars and tens of thousands of people to serve in communities.
It sends roughly 200,000 corps members across the country as part of its service programs. Most corps members get a living stipend during their service and become eligible for funding for future education expenses or to apply for certain student loans.
As part of the AmeriCorps State and National grant program, state volunteer commissions distributed more than $177 million in formula-based distributions, as well as $370 million in competitive grants that supported nearly 35,000 corps members serving at 300 organizations, according to announcements last year.
Notices of grants being terminated were sent late on a Friday in April, explaining “the award no longer effectuates agency priorities” and directing grantees to immediately shut down the projects, according to a copy reviewed by The Associated Press.
The states that sued the administration said those extensive and immediate cancellations did not provide the legally required notice and comment period. They said the result would be severely curtailed services and programs for vulnerable populations since states and organizations could not fill the funding void.
AmeriCorps argued in court filings that a temporary block on the agency’s actions as the lawsuit proceeds would disrupt efforts to comply with Trump’s executive order creating DOGE and to “act as responsible stewards of public funds,” according to court filings.
Despite bipartisan support, AmeriCorps has long been a target of critics who decry bloat, inefficiencies and misuse of funds.
“President Trump has the legal right to restore accountability to the entire Executive Branch,” Anna Kelly, White House deputy press secretary, previously said in a statement after the lawsuit was filed.
Connecticut filed the lawsuit along with officials in Maryland, Delaware, California, Colorado, Arizona, Washington, DC, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin.

On Wednesday, members of the Michigan Senate Health Policy Committee met to discuss the U.S. House of Representatives’ recently passed spending bill that would slice $535 billion from the federal program over the next 10 years.
Testifying before the Democratic-controlled Michigan Senate committee were members of the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, hospital officials and federally qualified health care providers.
Meghan Groen, senior deputy director of health services with the MDHHS, said one in four Michigan residents rely on Medicaid and that a significant portion of those recipients live in rural areas.
The U.S. House proposal to cap and eliminate provider taxes would cost Michigan around $525 million, Groen said, and the proposed work requirements in the federal spending bill could lead to a $155 million implementation cost with less coverage provided. Groen noted that nearly 500,000 people could face coverage loss.

One of the benefits of Michigan expanding Medicaid coverage many years ago was that health insurance could be provided to more low-income residents and reduced the financial burdens on hospitals. Eliminating the Medicaid expansion could lead to increased emergency room visits and higher health care costs overall.
“The Healthy Michigan plan involves about 750,000 Michiganders. At this point, it succeeded in exactly what it was intended to do,” Groen said. “It prevents people from going into bankruptcy and medical debt, because someone in their family got sick. Uninsured people don’t stop getting sick. They wait until they’re sicker, and then they go to an emergency room. They go with a higher level of care, where it’s more expensive to serve them, and their acuity, or how sick they are, is more intense at that time, so it costs more.”
If they don’t have money to pay that bill, Groen said, it gets left unpaid, and the providers have uncompensated care. She said the cost for everybody in the community goes up everybody who goes into that provider.
Sen. Sylvia Santana (D-Detroit) wondered about the work requirements, noting that the Institute of Health Policy and Innovation has said that 49% of Michiganders who fall into that category are already working.
Groen said the state does not have an exact number of how many in that population were actually working, but she suspected it would be most recipients. Adding the proposed requirements would lead to a lot of extra communication about recipients go on to comply with the requirement, which also say they needed to be working the month before they applied.
“It might be a little confusing for an individual who’s like, ‘great, I just got a job, I’ll apply for Medicaid,’ and then to get that determination letter [saying] that they, in fact, do not meet the requirements is going to be very confusing for people who are just reaching out, getting a job, and trying to make sure they have health care for themselves and their family,” Groen said. “We are very concerned about both what the compliance looks like for individuals who are working and individuals who are not.”
Also testifying was Katie O’Neal, a mother from Ypsilanti, who extolled how Medicaid helped her child get lifesaving care and without going through the rigors of dealing with the modern health insurance industry.
O’Neal’s son, Nathan, who came to their family through the foster care system, was born 11-weeks premature. He was eligible for Medicaid due to his inclusion in foster care. Shortly after he arrived as a member of the O’Neal family, Nathan became ill with RSV, a common respiratory virus that can have serious consequences for infants and older adults. It was later discovered that he had a stenosis, or narrowing, of his lower airway, requiring a tracheostomy.
All of that care was covered by Medicaid, O’Neal said, which was a blessing. Years later, Nathan’s airway needed to be reconstructed. A two-week intensive care unit hospital stay was necessary at a cost of more than $100,000. That procedure and follow up appointments were all covered by Medicaid.
He lives a pretty stable life now, despite a resurgence in complications from the reconstructive surgery, which is rare. Four procedures have commenced since late last summer, and each of those procedures were covered by Medicaid.
But future surgeries and complications could be harrowing if congressional Republicans’ cuts to Medicaid take hold.
“I have anxiety about the outcome and his life after surgery. I worry how first grade will go, and I wonder if we will ever escape this cycle of airway procedures,” O’Neal said. “But I don’t have to worry about convincing my insurance company that it’s necessary. Medicaid has been there for us at every turn, and now there’s a public debate about whether families like mine should still have this kind of support with Medicaid.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/unnamed-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-05 16:15:10.525344

Gov. Spencer Cox on Thursday appointed John Deeds, an attorney specializing in state and local taxes, to succeed longtime Commissioner Michael Cragun, who has served on the commission since 2009. 
“John knows how to navigate complex tax issues and keep things grounded in common sense,” Cox said in a news release. “He brings the kind of practical expertise and steady leadership that will benefit both taxpayers and the commission.”
The Utah State Tax Commission is a body that oversees the administration and enforcement of Utah’s tax laws. It consists of four members, and is currently led by longtime Commission Chair John Valentine. Deeds — if his appointment is confirmed by the Utah Senate — will join Commissioners Rebecca Rockwell and Jennifer Fresques. Commissioners are appointed to four-year terms. 
Cragun will be leaving his seat on June 30, Valentine told Utah News Dispatch on Thursday. No other information was provided about Cragun’s departure, and when pressed, Valentine said, “he’s just not ready to make any public announcements at this time.” Cragun served 16 years on the commission totaling four four-year terms. He wasn’t re-appointed after his latest term expired.

Valentine praised Deeds as a “very capable tax attorney,” and he said his fellow tax commissioners are “very, very excited to have him come onto the commission and bring the expertise he can bring.” 
Deeds is currently a partner at the law firm Crapo | Deeds PLLC where he represents individuals and businesses in a wide variety of state and local tax matters. He’s been an attorney for more than 15 years, and through his career, he’s helped craft tax policy, according to an alum bio on the University of Utah’s Hinckley Institute of Politics website. 
Deeds also served as a law clerk in the Utah Attorney General’s Office’s Tax and Revenue division, where he represented the Utah State Tax Commission in tax litigation and compliance issues. 
“It’s an honor to be appointed, and I’m excited to serve the people of this great state,” Deeds said in a prepared statement. “I’m committed to upholding the tax laws in a fair and impartial manner.
Deeds earned his Master of Laws in Taxation from Georgetown University Law Center. He also holds a Juris Doctor from the University of Utah S.J. Quinney College of Law and dual bachelor’s degrees in political science and psychology from the University of Utah.
As a member of the Utah State Bar Tax section, Deeds “frequently presents at national tax conferences and contributes to leading industry publications,” the governor’s office said in Thursday’s release. 
Deeds and his wife Jane Deeds live in Farmington with their five children. 
His appointment will be subject to confirmation by the Utah Senate. A date for that vote has not yet been scheduled.

(Amy Bushatz/Mat-Su Sentinel)PALMER – The residential Job Corps center in Palmer will remain open for now, with students continuing classes following a court order issued by a federal judge Wednesday.
U.S. District Judge Andrew Carter in New York issued the temporary restraining order as part of a lawsuit alleging that a Department of Labor directive to shut down the program is illegal.
The restraining order blocks the government from removing Job Corps students, terminating jobs, or halting the contracts that operate about 100 Job Corps centers nationwide. Any shutdown must first gain approval from Congress, the order states. The program is currently funded through June 2026, Job Corps officials said.
A hearing in the case is scheduled for June 17 in New York, according to the court order. The suit was filed Monday by the National Job Corps Association, several Job Corps contractors and a student enrolled at a Job Corps center in New York.
The U.S. Department of Labor announced a nationwide “pause” for the program last week, effectively ordering an end to all operations. Students were to be sent home, staff laid off and centers closed by the end of the month, according to the announcement.
The Don Young Job Corps Center in Palmer opened in 1994 and currently serves 160 students between the ages of 16 and 24, most of whom live on the 19-acre campus. About 80% of the program’s students come from rural Alaska villages, where no similar educational programs are available, officials there said. Job Corps students earn high school diplomas, receive technical training or both.
The Palmer program employs about 110 people and is operated under a contract with the Chugach Corp, officials said. It is the only Job Corps location in Alaska.
The Labor Department said it wants to halt the program because it is expensive to operate at about $80,000 per student and has a low graduation rate.
Officials at the Palmer center said their location costs about $37,000 per student and had a completion rate of about 70% last year. The Chugach contract is valued at about $9 million annually, they said.

Free.,Congressional Hispanic Caucus to keep pressure on immigration detention following arrests,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/congressional-hispanic-caucus-keep-pressure-immigration-detention-following-arrests,,"WASHINGTON — Members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus pledged Thursday to make more visits to immigration detention centers across the country to carry out oversight of the Trump administration’s crackdown.The members detailed their visits to various detention centers over last week’s recess. Many people they visited in those centers were arrested while attending their court hearings or had no criminal record, they said.“What we and our colleagues witnessed was the system being used to punish people simply for being an immigrant, and we all know that cruelty is the point with this president,” said New York Democratic Rep. Nydia Velázquez.Continued oversight of immigration detention centers will only become more important, members of the all-Democrat caucus said, if congressional Republicans succeed in passing a massive tax and spending bill that would increase immigration enforcement funding by billions, including for detention centers.Republicans are moving ahead with a legislative procedure known as reconciliation to fulfill President Donald Trump’s priorities without needing 60 votes in the U.S. Senate.The vow to continue with oversight at detention centers comes after three congressional Democrats said they were accosted by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials at a New Jersey detention center last month. That incident ended with the Newark Mayor Ras Baraka arrested, and Rep. LaMonica McIver facing federal charges. The charges against Baraka were dismissed about two weeks later.“We will not succumb to any intimidation tactics,” CHC Chair Rep. Adriano Espaillat of New York said. “We will continue to comply with our duty to have oversight of these detention centers, and we will visit them within the parameters of the law.”Members of Congress are allowed to conduct oversight visits at any Department of Homeland Security facility that detains immigrants, without prior notice, under provisions of an appropriations law.Collateral arrestsWashington state Democratic Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a former chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, slammed the Trump administration’s expansion of government contracts with private prison companies to detain migrants.“It is critically important that we members of Congress continue to investigate what are supposed to be civil detention centers, but instead operate as private for-profit prisons with substandard medical care and they make billions of dollars … in contracts from this administration detaining people of all legal statuses,” Jayapal said. The detention center in New Jersey reopened this year and ICE awarded GEO Group Inc. with a $1 billion contract to run the facility.Jayapal said when she conducted an oversight visit at the Tacoma, Washington, Northwest ICE Processing Center, which was formerly known as the Northwest Detention Center, over the recess, some of the people being detained were caught up in immigration enforcement raids targeting other people. Such immigration arrests are known as collateral arrests.She said one woman she spoke to who was detained had been in the country for more than 20 years, but did not have a permanent legal status.“She was swept up in a raid at the workplace, and she was detained less than a week before she was going to get married to a U.S. citizen,” Jayapal said.She said another person she talked to was a man who had been in the U.S. for 31 years and is a permanent legal resident.“These are not the so-called worst of the worst that Trump kept saying he was going to go after,” Jayapal said. “These are simply people who love this country, who have been in this country for decades, who are married to U.S. citizens and have U.S. citizen children, and do not understand why the country they love would be doing this to them.”Democratic Rep. Lou Correa of California, said that he’s come across immigrants in detention centers who were arrested while attending their court hearings.“These individuals are following the law, showing up … to court hearings, and they're having their removal cases dismissed,” he said. “Immediately as they walk out of that courtroom, they are rearrested and put into what is called an expedited removal process … to quickly get them out of the country.”",,,,2025-06-05 16:15:10.525344

U.S. District Judge Dana Christensen presided over the case.
Kevin Andrew Bacon, 51, pleaded guilty in January to conspiracy to distribute and possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine.
According to a Wednesday U.S Attorney’s office press release, law enforcement officers began investigating a drug trafficking ring operating around Butte in June 2022.  According to court documents, agents allegedly discovered a conspiracy operating in part by sending drugs through the U.S. Postal Service from California to Montana. Several members of the drug trafficking ring operated out of a residence in Whitehall, according to court filings.
The investigation led to the arrest of several conspirators in early January 2023, and the seizure of approximately 13 pounds of meth. On Feb 23, 2023, law enforcement located a package sent from California to “Kevin Bacon” in Manhattan. Law enforcement searched the package and located 873.5 grams of actual methamphetamine inside.
Bacon was arrested on Feb 28, 2023, when he arrived at the Manhattan post office to retrieve the package. He told investigators he had a friend in Whitehall who sold drugs and had asked Bacon to receive a package, which Bacon knew contained meth, to his P.O Box.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Brian Lowney prosecuted the case.
The investigation was conducted by the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, Homeland Security Investigations, Gallatin County Sheriff’s Office and Montana Division of Criminal Investigation.

In a unanimous decision, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled Thursday that a Catholic Charities organization in Wisconsin doesn’t have to take part in the Wisconsin unemployment insurance (UI) system.
The ruling overturns a 4-3 Wisconsin Supreme Court decision issued in March 2024 that declared the work of Catholic Charities Bureau Inc. of the Superior Diocese of the Catholic Church doesn’t get a pass from Wisconsin’s UI law on religious grounds.
The Wisconsin ruling, written by Justice Anne Walsh Bradley, declared that the Catholic Charities work is “secular in nature” and that the agency and its subsidiary organizations that took part in the case “are not operated primarily for religious purposes” as defined in the UI law’s religious exemption.

In Thursday’s ruling, Justice Sonya Sotomayor wrote for the Court that arguments the Wisconsin high court majority made amounted to making preferences of one religious denomination over another.
Her ruling noted that the church offers its own unemployment compensation program for laid-off workers and dismissed the suggestion that the organizations were “more likely to leave their employees without unemployment benefits.”
The Wisconsin ruling held that the agencies’ work was not religious in nature because they didn’t attempt to preach the Catholic faith to participants and did not serve only Catholics.
“Petitioners’ Catholic faith, however, bars them from satisfying those criteria,” Sotomayor wrote. The ruling quoted from the dissent by Justice Rebecca Bradley in the Wisconsin decision.
“Wisconsin’s exemption,” Sotomayor wrote, “as interpreted by its Supreme Court, thus grants a denominational preference by explicitly differentiating between religions based on theological practices. Indeed, petitioners’ eligibility for the exemption ultimately turns on inherently religious choices (namely, whether to proselytize or serve only co-religionists).”
The Wisconsin UI law exempts all churches, church conventions or church associations “without differentiating between employees actually involved in religious works” and those who are not, Sotomayor wrote.
Justice Clarence Thomas, while joining in the unanimous opinion, wrote a separate concurrence stating that because the Wisconsin ruling did not defer to the Bishop of Superior’s assertion that Catholic Charities and its affiliates are “an arm of the Diocese, the Wisconsin Supreme Court violated the church autonomy doctrine.”
In a separate concurrence  Justice Ketanji Brown  Jackson signaled how states could ensure that nonprofit employees of religiously associated organizations are covered by UI — by focusing on the work involved rather than its underlying motivations to determine who is and who is not exempt.
When the federal law was revised in 1970 to include nonprofit employees in state UI programs, Congress exempted certain church-affiliated employees. The goal, Jackson wrote, was to avoid the state getting involved in a dispute “over the sufficiency of a fired employee’s prayers or the accuracy of their scriptural teaching.”
The intent of Congress was to exempt “a narrow category of church-affiliated entities” that could produce such an entanglement “precisely because their work involves preparing individuals for religious life,” Jackson wrote.
She concluded: “It is perfectly consistent with the opinion the Court hands down today for States to align their [federally-based] religious-purposes exemptions with Congress’s true focus.”

The June 4 notice, first reported by The Public’s Radio, was obtained by Rhode Island Current Thursday. The two-page letter from Harmeet Dhillon, assistant attorney general in the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division, offers little information about the basis for the investigation.
“Our investigation is based on information that Rhode Island may be engaged in employment practices regarding its affirmative action program governing state government employment under state law that discriminate based on race, national origin, or other protected characteristics in violation of Title VII,” Dhillon wrote.  
“Accordingly, the Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division has authorized a full investigation to determine whether Rhode Island is engaged in a pattern or practice of discrimination as set forth above.”
Attorney General Peter Neronha also appeared caught off-guard by the notice of the probe.
“The Office is still reviewing, as the subjects and focus of their investigation are unclear,” Tim Rondeau, a spokesperson for Neronha’s office, said in an email Thursday. “We will share more information when we are able.”
Dhillon wrote that the investigation does not mean the DOJ has reached a conclusion or determination of violations of federal anti-discrimination protections.
Gov. Dan McKee’s office did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment Thursday.

The Senate on Thursday passed LD 957 with a 19-13 vote, after the House did so one day prior without a roll call. 
The bill would require the Maine Department of Education to convene a volunteer advisory committee to collect information and prepare materials to teach this history. It would also require the department to develop a process to enable schools to conduct internal audits of their curriculum to ensure the history is being adequately and accurately taught. 
Though, with a one-time cost of $15,000 for the department to convene the advisory group and prepare teaching materials, the legislation is expected to be placed on the appropriations table. 
Bills that land on this table, which is managed by the Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee that sets the budget, have already passed the full Legislature with initial votes. However, if they don’t have a specific funding source, they have to vie for remaining unappropriated money.
Essentially, that’s everything being voted through with a fiscal note because lawmakers are still drafting what will be in the next two year budget plan. 
This bill is one of several being considered this session to ensure diverse histories are taught in Maine schools, though the other bills seek to make sure already required curricula are actually being taught. 
Lawmakers revisit bills to ensure diverse histories are taught in Maine schools

Maine has required Wabanaki and African American studies to be taught in schools since 2001 and 2021, respectively. 
But, school districts have failed to consistently and appropriately include Wabanaki studies in their curricula, according to a 2022 report, and many caution African American studies could see the same fate without additional resources and accountability measures. 
Last year, two separate bills were combined into one that proposed establishing a commission on Wabanaki and African American studies but that legislation died without final action. This idea is back for consideration this session with distinct bills. 
LD 1474, sponsored by Rep. Laurie Osher (D-Orono), would permanently establish a Wabanaki studies specialist in the Maine Department of Education to ensure the standards are being met.
LD 1202, sponsored by Talbot Ross, would create the African American Studies Advisory Council to serve as a resource for educators, schools and the Department of Education to ensure the implementation of the curricula in accordance with existing state law. 
Neither bills have received floor votes so far. 
Another bill, LD 339, that sought to pilot a Wabanaki-centered curriculum for Wabanaki children attending public schools has been rejected by both chambers and is now effectively dead.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/American-History-2-1024x686.jpeg,,,2025-06-05 15:14:54.150245

(File photo by Getty Images)Continuing to provide grocery assistance to more than half a million South Carolinians could cost the state upwards of $100 million annually under proposed changes to the federal program.
For the last half-century, the federal government has fully funded benefits provided through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as food stamps. But Republicans’ massive bill on taxes and spending, as passed by the U.S. House, would require states to pay a portion of those benefits starting in 2028, plus a greater share of what it costs to administer the program.
While the U.S. Senate is likely to make changes to what’s dubbed the “big, beautiful bill,” advocates worry about major cuts to the 61-year program and what that would mean to the families who rely on it.
U.S. House Republican plan would force states to pay for a portion of SNAP benefits

“I can’t imagine the state is even closely prepared for all this,” said Sue Berkowitz, director of the Appleseed Legal Justice Center.
If the House plan holds, the Palmetto State’s total cost could triple, or in the worst-case scenario, increase elevenfold to $370 million.
What changes
That’s because it bases states’ share of the cost on how well they distribute benefits correctly: States with an error rate of 6% or less would be responsible for paying 5%. Those with an error rate higher than 10% would have to pay one-quarter of the cost.
And the latest data puts South Carolina in the latter category. In 2023, the state’s error rate was a whopping 22.6%, the fourth-worst in the nation, overwhelmingly due to overpayments.
State officials say that’s an anomaly.
Prior to the coronavirus pandemic, South Carolina’s error rate was historically in the lowest category. That changed in 2022, when the state’s error rate went to 9% amid changes to the SNAP program during the global pandemic. Then it shot up in 2023.
After a re-training of staff, the state Department of Social Services expects a big drop in the 2024 error rate, which should be released next month.
Can SC afford it?
The chief budget writer of the South Carolina House said the state has the money to continue the program, as long as the error rate returns to pre-pandemic levels. Ways and Means Chairman Bruce Bannister pointed to hefty surpluses in tax collections in recent years as an example of the state’s fiscal health.
SC legislators get extra $1B to spend as budget negotiations begin

The budget that takes effect July 1 includes $1.2 billion placed in reserves. About $500 million more is unspent and available following an update in revenue estimates last month.
The question is whether funding for the food program will stand up against other budget priorities in the years to come, said Bannister, R-Greenville.
Rep. Bill Herbkersman was less certain of South Carolina’s ability to pay.
The Bluffton Republican chaired the subcommittee that oversees the budget for South Carolina’s child welfare and social services agency for many years. He does not think the state can guarantee it will have the funding every year to keep the program going on a recurring basis.
In total, the federal government provides South Carolinians $1.3 billion in annual benefits for groceries, according to the latest figures.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which heads the SNAP program, and the state split the $66 million bill for administrative costs.
What frustrates Herbkersman the most are the overhead costs just to operate the program — three-quarters of which South Carolina will have to pay under the proposed changes.
“As a taxpayer, I’m incensed by that,” he said.
As for payment errors, those can occur from miscalculations in a household’s expenses and families struggling to provide the necessary documents updating their income in the case of a job change or loss, according to the USDA.
According to state officials, the federal government calculates the error rate by checking a small sample of beneficiaries.
DSS also has struggled to process applications for benefits within the 30-day window allowed under federal regulations. The USDA put the state on notice last year, both for timeliness and for not properly informing people of denied benefits.
As millions wait on food stamp approvals, feds tell states to speed it up

To address that, DSS started making much-needed upgrades to its technology. The agency has set aside about half of the $74 million it needs to replace equipment that’s as much as five decades old.
Those upgrades “will significantly improve the state’s ability to process applications in a timely manner,” according to an agency statement.
Rising demand
But the fundamental issue is a rise in the need, according to DSS.
South Carolina, like many other states, has seen the weekly application volume for SNAP benefits rise substantially — 7,000 applications for benefits each week on average, a nearly 50% increase over pre-COVID numbers.
As of last September, one in nine South Carolinians were receiving SNAP benefits. More than half went to families with children, while more than one-third went to families with an elderly or disabled adult, according to the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
Lee Patterson has seen that firsthand as Richland County Library’s social work director who helps people fill out applications. She’s not sure why more people are applying for aid, but she suspects it’s closely tied to the rising cost of housing.
“The first bill people usually pay is the rent,” she said. “When the price of housing goes up, then the ability to pay for food goes down.”
Applicants who aren’t elderly or disabled can deduct only $672 from their income when calculating whether they qualify for food benefits. Meanwhile, the median cost of rent and utilities in South Carolina is nearly double that, according to U.S. Census data.
Patterson and her team have the experience to help smooth the way for people seeking aid. But for those applying on their own, especially for the first time, it can be tricky.
For example, when it comes to proving income changes, applicants often have to go back to a former employer and ask for documentation that shows they no longer work for that company. Those employers don’t always respond, and in some cases may have closed entirely, Patterson said.
A second pain point for applicants can be waiting for a phone interview with DSS staff, which the federal government requires for benefits. South Carolina was allowed to waive those interviews during the pandemic, likely contributing to the state’s increased error rate, but they resumed in July 2023.
The call volume for these interviews is often high, and it’s not uncommon for an applicant to wait on hold for an hour. The library has a phone available for applicants to use. If they don’t get through, they may have to return multiple days in a row to complete their interview, Patterson said.
What’s next?
Advocates expect changes to the U.S. House proposal, as several key Republicans in the Senate have publicly opposed shifting food benefit costs to states. Negotiations are expected to continue into next week, Politico reported, with the goal of passing the bill by July 4.
The final plan remains to be seen.
The executive director of Foodshare South Carolina is concerned about what might ultimately happen to other SNAP-related programs.
Omme-Salma Rahemtullah said she relies heavily on the state-funded program known as Healthy Bucks, which provides additional money for SNAP recipients to purchase fruits and vegetables. They can use these benefits at farmers markets. Or they can get a box of produce worth $20 from Foodshare.
Rahemtullah worries that if the state has to spend more on general SNAP benefits, there may be less available to keep Healthy Bucks operating.
Healthy Bucks began as a pilot in six counties in 2014. It’s since expanded to all 46 counties, according to the state Department of Social Services. In 2023, the Legislature provided an additional $5 million to the agency to further expand the program.
Beyond upping the cost to states, the federal proposal also expands requirements for SNAP recipients.
Under existing rules, people under 55 who can work — what the government calls “able-bodied adults” — are limited to three months of food benefits over a three-year period unless they can prove they work, volunteer or attend job training at least 80 hours each month, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
The proposal would expand those rules by a decade — to people under 65 and, for parents of school-age children, they would be exempt if their children are younger than 8, rather than 18.
“As less money comes into the state from the federal level, the state will have to find ways to make that up for a lot of things,” said Berkowitz, the Appleseed advocate. “I just hope feeding people will be a priority.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/grocery-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-06-05 15:14:54.150245

With regard to their total nursing staff, eight of Iowa’s 410 nursing homes were staffed at least 40% below the level that was expected, based on residents’ acuity levels, during the fourth quarter of 2024. That marks a slight improvement from the 11 homes that fell into that category during the third quarter of the year.
The data also shows that among the 50 states, Iowa continues to rank in the middle of the pack, with staffing levels that average roughly 20% below expectations.

The data is reported by the facilities themselves to the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, and is then analyzed and published by the nonprofit Long Term Care Community Coalition. The coalition’s analysis shows that in late 2024, just over 90% of all nursing homes across the country were staffed below the level expected based on their residents’ needs.
In Iowa, the homes that provided the lowest number of total nursing staff hours per resident, per day, are scattered among both rural and urban counties. Among the 12 lowest-ranked Iowa homes, six are operated by the same company — Care Initiatives of West Des Moines.
The 12 homes, and their deviation from the expected hours per resident, per day, for all nursing staff were:
Fonda Specialty Care, Pocahontas County: 47.7% below expected levels.
Mount Ayr Health Care Center, Ringgold County: 43.9% below expected levels. This facility also was among the lowest-ranked facilities in the third quarter of 2024, when total nurse staffing was 44.3% below expected levels.
Accura Healthcare of Marshalltown, Marshall County: 43.5% below expected levels.
Kingsley Specialty Care, Plymouth County, 42.8% below expected levels. This facility also was among the lowest ranked facilities in the third quarter of 2024, when total nurse staffing was 40% below expected levels.
Bettendorf Health Care Center, Scott County: 42.8% below expected levels. This facility also was among the lowest-ranked facilities in the third quarter of 2024, when total nurse staffing was 43.8% below expected levels.
Avoca Specialty Care, Pottawattamie County: 42.2% below expected levels.
Lyon Specialty Care, Lyon County: 41.4% below expected levels.
Panora Specialty Care, Guthrie County: 40.5% below expected levels. This facility also was among the lowest-ranked facilities in the third quarter of 2024, when total nurse staffing was 42.8% below expected levels.
Northgate Care Center, Allamakee County: 39.9% below expected levels.
The Ivy at Davenport, Scott County: 39.1% below expected levels.
Aspire of Perry, Dallas County: 39.1% below expected levels. This facility also was among the lowest-ranked facilities in the third quarter of 2024, when total nurse staffing was 43.1% below expected levels.
Belle Plaine Specialty Care, Benton County: 39.1% below expected levels.
Fewer hours by registered nurses 
The analysis also shows that many nursing homes continue to rely on lesser skilled certified nursing aides, rather than registered nurses, to provide much of the care – with many homes falling far below the recommended level of staffing by registered nurses.
In Iowa, 12 nursing homes provided at least 60% fewer staffing hours by registered nurses than recommended. The Iowa facilities that deviated the most from the expected number of registered-nurse hours per resident, per day, during the fourth quarter of 2024 were:
Nora Springs Care Center, Floyd County: 76.9% below expected levels.
Garden View Care Center, Page County: 75.6% below expected levels.
Crystal Heights Care Center, Mahaska County: 69.7% below expected levels.
Caring Acres Nursing and Rehab Center, Cass County: 69.4% below expected levels.

Silver Oak Nursing and Rehabilitation Center, Linn County: 61.3% below expected levels.
Colonial Manors of Columbus Community, Louisa County: 60.2% below expected levels.
Congress questions staffing mandates
The staffing data shows U.S. nursing homes, on average, delivered 3.75 hours of nursing care per resident, per day – which is significantly below the 4.95 hours that would be expected based on residents’ acuity levels.
The expected staffing levels that are used as a benchmark in the analysis are calculated using an evidence-based, case-mix adjustment methodology that accounts for the specific care needs of residents within each specific care facility, using data provided by the facilities themselves.
“The significant staffing shortfall is more than just a statistic,” said Richard Mollot, LTCCC’s executive director, “it reflects the daily reality of thousands of vulnerable residents enduring avoidable pain and neglect simply because too many nursing homes are not being held accountable for meeting even basic care standards.”
The average U.S. nursing home provided 3.75 total nurse staff hours per resident day in the fourth quarter – almost the same level as the 3.73 hours reported in the third quarter.
In addition to showing that just over 90% of nursing homes are reporting staffing levels below their expected levels, the analysis indicates the median nursing home fell 24.9% short of expected total staffing levels and 42.3% short of expected staffing levels for registered nurses.
The analysis also found that more than a third of all care facilities — 36% of the total – reported no presence of a medical director, despite federal requirements that a medical director oversee the quality of clinical care provided in every facility.
As in the third quarter of 2024, only two states — Alaska and Oregon — met or exceeded their expected staffing levels, while North Dakota (-4.1%) ranked fourth in staffing adequacy, narrowly missing its expected target.
The states with the worst average staffing levels in both the third and fourth quarters of 2024 included Illinois, Texas, Missouri, Georgia, New Mexico and Indiana.
Congress is currently considering proposals that would require the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to delay, until January 2035, enforcement of new minimum staffing standards for nursing homes.

The Arkansas Board of Corrections filed a lawsuit in Pulaski County Circuit Court on Dec. 14, 2023 against Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the secretary of state and Arkansas Department of Corrections, challenging the constitutionality of Act 185 and 659 of 2023.
Act 185 requires the secretary of corrections to serve at the pleasure of the governor rather than the board, while Act 659 alters the reporting structure for the directors of the Division of Correction and Division of Community Correction, requiring them to serve at the pleasure of the secretary rather than the board. 
The board argued the laws violate Amendment 33 of the Arkansas Constitution, which protects the power of constitutional boards like the board of corrections from “usurpation by the Governor or the General Assembly, or both,” according to Thursday’s ruling. 
Arkansas judge sides with prison board in dispute with governor, corrections secretary

A circuit court judge granted a preliminary injunction in January 2024, which Attorney General Tim Griffin appealed. 
The Supreme Court’s ruling Thursday dismissed the state’s motion to send the case back to the circuit court, order the preliminary injunction vacated and the case dismissed as moot.
The high court also dismissed a motion to disqualify the corrections board’s attorney from further participation in proceedings before the court. 
In its motion to remand, the state argues the controversy ended when the board fired former Corrections Secretary Joe Profiri. The firing was part of a dispute between the board and the executive branch that started in late 2023 over who controls the state’s prison system.
The board’s refusal in November 2023 to approve a request to increase prison capacity by 500 beds prompted harsh public criticism from Griffin and Sanders. The board responded by hiring an outside attorney the following month to represent it in employment matters. 
Because Profiri was fired prior to the entry of the preliminary injunction, the lower court’s finding of irreparable harm was erroneous, the state argued. The board said it wasn’t seeking court confirmation of its right to fire Profiri, but relief from the legislation regarding the board’s authority under Amendment 33. 
Writing for the majority, Chief Justice Karen Baker said she agreed with the board’s assertion that Profiri’s termination doesn’t resolve the ultimate question of whether the board controls the secretary or division directors, and therefore the dispute is not specific to the individual holding the secretary’s office. 
“The Board’s complaint concerns the Challenged Legislation and the resulting changes to the Board’s supervisory authority. This dispute exists notwithstanding the individual who holds the Secretary position and is not personal to Secretary Profiri,” Baker wrote. “Further, because this case presents an existing legal controversy, it is not moot. Therefore, we deny appellants’ motion to remand.”


Let us know what you think...




The state also filed a motion to disqualify the legal counsel obtained by the corrections board, arguing the firm was obtained illegally. The board didn’t follow state law for securing outside counsel, and the board did not have the “authority to hire special counsel because the Board is not a constitutional officer,” the attorney general’s motion argued.
The circuit court denied this motion, explaining that “the Board is a constitutionally created board, making its members constitutional officers” who therefore had the legal authority to hire special counsel.  
The attorney general typically represents state agencies, but state law gives constitutional officers the ability to hire outside counsel when they disagree with the attorney general over a constitutional provision.
In dismissing this motion, Baker notes the board correctly points out that “an order denying a motion to disqualify adversary’s counsel in a civil proceeding is not an appealable final order.”
“As a general rule, an appeal from an interlocutory decision brings up for review only the decision from which the appeal was taken, here, the granting of an injunction,” Baker wrote. The motion to disqualify the attorney is outside the scope of the Supreme Court’s review of the preliminary injunction, she said.
The high court majority affirmed the lower court’s issuance of an injunction because its “findings that there would be irreparable harm were not clearly erroneous.” 
The crux of the lawsuit, Baker wrote, is whether the board retains ultimate authority over the corrections secretary and directors or whether the challenged legislation constitutionally transfers that power to the governor and corrections secretary. 
“The evidence presented to the circuit court demonstrates that, in the absence of the injunction, the dispute will be ongoing until the constitutionality of the Challenged Legislation is resolved,” Baker said. “This, coupled with appellants’ failure to even argue their likelihood of success on the merits, leaves us with little choice under our deferential standard of review. 
“We hold that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the Board demonstrated that irreparable harm would result in the absence of the requested preliminary injunction, and we affirm,” she added. 
Arkansas Supreme Court sends AG’s FOIA lawsuit against prison board back to circuit court

Special Justices Troy Braswell and Bud Cummins joined in the decision. Associate Justice Barbara Webb concurred in part and dissented in part. Associate Justice Shawn Womack dissented. Associate Justices Cody Hiland and Nicholas Bronni, both of whom were appointed by the governor, did not participate. 
Webb wrote that she agreed with the majority that the matter is not moot because Profiri’s termination doesn’t resolve the question of whether Acts 185 and 659 of 2023 are unconstitutional. She also agreed that it’s not appropriate to disqualify the board’s counsel at this time. 
However, she argues the board “failed to demonstrate irreparable harm” and the circuit court therefore erred in enjoining the challenged acts. 
“The crux of the Board’s claim for irreparable harm was Secretary Profiri’s alleged acts of insubordination, which were directly attributable to Act 185 requiring the Secretary to serve at the pleasure of the Governor rather than the Board,” Webb wrote. “This harm is not irreparable…By definition, if a secretary may be terminated and his actions undone, then it cannot be said that any harm resulting therefrom is ‘irreparable.’”
In his dissenting opinion, Womack argues the court must vacate the preliminary injunction and dismiss the lawsuit because sovereign immunity bars the board’s lawsuit against the governor, corrections secretary and Department of Corrections. 
Sovereign immunity, which Womack cites often in court opinions, is the legal doctrine that the state cannot be sued in its own courts.
“Even if that was not so, the Board would still lose because it failed to show irreparable harm — a necessary element to establish entitlement to a preliminary injunction,” Womack wrote “Therefore, I also join the other dissenting opinion in this case.”
Regarding the issue of the disqualification of the board’s “potentially illegally retained counsel, I again remind citizens of this state of their ability to protect themselves ‘against the enforcement of any illegal exactions whatever,’” he said.

Michael now works in a small-town hospital in Canada. KFF Health News and NPR granted him anonymity because of fears he might face reprisal from the Trump administration if he returns to the U.S. He said he feels some guilt that he did not stay to resist the Trump agenda but is assured in his decision to leave. Too much of America has simply grown too comfortable with violence and cruelty, he said.
“Part of being a physician is being kind to people who are in their weakest place,” Michael said. “And I feel like our country is devolving to really step on people who are weak and vulnerable.”
Michael is among a new wave of doctors who are leaving the United States to escape the Trump administration. In the months since Trump was reelected and returned to the White House, American doctors have shown skyrocketing interest in becoming licensed in Canada, where dozens more than normal have already been cleared to practice, according to Canadian licensing officials and recruiting businesses.
The Medical Council of Canada said in an email statement that the number of American doctors creating accounts on physiciansapply.ca, which is “typically the first step” to being licensed in Canada, has increased more than 750% over the past seven months compared with the same time period last year — from 71 applicants to 615. Separately, medical licensing organizations in Canada’s most populous provinces reported a rise in Americans either applying for or receiving Canadian licenses, with at least some doctors disclosing they were moving specifically because of Trump.
“The doctors that we are talking to are embarrassed to say they’re Americans,” said John Philpott, CEO of CanAm Physician Recruiting, which recruits doctors into Canada. “They state that right out of the gate: ‘I have to leave this country. It is not what it used to be.’”
Canada, which has universal publicly funded health care, has long been an option for U.S.-trained doctors seeking an alternative to the American health care system. While it was once more difficult for American doctors to practice in Canada due to discrepancies in medical education standards, Canadian provinces have relaxed some licensing regulations in recent years, and some are expediting licensing for U.S.-trained physicians.
In mere months, the Trump administration has jeopardized the economy with tariffs, ignored court orders and due process, and threatened the sovereignty of U.S. allies, including Canada. The administration has also taken steps that may unnerve doctors specifically, including appointing Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead federal health agencies, shifting money away from pandemic preparedness, discouraging gender-affirming care, demonizing fluoride, and supporting deep cuts to Medicaid.
The Trump administration did not provide any comment for this article. When asked to respond to doctors’ leaving the U.S. for Canada, White House spokesperson Kush Desai asked whether KFF Health News knew the precise number of doctors and their “citizenship status,” then provided no further comment. KFF Health News did not have or provide this information.
Philpott, who founded CanAm Physician Recruiting in the 1990s, said the cross-border movement of American and Canadian doctors has for decades ebbed and flowed in reaction to political and economic fluctuations, but that the pull toward Canada has never been as strong as now.
Philpott said CanAm had seen a 65% increase in American doctors looking for Canadian jobs from January to April, and that the company has been contacted by as many as 15 American doctors a day.
Rohini Patel, a CanAm recruiter and doctor, said some consider pay cuts to move quickly.
“They’re ready to move to Canada tomorrow,” she said. “They are not concerned about what their income is.”
The College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario, which handles licensing in Canada’s most populous province, said in a statement that it registered 116 U.S.-trained doctors in the first quarter of 2025 — an increase of at least 50% over the prior two quarters. Ontario also received license applications from about 260 U.S.-trained doctors in the first quarter of this year, the organization said.
British Columbia, another populous province, saw a surge of licensure applications from U.S.-trained doctors after Election Day, according to an email statement from the College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia. The statement also said the organization licensed 28 such doctors in the fiscal year that ended in February — triple the total of the prior year.
Quebec’s College of Physicians said applications from U.S.-trained doctors have increased, along with the number of Canadian doctors returning from America to practice within the province, but it did not provide specifics. In a statement, the organization said some applicants were trying to get permitted to practice in Canada “specifically because of the actual presidential administration.”
Michael, the physician who moved to Canada this year, said he had long been wary of what he described as escalating right-ring political rhetoric and unchecked gun violence in the United States, the latter of which he witnessed firsthand during a decade working in American emergency rooms.
Michael said he began considering the move as Trump was running for reelection in 2020. His breaking point came on Jan. 6, 2021, when a violent mob of Trump supporters besieged the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to stop the certification of the election of Joe Biden as president.
“Civil discourse was falling apart,” he said. “I had a conversation with my family about how Biden was going to be a one-term president and we were still headed in a direction of being increasingly radicalized toward the right and an acceptance of vigilantism.”
It then took about a year for Michael to become licensed in Canada, then longer for him to finalize his job and move, he said. While the licensing process was “not difficult,” he said, it did require him to obtain certified documents from his medical school and residency program.
“The process wasn’t any harder than getting your first license in the United States, which is also very bureaucratic,” Michael said. “The difference is, I think most people practicing in the U.S. have got so much administrative fatigue that they don’t want to go through that process again.”
Michael said he now receives near-daily emails or texts from American doctors who are seeking advice about moving to Canada.
This desire to leave has also been striking to Hippocratic Adventures, a small business that helps American doctors practice medicine in other countries.
The company was co-founded by Ashwini Bapat, a Yale-educated doctor who moved to Portugal in 2020 in part because she was “terrified that Trump would win again.” For years, Hippocratic Adventures catered to physicians with wanderlust, guiding them through the bureaucracy of getting licensed in foreign nations or conducting telemedicine from afar, Bapat said.
But after Trump was reelected, customers were no longer seeking grand travels across the globe, Bapat said. Now they were searching for the nearest emergency exit, she said.
“Previously it had been about adventure,” Bapat said. “But the biggest spike that we saw, for sure, hands down, was when Trump won reelection in November. And then Inauguration Day. And basically every single day since then.”
At least one Canadian province is actively marketing itself to American doctors.
Doctors Manitoba, which represents physicians in the rural province that struggles with one of Canada’s worst doctor shortages, launched a recruiting campaign after the election to capitalize on Trump and the rise of far-right politics in the U.S.
The campaign focuses on Florida and North and South Dakota and advertises “zero political interference in physician patient relationship” as a selling point.
Alison Carleton, a family medicine doctor who moved from Iowa to Manitoba in 2017, said she left to escape the daily grind of America’s for-profit health care system and because she was appalled that Trump was elected the first time.
Carleton said she now runs a small-town clinic with low stress, less paperwork, and no fear of burying her patients in medical debt.
She dropped her American citizenship last year.
“People I know have said, ‘You left just in time,’” Carleton said. “I tell people, ‘I know. When are you going to move?’”

(Photo courtesy the Maryland Department of the Environment)A 2,000-gallon diesel spill from tanks on the Johns Hopkins Hospital campus in East Baltimore that contaminated a portion of the Baltimore harbor had been contained as of Thursday morning, officials say.
The fuel traveled about 1.3 miles through the city’s storm drains after Wednesday’s spill and emptied into the Patapsco River near Harbor East, officials said at a Thursday morning news conference.
Officials from city, state and federal agencies responded to the spill Wednesday afternoon and overnight, which caused an odor in the surrounding area, and turned the water red, thanks to a dye in the oil.
With about 600 feet of booms, the spill was contained to a marina area about 150 yards wide and 200 yards long, near the South Central Avenue Bridge, where a number of sailboats and other watercraft are moored.

“This has been a robust and a truly collective effort,” said Gov. Wes Moore (D), who responded to the scene in Baltimore early  Thursday. “We have seen over 100 personnel literally work through the night to make sure that we had this situation under control and contained.”
A third-party vendor was delivering the diesel to the hospital when the spill occurred, read a statement from Liz Vandendriessche, a Hopkins spokesperson. The fuel was being pumped into two tanks, which supply power for backup generators at the hospital, but they were overfilled, leading to the spill.
Hopkins officials reported the leak at about 11 a.m. Wednesday, initially calling it a “contained 200 gallon diesel spill,” according to a news release from Moore’s office.
But by 1 p.m., Baltimore City fire officials were responding to a 911 call reporting a fuel spill at a Harbor East marina. First responders from the city, the Maryland Department of the Environment and the U.S. Coast Guard “very, very rapidly” deployed a boom to contain the contamination, said Baltimore Fire Chief James Wallace.
“Those actions taken by those three agencies have really reduced the footprint of this incident,” Wallace said. “This could have been far, far worse than what it was.”
At 6:48 p.m. Wednesday, Hopkins modified its report, indicating that it was a 2,000-gallon uncontained spill, according to the governor’s office.
“We immediately notified the Maryland Department of Environment of the overflow while continuing to investigate, and we proactively reached out again to MDE as we learned more about the estimated overflow volume,” said Vandendriessche. “We also are actively working with local, state and federal authorities to support the response in the Baltimore Inner Harbor.”
As of Thursday morning, officials were flushing the storm drains to force the rest of the diesel out of the underground pipes and into the containment area in the harbor, Wallace said. From there, the contaminated water could be pumped into a 4,000-gallon pump truck.

“We need to push the product down, push it down to the harbor, where we have skimmers, where we have capability to capture and retain product,” Wallace said. “So, that’s the operation right now. This operation will continue through a majority of the day.”
State officials found about a dozen geese that had been covered in oil, which were captured and taken in by a wildlife rehabilitator, said Geoffrey Donahue, director of Emergency Preparedness and Response at the Maryland Department of the Environment.
Baltimore City Mayor Brandon Scott said that city officials were evaluating the city’s storm drain system to ensure the flushing effort succeeded.
“They have the capability to look at that by GIS mapping, but we also had them physically going and popping manholes, because nothing beats being able to see it — or in this case, see it and smell it — with your own eyes, ears and nose,” Scott said.
Emergency response teams were preparing Thursday for the possibility of rain in the days ahead, particularly Friday afternoon, which could flood the storm drains with runoff and complicate the effort to flush the system in a controlled manner.
“Should this happen, and rain come behind it, we’re going to lose control — in the worst case scenario,” Wallace said. “But right now, as I said, we’re absolutely on schedule.”

More than 300 students and staff prepare for plug to be pulled on Wind River Job Corps, severing path to certifications, high school diplomas and driver’s licenses. 
The post Wyoming students ‘devastated’ after federal decree upends Riverton trade school appeared first on WyoFile .","RIVERTON—What began as a trickle soon turned into a flood of people streaming out of the Wind River Job Corps. More than 100 students and staff walked off the campus Wednesday afternoon to raise awareness of their plight: that Wyoming’s only Job Corps center will soon be shuttered by federal decree. 
The students were predominantly young men, and most had dropped out of high school. Some had made mistakes, finding themselves in trouble with the law. Others had gotten mixed up with drugs, lived on the streets and served prison time. Some, feeling aimless, just wanted to find purpose. 
All had found promise here at Wind River Job Corps, a trade school that offers paths to high school diplomas, driver’s licenses and certifications in fields like welding and truck driving. 
Igor Bool grew up in Ukraine and was adopted by a Gillette family when he was 13. As a teenager, he said, he made bad choices. Bool, now 17, came to Wind River Job Corps “to start a life and start making better choices … and find a career that could potentially lead me to a life of success.”
The center, which employs roughly 150 people and currently serves 178 students, was thrown into chaos when the U.S. Department of Labor announced last week it would pause operations at contractor-operated Job Corps centers nationwide. The decision aligns with President Donald Trump’s budget proposal and “reflects the Administration’s commitment to ensure federal workforce investments deliver meaningful results for both students and taxpayers,” the announcement read. 
For Wyoming’s only Job Corps center the news has disrupted career tracks and left employees and students reeling. Staff have spent the past week scrambling to prepare for an abrupt closure date of June 23, and fear the loss will leave many students to fend for themselves with zero resources. 
“Our kids are just devastated,” said Wind River Job Corps administrator Jerri Prejean. “It’s so sad.”

Bool just arrived at the center in April. He is nearly finished with the online high school program to earn his diploma but won’t be able to start his training in petroleum. Though disappointed by the news, Bool showed resilience beyond his years. 
“I was kind of disappointed because I have no place to go, so I thought they were just gonna put me back on the streets,” he said. “But it is what it is. I can only control myself and my choices and what I’m gonna do, I cannot control the situation because it’s out of my hands. So I just gotta stay positive.”
Not everyone was as upbeat. 
Jamie Maloid, 25, is one of the lucky ones. Having arrived at Job Corps in 2023, he just graduated after finishing his certifications in the petroleum program. He plans to move to Greeley and start a career. 
“For the other people that aren’t finished, I feel bad,” Maloid said. “I kind of feel like just taking that opportunity away from them that I was able to gain is heartbreaking.”
Incidents, budget
Job Corps is a 61-year-old federal program that offers free career training for low-income young adults. Funded by Congress, the program seeks to teach young people the academic and vocational skills they need to secure meaningful and lasting employment. The program was created in 1964 as part of President Lyndon B. Johnson’s War on Poverty.
Wind River Job Corps is a comparatively new center. The campus opened in 2015, north of Riverton, to much fanfare with dignitaries attending the grand opening and touting the economic boost promised by its first-of-its-kind petroleum technician training program.
It includes classrooms, hands-on training facilities and dorms. Students come from around the country to attend the program, including from Wyoming and the nearby Wind River Indian Reservation. Through the program, they can obtain their driver’s licence, high school diploma and career preparation in one of 10 trades — from carpentry to electrical work and heavy equipment mechanics.

Once they get their certifications, Prejean said, staff ushers them through a transition phase to ensure the student has job placement, an apprenticeship, college, military or advanced training. Wind River Job Corps even pays to fly the students to where their next life stage will take place. 
“I try to do job placement with students around our community,” Prejean said, noting that she works with local companies like Bechtel Construction to funnel skilled workers into Wyoming positions. 
Some 75% of Wind River Job Corps students graduate, she said. “Of those, 85% go to a job trade match. You don’t even have those kinds of numbers from college.”
The success of Riverton’s center does not match a national narrative cited in the closure decree, Prejean said.
In April, the Department of Labor released the Job Corps Transparency Report, which analyzed the financial performance and operational costs of the most recently available metrics from program year 2023. According to that report, the national program’s average graduation rate is less than 40%, and it costs $80,000 per student per year. Job Corps also has faced significant financial challenges under its current operating structure, the DOL release said, including a $140 million deficit in 2024.   
Those findings spurred the DOL to pause the program. It halted contracts to its 99 contract-operated centers, which will impact an estimated 25,000 students. 
“A startling number of serious incident reports and our in-depth fiscal analysis reveal the program is no longer achieving the intended outcomes that students deserve,” Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer said in a release about the pause.

The narrative painted in that report — which used data from the end of the COVID-19 pandemic — is incongruous with Wind River Job Corps, Prejean said. It has clear benefits to students, local businesses that need skilled workers and the 150 employees who are residents of Fremont County, she said. 
Due to DOL’s mandate, Wind River staff are anticipating a closing day of June 23 unless some overriding action occurs. The outcome of the federal budget bill, officially called the “One Big, Beautiful Bill Act,” could also impact the program. The bill passed the U.S. House last week and must still clear the Senate. 
“All students will be connected with the resources they need to succeed as this transition takes place,” the DOL said in its release. 
At Wind River, however, staff and students did not see it that way. 
Uncertainty
In the final weeks before the anticipated closing, staff are racing to secure job placements and obtain diplomas for the students. But for students and staff, the future beyond that is a question mark. 
Jaden Flowers, 23, didn’t finish high school in Los Angeles, where he grew up. He had a child at age 15 and his mom was sick, he said, so school wasn’t a priority. He migrated to Colorado after that, and was unhoused and unable to find a job this spring when he discovered Job Corps.

He’s only been in Riverton for two months and said it’s been a great experience. He is trying to get as many petroleum certifications as possible before June 23, he said, so at least he’ll have some leverage for finding a job. In terms of a plan, however, he hasn’t figured that out. 
“I don’t really have nowhere to go, so it’s just back to where I left off,” he said. 
That’s a common story, he added. 
“It’s a mess. It’s crazy how they’re just kicking us out, with nothing, no place to go,” Flowers said. Wind River Job Corps teachers are doing everything they can to help, he added. “They are really trying.” 
Joshuwa Begley, 25, is nearly finished with the program. He arrived two years ago, looking for a change from his life of meaningless jobs and substance abuse, he said. It worked. 
“I changed my life,” he said. “I am a year sober from all the drugs I used to do.”
He earned his high school diploma at Job Corps and just needs to pass a final test to complete his heavy truck driving program.

Begley had intended to stay in the area and had found a job with a local construction business. But because he won’t receive the completion money promised to him in the Job Corps contract and he doesn’t have a place to live, he said, he is instead going back to Georgia where he’ll move in with his grandmother. 
“It just kind of sucks,” Begley said. “All my hard work is going down the drain.”
Junior Chapa, 21, was incarcerated for two years in prison in Texas. When he got out, his probation officer suggested Job Corps. 
“So I came here to better myself, get my high school and my trade and stuff like that,” he said. He intended to obtain heavy truck driving and petroleum-related certifications. “This was like my only option to do better.”
He isn’t sure what he’ll do now, he said. 
Employees are also reeling, said Samantha March, who works in human resources. Many staffers have come to her seeking answers, she said Wednesday, pausing as she choked up. “And we don’t have any to give.” 
Another employee, Kathy, who declined to give her last name, said she worked all weekend trying to help students. 
The closure is profoundly unfortunate, she said. “We may not be 100% successful with every student that comes here, but we have changed enough lives that it is 100% worth it.”

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)Early 2027 could be when Rhode Island’s two casinos finally go smoke free under a compromise brokered by the Senate’s new majority leader.
Senate Majority Leader Frank Ciccone, a Providence Democrat, told Rhode Island Current Thursday that legislation will likely come before the Senate Committee on Labor and Gaming next week. The long-awaited proposal ends a loophole that has allowed Bally’s Lincoln and Tiverton casinos to avoid the state’s indoor smoking ban.
“This took a lot of time meeting with Bally’s and the union representing the people there,” Ciccone said in an interview
But Patti Doyle, a Bally’s spokesperson, said it’s not a done deal.
“Conversations between Bally’s and other stakeholders are ongoing,” Doyle said in an email.
Ciccone has long opposed banning smoking at the two casinos, saying he believes it would cost visitors, and revenue. He initially sought to negotiate an agreement between the Providence-based casino giant and its union workers to expand existing non-smoking areas at the Lincoln facility. But union officials opposed any deals that kept smoke inside, Ciccone said.
Rhode Island AFL-CIO President Patrick Crowley said in an interview Thursday that workers were willing to find common ground, but their goal was always to get smoking out of the state’s two casinos.
“It’s not good for them, it’s not good for the customers, it’s not good for the state,” Crowley said.
So Ciccone instead focused on what Bally’s could stomach in the effort to end smoking. That led to his last-minute filing of a bill, submitted on May 23, to raise the cap on marketing reimbursements the company receives from the Rhode Island Lottery — a measure the Senate approved 32-4 on Tuesday despite objections from state regulators.
While seemingly unrelated to the smoking debate, the marketing measure intends to help Bally’s offset any revenue losses from a smoking ban. The company has projected an annual loss of $20 million, Doyle previously said.
Should the revised legislation be approved by the General Assembly, Ciccone said the ban would take effect January 2027. The original companion bills introduced by Sen. V. Susan Sosnowski and Rep. Teresa Tanzi, both South Kingstown Democrats, called for smoking inside the state’s casinos to cease immediately upon the governor’s signature.
Sosnowski did not immediately respond to request for comment.
Tanzi questioned why the Senate would consider allowing employees to work within the smoke for an additional 18 months.
“These workers deserve to have a smoke-free environment now,” she said in an interview. “I look forward to understanding the justification of the 18-month delay.”
But Crowley called Ciccone’s proposed date “a big win” for Bally’s workers, who have spent years urging lawmakers to end smoking at casinos. The proposal was among the top legislative priorities this year for the AFL-CIO, which commissioned a poll in February suggesting nearly 7 in 10 survey respondents “strongly” or “somewhat” supported a smoking ban.
Legislative leaders also appear on board. Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi is one of 10 co-sponsors listed on the latest edition of Tanzi’s bill, which has the backing of 55 of the chamber’s 75 members. Senate President Valarie Lawson, an East Providence Democrat, has stated she personally supports a smoking ban.

Senate rolls the dice on more online betting vendors 
New compromise struck on the smoking ban comes a day after the Senate voted 30-3 in support of Ciccone’s bill to open Rhode Island’s online sports betting industry to new vendors, ending International Game Technology (IGT) PLC’s five-year monopoly over the state’s digital sportsbook.
Democratic Sens. Dawn Euer of Newport, Tiara Mack of Providence, and Linda Ujifusa of Portsmouth voted against the legislation.
The bill as approved in a revised form bars the Rhode Island Lottery from extending IGT’s contract beyond Jan. 31, 2026, even though the company’s deal to operate the Sportsbook RI app runs through November of that year. Ciccone said Thursday that the change was made to align with the Lottery’s plans to issue a request for information on expansion in the first quarter of 2026.
A Lottery-commissioned report by Spectrum Gaming Group recommended adding four to six new online sports betting vendors, but only if the state makes itself more attractive to popular companies like DraftKings and FanDuel.
Spectrum found that companies may not be interested in expanding to Rhode Island due to its 51% tax on operators’ revenues — tied with New York and New Hampshire for the steepest in the country.
Lottery Director Mark Furcolo wrote to the Senate Committee on Gaming and Labor on April 30 that the legislation could violate regulators’ constitutional authority to renew gaming contracts. Furcolo also had concerns with the economic feasibility of expanding to five vendors.
“The bill now addresses our primary concerns but does not eliminate the constitutional issue raised in the letter,” Paul Grimaldi, a spokesperson for the Lottery, said in an email Thursday.
Ciccone’s bill now heads to the House for consideration. Companion legislation sponsored by Rep. Matthew Dawson, an East Providence Democrat, remains held for further study following its initial May 1 hearing before the House Committee on Finance.

Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser is term-limited and announced he will run for Colorado governor in 2026. The Democrat has joined a growing number of legal challenges to Trump administration policies. 
Other Democrats running for attorney general include Secretary of State Jena Griswold, Boulder District Attorney Michael Dougherty, former speaker of the Colorado House of Representatives Crisanta Duran and worker and consumer rights attorney David Seligman. Conner Pennington is the only Republican candidate to file paperwork in the race so far.
Doshi’s campaign website says she will focus on defending Colorado from actions from the Trump administration, fighting for a fair economy and protecting Colorado’s rights, values and public safety. 
“Right now, the rule of law is under attack by those who have abandoned patriotism for power. Colorado’s next Attorney General must have a proven record of taking on the toughest fights — and winning,” Doshi said. “I’ve taken on powerful executives in boardrooms and corrupt officials in government, and I’m ready to defend the rights and freedoms of every Coloradan.”
The attorney general heads the Colorado Department of Law and oversees enforcement of consumer protection and antitrust laws, defends state laws in legal challenges, and advocates for law enforcement and community safety.  
Primary elections to decide party nominees for state offices will be held in June 2026.

“The President’s budget will greatly endanger wild horses and burros,” Rep. Dina Titus, a Democrat from Nevada, said in a statement to the Current. “I am deeply concerned by how these cuts will impact the care of these beloved creatures. Even more worrying is the omission of the long-standing provision against horse slaughter.”
The proposal, horse and burro advocates note, mirrors Trump’s 2017 budget, which initially called for a 30% cut to the program’s funding and the elimination of protections against slaughter. Congress restored the protections against killing the animals and augmented funding.
“Typically, the president’s appropriations bill contains a provision prohibiting horse slaughter. The Trump budget bill does not have this provision, opening the door to animals being sold off for slaughter,” said Dick Cooper, a spokesman for Titus.

The budget proposal is straight from the pages of Project 2025, the ultra-conservative manifesto of which Trump once claimed ignorance, but has since adopted de facto as a blueprint for his policies.
“What is happening to these once-proud beasts of burden is neither compassionate nor humane, and what these animals are doing to federal lands and fragile ecosystems is unacceptable,” says Project 2025, which asserted “the uncontrolled growth of wild horses and burros poses an existential threat to public lands.”
More than half of the nation’s wild horses, estimated between 70,000 and 95,000, are in Nevada, notes Project 2025. “Congress must enact laws permitting the BLM to dispose humanely of these animals.”
The policy is an “attack on animal welfare and America’s public lands,” according to American Wild Horse Conservation (AWHC), a wild horse advocacy organization.
“This budget would be a bullet to the head of America’s wild horses if passed by Congress,” said Suzanne Roy, executive director of AWHC. “Slaughter is a barbaric solution to a fundamentally broken federal program.”
The current program is focused on what critics contend are inhumane roundups that end in the warehousing of the creatures in government holding facilities.
A better solution, say horse advocates, is increasing fertility control efforts and restoring habitat.
Last month, Titus announced the formation of the Wild Horse Congressional Caucus, “to encourage federal policies for more humane treatment of wild horses and burros,” according to a news release.
Days later, Titus and 82 members of Congress urged a subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee to craft legislation requiring the BLM to spend at least 10% of the Wild Horse and Burro program’s $140 million budget on fertility control in additional herd management areas.
Utah horseman concludes 6,000-mile ride through 25 states to spotlight the wild horse crisis

“The letter included several requests but notably included language maintaining the prohibition on the sale or adoption of healthy wild horses and burros that results in their destruction,” Titus said in a news release.
Titus has opposed the BLM’s use of aircraft in roundups. The U.S. has paid helicopter companies $57.4 million for roundups since 2006, according to Titus, a process she has attempted to ban.
“Scientific research has shown that more humane and cost-effective alternatives, like fertility control, are equally effective in controlling equine populations,” according to the May statement from Titus announcing the Wild Horse caucus. “The BLM’s Wild Horse and Burro Program, however, currently spends less than four percent of its budget on these methods.”
Diverse interests, ranging from cattle ranchers to animal activists, have called for vast reductions to wild horse populations, which they contend are three times the number public lands can accommodate.
“The greatest threat to our wild horses and burros and our public lands right now isn’t the BLM, it’s not cattle, ranching or mining interests. It’s not animal advocates. It’s climate change and the new reality is fast settling in,” Stephanie Boyles Griffin, the chief scientist of the Humane Society of the United States’ (now Humane World for Animals’) wildlife protection department,  told Reuters in 2021.
Americans, deeply divided on a plethora of topics, are on common ground when it comes to wild horses, says AWHC, which commissioned a 2017 poll that revealed 83% of Trump voters supported protecting wild horses and burros from slaughter, compared with 77% of Hillary Clinton’s supporters.
“After decades of costly and ineffective roundups, the BLM now stockpiles more wild horses in government pens than remain free on the range,” said Roy in a news release. “Americans deserve a better federal plan that  genuinely tackles off-range holding issues without resorting to slaughter.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-05 18:10:12+00:00,CT Mirror,"CT municipal camp bills, proposed after Bethany scandal, expire",Laura Tillman,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/05/bethany-ct-scandal-camp-licensure-bill/,Proposed regulations spurred by a child sex abuse scandal at a Bethany camp will not come to pass after session ended without a vote on them.,"Some lawmakers’ attempts to pass two bills spurred by a child sex abuse scandal at a town-run camp in Bethany came to an end at midnight on Wednesday when the legislative session came to a close. 
Senate Bill 6, which would have required camps operated by towns and cities across Connecticut to be regulated by the state, had received support in the Senate, but efforts to move that forward came to an unceremonious end when the House failed to take it up on the last day of the session. House Bill 6952, which would have required a more limited set of safety measures for those camps, was never voted on by either chamber.
“It’s very unfortunate, disappointing,” Sen. Jorge Cabrera, D-Bethany, told The Connecticut Mirror on the Senate floor Wednesday night. “I hope that we’ll get the chance to try again next year.”
Cabrera said he thinks that confusion over S.B. 6 and its impact stood in its way. In addition to other unrelated provisions on food assistance, disconnected youth and the Early Start program, that bill would have required municipal camps to be licensed by the Office of Early Childhood in the same way that private camps are. 
Municipalities overwhelmingly voiced opposition to the legislation, citing concerns about the financial impact of complying with regulations like ratios of bathrooms to the number of campers. They said that such changes could close camps and shut low-income families out of an inexpensive child care option in the summer months. Advocates argued that these concerns were overblown and that it was possible to get to a middle ground that would have assured the safety of campers with only modest increases in cost.
The bill gained traction after a scathing report was released on May 15 that detailed the findings of an internal investigation into how the town of Bethany and its first selectwoman, Paula Cofrancesco, handled allegations of sexual abuse by an employee who worked with children at the local school and in the town-run summer camp. 
After Cofrancesco learned of those allegations, the report found that she deceived Bethany residents and failed to protect local children from an alleged abuser — then resisted efforts to make those programs safer. More than a year later, no arrest had been made despite findings by experts at the Yale Child Advocacy Center and the state Department of Children and Families that the allegations were credible, and in that time an additional victim alleges she was abused.
The report also found that Bethany’s Parks and Recreation Department was poorly run. According to the report, the department “had no filing or record-keeping system, written safety policies, or documented training protocols for its staff.” 
According to an interview in the report with Cofrancesco’s assistant, no background checks were conducted until 2024. 
Cofrancesco was among the voices of opposition back in 2023 when the legislature took up a similar bill that attempted to create oversight for town camps. At the time, she argued that municipal camps already received enough oversight, including from elected leaders like herself.
Sen. Ceci Maher, D-Wilton, who is co-chair of the Committee on Children, had championed the bill’s passage on the Senate floor. She said that licensing municipal camps is an equity issue, because many low-income families rely on town camps and should be able to count on them to be checked for safety, on par with the way the state regulates private camps.
Maher said she believes there is a pathway forward to come to an agreement in the future and had hoped to carve out a middle ground that would have satisfied the concerns of municipalities. She had hoped to develop a task force to bring stakeholders to the table to discuss the best path forward.
“The most important thing to me is that municipal camps are taking care of our children, that our children are safe, that parents know that their child is safe in the summer,” she said. “Most parents drop their kids off and have no idea that they are not licensed and there’s no oversight except through the municipality. So, we want to make sure that there’s first aid training, that there’s mandated reporter training, that they have staffing ratios that make sense that keep kids safe.”
H.B. 6952 was an attempt to carve out a more modest set of regulations based on safety concerns. That bill would have required prospective employees age 18 and older to submit to comprehensive background checks, which many municipal camps say that they already do but which is not required by the state. It would also have required at least one staff member over the age of 18 for every 12 children, mandatory reporter training for leadership, and that such programs, because they are exempt from camp licensing, would not be allowed to call themselves “camps.” 
Many municipal Parks and Recreation departments took issue with the bills. In written testimony, Stephanie Crane, the recreation director for Bolton, said the S.B. 6 “could result in reduced program registrations, the loss of high school employees, and potentially force the closure of many recreational programs due to staffing shortages.”
Sen. Cathy Osten, D-Sprague, also spoke out in opposition to the bill on the Senate floor. 
“I think it’s a great thing that you want to feel better, but I can tell you that you are not going to protect children with a piece of legislation that will not stop someone from putting hands on children,” Osten said on the Senate floor. “The only thing that stops people from putting hands on children is to put them in jail, to incarcerate those people, to make sure they stay there a really long time. And when they get out to follow them and make sure they get the treatment they can. And our bills today don’t address that issue.” 
Rep. Mary Welander, D-Orange, said she hoped to come to the table next year, and was encouraged by testimony submitted by municipal camps.
“The good news is that through the public hearing we did learn that the overwhelming majority, if not the entirety of municipal camps are already doing the vast majority of what was being asked for,” she said.
Welander said that while background checks would not have prevented the Bethany case, since that counselor did not yet have a record at the time of the alleged abuse, the internal investigation did raise concerns and questions about what else could be done to prevent a similar case in the future. 
“It’s not just about background checks, it’s also about best practices,” she said, emphasizing that there should be measures in place to ensure that concerning behavior is addressed, “and that the people that work with the children are taught to recognize the signs that something might be going on that is unacceptable.”
But for Acting Child Advocate Christina Ghio, background checks are still the major focus. 
“From our perspective the core of the issue is that background checking, so I hope there is a way to make sure that, at a minimum, we can get background checks for all of those settings even if we can’t get full licensure.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024_1001_SR_Bethany_015-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-05 14:12:26.966485

As part of police accountability measures passed in 2021, the Legislature required law enforcement agencies to report to the state Criminal Justice Training Commission when officers leave the department for any reason, use force that results in death or serious injury, are charged with a crime or are found to commit certain misconduct.
The law also required departments to continue investigations even if an officer resigns before the probe is finished.
This is meant to ensure “bad-apple” officers who should lose their state certification don’t slip through the cracks. Losing those credentials blocks officers from working as police in the state, even if they quit their job to evade formal discipline.
The Criminal Justice Training Commission suspected agencies weren’t reporting misconduct as they should have. So it requested the state auditor’s office look into compliance.
Officials see the resulting audits as a teaching moment on the new reporting requirements. The objective is to increase public trust and improve transparency.
“This isn’t like a gotcha, it’s not a punishment,” said Kimberly Bliss, the commission’s assistant director focused on certification. “This is an educational piece for us to make sure that agencies across the board learn what they’re supposed to be doing.”
Last month, Bliss and Michael Huynh, from the state auditor’s office, led a presentation on the audits at the Washington Association of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs conference in Spokane. Afterward, police officials told Bliss they realized they hadn’t reported correctly.
The first two new audits, of the Renton and Des Moines police departments, both showed missteps.
After reviewing department records, auditors found Des Moines didn’t report three of four sustained misconduct allegations. That conduct included violations of the state’s controversial pursuit law that lawmakers later rolled back, wrongful use of a Taser and improper handling of drug evidence.
Des Moines Police Chief Ted Boe blamed the lack of reporting on the law being unclear. For example, while some parts of the statute are more specific, one provision says officers can be decertified for failing “to meet the ethical and professional standards required of a peace officer or corrections officer.”
In response, the Criminal Justice Training Commission agreed to develop guidance on what conduct falls under that umbrella.
Des Moines also notified the state training commission of all officers who had left, but four of those notices came well after the 15-day window in the law.
Meanwhile, in Renton, auditors found the department didn’t report that two officers were involved in a use of force incident in 2022 until learning of the audit. The chief said this was an oversight.
Renton also was a little late on reporting two officer separations.
For both departments, the auditor’s office recommended outlining the reporting process in agency policy.
“One thing we found was that one person would be responsible for notifications, and if they didn’t do it, no one knew,” said Huynh, a program manager with the auditor’s office.
Police accountability advocates see failing to comply with the law as a symptom of a systemic problem.
“This is not an oversight. It’s a pattern. A culture. One where data is withheld, timelines are ignored, and truth is treated like a suggestion,” Nickeia Hunter, whose brother was killed by police, said in an email. “Until truth is demanded and enforced, we will remain stuck in a cycle where transparency is performative and justice is optional.”
Next up for these new state audits are the Kitsap County Sheriff’s Office and the police wing of the state Department of Fish and Wildlife. Auditors will continue looking into a pair of agencies at a time indefinitely.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/police-cars-night-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-05 14:12:26.966485

Renee Erickson, second from left, a Wichita Republican who leads the Kansas Legislature's school finance task force, said Kansas should retain use of high school graduation statistics to measure student achievement despite criticism it was unclear earning the diploma meant students were prepared for college or the workforce. (Kansas Reflector screen capture from Legislature's YouTube channel)TOPEKA — Disagreement exists on the Kansas Legislature’s task force reworking the state’s public school finance formula about the importance of high school graduation rate as a measure of student success.
A member of the task force pointed to alleged manipulation of student records at Wichita Southeast High School as evidence of why a district’s annual graduation rate shouldn’t be viewed as a significant metric, while others defended graduation rates as an evaluation tool when determining whether districts prepared students for the workplace or college.
Rep. Kristey Williams, an Augusta Republican, said the Wichita school district had touted a 5.1 percentage point surge in its graduation rate in 2024 to 84.3%. Wichita Southeast’s graduation rate climbed 12.5 percentage points in 2024 to a record-high 86.3%.
Southeast’s principal was replaced last week amid reports of suspected grade fixing that may have been associated with helping students meet graduation requirements.
“I wouldn’t use graduation rates,” said Williams, who didn’t see a meaningful correlation between graduation rate and student success. “If we want to baby sit, that’s one thing. If we want to have a safe place for them, that’s one thing. But that doesn’t mean you’re learning anything.”
Frank Harwood, a deputy commissioner of the Kansas State Department of Education, said one potential incident of administrative misconduct shouldn’t justify dismissal of graduation rates as a means of measuring school districts.
“When you look at any industry, including the Legislature, there are bad actors,” he said. “It doesn’t mean you should throw out that metric all together. I’m not saying graduation rate is the best indicator, but I think it is an indicator that we can’t just ignore.”
The Kansas State Board of Education made elevating the state’s high school graduation rate a feature in its “Kansans Can” agenda and in terms of school district accreditation. The state board’s graduation-rate goal was set at 95%.
Kansas’ adjusted cohort graduation rate, which tracked student graduation within four years and took into account transfers, has ranged from 86% to 89% during the past decade.
In 2022-2023, more than 90 of the state’s 287 school districts graduated 100% of students. Twenty school districts had graduation rates below 80% during that academic year. The Wichita district’s graduation rate was at 79.2% during that period, while the Kansas City, Kansas, district came in at 73.4%.
Sen. Renee Erickson, a Wichita Republican serving as chairwoman of the Legislature’s school-finance task force, said Kansas should continue to include graduation rate in a set of evaluation metrics. She said the state needed to develop a definition of what a high school diploma revealed about students.
Erickson said employers had reported a high school diploma didn’t guarantee a quality worker. University or college officials indicated high school graduates didn’t necessarily have skills to succeed in higher education, she said.
“I have post-secondary folks in my office frequently and they’re saying, ‘They’re not prepared for our level of work,'” the senator said. “I’m not blaming. I’m just telling you, if you can’t acknowledge that, we’ve got a problem.”
Task force member Pat Pettey, a Democratic senator from Kansas City, Kansas, said it would be folly to drop the graduation rate as an indicator of a school district’s ability to prepare students for the future.
“I still am a strong supporter of graduation rates because having a high school diploma is a key to opening the first door to get a job. I don’t believe it is the key, but if they don’t have that they’re not on a trajectory to be economically successful,” Pettey said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Renee-Erickson-education-task-force.png,,,2025-06-05 14:12:26.966485

(Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator)Over the past few months, Celina Damian’s phone has been ringing off the hook with one bewildered, anxious question after another: “What kind of loan is this?” “Am I in default?” “Will the government really take my wages?”
“Sometimes they just don’t know where to start,” said Damian, California’s student loan servicing ombudsperson.
“I’m talking to borrowers from all ages, from new borrowers to — I have 80-, 90-year-old borrowers,” she said.
The federal government last month restarted collections on defaulted loans. State student loan ombudspersons such as Damian have become some of the only sources of contact for worried borrowers lost in a tangle of conflicting information at the federal level about their loan status and repayment options.
The U.S. Department of Education began collecting on defaulted student loans in May for the first time since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020.
Federal student loans issued by the U.S. Department of Education come with fixed rates, set repayment plans and borrower protections. Private servicers handle billing, repayment-plan enrollments and defaults.
More than 5 million borrowers are in delinquency, and nearly 10 million — about 25% of the federal student loan portfolio — are at risk of default within months, according to data from the U.S. Department of Education.
States can’t cancel that debt, but they do register and oversee servicers operating in their states, run ombuds offices, tweak tax rules and offer outreach or limited grants — actions aimed at reducing defaults and the economic fallout.

When borrowers default, states will likely feel the economic impact. They might lose tax revenue as homebuying stalls. They could end up paying more for Medicaid and social services if borrowers need to rely on them. And students with loan debt may be reluctant to go into lower-paying public-sector work, leading to staffing shortages at state agencies.
A borrower is considered delinquent after missing a payment to the servicing companies that handle billing, repayment plan enrollments, and defaults.
Damian’s office, established under California’s Student Borrower Bill of Rights, began as a narrow statutory role but now serves as a hub for outreach, “Student Loan 101” workshops and escalated complaints to federal agencies.
Roughly 16 states plus the District of Columbia have followed suit, creating ombuds offices to guide borrowers through confusing paperwork and misinformation. Damian believes these ombuds offices should be in every state, as borrowers across the country will likely have similar questions and little help at the federal level.
“If you don’t have an ombudsperson or even just a person at the state level who can educate borrowers, that will make a difference,” Damian told Stateline. “These borrowers are trying to pay, but the system is broken. No other financial product works this way.”
Student loans became a key issue during last year’s election race, with President Joe Biden blocked by the U.S. Supreme Court in his effort to offer relief to 40 million Americans. In its waning days, his administration did forgive loans for some 150,000 borrowers under previous programs.
But President Donald Trump opposes most loan forgiveness programs, and in May, the U.S. Education Department issued a “Dear Colleague” letter to higher education institutions, reminding them of their legal obligations to help former students understand repayment responsibilities and access support.










These borrowers are trying to pay, but the system is broken. No other financial product works this way.


– Celina Damian, California student loan servicing ombudsperson


Some conservative economists say that federal loan forgiveness and financial aid hurt all students, offering colleges an incentive to raise tuition or lower their own institutional aid.
Winston Berkman-Breen, the legal director at the Student Borrower Protection Center, a nonprofit aimed at protecting borrowers and improving the repayment system, said that more than 2 million borrowers are stuck in a backlog of unprocessed applications for income-driven repayment (IDR) plans — calculated pay structures meant to keep payments affordable based on a borrower’s income.
Other borrowers have called federal agencies for help only to find that U.S. Education Department staff, including servicer-oversight teams, have been laid off as the Trump administration works toward dismantling the department entirely.
“There was an expectation to repay,” Berkman-Breen said. “But there was also an expectation that people would have access to affordable plans. That promise has broken down.”
States now have three primary tools to address student loan debt, Berkman-Breen said: enforcement actions to protect consumers, such as the 39-state lawsuit against servicer Navient; legal oversight by suing to uphold or challenge federal policy; and direct outreach to help public servants access Public Service Loan Forgiveness and similar programs.
Nineteen states now require registration for companies that service student loans, he said. And more than a dozen states align with federal policy to exempt forgiven loan balances from state income taxes.
‘Can’t wait for Washington’
Connecticut state Rep. Eleni Kavros DeGraw, a Democrat, calls student debt “a drag on the economy,” and said states can’t afford to wait for Congress — mired in partisan gridlock over student loan forgiveness — to find common ground.
“[Student debt] is stopping people from buying homes, starting families and fully participating in the economy,” she told Stateline. “That hurts us as a state, as a city, and we can’t wait for Washington to figure it out.”
Last year, Connecticut created a bipartisan reimbursement program that provides up to $20,000 for graduates of local colleges who make payments and complete community service. The state has distributed more than $2 million so far.

Kavros DeGraw hopes the program can serve as a model, and has already talked with lawmakers in other states on possibly developing their own versions of it.
“These were people who were already paying,” Kavros DeGraw said. “It just made sense. I think it’s something that other states could explore this session, and it would provide an immense deal of relief.”
Lawmakers in other states also have considered student loan legislation. This year, New Jersey introduced bills to register education lenders and cap interest rates. Lawmakers in New Mexico, New York and North Carolina have proposed Borrower Bill of Rights legislation. Arizona has a registration bill for private servicers. None of these measures has advanced far.
According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, more than 20 states have enacted laws expanding loan forgiveness, repayment programs and servicer oversight in recent years.
Several states are also investing directly in workforce-aligned loan forgiveness: Georgia expanded its service-cancelable loan program to cover dental students working in rural areas. Idaho created a loan repayment incentive for rural nurses. Kentucky now offers $5,000 stipends to attract new teachers. Maryland authorized Anne Arundel County to launch a local forgiveness program for public school educators.
Repayment
Student loan stress is not evenly distributed. Seven states, all with Republican‐controlled legislatures, report delinquency rates above 30% among borrowers required to make payments.
Mississippi leads the nation with a conditional delinquency rate of nearly 45% — meaning borrowers who should be making payments are late. That’s just ahead of Alabama, West Virginia, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana, all of which have rates above 31%, according to recent data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
By contrast, Illinois, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Vermont and New Hampshire maintain delinquency rates below 15%.
Experts say this chasm reflects deeper systemic differences, such as lower median incomes in higher delinquency states, along with weaker consumer protections and a higher share of students attending for-profit institutions or leaving college without a degree.
States also have promoted the federal Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, established in 2007, that offers help to public service professionals. New Mexico has an outreach campaign that includes prospective teachers and health care workers. Maine has provided guidance to public defenders on how they can take advantage of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program and touts a related state tax credit on a marketing site to lure new residents.

“States can regulate and enforce, but they can’t fix the structural problems in how repayment is administered,” said Michele Zampini, senior director of college affordability at The Institute for College Access & Success, a research organization that advocates for students. “They’re helping around the edges, but the core system is still broken.”
A November report from the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau found at least 3.9 million borrowers received misleading or inaccurate bills from servicing companies.
“The repayment system is not in a good place to provide the services and repayment options borrowers are legally entitled to,” Zampini said.
The Student Loan Borrower Survey, conducted between October 2023 and January 2024, found that 61% of borrowers who received debt relief made a beneficial life change earlier than they otherwise could have. Yet borrower awareness remains dangerously low: Nearly 42% of federal borrowers have only been on the standard repayment plan, and 31% of those didn’t know other options, such as an income-based plan, existed.
In California, a major part of Damian’s job in the past few months has been to help borrowers access existing forgiveness programs.
Meanwhile, new federal policy proposals could reshape repayment entirely. The Trump-backed One Big Beautiful Bill Act would consolidate existing IDR plans into a single tiered structure, with lower-income borrowers paying flat monthly rates and higher earners contributing 8% of their income. The bill also proposes extending standard repayment terms to 30 years — raising concerns it could delay forgiveness and inflate total interest costs.
The bill passed the U.S. House and is pending in the Senate.
‘Incentive to hike prices’
Andrew Gillen, a Cato Institute research fellow who recently testified before Congress, argues that any meaningful fix must address the incentives driving rising tuition — namely, federal aid being tied directly to college sticker prices.
“The link between rising tuition and increasing aid is what drives the Bennett Hypothesis, where federal student aid, in the form of loans, can lead to higher tuition costs at colleges and universities,” Gillen said in an interview. “If we instead use the median cost of attendance to calculate aid eligibility, we remove colleges’ incentive to hike prices just to capture more aid.”
Even without agreement on blanket forgiveness, experts agree on smaller bipartisan steps: streamlined repayment, stronger servicer oversight and targeted help for borrowers with the greatest need.
“We don’t want people defaulting. We don’t want payments that are too high for people just out of school. That should be the bipartisan starting point,” Zampini said.

Potholes deepen in Fairbanks, washed-out culverts block salmon in the Mat-Su, and rural communities from Ketchikan to Kotzebue are left waiting on repairs that may never come. A trip on the Kenai Peninsula leaves your teeth rattling and your fishing poles clanking in the back of your rig. Our state’s transportation system is in a state of disrepair.  
And yet the state is poised to spend at least half a billion dollars building a second bridge across one of Alaska’s most ecologically significant and beloved wetlands: the Mendenhall Wetlands in Juneau. 
The proposed Juneau-Douglas Second Crossing – termed the Juneau Douglas North Crossing by DOWL, the engineering firm contracted to assess and build this structure – is being marketed as a strategy to reduce commute times, link the Douglas Island communities to emergency services, and promote development. But even if these reasons are held up under scrutiny – and none of them are as simple as they sound – the second bridge comes at a staggering cost estimated between $290-450 million. In a time when Alaska faces over $2 billion in deferred maintenance on existing roads and bridges, we must ask: Is this the best use of public funds? 
Juneau has already developed more than 40% of its wetlands. In a state where habitat loss is often distant and gradual, the proposed Second Crossing represents an immediate and irreversible threat to an intact, high-value ecosystem. Once roads and bridges fragment this landscape, the consequences – disrupted migration, habitat degradation, declining fish and bird populations— are permanent.  
A Highway to Nowhere?
The Juneau Douglas Second Crossing’s installation bill could exceed half a billion dollars, which doesn’t include annual maintenance costs. That’s money that could fix existing infrastructure all over the state, such as roads that rural Alaskans use to access schools, groceries, medical care, and subsistence hunting and fishing grounds. Project funds could also easily maintain the bridge that currently exists between Douglas Island and the Juneau mainland.  
Unlike these lifeline routes, the Second Crossing is a convenience project, not a necessity. Juneau’s population is gradually shrinking. The most cost-efficient second bridges would shave only a few miles off driving time from the existing bridge. The roads and bridges in place today are not failing. This is a solution in search of a problem, and it comes at a cost that all Alaskans would bear. 
 A Wetland of Global Significance

This project just doesn’t pencil out and is not fiscally responsible. The Mendenhall Wetlands are one of the most ecologically important habitats in Alaska, recognized globally as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by the National Audubon Society. A 5,000-acre ecosystem provides essential habitat for millions of migratory birds traveling the Pacific Flyway each year—including sandpipers, dowitchers, plovers, and waterfowl. These wetlands are also a critical nursery for salmon and trout, with rich tidal channels that shelter juvenile fish before they head to sea. The Mendenhall Wetlands have been called the Heart of Juneau. 
It’s not just birdwatchers and fishers who value the space. The Mendenhall State Game Refuge was designated in 1976 by the Alaska State Legislature. It was in part designated so hunters could pursue waterfowl and have an accessible place to hunt. In 2023, the Alaska Department of Fish & Game added over a dozen anadromous fish to the Anadromous Waters Catalog (AWC) fish streams after surveying the wetlands. A total of 230 species of birds have been documented within the wetlands – that’s 69% of the 335 bird species for all of Southeast Alaska – including 36 different waterfowl species, according to Audubon Alaska. The Mendenhall Wetlands support one of Southeast Alaska’s most popular and accessible waterfowl hunting areas, drawing hunters from across the region each fall and over 1800 annual local resident hunters (ADF&G). 
For many, it’s a tradition passed down through generations, a place where families hunt ducks and geese on public lands, some just minutes from their homes.  
 The Opportunity Cost

Building this road means more than just the loss of habitat. It means lost opportunities elsewhere. Alaska’s existing road system is aging and underfunded. Major corridors in the Interior and Southcentral suffer from poor drainage and frost damage. Coastal communities face landslide risks and storm-damaged causeways. Ferry service remains unreliable for many Southeast residents. Every dollar spent on a vanity project like the Second Crossing is a dollar not spent on infrastructure Alaskans actually rely on. 
Let’s be clear: this is not a NIMBY (not-in-my-backyard) issue. It’s a matter of statewide priorities. From Cold Bay to Prudhoe, we all have a stake in how limited public funds are used. Do we choose to invest in maintenance, safety, and real community needs, or spend lavishly on speculative development that benefits a few, while costing us all? 
 A Smarter Path Forward

Alaska doesn’t need another expensive, new road project. What we need is leadership that respects our budget, our wildlife, and our way of life. Preserving the Mendenhall Wetlands as a globally important ecosystem, a rich fish and wildlife habitat, and a cornerstone of Southeast Alaska’s outdoor traditions is not just the right thing to do—it’s the smart thing. 
Let’s repair what is broken. Let’s protect what is working. And let’s leave the Mendenhall Wetlands wild for the generations of Alaskans yet to come, like nature, and the state legislature intended.

DemasElectronic theft of benefits and unauthorized use of food assistance cards is costing Michiganders millions if not billions of dollars in fraud, supporters of legislation to require a photo and a signature on Michigan Bridge cards said during a Thursday meeting of the state House Government Operations Committee.
Rep. Jason Woolford (R-Howell), sponsor of House Bill 4515, told lawmakers Thursday that Michigan has seen instances of organized crime stealing people’s Electronic Benefits Transfer, or EBT, data to drain people’s SNAP, or Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, benefits which are informally known as food stamps. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXA May statement from the U.S. Department of Agriculture said SNAP benefit fraud efforts have  “dramatically” increased in recent years through card skimming and cloning efforts. And as President Donald Trump’s administration has zeroed in on cracking down on bad actors stealing food assistance dollars from those who need them, Judicial Officer of the United States Department of Agriculture John Walk said these crimes hurt Americans on multiple levels.
“These are truly sick and depraved individuals who are stealing food from low-income Americans for their own profit,” Walk said in May. “It is especially disturbing when international criminal organizations siphon tax dollars away from SNAP beneficiaries to fund their own illicit activities.”
Woolford’s bill would require those using Michigan’s food assistance card, known as the Bridge Card, to have their photograph and signature appear on the card.
The bill isn’t meant to inconvenience anyone in need of food assistance in Michigan more than the inconvenience many Michiganders face when getting a photo for a driver’s license, passport, or a Costco membership card, Woolford said. And although the nonpartisan House Fiscal Agency places estimates of implementing photo and signature requirements at between $1.5 million to $4.5 million annually, based on other states that have done so, Woolford said the change could save taxpayers billions in fraud.
“That’s my concern, that the amount of money we’re losing here, money that quite honestly could go to other people that are being denied benefits or that we don’t have the money to take care of because of the waste, fraud and abuse,” Woolford said.
In the House Fiscal Agency’s analysis of the bill, savings to Michigan as a result of reduced fraud are indeterminate and likely negligible. Regardless of whose image would appear on a card, in order for whole families to benefit from food assistance, federal rules mandate that states can’t hinder members of a household from permitted purchases, so anyone with the pin number can make a purchase regardless of the image on the card, the analysis said.
On Thursday, Rep. Mike Harris (R-Waterford Township) said during his law enforcement career prior to joining the Legislature, he saw frequent fraudulent use of food assistance cards. At the same time, when considering concerns that having to get a photo taken would place an undue burden on recipients, Harris said he’d be interested in seeing if the bill could be further fleshed out to allow images already in the Michigan Department of State’s database for state IDs to be used for Bridge Cards.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_1257-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-05 14:12:26.966485

(Screenshot from National Archives film)Shaun Nadolny is finally making the trip from Wisconsin to visit his great-uncle’s grave in the Brittany American Cemetery in France.  
Last in a two-part series on Pennsylvania’s 28th Division and a new memorial to soldiers who were killed in the fight to liberate Gathemo, France. Read the first part here.

Tradition holds that for visiting family members, staff will place moistened sand on the engraving on the marker for Jerome Nadolny, who was killed in the fierce fighting around Gathemo, a small village in Normandy, using a wet sponge. The process brings the name out on the marble Latin cross, so it can easily be seen from 15 to 20 feet away.

An American and French flag – standing about knee high – will be placed in front of the grave. Traditionally, the U.S. marker is symbolically on the right side – as if it were in the soldier’s right hand and facing home. The French will be on the left – always toward inland territory.
Then, he and his cousin, Kurt, will travel to Gathemo, where nine soldiers of the 28th Division, including three from Pennsylvania, lost their lives as the Allies pushed inland from the beaches of Normany to liberate Europe. 
They’ll be the sole American relatives of the fallen soldiers who will be on hand for a ceremony Saturday honoring their sacrifice during the fight for the town 81 summers ago. The gathering will include the dedication of a plaque and memorial and a renaming of a street in honor of the 28th Division, a Pennsylvania National Guard unit before the war. The trip is the culmination of an improbable sequence of events that began when Nadolny went in search of the war history of a long-lost great-uncle. Nadolny admits to feeling a little pressure, because he doesn’t want to let his family down or any of the other families. 
“I know it’s going to be a heavy experience for me personally. I wish I could share this with my dad,” he said. “It was on my bucket list to just go to that cemetery, but now to actually go to the cemetery? It’s obviously a trip of a lifetime, right?“
Gathemo today
Visitors to Normandy will notice Allied flags – American, British, and Canadian – hanging not just on poles, but in windows and on doors in village after village. This isn’t just a phenomenon that happens in the typical tourist areas around the landing beaches or landmarks made famous in the 1962 movie, The Longest Day, or the HBO miniseries, Band of Brothers.
The Battle of Normandy stretched beyond what happened on June 6, 1944. Allied troops applied relentless pressure in an effort to push the German occupiers back.
The clash lasted for more than two months, as it became a war of attrition. Allied troops had to constantly resupply the front lines, while the enemy dealt with losses – in terms of men and machines – it simply couldn’t replace
In the end, the Allies suffered 210,000 casualties,while the Germans dealt with losses of 400,000 men. 
Town and after town touched by the Battle of Normandy has its own monuments or historical markers to pilots whose downed aircraft crashed nearby, soldiers who died in their streets or units that helped liberate them.
In Periers for example, The Four Braves memorial honors the 90th Infantry Division — which liberated the town as part of Operation Cobra. This was a piece of the successful U.S. breakout — which played a big role in the rapid collapse of the Germans’ defense in Normandy.
Two Pennsylvanians who lost  their lives — Private 2nd Class Andrew J. Speese III of Philadelphia and Sgt. Tullio Micaloni of Oneida — are immortalized as part of the memorial.

One tour group recounted how in the town of La Haye du Puits, a man noticed they were Americans. He hurried home and later found the group at a restaurant eating lunch. He excitedly, in French, described what it was like as a boy in the summer of 1944 to see his home liberated.  
As his story was translated, he pulled a piece of silk parachute from his jacket — given to him by a U.S. soldier. He simply wanted to share his gratitude for the sacrifice made by the Allies.
Even in 2025, people in Normandy’s villages and towns still think there is history to be acknowledged and a debt owed.
Gathemo, with a population of 267, will join the others Saturday, with a permanent “thank you.” 
Over several days in early August, 1944, the 28th attacked German troops occupying the town.
Progress was slow, measured in a few hundred yards at times, but by the afternoon Aug. 10, the 28th had liberated Gathemo. The division’s losses were nine men killed, including three from Pennsylvania, and an estimated 235 wounded.

– – From The Bloody Patch: A True Story of the Daring 28th Infantry Division 



The 77-day Battle of Normandy came to an end on Aug. 19, after tens of thousands of German troopers were captured when the Falaise pocket was closed by Allied troops.
A mere 10 days after that, the men of the 28th Division were in Paris, taking part in the liberation day parade through the city. 
Located nearly 90 minutes from the English Channel and Omaha Beach, Mayor Christelle Errard describes Gathemo as having all the hallmarks of a quaint Norman community – a bakery, a bar, gift shops and five farms. 
The church, destroyed in the fight, was rebuilt after the war and features a pointed bell tower. According to the mayor, the granite used for the altar and the cross came from Gathemo’s quarries.

‘There are no words strong enough’ 
The town’s role in the Allied push to encircle and destroy part of the German Army in the final weeks and days of the clash has largely been forgotten – overshadowed by the fight in Mortain and Saint-Lambert-sur-Dives, among others. Errard became mayor of Gathemo in July of 2020 and has lived in the community for a decade. She was born in another historically significant part of France – Verdun. It’s the site of one the longest and most ferocious battles of the First World War.  
“We have a mission in our world: to listen to our history, to transcribe it, so as not to forget Our duty to remember is here. And the witnesses of this period will soon all be gone. I also understood that many don’t want to share what they experienced,” she wrote in an email exchange using Google Translate to go from French to English. “My father never spoke about this period when he was 6-years-old, yet four years ago, on his deathbed, he relived the scenes he had witnessed.”

Now, she said, it’s Gathemo’s turn to pay tribute to the young Americans who fought to liberate Europe. 
“Many returned home with physical and mental injuries, but many, like Pvt. Nadolny, did not return to their families,” Errard wrote. “My son will be 23 in June, the same age Pvt. Nadolny was when he lost his life in Gathemo, for Gathemo. I cannot remain indifferent. The tribute is small, but I hope it is the beginning of another story for Gathemo and all the people who will stop and pay their respects at this memorial.”
The monument with the names of the nine men killed will be located close to the back of the church in Gathemo. It will be on a granite stone with an M1 helmet featuring the division logo placed on top. A plaque honoring the entire division will be dedicated, and a street will be renamed in honor of the 28th Division, which, according to unit lore was nicknamed the “Bloody Bucket” by the Germans because of the red keystone patches worn on their uniforms. 
The Mike Pride Museum in Normandy covered the 1,800 Euro price tag.
“Dear American friends, there are no words strong enough to express our gratitude and respect,” Errard said. “I would like to say BRAVO and THANK YOU.”
Two men who were just children at the time of the battle will be on hand for the ceremony – 87-year-old Guy Lelandais and 80-year-old Michele Golonde. 
Errard says for Lelandais, whose cousin was killed by an exploding shell in front of his eyes, preserving the history of the liberation of his hometown has been a lifelong passion. He has – collecteding testimonies from around the region.

Galonde was just six months old when the 28th Division pushed the Germans out of Gathemo, hiding in a cellar with his family, according to Gerrard. His older sister was in front of the baby carriage he was in when a shell exploded – wounding her in the leg, which left her permanently disabled.  But as fate would have it, she likely saved Galonde’s life because of where she was standing. 
Nadolny plans to have dinner with the mayor and hopes to shake Lelandais’ hand and ask him what he remembers about the fight to free the town. 
“I mean sincerely, we are so thankful…my family and I are almost just unbelievably thankful,” he said. “(Jerome) was a blue-collar soldier that gave everything and moved us along, So to me, that’s what it’s about. A lot of forgotten stories. So, if we can share a little bit of it or be a part of it, I think it’s incredible.”
The commemoration is a reminder that “freedom has a cost and that true friendship endures,”  Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said in a letter to the event organizers.
“More than 80 years ago, the sons of Pennsylvania crossed an ocean to stand in defense of liberty and peace, forging a bond of courage and shared sacrifice. The soldiers of the 28th Infantry Division fought with extraordinary bravery, with some making the ultimate sacrifice,” Shapiro said. “The people of Gathemo have, across generations, honored the legacy of these brave men not only with gratitude, but with a deep and enduring partnership that continues to unite our communities. Pennsylvania is proud of the heritage of the 28th Infantry Division and of the shared history we hold with our friends in Gathemo.”
The ceremony is set to begin Saturday, June 7, at 5 a.m. EST and will be livestreamed on the Mike Pride Museum YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@grpicardie3945.

Some question the precedent that sets.,"Earlier this year, Margaret Joyce was charged alongside four other individuals with abusing Bridgeport’s absentee ballot system during the city’s 2023 Democratic mayoral primary.
And this week, the 46-year-old was cited again by state election enforcement officials — this time for violating the state’s absentee ballot laws during a 2024 re-do election between Bridgeport Mayor Joe Ganim and his Democratic challenger John Gomes.
According to State Election Enforcement Commission staff, Joyce told state investigators that she was compensated during those 2024 elections for the sole purpose of soliciting absentee votes — which is a violation of state law. They said she also admitted to taking possession of at least one voters’ absentee ballot ahead of those contests, which is a felony in Connecticut.
But Joyce, who is now homeless and living out of her car, is unlikely to face any consequence for the actions she took during the 2024 elections, which were held after Ganim’s victory in 2023 was overturned in court due to widespread allegations of absentee ballot fraud.
The SEEC staff recommended the commission settle the case against Joyce — who is already facing nine felony charges tied to the 2023 election — and issue Joyce a fine of $1,000 for what they described as an “egregious” violation of state law.
But the SEEC also acknowledged that Joyce was unlikely to pay that fine because of her financial circumstances. They said she will qualify to have the fine waived because she is considered indigent.  
Joyce previously told investigators with the Connecticut Chief State’s Attorneys office that she worked for Ganim in 2023 and 2024 and was paid by his campaign. 
Joyce could not be reached for comment for this story. Her attorney, Robert Koetsch, did not return a call to his office.
Ganim did not respond to an email that was sent to a spokesperson for his office.
Members of the SEEC ultimately voted to settle the case against Joyce. But before they did, two of the commissioners openly questioned what type of precedent they were setting, and what message it might send to candidates who are running for political office in the future.
Stephen Penny, chairman of the SEEC, specifically asked what would prevent Ganim or any other political candidate from hiring low-income individuals to repeatedly violate the state’s absentee ballot laws.
“What is there in this process that would discourage candidates for the office of the mayor for the city of Bridgeport from putting indigent people in this position, over and over and over again?” Penny asked. 
Gregory Piecuch, another commissioner, made a similar point, and suggested that the SEEC needs to start investigating the candidates and treasurers paying campaign workers who mishandle absentee ballots.
“What we have seen, particularly since COVID, is a proliferation in the use of absentee ballots by campaigns,” Piecuch said. “…The use of absentee ballots has grown, and so too has the ability of folks to be acting in concert and perhaps using the indigent as a way to escape liability.” 
“That is something that we are going to have to take a much closer look at going forward,” Piecuch added.
William Smith, an attorney for the SEEC, explained to the commission that the case against Joyce, which included video footage of her allegedly picking up an absentee ballot at a voter’s house, was one of more than 30 investigations stemming from the election contests between Ganim and Gomes in 2023 and 2024.
According to Smith, Michael Brandi, the SEEC’s former director, made the decision to focus those cases on the individual campaign operatives who were allegedly mishandling absentee ballots. Smith said that is why Ganim and his campaign team were not investigated as part of the complaint that was filed against Joyce.  
Brandi, who retired earlier this year, did not respond to phone call for this story. 
“Based on the former executive director’s strategy, we were focused on the participants who were actually on the ground, knocking on doors,” Smith told the commission. 
It’s not just members of the SEEC, however, who are starting to question why it is largely campaign operatives who are being hit with fines and criminal charges in Bridgeport.
People involved in election cases in Bridgeport and attorneys for some of the defendants who are currently facing charges are also critical of the fact that campaign directors and political candidates who benefited from the alleged absentee ballot fraud are not being investigated and criminally prosecuted. 
Ken Krayeske, who is representing Nilsa Heredia, another low-level campaign worker who was charged with mishandling absentee ballots during Ganim’s 2019 election, said the string of alleged election fraud that has taken place in Bridgeport is unlikely to end if the people at the top are not held accountable.
“Why isn’t the person who benefited from these schemes in 2019 and 2023 a defendant here,” Krayeske said, referring to Ganim. “It is a crime to solicit someone to go out and take absentee ballots.”
Krayeske said it will be deeply unfair if people like Joyce and his client, who lives in P.T. Barnum Apartments, a public housing facility, are convicted of felonies, while the individuals who hired them and paid them are left unscathed. He said he would consider that selective prosecution.
Prena Rao, an attorney who led a civil lawsuit challenging Ganim’s primary victory in 2019, said the trial in that case highlighted the instructions that many lower-level campaign operatives receive during many Bridgeport elections. 
Rao, who grew up in Bridgeport, said there is clearly evidence in some of the ongoing criminal cases that the people accused of illegally collecting absentee ballots were also being paid by campaigns.
“I don’t think that justice will be done until the folks involved in orchestrating this process and giving people directives and issuing checks and payments also face consequences,” Rao said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Bridgeport-complaint-video.png,,,2025-06-05 14:12:26.966485

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — An Oklahoma City federal judge this week placed an indefinite ban on enforcement of a state law criminalizing undocumented immigrants living in Oklahoma.
The decision from U.S. District Judge Bernard Jones extends the two-week hold he implemented for House Bill 4156 on May 20 to last until he makes a final ruling on a lawsuit challenging the statute. 
HB 4156, enacted last year, created the state crime of “impermissible occupation,” threatening fines and jail time for immigrants living in Oklahoma without legal residency.
Past rulings from the U.S. Supreme Court and judges across the country have made clear that immigration enforcement is the federal government’s responsibility, not an individual state’s, Jones wrote in his decision issued Tuesday. Federal law preempts state laws on the issue, rendering Oklahoma’s new statute unenforceable, the judge decided.
“In the end, that is why H.B. 4156 must fail — not to excuse unlawful presence or shield criminal conduct, but because it is what the Constitution demands,” Jones wrote.
Oklahoma still has the power to prosecute U.S. citizens and noncitizens alike for crimes that might stem from unlawful immigration, the judge said.
Attorney General Gentner Drummond had contended HB 4156 helps law enforcement stop drug trafficking and other crimes. Drummond called Jones’ previous two-week hold “outrageous,” “perverse” and “contrary to the rule of law.”

“The attorney general is committed to ensuring the state has the agency to protect Oklahomans,” Drummond’s spokesperson, Phil Bacharach, said Thursday. “HB 4156 is a commonsense and necessary law and Oklahoma must be able to enforce it.” 
Jones blocked enforcement of the law for nine months last year after former President Joe Biden’s Administration filed a lawsuit. The ban lifted when President Donald Trump withdrew Biden’s case.
Two undocumented residents of Oklahoma and two immigrant-focused organizations based in the state refiled the lawsuit last month, contending HB 4156 is unconstitutional.
Attorneys from the American Civil Liberties Union and the Tulsa law firm Rivas & Associates are representing the plaintiffs.
“Once again, the court has made it clear that the state of Oklahoma may not enforce HB 4156 while our litigation proceeds,” ACLU of Oklahoma legal director Megan Lambert said. “People who are immigrants join the long American tradition of coming here in search of a better life and the freedom and opportunity we offer. Anti-immigrant policies do not represent our state, and we are grateful for the relief this provides while we continue to fight for the rights and safety of Oklahoma’s immigrant communities.”

“Neither the University of Florida nor the Board of Governors, nor (Santa) Ono would have been in this position,” had HB 1321 been in effect before the presidential search, Perez said during a media availability.
Representatives voted 104-8 on that bill this session, which would have repealed the public records exemption on applicants for presidencies at state colleges and universities. The Senate companion bill,  SB 1726, cleared all its committees of reference, but the full Senate never considered it.
Back to the drawing board: UF presidential finalist nixed for conflicting DEI stances

The State University System Board of Governors rejected University of Michigan President Santa Ono during the final phase of the presidential search process this week. The 6-10 vote against Ono followed hours of questions about his conflicting stances on diversity, equity, and inclusion. He was unanimously approved by UF trustees the week before.
“All of the deficiencies that Ono had prior to the presidential search coming to a conclusion, and eventually going before the BOG would have been discovered,” Perez said. “It was not discovered because no one knew that Ono was the one that was going to be nominated, unanimously approved, and sent to the BOG.” 
  Speaker Daniel Perez via Florida House
 The House sponsor of the bill, Rep. Michelle Salzman, said the measure was about “transparency, term limiting bureaucrats, and good governance.” Gov. Ron DeSantis said the bill, which included a provision prohibiting his office’s involvement in searches, would “kneecap our ability to hold higher ed accountable.”
Speaker voted for secrecy
The law that put secrets in the dark once had the support of Perez.
State law, since the signing of SB 520 in 2022, requires university presidential searches to be conducted outside the public eye, none of the applicants known to the public unless part of the “shortlist” of finalists unveiled in the final phases, and the finalist(s) must be approved by the chair of the Board of Governors. That bill passed the House 86-26, with Perez voting in favor.
“What many fought back on was that the BOG chair had to have the veto power. Well, he had the veto power. He never used it. And then here we are with a presidential candidate for a major university, flagship university for the state of Florida, in a very embarrassing moment for the entire state of Florida, something that should have been avoided, could have been avoided,” Perez said. 
UF has twice, consecutively, named a sole finalist despite the “shortlist” language in law.
Perez said the school will have a problem trying to find a president now that the “process is flawed.”

Senate president wishy-washy
Opponents of the House proposal have said keeping searches confidential initially prevents a candidate’s current employer from discovering their employee is applying for a new job. That, in turn, encourages more candidates to apply.
Senate President Ben Albritton doesn’t see the issue as clearly as Perez.
Albritton replied to Perez’s comments in his own media availability held about an hour after Perez’s.
“I’m not sure it would have” avoided Ono’s rejection, Albritton said.

“One way to look at it would be that way. Another way to look at it would say that the system worked.”
Albritton added: “I applaud the Speaker and the House for taking it head on. It’s a complicated situation. Let’s keep talking about it.”
The Legislature is not poised to address policy issues unrelated to the budget in the final days of its extended session.
“Are there some circumstances where it would be better to have multiple [finalists]? Maybe. Are there some circumstances you’re better off to have one? Maybe,” Albritton said. “I’m not going to give you something definitive at this point.”
Perez said he hopes changes can come before any more searches fail.
“The House tried for this to never happen. Yet we were the only ones that believed in that policy. I still believe in that policy,” Perez said. “Hopefully, now that we have seen this example come to fruition and become a reality, unfortunately, we can now once again have that consideration and that conversation of the policy that the House passed.”

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Rhode Island Senate President Valarie Lawson quietly recused herself from two labor bills decided Wednesday. The reason: She’s awaiting the advice of a state ethics panel on conflicts of interest with her job as head of one of the state’s two largest teachers unions.
Despite Lawson’s abstention, two union-backed bills secured approval with decisive majorities of the 37-member chamber. One would extend organizing rights to university graduate students; the other enhances information-sharing about union members between their employers and local bargaining units.
As the end of session looms, with hundreds of bills expected to be considered by both chambers in the final weeks, it’s still unclear when and whether Lawson should be participating in discussions and decisions that overlap with her day job as president of the National Education Association of Rhode Island.
Lawson, an East Providence Democrat, was elected Senate president on April 29, filling the opening left after the death of former Senate President Dominick Ruggerio. She requested an advisory opinion from the Rhode Island Ethics Commission on May 23, according to a letter obtained by Rhode Island Current. The commission, which last met on May 20, has not set a date to consider a recommendation from its staff on Lawson’s request.
Lawson in the letter referred to a June 2024 ethics recommendation, when she was majority leader, determining that she could still vote on a swath of proposed changes to the state pension system despite being a retired teacher and head of the teachers union. The ethics panel concluded that Lawson would not benefit from the proposed changes any more than the 68,000 retirees and active state workers and teachers, including 400 of her co-workers at the state teachers’ union.
Lawson sought to distinguish between actual conflicts of interest, rooted in financial gain, and a “subjective perception of bias” — the latter of which is not addressed by the state ethics code.
“The Code of Ethics does not address perceived general biases, political views or personal opinions unless they intersect with financial interests,” Lawson wrote. “This is intentional as the Code of Ethics may not infringe upon either legislative or executive powers.”
Lawson also pledged in the letter to recuse herself from any discussions and votes on bills related to pension benefits that would affect her “rights or entitlements as a participant in the state’s Pension system.”
Her letter does not mention potential conflicts on labor bills, including the two she abstained from Wednesday.
‘What happens behind closed doors?’
Greg Paré, a Senate spokesperson, downplayed Lawson’s recusals.
“In any part-time legislature, most members will have full-time jobs as well, and it is inevitable that potential conflicts will arise,” Pare said in an emailed response Thursday. “The members of the Senate recuse themselves in these situations. Throughout her tenure in the Senate, President Lawson has recused out of an abundance of caution when a potential conflict arises, and she did so yesterday as well.”
The precautionary measure did not put Sen. Ana Quezada at ease. Quezada, a Providence Democrat, did not vote for Lawson for Senate president because she worried over the conflicts of interest with her union job.
“For me, it is still a concern,” Quezada said in an interview Thursday. “Even if she recuses herself from voting on the floor, what happens behind closed doors?”
Indeed, it was behind-the-scenes negotiations, not public votes, that prompted the first Senate president, East Providence Democrat, Billy Irons, to resign. Irons abruptly left the leadership post at the end of his first year, in 2003, amid news reports he accepted payouts from insurance companies in exchange for defeating legislation the industry opposed.  
“Recusing from a vote is only part of the actions as Senate president,” John Marion, executive director for Common Cause Rhode Island, said. “Lawson is also the person who decides if a committee can move forward with a vote on the legislation.”
Exercising caution might sound like the best choice amid uncertainty. But her constituents, and the 12,000 teachers she leads, could lose out if she recuses herself unnecessarily, too.
This was the conclusion of a pair of Brown University professors in a paper in the 2024 Roger Williams University Law Review in examining non-judicial recusals from 2006 to 2018.
“Recusing might make political sense,” the authors stated. “Stepping aside makes it impossible for political opponents to claim that voting was improper. But this is where the phrase ‘out of an abundance of caution’ falls apart. That phrase implies that there are no costs to recusing, just possible benefits. But there are real costs—direct and indirect—to this kind of ‘abundance of caution.’ The direct cost of legislative recusal is the disenfranchisement of constituents.”
Without an ethics opinion on the bills up for a vote Wednesday, it’s unclear whether Lawson could have participated in the decisions.










Recusing from a vote is only part of the actions as Senate president. Lawson is also the person who decides if a committee can move forward with a vote on the legislation.


–  John Marion, executive director for Common Cause Rhode Island


Marion acknowledged the timing of the state ethics reviews and meetings – typically once per month — made it difficult for Lawson to get timely advice in the end-of-session scramble.
But the proposals themselves were introduced on Jan. 31, giving Lawson ample time to ask for more general input from the ethics panel. Senate Majority Leader Frank Ciccone requested an advisory opinion from the Ethics Commission on his ability to discuss and vote on gun-related legislation immediately after he was elected the Senate’s no. 2. The commission approved its staff recommendation at its May 20 meeting.
Lawson waited more than three weeks after she was tapped as president to ask for an ethics opinion. 
“It’s surprising given the scrutiny on her dual roles that she isn’t doing more publicly to make sure that she’s getting sound advice on what she can and can’t do in her role as Senate president,” Marion said. “The next few weeks are going to highlight that challenge.”
Companion legislation in the House to Ciccone’s bill expanding organizing rights to college graduate students remains held in committee following an initial Feb. 12 hearing. The House Committee on Labor is scheduled to vote Thursday night on a companion to the other union bill, requiring regular updates from union employers to the local bargaining units.
House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi remained noncommittal when asked for comment Thursday, only saying that both bills were “under consideration.”

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)LINCOLN — A new vacancy on the three-member Nebraska Liquor Control Commission came at the request of Gov. Jim Pillen, which the former commissioner in that seat said happened because the governor wanted more “cannabis experience” on the regulatory board.
Former Commissioner Harry Hoch, Jr., speaking with the Nebraska Examiner, confirmed this week that he was told he would not be reappointed to another six-year term to the Liquor Control Commission after his term expired May 24. Hoch said he had put in a request to be reappointed but withdrew it after talking with Dave Lopez, Pillen’s chief of staff, so his last day was May 24.

Hoch said the “nice” conversation with Lopez “basically boiled down to [that] I wasn’t going to be reappointed, because the governor wanted to get more cannabis experience in my seat.”
“There was no Hanky Panky there. It’s all above board,” Hoch said of his resignation, adding that he parted ways with the executive branch officials, “basically friends still.”
Medical cannabis duties
Under a ballot measure approved by about 67% of voters in November, the three members of the Liquor Control Commission also jointly serve on the Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission.

Pillen’s two new at-large appointees to the medical cannabis board were confirmed by the Nebraska Legislature last week. The commission’s first meeting is Monday at 3 p.m.
“If you think about it, the three Liquor Control commissioners were put on the cannabis board just because it was a convenient way,” Hoch said.
In his resignation email, dated May 20, Hoch said it was “a pleasure to be able to serve and use my 40 years of industry knowledge” during his six years on the Liquor Control Commission.
Hoch represented Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District, which consists of Saunders County, Douglas County and western Sarpy County.

The resignation had nothing to do with the later action to suspend without pay the Liquor Commission’s executive director — an employee of the commission — one day after a federal search warrant was carried out on the commission, Hoch said.
The former commissioner said he did not know those “goings on.” Authorities have shared no other information about that investigation.
There has been no public announcement or call for applications for the 2nd District Liquor Commission vacancy. There was no announcement or call for applications for the Medical Cannabis Commission as of March 31, either. Pillen made the six-year appointments April 24.
Applications for open appointments to boards and commissions are available here.
‘A role even more critical’
In a May 20 email exchange between Lopez and Hoch, Lopez said the Governor’s Office would put out a statement recognizing Hoch’s service and look for another way that the former commissioner could serve. It’s unclear whether any statement was sent about Hoch.
“As discussed, I will personally see to identifying several possibilities for continued state-appointed service that will befit your experience, wisdom and stature,” Lopez wrote to Hoch. “I cannot overstate how valuable it is to have good people willing to serve in appointed positions, and candidly, I am hopeful we can engage you in a role even more critical than LCC is presently.”

Pillen confirmed in an interview this week with the Examiner that he directed the call for Hoch’s resignation, as he believes serving at the “pleasure of the governor” means appointing someone when a term expires, though he was grateful for Hoch’s work.
Hoch was appointed by former Gov. Pete Ricketts. Pillen accepted Hoch’s resignation May 21.
Asked if Pillen had a reason for Hoch’s resignation, the governor said: “No, just time.”
A spokesperson for the governor declined to comment on the pending appointment process beyond a previous comment that the vacancy would be filled “in due course.”
‘Important we get it right’
Pillen reiterated that he also always supported medical cannabis but does not support a “leak” to recreational marijuana — ”no way, shape or form.” He previously said access to medical cannabis should only come after U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval.
Pillen committed to taking the medical cannabis duties seriously while protecting kids.
“We’re gonna do it, fulfill the will of the people as quickly as possible,” Pillen said.
He then pointed to the “be quick, but don’t hurry” phrase popularized by former American basketball Coach John Wooden and added: “This is important we get it right.”

(NCDPI Screengrab)When Kimberly Jones was selected as the 2023-24 North Carolina Teacher of the Year she earned a two-year appointment to the State Board of Education. This week, as the veteran Chapel Hill English teacher attended her final meeting in that leadership capacity, she challenged both the board and state legislators to invest more in public schools.
Jones urged the State Board of Education on Thursday to stay grounded in the constitutional mandate to provide every North Carolina child with a sound basic education.

“Be wary of oversimplified solutions to complex challenges,” Jones advised. “Invest not only in outcomes, but in the conditions that produce them — teacher retention, culturally relevant pedagogy, instructional materials that reflect diverse experiences and perspectives and learning environments that allow our students to feel safe, both physically and emotionally.”
During her time on the board, the Trump administration’s U.S. Department of Education has sought to block diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs nationwide. Jones cautioned her colleagues to never confuse neutrality with justice.
“Please make equity, access, or whatever synonym meets the current criteria to guide your compass, even when that path is hard to navigate. The very future of our democracy and our society depends on how courageously you continue to steward this responsibility,” Jones said.
As Newsline has previously reported, this legislative session state Republican lawmakers have advanced multiple proposals to eliminate DEI from all corners of the public sector — government, higher education and K-12 education.
At the same time, the North Carolina House has passed legislation that would promote “wholesome” content for students, but that critics have derided as an invitation to censorship. The bill would require the State Board of Education to maintain a database of all banned media across the state with annual updates.
Jones reminded the board that reading and inquiry are not a nuisance, but rather an engine of learning.
“In my classroom, we use complex questions to feel reading, research, and rigorous dialogue to build empathy and to strengthen civic understanding,” she said. “I believe students of every background and every region of our state deserve access to such curricula. Ones that affirm their identity, reflect their communities, inspire their best efforts, and invite them into meaningful conversations about the world they are inheriting and shaping.”
Jones, a high school English and AP African American studies and Holocaust educator, said students should be encouraged to explore not just what was said or written, but why it mattered.
For legislators who will be working on a compromise budget in the weeks ahead, Jones urged improved funding for schools and better respect for educators.
“Public education cannot be reimagined if it is consistently underfunded, undermined, or politicized,” she said. “If we are to recruit and retain a diverse, highly qualified, and effective workforce, then we must offer more than praise. We must offer respect, autonomy, and trust.”

Jones said her classroom colleagues simply deserve more.
“We need competitive teacher pay that honors both experience and expertise. We need sustainable investments in student mental health because no curriculum is effective in a crisis. We need clean modern school buildings, not just in select counties but in every community.”
The House budget proposes to increase new teacher pay from $41,000 a year to $48,000 for the next school year but offers little to more experienced teachers. The Senate budget offers average raises of 2.3% in FY 25-26 with a $3,000 bonus spread out over two years. The two sides are reportedly far apart from reaching a consensus.
Beyond the classroom, Jones said lawmakers should acknowledge those behind the scenes — cafeteria workers, bus drivers, and those willing to pitch in to maintain the grounds and buildings when the needs surpass the resources.
For parents and community advocates, Jones encouraged them to visit a classroom, become a mentor, vote in their local school board elections, and ask their local school district leaders what they’re doing to serve the most marginalized students.
Jones said it’s important to understand that not every student learns the same way, and not every parent’s experience with their school is universal.
“In public schools, there are no applications for admission. There are no filters to whom we serve. We don’t select who enters our classrooms, but every day we get the unparalleled opportunity to shape and influence what kind of person leaves our classrooms.”
Jones said that during challenging times she reflects on a proverb which holds that children are born with their hands closed because that’s where their gifts and talents lie.
“As they grow, their hands begin to open so they can share those talents with the world. At its most essential level, education is not about what we put into young people. It’s about what we pull out of them,” she said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/NC-State-Board-of-Education-June2025.jpg,,,2025-06-05 14:12:26.966485

The travel ban applies to citizens of Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.
The policy change restricts entry for citizens of Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela who are outside the U.S. and do not hold a valid visa.
The policy takes effect Monday at 12:01 a.m. and does not have an end date.
Here’s what to know about the new rules:
How Trump justified the ban
Since returning to the White House, Trump has launched an unprecedented campaign of immigration enforcement that has pushed the limits of executive power and clashed with federal judges trying to restrain him.
The travel ban results from a Jan. 20 executive order Trump issued requiring the departments of State and Homeland Security and the Director of National Intelligence to compile a report on “hostile attitudes” toward the U.S.
The aim is to “protect its citizens from aliens who intend to commit terrorist attacks, threaten our national security, espouse hateful ideology, or otherwise exploit the immigration laws for malevolent purposes,” the administration said.
In a video released on social media, Trump tied the new ban to a terror attack Sunday in Boulder, Colorado, saying it underscored the dangers posed by some visitors who overstay visas. The suspect in the attack is from Egypt, a country that is not on Trump’s restricted list. The Department of Homeland Security says he overstayed a tourist visa.
Who is exempt from the ban
1. Lawful residents: green card holders, citizens of designated countries who have obtained legal residency in the U.S.;
2. Dual citizens: U.S. citizens who also have citizenship of one of the banned countries;
3. Some athletes: athletes and their coaches traveling to the U.S. for the World Cup, Olympics or other major sporting event as determined by the U.S. secretary of state;
4. Afghans who worked for the U.S. government or its allies in Afghanistan and are holders of Afghan Special Immigrant Visas;
5. Iranians belonging to an ethnic or religious minority who are fleeing prosecution;
6. Certain foreign national employees of the U.S. government who have served abroad for at least 15 years and their spouses and children;
7. Refugees: Those who were granted asylum or admitted to the U.S. as refugees before the ban entered into force;
8. Individuals with U.S. family members who apply for visas in connection to their spouses, children or parents;
9. Diplomats and foreign government officials on official visits;
10. Those transiting the U.S. to the U.N. headquarters solely for official business related to the U.N.;
11. Representatives of international organizations and NATO on official visits in the U.S.;
12. Children adopted by U.S. citizens.
Which countries are affected
Trump said nationals of countries included in the ban pose “terrorism-related” and “public-safety” risks, as well as risks of overstaying their visas. He also said some of these countries had “deficient” screening and vetting or have historically refused to take back their own citizens.
His findings rely extensively on an annual Homeland Security report of visa overstays of tourists, business visitors and students who arrive by air and sea, singling out countries with high percentages of remaining after their visas expired.
“We don’t want them,” Trump said.
The inclusion of Afghanistan angered some supporters who have worked to resettle its people. The ban makes exceptions for Afghans on Special Immigrant Visas, generally people who worked most closely with the U.S. government during the two-decade war there.
The list can be changed, the administration said in a document circulated Wednesday evening, if authorities of designated countries make “material improvements” to their own rules and procedures. New countries can be added “as threats emerge around the world.”
Early reactions to the ban
International aid groups and refugee resettlement organizations roundly condemned the new ban.
“This policy is not about national security — it is about sowing division and vilifying communities that are seeking safety and opportunity in the United States,” said Abby Maxman, president of Oxfam America.
The African Union Commission expressed concern Thursday about the “the potential negative impact” of the ban on educational exchanges, business ties and broader diplomatic relations.
“The African Union Commission respectfully calls upon the U.S. administration to consider adopting a more consultative approach and to engage in constructive dialogue with the countries concerned,” the commission said in a statement.
The Council on American-Islamic Relations, the nation’s largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, called the order “unnecessary, overbroad and ideologically motivated.”
How the ban is different from 2017
During his first term, Trump issued an executive order in January 2017 banning travel to the U.S. by citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries including Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen.
It was one of the most chaotic and confusing moments of his young presidency. Travelers from those nations were either barred from getting on their flights to the U.S. or detained at U.S. airports after they landed. They included students and faculty, as well as businesspeople, tourists and people visiting friends and family.
The order, often referred to as the “Muslim ban” or the “travel ban,” was retooled amid legal challenges until a version was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2018.
The ban affected various categories of travelers and immigrants from Iran, Somalia, Yemen, Syria and Libya, plus North Koreans and some Venezuelan government officials and their families.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/AP25156397352976-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-05 14:12:26.966485

[…]","A St. Louis Metro Police car outside Carnahan Courthouse in downtown St. Louis (Clara Bates/Missouri Independent).A St. Louis civil rights law firm filed a lawsuit Thursday challenging the state takeover of the St. Louis police as unconstitutional.
ArchCity Defenders filed the lawsuit in Cole County circuit court on behalf of two St. Louis city residents, Jamala Rogers and Mike Milton. The state and Attorney General Andrew Bailey are the defendants.
The lawsuit seeks to overturn provisions of a bill Gov. Mike Kehoe signed into law in March, which put the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department under a state board instead of local control. The law, reversing a statewide vote from 2012 that put the board under local control, was needed, supporters said, to address high crime rates.
With Kehoe’s signature, St. Louis joined Kansas City as the only major metropolitan police force in the country under control of a state board rather than local officials. 
The plaintiffs argue the law violates two parts of the state constitution: the prohibition on unfunded state mandates and on special laws targeting a particular locality.
The law will “subject the city to an unfunded mandate that diverts resources away from needed programs to prevent crime, overturns the democratic vote of the people with no rational basis to believe it will help increase public safety,” the lawsuit states, “and will derail any progress that has been made in reducing the level of violence and improving law enforcement community relations.”
The bill established a floor for the police budget in St. Louis, setting a minimum portion of  general revenue funds that must be used for police each year, rising to 25% in 2028. 
Previously, there was no minimum funding requirement for the St. Louis city police, according to the lawsuit.
The lawsuit argues the city will need to either reallocate money from other programs and services or raise taxes. 
The two St. Louis city residents named as plaintiffs are activists who have advocated for policies to reduce poverty, prevent violence and increase community trust in law enforcement, according to the lawsuit.
Those plaintiffs believe that the “policies they are advocating for and the programs they implement will increase public safety,” the lawsuit states, but that “funding and support for those policies are now in jeopardy because of the state takeover law.”
The city charter also requires pay parity between police officers and firefighters and emergency medical personnel, meaning that if the state board increases police officers’ salaries, the city will be under the increased strain of matching those salaries. 
“There will be even less funds available for the city to implement holistic, poverty-reducing programs that have a proven effect on increasing public safety in the region,” the lawsuit states.
Under the state’s Hancock Amendment, the state is forbidden from imposing unfunded mandates on local governments.
The second component of the lawsuit argues the law is unconstitutional because it violates the prohibition against the legislature enacting certain local or special laws. It argues the law regulates the affairs of St. Louis when a general state law could be made applicable to it. 
“The state has no rational basis for imposing minimum police department funding requirements only on the city of St. Louis and excluding other municipalities from those requirements,” the lawsuit states.
The plaintiffs ask the court to declare the state takeover provisions invalid under the constitution, and sever them from the rest of the wide-ranging crime bill in which they were passed.
The bill restored the governing system that controlled the police department from 1861 until the 2012 vote. 
The bill was passed despite the 2012 vote, and “despite the City’s robust funding of the police department at the expense of other needs, and despite the falling crime rate in the city of St. Louis,” the lawsuit states. The plaintiffs argue that the city has struggled to fund services like affordable housing and violence prevention services, which could reduce crime, while providing “steady funding” for the police department. 
The Board of Police Commissioners has six members — the mayor of St. Louis and five people appointed by the governor and subject to state Senate confirmation. 
The bill passed on party-line votes in the House and Senate earlier this year, with Democrats opposed.

Opponents argued it was racist because Black Democrats held the major offices in St. Louis at the time of passage and is unneeded because crime is decreasing. Senate Democrats filibustered the bill, winning additions of provisions banning the shackling of pregnant prisoners, establishing a fund for exonerated prisoners to receive restitution from the state and limiting what jails and prisons can charge inmates for phone calls.
Critics point to statistics showing a drop in violent crime in St. Louis under local leadership. They say Kansas City has fared no better despite being under state control since the 1930s.

(Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)The Republican-led Michigan House of Representatives announced Thursday that it has filed a lawsuit against Democratic Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson for her alleged failure to comply with a subpoena issued by the chair of the chamber’s oversight body.
The complaint, House of Representatives v. Benson, filed in the Michigan Court of Claims on Wednesday, follows the House Oversight Committee’s request for election training materials from Benson and her office, which resulted in a subpoena.
House Oversight Committee Chair Rep. Jay DeBoyer (R-Clay Township) last month asked the full chamber to hold Benson in civil contempt for her alleged failure to provide the materials, which the House moved as a resolution later that day.
Now, the chamber’s Republicans have sued Benson seeking a declaratory judgment holding that the House issued a valid subpoena to which the secretary of state must comply. That lawsuit also seeks an injunction prohibiting Benson or the Michigan Department of State from modifying relevant records in the initial request.
A request for comment from the department or Benson was not immediately returned. Benson however in a press conference when the House held her in contempt said the move was a political stunt and that if they wanted to go to court, she would see them in court.
In a statement, DeBoyer said his commitment to bringing accountability to Lansing wasn’t lip service. 
“After going years without legislative oversight, Benson has clearly grown comfortable operating independent of the other, co-equal branches of government,” DeBoyer said. “For months, we have tried to get her cooperation through requests, then accommodating offers, and then legal demands. Her continued defiance now brings us to the courtroom, where we will continue to diligently work to deliver government transparency for the people of Michigan.”
DeBoyer added that all government officials, regardless of their title, each of them have a responsibility to uphold their constitutional duties and adhere to the law.
“Yet, Jocelyn Benson, one of the most powerful office holders in Michigan, must instead be brought to court and forced to comply with Michigan statute,” DeBoyer said. “We will not let her disregard for the law keep us from delivering results to the people we represent.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/AMR_0051-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-05 14:12:26.966485

More legislatures in Republican-led states are passing paid parental leave for public employees (Brandon Bell/Getty Images).More Republican-led states are giving paid parental leave to public school teachers and other state employees, signaling a broader acceptance of family-friendly workplace policies once championed primarily by Democrats.
“All of these red states, I think we’re late to the party,” said South Carolina state Rep. Beth Bernstein, a Democrat who sponsored a bill this year to increase state employees’ paid parental leave from six to 12 weeks. It passed the majority-Republican South Carolina House in April with strong bipartisan support.
This year, Alabama, Iowa and Mississippi joined 37 other states in granting paid parental leave to thousands of state workers.
The trend has gathered steam in recent years. Some experts link it to the cascade of state abortion bans that followed the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2022 Dobbs decision, which dismantled the federal right to abortion. Under fire from critics to do more to care for babies once they’re born, at least a dozen conservative-led states with abortion bans have since granted or expanded paid parental leave for their state employees.
But others say the increasing bipartisan support for measures that help working parents is also a reaction to economic realities.
“What we’ve seen, especially in more conservative states, is the public sector has experienced a lot of turnover,” said Kameron Dawson, legal director of the Southern Office of A Better Balance, a legal organization focused on workplace rights. “They’re looking for tools to recruit younger employees.”
Paid parental leave is the time off granted to workers for the birth or adoption of a baby, to care for a child, or to recover from a stillbirth or miscarriage. Without it, employees are left to cobble together their sick leave and vacation leave — or go unpaid — to stay home with a child and heal.
Alabama Republican state Rep. Ginny Shaver watched her daughter, a public school teacher, struggle to get the leave she needed after the births of her children in recent years.
“With her second, she had complications in her pregnancy and used up her [paid vacation and sick] leave before she even had the baby,” Shaver told Stateline. Her daughter contracted COVID-19, and the baby had to spend time in neonatal intensive care. “It was a very difficult time, and she had to take unpaid leave.”
Last year, Shaver and Democratic state Sen. Vivian Figures worked to win approval of a paid parental leave bill for state employees. It failed.
But they tried again this year. With the support of Republican Gov. Kay Ivey, the state legislature — which has a Republican supermajority — passed it nearly unanimously. The new law gives female state employees, including teachers, eight weeks of paid parental leave in connection with birth, stillbirth or miscarriage, and gives male employees two weeks. Adoptive parents get eight weeks for one parent and two for the other.
Shaver said she thinks the law passed thanks to vocal support from the governor and increased awareness of the issue due to the work she and Figures did in previous sessions.
“And the fact that all of the southeast states around us offered it,” Shaver said. “We’re trying to attract and retain state employees and teachers, and we’re in competition with everyone around us, and the private sector as well.”
Keeping talent
For many Republicans, the workforce development argument for paid leave is a persuasive one. For states such as Alabama and South Carolina that have some of the lowest workforce participation rates in the nation, paid leave can be a tool to keep more people — particularly women — working. And it can be a way to retain educators as many states struggle with teacher shortages in K-12 schools.
“For several years we’ve seen state legislatures acknowledging the importance of child care to businesses and the economy,” said Feroza Freeland, policy director at the Southern Office of A Better Balance. “But in the last few years, we’ve seen a growing recognition that paid leave is another piece of that puzzle.”
States have taken up the issue because the federal government has not. The United States is a global outlier; among 38 peer nations, it’s the only one that doesn’t mandate paid parental leave, according to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development. The group comprises 38 democracies with market-based economies.
The federal Family and Medical Leave Act, passed in 1993 and extended in 2020, only requires public agencies and companies with at least 50 employees to give up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for parents of newborns or newly adopted children, or caregivers of sick family members.
 GOP support

During his first term, President Donald Trump publicly supported some forms of paid family leave and signed a defense bill that gives 12 weeks of paid parental leave to most federal employees.
Paid family leave was a signature issue for his daughter Ivanka Trump, at the time a senior adviser to the president. She even held a paid leave and child care summit at the White House in late 2019.
That set the stage for other Republicans to take up the issue more publicly. And after the Dobbs decision, family-friendly policies have increasingly become conservative talking points in states with restrictive abortion laws.
After the Mississippi House unanimously passed a paid parental leave bill earlier this year, Republican House Speaker Jason White celebrated the bill as a reflection of Mississippi’s status as a “pro-life state.”
In a post on X this week announcing her signing of a new paid parental leave law, Iowa Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds called Iowa “a pro-family state.”
North Carolina was one of the first Southern states to grant paid parental leave to state workers in 2019 when then-Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, signed an executive order. In 2023, several months after the Dobbs decision, the state’s majority-Republican legislature extended paid parental leave to public school employees by tacking it onto a law banning most abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy.
Meanwhile, Indiana Republican Gov. Mike Braun signed an executive order in March to add up to eight additional weeks of paid leave for “childbirth recovery” to the state’s existing four weeks of paid parental leave.
 Running the gamut

The new laws won’t apply to most residents, because they only cover state employees. But they could have a downstream effect.
Shaver, the Alabama lawmaker, said she hopes her state’s new law will not only help the state be competitive with the private sector, but also set a precedent for other employers to follow.
“I hope they will see it’s in their benefit to offer what they can,” she said. “It may not be eight or 12 weeks, but even offering a reduced or flexible work schedule can help families.”
Just over a quarter of private-sector workers have access to paid family leave through their employer as of March 2023, according the most recent data from the U.S. Department of Labor.
Among the lowest-wage earners, that share drops to 6%.
State paid leave programs run the gamut in terms of what they offer. While Alabama’s new law offers up to eight weeks of leave for all state employees, including teachers, Mississippi’s offers six and does not require public schools to offer paid parental leave to their employees.
Iowa’s new law grants four weeks of paid leave for the birth or adoption of a child and one week of paid paternity leave. Tennessee’s law, passed in 2023, only offers paid leave to workers in the state’s executive and judicial branches.
But a few states are already expanding their offerings: Last year, Georgia legislators voted to double paid parental leave from three to six weeks.
And some states have gone further than just state employees: 13 states and the District of Columbia have mandated paid family leave for all workers, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. Most of those states are located in New England or on the West Coast and all are Democratic-led. Ten more offer voluntary paid family leave statewide that’s provided through private insurance.
 Sandwich generation

Experts say the shift in attitude toward family-friendly policies can also be attributed to a generational shift.
“A lot of younger lawmakers are more willing to champion the issue of paid leave,” said Freeland, of A Better Balance. “They’re understanding it because they’re seeing it in their own lives, or seeing friends and family members going through this.”
In South Carolina, Bernstein’s bill faced some opposition from members of the state’s ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus and Family Caucus. Some lawmakers questioned the potential costs of the bill, or criticized it as government overreach.
South Carolina Republican state Rep. Josiah Magnuson, a member of the Freedom Caucus, said he believed the bill would be a financial burden on public school districts that could lead to raised taxes.
“You’re saying, let’s tax the people of South Carolina, most of whom don’t get paid parental leave, and give them to state employees who already have six weeks’ paid parental leave,” Magnuson told lawmakers in April before the House voted to pass the bill.
He also said he doesn’t like that the increased paid leave “puts the foot in the door a little more for the government to be involved in the home.”
The opposition frustrated Bernstein, who pointed out that the state’s 2022 law that granted six weeks of paid parental leave passed the legislature almost unanimously. This year’s bill expanding that leave passed the House but hasn’t seen movement in the Senate. It can be picked up again when the legislature returns in January.
Other South Carolina Republicans backed the bill, citing their own families’ experiences following the birth of their children, reported the South Carolina Daily Gazette.
More conservative states are also responding to the needs of “sandwich generation” employees who may be caring for aging parents as well as children, Freeland said.
Earlier this year, Tennessee became the first Southern state to expand its state paid leave policy beyond just parental leave. The state legislature voted almost unanimously to extend its six-week paid leave policy to cover state workers providing end-of-life care to a family member.
“We’re seeing a growing recognition that people need support for these types of family or caregiving needs,” said Freeland, “and that it strengthens the workforce and economy to be able to provide that.”

Most of the clients Keene serves at the Susanna Wesley Family Learning Center in southeast Missouri are working but still rely on federal food assistance to keep up with ever-increasing costs.
The center provides a domestic violence shelter, parenting education and summer camps to struggling families stretched thin by living expenses. Keene, the center’s CEO, worries about how her clients can absorb significant cuts to food stamps, officially called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.
“I don’t see communities just being able to absorb that need,” she said. “I don’t know what the impact is going to be yet, but I cannot imagine that it’s going to be good.”
Billions in cuts to federal food assistance are looming as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a major tax and spending package that would slash federal spending on domestic programs to extend tax cuts passed during President Donald Trump’s first term. U.S. House Republicans passed the package in a 215-214 vote, and it’s now before the Senate.

Cuts to SNAP would affect residents of every state in all types of communities, but advocates fear the fallout could especially hit rural people, who are more dependent on food stamps, the largest anti-hunger program in the nation.
The legislation that passed the House would cut food assistance by an estimated $300 billion, according to the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. One key provision of the bill would expand work requirements to include people between 55 and 64 years old and those with children aged 7 or older. It would also tighten rules for counties with high unemployment rates.



Hunger in North Carolina

In a recent interview with NC Newsline, Amy Beros, the President and CEO of the Food Bank of Central and Eastern North Carolina, which serves an array of urban and rural counties, said her agency is already struggling to cope with rising demand and expects that proposed cuts in Washington will worsen the situation.
“In the past three years, just in our 34 counties that we serve, hunger has increased by over 150,000 people,” Beros said. “We’re seeing it worse than we saw at the height of the pandemic. It’s the worst than we’ve seen in nearly two decades, and unfortunately, with the decisions that are being made at the state level and federal level right now, we anticipate that that need is going to rise drastically with the proposed cuts.”
–Rob Schofield



Together, the changes would remove more than 3 million Americans from the program in an average month, reducing spending by more than $92 billion over 10 years, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
The legislation will likely face changes in Senate negotiations. The measure was endorsed in a letter signed by 20 of the nation’s 27 Republican governors.
A greater share of rural residents currently rely on SNAP than those in metropolitan areas, according to the Food Research & Action Center, a nonprofit focusing on hunger and health among the impoverished. Rural hunger is already on the rise and grocery stores face an uphill battle to keep going in the most isolated parts of the country.










The SNAP cuts are definitely going to make an impact because we already have hungry kids.


– Marsha Keene, CEO of the Susanna Wesley Family Learning Center in Missouri


In her corner of Missouri, Keene said, limited job opportunities leave many workers struggling to cover housing and grocery bills. Nearly a quarter of residents live below the poverty line in Mississippi County — almost double the state and national averages.
She recalled her own recent trip to the grocery store, where high prices caused her to forgo items on her list such as orange juice and meat. “And I have a pretty good job,” she said.
“The SNAP cuts are definitely going to make an impact because we already have hungry kids.”
‘I’d probably close the doors’
The National Grocers Association has opposed the potential cuts, saying SNAP provides not only critical food, but also meaningful boosts to local employment and economies. The organization, which represents retail and wholesale grocers, said cuts will particularly hurt independent and rural stores.
“Cutting SNAP would harm the most vulnerable Americans and threaten the viability of community grocery stores that are depended upon by their local economies and neighborhoods,” the association said in a May statement.
Facing competitive pressures from online retailers and big-box stores with lower prices, rural grocery stores are already struggling to remain viable.

But deep cuts to SNAP would have an uneven impact on rural stores.
For Kay Voss, the cuts would be catastrophic at her Stratton Country Market in southwest Nebraska. She estimates 40% of sales are paid for with SNAP.
“I’d probably close the doors,” she said.
That’s a possibility with or without federal changes: Struggling to turn a profit in the town of about 340 people, Voss said the market likely won’t last much longer.
“There’s nothing to be made on the grocery side,” she said.
Several grocery store operators interviewed by Stateline were more optimistic. Some said they believed locals were using their federal benefits at chains in nearby cities for cheaper prices or anonymity.

Tasha Malay, one of the owners of Malay’s Market in western Kansas, said SNAP made up less than 2% of the store’s sales last year.
While she believes cuts to the federal program are “a terrible idea” broadly, she said it won’t make a huge difference for her store.
“I think the people that qualify are utilizing it, but I think that they’re spending the dollars elsewhere,” she said.
Profit margins are famously slight in the grocery industry, especially for rural stores facing an onslaught of competition from dollar stores whose bulk purchasing allows them to offer much lower prices.
“When they’re operating on such thin margins anyways, that could have a huge impact on whether or not the store can remain open,” said Carlie Jonas, a policy associate at the nonprofit Center for Rural Affairs.
The center has worked with lawmakers to preserve rural grocery stores, which provide locals with social connections in addition to fresh meat and produce. Proposed legislation to fund $2 million in rural grocery assistance did not win approval from the Nebraska legislature because of the state’s challenging budget cycle, Jonas said.
That figure, though, pales in comparison to new costs Nebraska could face if the proposed SNAP changes are enacted.
One component of the federal legislation would shift billions of costs from the federal government to states to administer SNAP.
A Nebraska-based think tank estimates the state would have to spend at least $39 million a year to make up for the lost federal funds.
“Every single state is going to have to make some really difficult decisions,” Jonas said.

In Wisconsin, state officials estimate the changes would cost the state $314 million per year.
“This is over a quarter billion dollars each year that Wisconsin couldn’t use for our health care, our roads, our schools, or our economy,” Wisconsin Medicaid Director Bill Hanna said in a May statement.
U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, downplayed the impacts of the changes.
“We are not cutting SNAP,” he said May 25 on CBS News’ political show “Face the Nation.” “We’re working in the elements of fraud, waste and abuse. SNAP for example, listen to the statistics, in 2024, over $11 billion in SNAP payments were erroneous.”
A PolitiFact breakdown published May 29 disputed Johnson’s remarks, concluding that three independent analyses show millions of people could lose SNAP benefits.
‘It’s time to sound the alarm’
Food insecurity is already on the rise in rural America.
Even in heartland areas where farming is central to the local economy, many have trouble accessing fresh and affordable food.
“We’re seeing food insecurity across the entire state rise, but really disproportionately in our more rural areas,” said Tim Williams, government affairs and advocacy officer at Food Bank for the Heartland, an Omaha, Neb.-based nonprofit serving 93 counties across Nebraska and Iowa.

Williams said cuts to the SNAP program will drive up demand on food banks, especially in rural areas that have long struggled with access and transportation to secure fresh foods. In sparsely populated areas such as western Nebraska, it’s difficult to get to grocery stores — if they exist at all.
“There are counties in the state where there are more cows than people, and so things are very spread out,” he said. “They can be very difficult to get to. Sometimes there’s only one pantry or one grocery store in a county.”
The federal food program works in tandem with food banks to keep people from going hungry, Williams said. And cuts to federal aid will unquestionably affect nonprofits.
“It will put a disproportionate burden on the charitable food system that they can’t sustain because they’re already seeing too many people,” he said.
Susie Boelter, executive director of the North Country Food Bank, said it’s time to expand food assistance — not cut it. She told the North Dakota Monitor her nonprofit has experienced “staggering increases” in need over the past three years.
For every meal the food bank provides across its 21-county service area in North Dakota, SNAP provides nine, she said.
“Any additional cuts will put a ton of pressure on our emergency food system,” Boelter said. “Food banks are good at getting food into the hands of people who need it, but it’s time to sound the alarm.”

SPRINGFIELD – While Illinois State Police has long investigated child sex crimes, a new measure would explicitly name addressing internet crimes against children as a core mission of its criminal division.

House Bill 2586, also called Alicia’s Law, would add to the current 13 missions of the Illinois State Police Department of Criminal Investigations. It passed both chambers of the Illinois General Assembly unanimously in late May.

The bill is named after Alicia Kozak, a survivor of and advocate against online crimes against children, who was at the center of the first nationally known case of child grooming and abduction in 2002. At age 13, Kozak was abducted from her home after months of online grooming by a 38-year-old man, who took her across state lines and chained her in a basement, where she was sexually assaulted and tortured for four days. The perpetrator livestreamed Kozak’s abuse, which was quickly reported to the FBI by a viewer, aiding in Kozak’s release.

“I’ve spent the last 25 years sharing my story and presenting to audiences about online safety and advocating for critical change. And through my work, I’ve heard so many heartbreaking ‘if only’ stories, ‘if only we had known sooner’ or ‘if only we could have stopped it,’” Kozak said in an interview. “Now, with Alicia’s Law in Illinois, Illinois children are safer.”

If signed by the governor, Illinois will be the 13th state to adopt a variation of Alicia’s Law. In most states that have passed a version of the law, it allows states to create a task force to investigate internet crimes against children. Illinois already has such a task force that was created in 2004, although it’s currently under the attorney general’s office.

Illinois’ task force coordinates the AG’s office with state law enforcement officials to investigate and prosecute child exploitation cases. During an October 2021 news conference, Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul said his office managed over 5,100 cyber tips the year prior, an increase of over 2,000 since 2018. Raoul said he expected that number to continue to grow, in part due to increased reporting and awareness by social media and apps.

Illinois State Police Director Brendan Kelly said although ISP has become “much more engaged” in cases involving internet crimes against children in recent years, he said he believes it needs to be explicitly stated in statute that investigating those types of cases is one of ISP’s core duties.

Through talks with Kozak about the issue, Kelly said ISP drafted the bill and spearheaded efforts to get it passed during this year’s legislative session.

“We believe that this is something that is critical, this is important and that is essential to what our values are as the Illinois State Police,” Kelly said. “Making sure that this is a legal, permanent function of our agency is something that I think needed to be done because we want to make sure that these efforts are sustained over time.”

Kozak agreed.

“Before the law, investigating crimes against children in Illinois wasn’t really a legal obligation, it was something Illinois state police would choose to do when resources allowed,” Kozak said. “And now, with Alicia’s Law, it’s a permanent responsibility, it’s no longer optional.”

Kelly Armstrong on Thursday appointed a Minot attorney to a judgeship in the North Central Judicial District covering Burke, Mountrail and Ward counties.
The appointment of Steven Lautt is effective Aug. 4. The judgeship is chambered in Minot. 
Lautt, a Minot native, has been with the Minot law firm of Pringle and Herigstad since 2012. He is the general counsel for several regional agriculture and telecommunications cooperatives and a statewide nonprofit organization, according to a news release from the governor’s office. 
Lautt earned his bachelor’s degree from Tabor College in Kansas, and his law degree in 2012 from the Washburn University School of Law in Kansas. He is a former president of the Ward County Bar Association and current president of the North Dakota Association for Justice. Lautt serves on the board of directors of the Minot-based Northern Plains Children’s Advocacy Center.
The North Central Judicial District judgeship became vacant June 1 with the retirement of Judge Douglas Mattson, who was first elected as judge in 2002.

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)TOPEKA — Kansas measles cases rose to 71 and were found in 11 counties in south-central and southwest Kansas, the state reported Wednesday.
Sixty-nine cases are associated with the outbreak in southwest Kansas, where three hospitalizations have also been reported, according to the Kansas Department of Health and Environment dashboard.
Counties where measles have been reported are Finney, Ford, Grant, Gray, Haskell, Kiowa, Morton, Pawnee, Reno, Sedgwick and Stevens. Gray has the most cases with 25 and is part of what is considered the outbreak, in which transmission is connected to other cases within an area. Sedgwick and Reno counties are outside the outbreak area, and the two cases there have been connected to international travel, the Sedgwick County Health Department website said.
County health departments continue to hold vaccine clinics. The Sedgwick County Health Department has one scheduled from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Saturday at the Evergreen Recreation Center, 2700 N. Woodland, Wichita.
In data updated Wednesday, KDHE indicated 57 cases were in children ages birth to 17 years, with the remaining 13 in people ages 18 to 64 years. Among the 69 cases associated with the outbreak, 58 were in unvaccinated people, one person was not age-appropriately vaccinated, five people were age-appropriately vaccinated, three people had vaccination statuses that could not be verified and two were pending verification.
Dana Hawkinson, medical director of infection prevention and control at the University of Kansas Health System, said in a previous story that fully vaccinated people can get the disease but typically have fewer complications and overall less severity of illness. With one dose of the vaccine, people have 93% protection from measles, and after two doses, 97% protection, he said.

The stakes could not be higher—this is a matter of life and death. 
To say that Waterbury’s handling by Prospect Medical, who bought the hospital for $31.8 million in 2016, has been poor would be an understatement. Senator Chris Murphy has called it an outright “abomination.” The private equity model of Prospect has destroyed any hope of the hospital doing what it should: provide good, accessible healthcare to those in the area. 

Gray West
My first exposure to the issues with Waterbury Hospital occurred in Waterbury at the Brookside Housing Cooperatives, a local complex of housing cooperatives. Alex Kolokotronis, the Director for Naugatuck Valley Project, while guiding a tour of the cooperatives made it clear that “at the end of the day it affects everyone in the area.” 
The city of Waterbury, with a population of 114,990, should not have to depend on a hospital whose owners look to maximize profits instead of providing the basic healthcare necessities. The for-profit ownership model of hospitals, exemplified by Prospect Medical’s handling of Waterbury Hospital, endangers public health and must be stopped. 
Waterbury was first opened in 1890 with just 30 beds available and has expanded since to 357 licensed beds. Waterbury has a Cardiology, Orthopedic Surgery, a Surgical Innovation Center, and a Family Birthing Center, and it offers an extensive array of additional services. On paper, Waterbury sounds like a thriving, well-funded, and modern hospital. The issue: private-equity ownership. 
Since Waterbury Hospital was bought by Prospect Medical, there have been extensive issues of ownership and mismanagement that all are rooted in the private equity model of Prospect. The model? Initially infuse hospitals with large amounts of funding, then saddle the hospitals with massive amounts of debt, cut staff, cut supplies and investments, maximize profits before selling or declaring bankruptcy. That is exactly what Prospect has done. 
Prospect came into the Waterbury ownership with the promise of “turning around [the] financially challenged hospital.” It was seen as just that, a possible salvation for a faltering hospital. A 2024 investigation by state health inspectors was “concerned that the ICU is often inappropriately staffed” and that Waterbury was “not providing quality patient care.” 
Sarah Campell, a former nurse at Waterbury, spoke with the CT Insider. She painted a devastatingly bleak portrait of Waterbury. She reported water leaks, broken beds, inoperable computers, a lack of cell service, and plumbing issues. It would then make sense that Prospect was issued a $60,000 fine for health code violations that same year. 
Prospect followed the private equity playbook with chilling precision. In January, Prospect filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, having milked profits from people just looking for good healthcare. When I say milked, I mean the fact that Prospect owes Waterbury roughly $22 million in unpaid city taxes. This bankruptcy filing ripples far beyond Waterbury, threatening Prospect’s other Connecticut hospitals, Manchester Memorial and Rockville General as well. Hospitals are not hedge funds. People’s health is not an asset class. Waterbury should have been treated like a place of care, not a business deal. 
Yale New Haven Health (YNHH) reached a deal to buy all three hospitals in 2022 with a settled amount of $435 million dollars. However, this quickly fell through due to a series of lawsuits and counter-lawsuits between the two groups over the true value of the assets. YNHH and the overarching healthcare system allege that once the $435 million dollar settlement was reached and signed, Prospect began to neglect the properties, decreasing the overall value of purchasing for YNHH. With reports of neglecting to pay rent and the denial by Prospect to provide YNHH with an audit, a spokesperson reported, “The lawsuit filed by Prospect is a clear attempt to shift attention away from the for-profit, California-based company’s mismanagement of their Connecticut facilities and neglect of the communities who entrusted them with their care.” 
Monetarily the for-profit private equity was successful for Prospect. The issue is that this model comes at the risk and expense of real people, with real issues, and real health to take care of. The truth seems to be that Prospect did not and does not care about this when it comes to the monetary value of their stakeholders and investors. 
Something must be done about Waterbury, Manchester Memorial, and Rockville General as soon as possible. Terms of settlement and discussion need to be moved away from money and look at the real thing being discussed, which is the lives of people. The lives of people who actually depend on the services and care of these hospitals. No person should enter a hospital and worry about the quality of service, lack of staffing, or be boarded in an ER for a full day before being seen. 
Connecticut lawmakers are taking action this session with House Bill 7067 calling for an expedited timeline for acquisition of bankrupt hospitals and Senate Bill 1507, a proposal to flat out ban private equity ownership of hospitals. 
Waterbury’s story shows what happens when healthcare becomes a profit machine instead of a public good. It should be treated as such and used as a lesson for healthcare across America. Prospect’s structure harming everyday citizens is not a uniquely Waterbury issue, it is one that can be seen across the United States. It’s time to put an end to the era of profit-first healthcare. People’s lives—not private equity returns—must come first.

Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder.Georgia’s state Senate will have a new face when lawmakers return to work next year, and seven people are vying to be the one posing for photos under the Gold Dome when the dust settles.
  Former Sen. Brandon Beach. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
The spot opened in this off-year election after Alpharetta Republican Sen. Brandon Beach stepped down following his appointment to serve as U.S. Treasurer under President Donald Trump.
Election Day is scheduled for Aug. 26.
Senate District 21 includes much of Cherokee County and some of north Fulton County. With seven candidates on the ballot, it’s likely that none will win an outright majority, and the most probable outcome is a runoff between the top two vote getters regardless of their party. The runoff is planned for Sept. 23.
Beach has been a stalwart ally to Trump – he was a leader in backing the false idea that the 2020 election was rigged and in pushing back against Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis’ criminal case against Trump – and his former district rewarded him for his devotion.
Beach, who had served in the Senate since 2013, won just over 70% of the vote against his Democratic opponents in 2024 and 2018, the only times he faced a challenge from the other party. In 2024, Beach slightly outperformed Trump in the district, earning 81,481 votes, good for just over 70%, compared with Trump’s 78,544, or about 66.5%, according to data from the Georgia Secretary of State’s office analyzed by the Georgia Recorder.
So it’s no surprise that six of the seven Senate hopefuls are running as Republicans. Five of them came to Canton Monday for a forum hosted by the conservative Americans for Prosperity and answered questions about their commitment to principles like smaller government and lower taxes.
Policy-wise, there was not a whole lot of space between the candidates at the forum. Each said they support legislation expanding school vouchers, reducing or eliminating the state income tax and reducing government regulations – though the candidates did express some disagreement on accomplishing those goals.
Lance Calvert
  Lance Calvert. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Lance Calvert is the founder and owner of a Canton-based maintenance and repair business for retail and restaurants who says he wants to help repair the country.
“God’s going to fix this country, but he’s got some people that he needs to participate with him. Trump got this thing started, whether he knew or not to begin with. But there’s a lot of people who’ve been called forward, and they’re going to answer the call, we’re gonna do this. We’re going to turn this country around.”
While some candidates proposed a gradual approach to reducing the state income tax, suggesting a state equivalent to Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, Calvert advocated for a quick and direct approach.
“Eliminate it. We’ve got the money,” he said.
Income taxes account for about half of state funds, according to the Georgia Budget and Policy Institute, with sales taxes making up the second largest revenue source at about a quarter.
Stephanie Donegan
  Stephanie Donegan. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Stephanie Donegan, an entrepreneur and business strategist, said she’s seen the effects of rising prices for things like health insurance and will support conservative fiscal policies she says will help people keep more of their income.
“I love Georgia, I love the people of Georgia, and what I’ve been seeing is that what the people in Georgia have been asking for and need, we have not been getting. I truly believe I am that person who can do it. I can clearly sit up here among a group of amazing men, but men nonetheless, and still have a voice,” she said.”
Responding to a question about outreach to Latino voters, Donegan, who is Black, said Republicans have not done enough to reach minority voters.
“If we’re not careful, we’re going to become a blue state,” she said. “We are purple. We have a lot of people moving in here from blue states, from Philadelphia, New York, California, and if we don’t get people to understand that they have a place in this party and why they should vote for these conservative values, we’re going to lose this state, and that’s going to be a shame.”
Brice Futch
  Brice Futch. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Brice Futch, a Cherokee County firefighter, said he’ll push for expansive conservative policies, including replacing the state income tax with a consumption tax on goods and services purchased as well as expanding Georgia’s school voucher program.
“I believe the next step is ESAs, education savings accounts,” he said. “With that, the full amount of money that is given to the student over the life of the student would be loaded on a debit card. Parents would take their debit card and go to the education institution of their choice. If they decided they want to homeschool, they could also use that for homeschool curriculum as well. I also think it needs to apply to local funding and not just state funding.”
Georgia’s current school voucher program is available to students in low performing schools and provides funds based on the state’s share of the cost to educate that student, with the local share of the money staying in the local district.
Though Monday’s discussion centered on economic policies, Futch also pledged to be a strong voice on cultural issues.
“I believe you have to look at broader moral values,” he said. “If you want somebody that’s going to stand up and introduce legislation to outlaw puberty blockers in 2026, I’m your guy.”
A ban on the drugs that doctors prescribe to some transgender youths to delay the onset of puberty has been proposed but hasn’t passed. Georgia prohibits gender affirming surgeries and hormone treatments for transgender minors.
Steve West
  Steve West. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Steve West, the CEO of a metal fabrication company, stepped down from a seat on the Cherokee County Board of Commissioners to run for the seat.
“I want to run for the state Senate so I can go down to represent our district and cut taxes, bring business in, keep Georgia the best place to work, the best place to do business. You can tell I’m one that doesn’t speak very well. But I love the county. I love District 21. I’ve been a life-long resident of this district.”
West, who was first elected to the commission in 2014, said he may not be the slickest orator, but he says he has a record of serving the community and proposed ending the state film tax credit.
“I’m not the guy that wants to have his picture put in the paper every day. I want to be the one that goes down and fights for District 21 on the issues that we’re talking about tonight,” he said. “I want to go down and look at doing away with funding Hollywood and putting that money back into the income tax. Take away the income tax, quit funding Hollywood. Let’s look at deregulation so we can get projects done.”
Brian Will
  Brian Will. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Brian Will, an entrepreneur and author, resigned from a seat on the Alpharetta City Council to seek a place in the Senate.
For a Republican candidate, Will took several unorthodox positions on popular conservative programs, including the school voucher program and eliminating the state income tax.
In each case, Will supported the concept but found fault with how state leaders implemented them.
He said he supports the voucher project but said not enough people can take advantage of it and fully funding it would be too expensive. He said eliminating the state income tax and instituting a consumption tax would harm low-income Georgians who spend a greater portion of what they earn.
“This is why we need Georgia DOGE. We’ve got to go find out where the money went, who got it, for what, and how much, and then start cutting what we’re spending and come back and lowering the taxes.”
Will also had different ideas on the bill sometimes billed as Georgia DOGE, the Red Tape Rollback Act supported by Lt. Gov. Burt Jones, which passed the Senate this year but stalled in the House. He argued the proposal would create more red tape.
“Simply put, we have 150,000 rules and regulations in the state of Georgia. We have 100 different agencies. Each agency is going to be required to go through every single one of those rules to determine if that rule costs more than $3 billion to implement over a five-year period. Now I’ve done math on this. I’ve done some research on it. It’ll take us about four years to get through every single rule to figure out if it’s a good rule that doesn’t cost money. The problem now is that the clock starts again. We have to do this every four years.”
Jason Dickerson
One Republican candidate qualified with the Georgia Secretary of State’s office to appear on the ballot but did not participate in Monday’s forum.
Jason Dickerson did not respond to a request for comment, but according to his qualifying documents, Dickerson is a Cherokee County investment manager. On his campaign website, he describes himself as “A conservative Republican businessman – not a typical politician.”
Debra Shigley
  Debra Shigley. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Attorney Debra Shigley is the sole Democrat in the race, who announced her candidacy last month. Last year, Shigley challenged the powerful House Speaker Pro Tem, Milton Republican Jan Jones, but lost by about 62% to 48%.
Members of her party are likely hoping that a crowded Republican field will split the conservative vote and put her into a runoff at a time when turnout could be low and Democrats are riled up to vote.
In a phone call, Shigley said voters in the district are not happy with what they are seeing from the government and she’s hoping to convince them she can help be a part of the solution.
“I know what it’s like to be a hardworking Georgian raising a family and wanting to make sure that they have every opportunity in front of them. I have been raising my kids here in the district and I never thought I would get into this arena, but as a mom, as a lawyer, as a small business owner, I just felt I could not stay on the sidelines because what we’re seeing here in our own community as well as in the state and even in our country is not going in the right direction, and something’s got to change.”

(Photo by Nick Evans, Ohio Capital Journal.)Ohio House Minority Leader Allison Russo, D-Upper Arlington, is stepping down from her leadership role at the end of the month. 
Russo has served as minority leader since January 2022 and she will continue to serve as state representative until her term ends on Dec. 31, 2026. She made the announcement to her caucus Thursday morning.

“Serving as the Ohio House Minority leader for the last three and a half years has been an incredible honor,” she said in a statement. “It has been one of the most challenging yet rewarding positions I’ve had the privilege to hold.”
Russo was first elected as state representative in November 2018, flipping a previously held Republican seat. She worked in health policy for more than 20 years before entering politics. Russo ran for Congress in 2021, but lost to U.S. Rep. Mike Carey 58% to 42%. 
“Every strong leader knows the importance of a thoughtful transition,” she said in a statement. “At the beginning of this session, I communicated to members that I wanted to remain in leadership through the important state operating budget negotiations.”
Heading into the legislative summer break and the rest of the General Assembly session, however, she said it “is important that I give the next leadership team ample time to thoughtfully and carefully plan how to navigate our caucus priorities after this budget cycle and to continue building our effort to pick up more seats for Democrats in the Ohio House in 2026.”  
Russo also said she wants to focus on her family, policy work and serving her district. 
“My son just graduated high school, and I look forward to spending the summer with him and my family preparing to send him off to college,” said Russo, who has three children. “Any decisions regarding my political future, will come at a later time.”
Russo is term-limited in the House and has been tight-lipped about her future plans. 
During her time as minority leader, Russo has been forced to navigate a Republican supermajority. 
“Over the last few years, my colleagues and I have stood strong in the face of attacks on our most basic rights and values, and despite tough odds we were successful in standing up for all Ohioans,” Russo said.
Ohio Democrats secured a couple of major victories in 2023 — voting down an effort that would have made it harder to pass constitutional amendments, and voting to enshrine abortion and reproductive rights in the state’s constitution. 
Russo’s announcement comes the same month Ohio Democratic Party Chair Liz Walters announced her plan to step down. So far, Dr. Amy Acton is the only Democratic candidate who has announced they are running for governor in 2026. Republican Vivek Ramaswamy is running for governor and Ohio Lieutenant Governor Jim Tressel is considering running. 
Ohio Supreme Court Judge Jennifer Brunner is the only Democrat in statewide office in Ohio.
“During her time as minority leader, Leader Russo has led Ohio House Democrats in fighting back against threats to our democracy, working to pass legislation that benefits Ohio families, and even picked up democratic seats during a difficult election cycle,” Walters said in a statement. “In an extremely difficult legislature, she has found countless ways to deliver for Ohioans.”
Ohio Senate Minority Leader Nickie J. Antonio, D-Lakewood, said she enjoyed working with Russo. 
“Leader Russo has been a dedicated advocate for working-class Ohioans and a fighter for fairness and justice in our state,” Antonio said in a statement. “I am confident that her voice will remain critical in shaping Ohio’s future, and I look forward to working with the next leader who will inherit the strong foundation she built in the House.”

(Photo credit: Christine Sexton/Florida Phoenix)House Speaker Daniel Perez said Thursday the chamber will try again next year to pass a repeal of the “free kill” statute following Gov. Ron DeSantis’ veto of the proposal.
DeSantis on May 29 vetoed the Legislature’s attempt to remove the bar on parents of adult children and the adult children of single parents from suing hospitals and physicians for non-economic damages for the deaths of loved ones. The governor said repealing “free kill” would increase health care costs for Floridians and make it harder to keep physicians in the state.
“Of course, the governor has in his right the power to veto this bill, and he chose to do so,” Perez told reporters. “I disagree with the veto, and we will be bringing that bill back next year for a continued conversation.”
The Florida Justice Association, the group that represents the state’s trial attorneys that championed the measure, released a statement saying the decision to not override the veto was “disappointing.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Lawmakers passed HB 6017 with bipartisan support. Repealing the ban on suits to recover non-economic damages is one of the perennial arguments in Tallahassee, as business interests and medical groups oppose the move.
Perez said he remains opposed to placing caps on the pain-and-suffering damages, which is something that DeSantis said could make him support the repeal in the future, along with caps on attorneys’ fees. The family members barred from suing for pain-and-suffering damages can recover economic damages, such as lost wages, medical bills, and funeral costs.
“I don’t think that we should determine how much a person’s life is worth when someone negligently ended it,” Perez said.
The Senate also rejected a bid to cap the damages at $1 million on April 30. Florida, for now, remains the only state banning the recovery of pain-and-suffering damages for parents of adult children and adult children of single parents.
Disappointing decision
Florida Justice Association President Todd Michaels said the decision to not override the governor’s veto is disappointing, noting that 93% of the Legislature voted for the bill.
“The Governor’s veto and call for caps in all medical malpractice cases fails to consider victims and instead gives us the green light to negligent medical providers and limits their accountability when they hurt or kill other people. The safety of all Floridians will suffer,” he said in a prepared statement. ” The continuation of this unjust law in Florida means insurance companies’ discriminatory practice to ensure that victims are unable to achieve justice or accountability when a bad doctor kills their parents or child. It  means that a lack of accountability, and therefore a lack of safety, continue.”

DeSantis on May 29 vetoed the Legislature’s attempt to remove the bar on parents of adult children and the adult children of single parents from suing hospitals and physicians for non-economic damages for the deaths of loved ones. The governor said repealing “free kill” would increase health care costs for Floridians and make it harder to keep physicians in the state.
“Of course, the governor has in his right the power to veto this bill, and he chose to do so,” Perez told reporters. “I disagree with the veto, and we will be bringing that bill back next year for a continued conversation.”
Lawmakers passed HB 6017 with bipartisan support. Repealing the ban on suits to recover non-economic damages is one of the perennial arguments in Tallahassee, as business interests and medical groups oppose the move.
Perez said he remains opposed to placing caps on the pain-and-suffering damages, which is something that DeSantis said could make him support the repeal in the future, along with caps on attorneys’ fees. The family members barred from suing for pain-and-suffering damages can recover economic damages, such as lost wages, medical bills, and funeral costs.
“I don’t think that we should determine how much a person’s life is worth when someone negligently ended it,” Perez said.
The Senate also rejected a bid to cap the damages at $1 million on April 30. Florida, for now, remains the only state banning the recovery of pain-and-suffering damages for parents of adult children and adult children of single parents.

Lawmakers appropriated $312 million to purchase the facility from The GEO Group.
The state expects to take over the facility July 25.
The Board of Corrections must approve it.
“This move not only strengthens our public safety infrastructure, but also reflects our commitment to better outcomes for staff, inmates and the people of Oklahoma,” said Steven Harpe, Oklahoma Department of Corrections director, in a statement.
Built in 1998, the facility houses about 2,100 Oklahoma offenders, said Kay Thompson, a Department of Corrections spokeswoman.
The facility has medium security beds and a protective custody unit, she said.
The purchase price includes 560 acres, the buildings and equipment, Thompson said.
Current Lawton Correctional Facility employees will be offered employment after the successful completion of a background and drug test, Thompson said.
Some lawmakers were critical of the decision to purchase the prison, saying they were not told about it until the last minute.
Oklahoma used to rely on private prisons in Texas to house offenders before companies began building in Oklahoma.

,DC,2025-06-05 15:15:03+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump opens investigation into Biden autopen use,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-opens-investigation-biden-autopen-use,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump late Wednesday ordered the White House legal counsel and U.S. attorney general to investigate when Biden administration staff used an autopen to sign the former president’s name on official documents, alleging that Biden might not have known or approved of their actions.The inquiry represents an escalation in Trump’s animosity toward and legal action against former President Joe Biden, who vehemently denies the allegations that he didn’t know what executive orders or pardons were signed during his term.Trump has repeatedly suggested that Biden wasn’t fully cognizant during the end of his administration. Similar concerns were reported on by dozens of news organizations following Biden’s answers and behavior during a debate in June 2024.Biden’s apparent confusion during some of the debate raised alarm bells among fellow Democrats and eventually led him to withdraw from his reelection campaign, later endorsing then-Vice President Kamala Harris.Trump’s memorandum alleges “Biden's aides abused the power of Presidential signatures through the use of an autopen to conceal Biden's cognitive decline and assert Article II authority.“This conspiracy marks one of the most dangerous and concerning scandals in American history. The American public was purposefully shielded from discovering who wielded the executive power, all while Biden's signature was deployed across thousands of documents to effect radical policy shifts.” The memo stated that if Biden staff used an autopen, a mechanical device that mimics a person’s signature, “to conceal this incapacity, while taking radical executive actions all in his name, that would constitute an unconstitutional wielding of the power of the Presidency, a circumstance that would have implications for the legality and validity of numerous executive actions undertaken in Biden's name.”Trump said Thursday during an appearance in the Oval Office that he hadn’t discovered any evidence that Biden aides violated the law.“No, but I've uncovered the human mind,” Trump said. “I was in a debate with the human mind and I didn't think he knew what the hell he was doing. So it's one of those things, one of those problems. We can't ever allow that to happen to our country.”  Biden released a written statement rejecting the claims Trump laid out in the memo, arguing the investigation “is nothing more than a distraction by Donald Trump and Congressional Republicans who are working to push disastrous legislation that would cut essential programs like Medicaid and raise costs on American families, all to pay for tax breaks for the ultra-wealthy and big corporations.”“Let me be clear: I made the decisions during my presidency. I made the decisions about the pardons, executive orders, legislation, and proclamations,” Biden wrote. “Any suggestion that I didn’t is ridiculous and false.""",,,,2025-06-05 14:12:26.966485

The utility, which provides electricity to most of Nevada, is asking state regulators to approve a revenue increase of $215.7 million that could hike  rates by 9% in Southern Nevada. It’s also asking to increase shareholder return on equity from 9.5% to 10.25%; level the playing field between rooftop solar and conventional ratepayers; and save low-income Southern Nevadans about $20 a month by eliminating their basic service charge.
“NV Energy is acting like it’s so benevolent,” Las Vegan Angel DeFazio told the Current of the proposed elimination of the service charge for customers earning less than 150% of the federal poverty level. “They’re not the good guys. They’re passing it on to us. They’re just redistributing the cost.” 
But representatives of charitable groups and veterans organizations that receive grants from NV Energy voiced support for the rate hike, as did the Asian Chamber of Commerce and Latin Chamber of Commerce. 
“My business community relies on energy, relies on being able to open their doors and conduct business. That takes an investment. That takes reliability. That is NV Energy,” said Peter Guzman, president of the Latin Chamber of Commerce. 
Guzman said he was not asked by NV Energy to speak on its behalf. The utility’s spokesperson did not respond when asked if NV Energy solicited support from the organizations. 
Longtime gaming executive and former acting UNLV president Don Snyder, who is currently chairman of the United Way Board of Directors, defended the utility’s bid to raise rates. Snyder said the non-profit touches one in four Nevadans through a variety of services. 
“We are uniquely positioned to understand the needs of our community, particularly our low income individuals and families,” Snyder told PUC Commissioner Tammy Cordova, who is presiding over NV Energy’s rate hike request. Snyder added United Way has a “longstanding partnership” with NV Energy, its employees,  and its foundation, which “provides financial grants supporting utility assistance for our low income senior citizens.” 
Others contend now is no time to raise the cost of electricity. 
Dr. Mary House, co-founder of Caring, Helping & Restoring Lives (CHR), urged the commission to hold NV Energy accountable for energy policies that she says disproportionately affect low-income individuals and families.
“They’re sacrificing necessary medicines just to pay their bills. They’re limiting how much they spend on groceries just to pay their bills,” House said, adding many of the families her organization serves pay a disproportionate share of their income toward electricity. 
House added that she has taken steps to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and increase energy efficiency. “But many households, the ones who I represent, don’t have the means to even make those changes.” 
House also encouraged the utility to fully refund overpayments of at least $17 million the utility assessed against some 70,000 customers in multi-family units over a 20-year span.  
Angela Hollimen moved to Las Vegas in 2018. The retiree said although she lives with family, making ends meet remains a struggle. 
“Since I moved here, I’ve noticed that everything’s been going up,” she said, adding her family has taken all the recommended steps to reduce energy costs. “Were doing what we’re supposed to do, and questioning whether we should have moved here.” 
Tracy Puckett, another retiree, said she “saved and saved” to install a $30,000 rooftop solar array on her home. NV Energy’s efforts to tweak its net metering formula will cost her and other solar customers more, extend the time it takes to recoup their investment, and deter more ratepayers from going solar. “I want my investment to mean something.”
The utility’s request to impose peak usage rates on customers drew protests from ratepayers who say the scheme penalizes working people who are not home to run appliances during hours when the system faces less demand. 
A customer using 5 kWh would pay $27 more per month, while a customer using 6 kWh would pay $38 more per month, according to data provided by Advanced Energy United, a trade group that represents renewable energy providers. 
Total usage during the monthly billing period would be irrelevant.
Should the PUC turn down the proposal for a peak demand rate, NV Energy wants to increase the basic service charge in Southern Nevada from $18.50 to $24, far less than the projected increase of maximum demand charges. 
The proposed changes “reflect the company and its shareholders’ best interests and not its customers’,” Julia Hubbard of Solar United Neighbors (SUN), an organization dedicated to educating ratepayers, said at the consumer session. “When someone goes solar, they are not just saving on future utility bills. They are adding infrastructure to the grid on their dime.”
“This proposal doesn’t account for their recent mismanagement of customer classifications, resulting in millions of dollars in overcharges, or lack of real progress on their transportation electrification plan and their community solar program,” Hubbard said, adding the utility, charged with constructing 120 electric vehicle charging stations, has completed 40. 
Hubbard said NV Energy’s plan to change the way it calculates net metering by calculating excess energy returned to the grid every 15 minutes rather than monthly, would reduce the value of rooftop solar and disincentivize investment in “a powerful tool that Nevada residents can use to lighten their energy burden while contributing to statewide goals.” 
The change is expected to increase monthly bills for rooftop solar customers by about $11 a month, and would affect customers who apply for net metering after Oct. 1 of this year. 
The move would delay return on investment for homeowners who install rooftop solar in the future, Hubbard said. 
“People are struggling to pay their energy bills,” she said. “This is not the time to raise rates.” 
The PUC will hold hearings on NV Energy’s rate hike request in September. If approved, the changes would go into effect in April 2026.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/D4983C29-B5B1-4344-BDEC-BCAF52B32D8C-1024x589.png,,,2025-06-05 11:08:15.310363

The library relies on the Institute for Museum and Library Services (IMLS) for about half of its annual funding.
The money helps pay for things like interlibrary loans, professional development for librarians across South Dakota, summer reading program support and public access to paid educational databases.
Access to that funding was called into question twice over the last six months. First, Former Gov. Kristi Noem released a budget plan that slashed state funding for the library to a level too low to meet the federal match necessary to secure IMLS funding.
State lawmakers returned enough money to the library in their final budget in March to maintain access to the grants, but an executive order to gut IMLS from President Trump threw the South Dakota State Library’s future into question again.

Money for the grants is congressionally appropriated, but advocates worried that IMLS staff cuts caused by the Trump order would make it impossible for the federal agency to process grant applications.
In the face of that uncertainty, the State Library announced a suspension of the courier service that delivers books from library to library through interlibrary loans. Without a courier service, local libraries would’ve needed to mail materials ordered through interlibrary loan.
State Librarian George Seamon got good news in late spring. He told the South Dakota Library Board of a notice from IMLS on the state’s federal grant on April 24.
It was to be the board’s last meeting. Lawmakers dissolved the citizen-led advisory group and cut three positions from the State Library as part of the compromise deal to save it. Seamon told the board during the April meeting that the departing employees had new jobs.
He also said the state had received half its IMLS money, and that securing the other half was contingent on answers to some follow-up questions from IMLS on how the dollars would be spent.
Nancy Van Der Weide, spokeswoman for the state Department of Education, confirmed this week that the remainder of federal funding has now been secured. The state library is an arm of the state Department of Education.
The interlibrary loan courier service will resume June 1, she wrote in an email to South Dakota Searchlight.
The future of funding on the federal side beyond this year is unclear, however. Congress appropriates IMLS funding in periodic increments, most recently in 2018. Congress faces a choice of whether to re-up IMLS funding beyond 2025.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-05 14:56:11+00:00,CT Mirror,"Despite key bills’ passage, legislative session ends on sour note",Ginny Monk and Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/05/ct-legislative-session-ends/,"A number of bills passed in the waning hours of CT's 2025 legislative session, but many more died, and there were a few twists along the way.","Although the General Assembly closed out the session with hugs, cheers and applause, it was tinged with a sour note after a dispute among Democrats over a few lines in the state budget that allow the state to take financial oversight of Ansonia.
Republicans, displeased that the lines targeting Ansonia had been included in the budget, moved to undo them by amending an unrelated bill.
Speaker of the House Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, voted alongside Republicans, and the amendment passed with Ritter’s support, 80-70.
But victory was fleeting. The move prompted a filibuster from one Democrat on the newly amended bill, a rare move from the majority party. 
Rep. Kara Rochelle, D-Ansonia, who was in favor of the state takeover, made clear that she planning to kill the amended bill by speaking until the midnight adjournment.
The tactic worked — legislators moved on, and the bill died without a vote.
The budget provision was an unwelcome surprise to the city’s Republican mayor, David Cassetti.
Rochelle has been a critic of Cassetti and his management of the city. The pair long have feuded.
“She brought a personal gripe to Hartford. She’s entitled to have that gripe, but I think she shouldn’t have used the process to try to get even with her mayor,” said House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford. 
Candelora called the surprise effort to force state oversight on Ansonia “the most egregious abuse that I’ve ever seen in this building.”
Ritter said he regretted the inclusion of the Ansonia language in the budget: It should have been a separate bill subjected to a public hearing, and the unsuccessful 11th-hour fight to strip it took up time that could have been used to pass other bills.
Ritter said he voted with Republicans to uphold his end of a deal to pass other bills important to his caucus. 
“Culture’s important,” Ritter said.
Rochelle offered no regrets.
“I encourage everyone to look at what’s happening with the finances of Ansonia,” she said. “That’s all I’m going to say tonight.”
Despite the Ansonia disruption, the House and Senate passed most of the day Wednesday easily, with most of the priority legislation they planned to move forward this session already approved. They spent hours debating the bonding bill, which passed the Senate in the afternoon. The Senate also gave the final nod of approval to a climate change bill.
Other than those, the day passed with mostly smaller bills. Lawmakers slowed down in the late hours. Less than an hour before midnight, the House was waiting for the Senate to send bills downstairs and announced Little League wins in their districts, teenagers getting driver’s licenses and interns’ future plans.

The Senate then passed dozens of bills in the last few minutes of the night on a consent calendar.
In the last few weeks of the six-month session, lawmakers have passed an omnibus housing bill, legislation to cut down on energy costs, a bill to improve early child care and education and reforms to Connecticut’s special education cost sharing system.
After weeks of negotiations with Gov. Ned Lamont’s office that included a since-rejected proposal to draft a one-year budget for the first time since the 1990s, lawmakers passed the biennial budget Tuesday.
Democratic leadership told members they were happy with the work accomplished this session.
“I think that we have a strong record of achievement in this session, but there is more work to do. This is an extraordinary year,” said Senate President Pro Tempore Martin Looney, D-New Haven, in his closing remarks.

Still, thousands of bills died after committee passage. Democrats have already hinted at topics they’d like to work on again when the Connecticut General Assembly is next scheduled to convene in February. Looney said first on his list is a bill that expands services for children’s behavioral health.
The possibility of a special session remains, depending on the federal budget from Washington. If federal funds to Connecticut are cut, particularly for human services and health care, lawmakers may have to gather to adjust the budget. Looney told members it seemed likely he’d see them again in a few months for those adjustments.
Lamont has a few weeks to sign bills into law and is expected to veto at least one — a bill that would offer benefits to striking workers. He’s already signed several bills into law.
The governor visited the House of Representatives and Senate just before 9 p.m. Wednesday to chat with lawmakers and received a standing ovation. He told members of the media afterward that he was ultimately happy with how the budget negotiations turned out.

“Look what we did on child care,” Lamont said outside the House chambers. “Look what we did on special ed. Look at the investments we made that’ll make a big difference for our towns and cities for years to come.”
Drama in the Senate chambers
On the third floor, Lamont walked into a drama over whether the Senate would call a vote on a bill sought by Republicans and opposed by the building trades and the Connecticut Business and Industry Association.
The measure, House Bill 7004, is intended to give Plainfield, a small town in eastern Connecticut, the ability to hold a referendum over a proposed trash-to-energy plant. 
A negative referendum vote would not kill plan, but it would be a factor that the state Siting Council must consider, said Sen. Heather Somers, R-Groton.
Business in the Senate stopped Wednesday night while legislators talked over whether the bill would get a vote, as demanded by the Senate Republican minority. Without a vote, the GOP threatened to halt business by filibuster.
“This is a top Republican priority,” said Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield.
The House passed the bill on a 104-43 vote at 12:06 a.m. Tuesday. Most of the no votes were cast by Democrats.
The bill’s impact would be broader than Plainfield: It would expand the number of so-called “environmental justice”  communities able to hold referenda by raising the population threshold from 10,000 to 16,000.
Environmental justice communities are any U.S. census block for which at least 30% of the population consists of low-income people who have an income below 200% of the federal poverty level.

Labor lobbyists were fuming at the prospect of the Democratic majority calling the bill for a vote as part of a last-night deal to smooth business. At that moment, Lamont arrived and was immediately confronted by Jennifer Berrigan of the Connecticut AFL-CIO.
“She was not talking about the other bill that she cares deeply about,” Lamont said after their conversation.
“The other bill” is the measure that would provide jobless benefits to strikers, and the AFL-CIO is already angry at Lamont over his pledge to veto it. 
Berrigan spoke animatedly to the governor, her words inaudible to onlookers. 
Lamont said the topic Wednesday night was HB 7004, the siting bill. He was not familiar with its details and looked to Matt Brokman, his chief of staff.
“I think it’s not a bill you really like,” Brokman said, telling the governor it could hamper the ability to site necessary projects in Connecticut.
Lamont said his night-time stroll was meant to be purely social.
“I think I did this last time, to just go around, say, ‘Hi, thank you for a good session. Good working with you. Now get out of here,’” he said.
The Senate passed the bill at 11:15 p.m. on a 25-11 vote, with every Republican in support.

No charter school change
For years, some education lawmakers have tried to back-pedal on a decade-long standing piece of legislation that made it more difficult for charter schools to open in the state.
An effort to change it came up empty again this year.
Prior to 2015, a charter school could begin recruiting students and building its campus as soon as it received approval from the state Board of Education. That year, however, a bill changed the process into a two-tier approval system, where the state Board of Education grants “initial” approval and a charter school can only open in Connecticut after receiving funding approved by lawmakers.
Senate Bill 1439 proposed to “include funding for new charters granted by the State Board of Education in the Governor’s annual budget, revise the process by which charters are granted for state charter schools, include charter school students in a town’s resident student count for purposes of education cost sharing grant calculations, and require a biennial report regarding charter schools to be submitted to the General Assembly,” according to language in the bill.
It had passed out of the Education Committee 30-14 and 37-17 in the Appropriations Committee but was never taken up by the House or Senate.
Scholarship opportunities 
Several bills that expanded scholarship opportunities merged into the budget this year, including for students who qualify for the Roberta B. Willis grant and for students looking to become educators.
The budget allotted $6 million in each of the next two fiscal years for aspiring educators. The scholarship was proposed this year to expand from offering up to $10,000 annually to graduates from priority school districts, or the top 10 lowest performing districts in the state, to anyone who’s underrepresented in the teaching profession and willing to become an educator in a shortage area.

Child Advocate
The House and Senate have also approved a bill that would change the reappointment process for the state’s Child Advocate, a position that has subpoena power to investigate all matters related to children in the state, including child welfare and unexpected deaths. 
If Lamont signs the bill, the Child Advocate will be selected for a term of five years instead of four. The bill also requires the Office of the Child Advocate’s advisory committee to evaluate the advocate’s performance and recommend whether they should be reappointed or not.
Earlier in the session, lawmakers had considered a significantly different version of the bill which would have taken the selection process away from the governor altogether. At the time, proponents said that facing appointment and reappointment by the executive puts the advocate in a delicate position in which they are serving as a watchdog for the executive branch while also reliant on its favor for their position. 
But after pushback from Lamont, that provision of the bill was stripped out, and the new legislation allows the governor to retain the power to appoint the position. Lawmakers have called the new bill a compromise, since it would create public-facing information about the effectiveness of the advocate’s performance, making any future decision to decline reappointment of an effective advocate more transparent.
Omnibus education bill fails
The legislature’s omnibus education bill, House Bill 7009, which included dozens of provisions from establishing a state seal of civics education, requiring school boards to annually adopt policies limiting smart-devices, changing kindergarten waiver requirements, and more, was never taken up by the Senate.
The bill passed the House on a 128-20 vote in early May and was noteworthy for what it did not address: a recent report by the Office of the Child Advocate concluding that Connecticut is one of a dozen states with “no meaningful regulation of homeschooling.”
Nonprofits and inflation rates
For years, nonprofits that contract with the state have struggled to pay bills and employees, and wages have been stagnant. To that end, Senate Bill 1358, which passed through both the House and Senate, would tie increases in wages and Medicaid rates to inflation. 
Sen. Cathy Osten, D-Sprague, co-chair of the Appropriations Committee, said the bill was long in the making.
“The concept of the bill itself is very important,” Osten said. “It is not a new concept, by the way — we use this for nursing homes and residential care facilities right now, so this is continuing that concept so that the nonprofit providers can be set up to have a standard increase in their funding, based on the consumer price index each year.”
Gian-Carl Casa, the president of the CT Community Nonprofit Alliance, said nonprofits have been struggling for a long time with stagnant employee wages and with the rising costs of health insurance, energy and rent. 
But when those organizations are pinched, they are unable to improve wages. After inflation, that effectively results in a pay cut for workers. “Many nonprofits now provide food panties for their employees because they have been so poorly paid.”
Green crabs
On Tuesday, Lamont signed into law a bill that allows Connecticut restaurants to serve green crabs, one of the state’s most invasive species. 
House Bill 6222 passed the House and Senate in May and allows restaurants to serve other “bait” species as well, without gaining a license from the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. 
Restaurateurs said in public testimony that they benefit from the new law, citing the high culinary value of green crabs. 
On a similar note, the bill authorizes the Department of Agriculture to study lowering the minimum harvest size for oysters to smaller than 3 inches, the current standard. Bill proponents cited consumer demand for smaller oyster sizes, whereas opponents of the bill — oyster industry members — said that the current standard of harvest size preserves the health of Long Island Sound’s species. 
The new law demonstrates, among other things, the prevalence of industry and consumer demands versus environmental concerns in Connecticut’s aquaculture.

Earned wage access regulations loosened
As inflation, economic uncertainty and Connecticut’s high cost of living continue to strain wallets, legislators approved Senate Bill 1396, a bill that makes it easier for workers to receive pay advances for hours worked before their official pay day.Under the bill, which originated in the Banking Committee and was later amended by the Senate, so-called “earned wage access” payments will now be exempt from certain portions of the state’s small loans law, relaxing previous regulations that went into effect last year. The measure limits how much borrowers can request to less than $750, prevents them from requesting more than what they will actually earn in a pay period, and caps any related finance charges at $4 per transaction, or a maximum of $30 per month. The bill also restricts third-party earned wage access providers from pursuing people who fall behind on repayment. Supporters said the changes protect workers and will make it easier for them to access money when they need it by requesting part of their paycheck early. But consumer protection groups criticized the measure, arguing that because earned access wages are expected to be paid back so quickly, typically by their next check, already cash-strapped borrowers could end up in trouble. The bill passed unanimously out of the Banking Committee and received a 35-13 vote in appropriations before clearing the Senate 32-3. But the measure sparked debate and significant questions before Wednesday’s 101-46 vote in the House, where dissenting lawmakers argued it did not do enough to protect users from high interest fees and finance charges that could trap vulnerable workers in a spiral of debt. “I know what happens to our low-income folks, our folks that don’t really know how to navigate the financial system,” said Rep. David Rutigliano, R-Trumbull, who compared the practice to a payday loan and described it as “predatory.” Earned wage access regulations have been a focus of several state legislatures in 2025, with lawmakers in Maryland, Arkansas and Utah passing new measures guiding how providers should operate. Banking Committee co-chair Rep. Jason Doucette, D- Manchester, argued that SB 1396 is the best version of the regulation to date. “This bill will end up being, believe it or not, the strongest consumer protection bill for this product in the country,” he said.

Better prison meals, reporting on strip searches and more power for the Correction Ombuds 
An omnibus bill put forward by the state Department of Correction was mostly folded into the state budget. The provisions include a ban on nutraloaf — a solid “loaf” made of a mix of different foods that is sometimes used as a form of punishment — and a requirement for “palatable” meals, a study on the possibility of relocating the Bridgeport and New Haven Correctional Centers, a protocol for documenting inmate assaults on correction officers, a plan to improve retention and recruitment, and reporting on strip searches.
Removed from the bill was a mandate to release a report on medical malpractice cases that took place under the care of the Department of Correction, as well as approximately $11.6 million that would have gone to educational and vocational programming. The bill also does not include a reference to a pilot program for two body scanners, although Ritter said at a Wednesday press conference that the funds for the scanners was included in the budget. 
A bill that would give more power to the correction ombuds, including the ability to subpoena witnesses and to conduct unannounced visits to correctional facilities, passed the House of Representatives four hours before the close of the legislative session. It had previously passed the Senate 36-0.
The bill extended the term of the ombuds from two to four years. It also requires a correction officer who sees a fellow officer engage in an inappropriate use of force to report that colleague to the warden, who must then report it to the commissioner of the Department of Correction and the state police, and it requires the department to instate body cameras for correction officers in the facilities.  
Modifications to hate crimes laws
After a lengthy and highly technical debate, the House of Representatives passed a bill on Wednesday revising the state’s laws on hate crimes. 
The original bill came out of the work of Lamont’s Hate Crimes Advisory Council, which was convened in 2021. Rep. Steven Stafstrom, D-Bridgeport, said Tuesday that the purpose was to consolidate Connecticut’s hate crimes laws, which are “scattered,” “inconsistent” and “difficult for police officers and prosecutors to charge,” into one place. 
The bill will move all the current statutes that pertain to hate crimes into one section, increases penalties for criminal acts that are found to have been motivated by bias against a protected group, and extends the power of the Attorney General’s office to investigate and prosecute hate crimes. 
Rep. Craig Fishbein, R-Wallingford, protested Tuesday against an amendment to the bill that removed an earlier provision that would have required someone who committed a murder that was also classified as a hate crime to serve life without parole. 
“When somebody kills someone — I don’t care how old you are — and you kill a Black person not because they were trying to do something, but merely because they were Black, that’s a different kind of evil,” said Fishbein. 
Stafstrom said they did not want to take away discretion from judges, particularly if a hate crime was committed by a young person. He also said nothing prohibited a judge from imposing a sentence of life without parole. 
“A 19-year-old kid, even a 19-year-old kid who commits a hate crime might — might — be a different person when they reach the age of 50 or 55 or 60, and we should at least allow that 19-year-old kid the opportunity to make their case at the Board of Pardons and Paroles,” said Stafstrom.  
The amendment passed 102-46. 
Fishbein offered an amendment that would have included law enforcement as a protected class, along with race, gender, sexual orientation, age and other characteristics. The House opted to pause the debate and resume it the next day, when Fishbein withdrew the proposal. 
The House passed an amended version of the bill unanimously on Wednesday.

Roaming dogs debated but run out of time
Late in the evening, House lawmakers spent about half an hour debating whether to increase penalties on the owners of roaming dogs — only to give up before the clock struck midnight.
The penalty for anyone whose dog is caught wandering on private lands or a public highway is currently a fine that would increase to $350 under Senate Bill 1446, with even greater penalties for subsequent offenses. In addition to the state ban, many towns have their own leash laws.
After introducing the bill, state Rep. Jack Fazzino, D-Meriden, faced questions from Republicans who said they were concerned that owners could be penalized for simple mistakes. 
“I could see dogs getting loose a couple of time on the owner,” said state Rep. Gale Mastrofrancesco, R-Wolcott. “They’re excited, they’ve got the zoomies, they take off, I can certainly see it happening.” 
While Fazzino said that the bill was intended to deal with dogs that are habitually allowed to roam free, Rojas afforded to “throw him a bone” after several rounds of questions and pass over the bill, sending into the scrap heap of the legislative session.
Mobile home bill
A bill that would have offered more protections for mobile home residents died Wednesday night after passing the House earlier in the week.
House Bill 5428 would have required park owners to disclose any ancillary fees, such as extra costs to own a pet or have a washer and dryer, ahead of time, and increase relocation payments for residents from $10,000 to $20,000 if the owner sells the park with the intent to turn it into something else, among other measures.
It would also have required that park owners test the power of fire hydrants on their properties and report the results to fire marshals, a measure added in the wake of two fires at parks in East Hartford that were difficult to control because the hydrants didn’t have enough water pressure.
The bill passed the House after being stripped of proposals to implement caps on land rents and ancillary fees but wasn’t called in the Senate.
Prescription drug prices
The Senate on Wednesday gave final passage to a bill that aims to reduce the cost of prescription drugs for Connecticut residents and increase transparency of the pharmaceutical industry.
The proposal requires state-regulated insurance plans to count certain out-of-pocket drug costs toward an enrollee’s deductible, even if someone goes outside of their insurance plan to buy medication, if they find a cheaper price. The change is meant to ensure that purchases from companies like GoodRX, which offer drug coupons for discounts on medications, can still count toward a deductible.
Rep. Jillian Gilchrest, D-West Hartford, said the measure would “get people savings right there at the pharmacy.” Gilchrest served as co-chair of a bipartisan prescription drug task force that met over several months earlier this year to weigh possible solutions to the rising cost of medications.
The legislation also seeks to increase transparency into the practices of pharmacy benefit managers, middlemen commonly referred to as PBMs that help to manage drug benefits for health plans. The bill requires that the state Insurance Department report each year on the percentage of drug rebate dollars that insurers put toward reducing premiums for policyholders.
PBMs arose to help health plans negotiate with drug companies and save money on prescriptions but have come under fire over the last year for driving up costs for people and health plans to reap bigger profits for themselves. Gilchrest called it “vitally important” to bring transparency to the inner workings of PBMs.
The bill also allows state agencies to opt into a bulk drug purchasing program and requires the state to petition the federal government to authorize the production of generic GLP-1s.
The measure drew wide support in both chambers, passing with a vote of 142-5 in the House, and 32-4 in the Senate.

Final Actions
In the frantic final stretch, the Senate added more than 30 bills and resolutions to a consent calendar that they passed with less than 10 minutes to spare. Among the items was Senate Bill 1558, which would create a new tax credit for anyone who challenges another state for taxing them on income earned while in Connecticut. 
The idea is one that stretches back to February 2024, when Gov. Ned Lamont announced that he wanted to create an incentive to encourage someone to sue New York — where tens of thousands of Connecticut residents commute ​​— over the taxes on wages they earned working from home. 
After a year of waiting, lawmakers and members of Lamont’s administration decided to re-up their offer. 
“This is a critical emerging policy issue as telework arrangements have become increasingly common since the pandemic,” Jeffrey Beckham, the secretary Office of Policy and Management, said in testimony in support of the bill. “Many of these workers would receive favorable tax treatment if their income were sourced to Connecticut, and our position is that our state is the correct tax jurisdiction for our citizens when telecommuting from their home.”
After passing their consent calendar, the Senate voted on the very last bill of the session, House Bill 7192, implementing recommendations of the state’s bipartisan drug task force. The roll call was taken at 11:58 p.m.

(Provided)As torrential rains inundated Kentucky in April, Union County Judge-Executive Adam O’Nan needed labor to fill and distribute sandbags to protect homes and businesses from flooding.
  With a phone call, local students from the Earle C. Clements Job Corps center stepped up to the task. 
“They loaded those bags for them and were a tremendous help,” O’Nan said.
Now the hundreds of students and employees at the center in Union County will be scattering to uncertain futures after the Trump administration on May 29  announced that it would “pause” Job Corps operations across the country. 
O’Nan, a Republican, said that would be a loss for his county.
“It really is difficult to measure the value because we’re just so used to them being around, and not that we take them for granted, but they’re just part of us,” O’Nan said.  “If, in fact, this is the end of Job Corps, that’s just going to be a big void for us.” 
The abrupt halt would be an even bigger loss for the center’s mostly low-income students who are feeling panic, anger and desperation about their futures, said Jonathan Brown, the finance and administration director for the Clements center in Union County. 
“Either they have nowhere to go — they’re homeless or house insecure, they don’t have safe places to go — or they’re just not done with their trade,” Brown said. “I couldn’t imagine going to college for two years, halfway done, and then my school closes and loses its accreditation and none of my classes count.” 
Brown said the contracts to run the center, including contracts for employees, are being cancelled with a deadline of June 30 to have students returned to their home states. Guidance from the U.S. Department of Labor states the department will cover the cost to send students back to their home states by the end of the month and connect them with other job training and educational opportunities.
The Jobs Corps center in the county seat of Morganfield is one of dozens across the country — including two others in Kentucky in Floyd and Muhlenberg counties —  funded by the federal government that have offered young people free training in a wide variety of career paths including culinary arts, welding, nursing, electrical work, diesel mechanics and more. 
Brown said the center is the second largest in the country in terms of students served. He said the center is contracted to serve over 1000 students, bringing in usually about 30-40 new students each week. He said about 275 employees serve those students. 
Created 61 years ago as a part of President Lyndon Johnson’s War on Poverty, Job Corps enrolls people between the ages of 16 and  24 who are dealing with challenges such as poverty, homelessness, a disability or falling behind on reading and writing skills. 
In announcing the “pause,” the Trump administration cited data from 2023 that it argues shows cost overruns and low graduation rates.
But Brown, the Job Corps administrator in Union County, argues the April report from the Trump administration is largely misleading, cherry-picking data from 2023 when centers were still rebounding from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Brown also thinks the “pause” of operations is essentially a closure.
‘A failed experiment’
Brown said the headwinds for his center began to pick up months ago with various positions and departments being cut, but he became particularly troubled with the center’s situation when enrollment of new students was halted in March. 
He said the Department of Labor stopped doing background checks for new students, essentially stopping the center from bringing in new students. 
Then in April, the department issued a report looking at graduation rates and the cost to graduate students from each center, stating that the average cost for each student at a center was a little over $80,000 and the average graduation rate from the centers was 38.6%. 
In early May, the Trump administration sent a budget request to Congress that eliminated funding for the Job Corps, calling it “a failed experiment to help America’s youth.” In testimony before Congress on May 15, Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer told lawmakers the president’s budget request signaled a need to “refocus” on “where those dollars are going to have the outcome for the workforce.” 
On May 29, Chavez-DeRemer announced the “pause” of Job Corps center operations, citing the report from April as evidence of the ineffectiveness of the Job Corps programs. 
“Job Corps was created to help young adults build a pathway to a better life through education, training, and community,” Chavez-DeRemer said in a statement provided in a press release. “However, a startling number of serious incident reports and our in-depth fiscal analysis reveal the program is no longer achieving the intended outcomes that students deserve. We remain committed to ensuring all participants are supported through this transition and connected with the resources they need to succeed as we evaluate the program’s possibilities.” 
In Union County, Brown acknowledges there are “inefficiencies” within Job Corps and that some centers perform better than others. But given the United States is the “richest country in the history of the world,” he questioned why the federal government couldn’t provide “this small amount to give people that second chance.” 
An information sheet provided to the Lantern from the director of the Earle C. Clements center asserts the average graduation rate for Job Corps centers is higher than the average graduation rate for two-year community and technical colleges. The information sheet also asserts the average cost per student is lower, and comparable to community and technical colleges, when Job Corps enrollees who don’t ultimately graduate are taken into account.
 The April report released by the Trump administration says the Earle C. Clements center has a graduation rate of 47% and a cost per enrollee of $67,713 in 2023, both figures better than the national average in the report. 
Job Corps’ operations cost roughly $1.53 billion in fiscal year 2024, making up a small fraction of the $6.75 trillion of federal government spending that fiscal year.
“I wish it was a more nuanced look at how to make the program better to meet that national need to provide skilled labor while also serving disadvantaged youth,” said Brown.
A Department of Labor spokesperson did not respond to several emails requesting comment about criticisms of its April report. 
Finding meaning in helping students
Amanda Moore, the manager of Amanda’s Floral and Gift Shop in Sturgis, said the loss of Job Corps in Union County  “is really going to impact our whole community.” 
Her relatively new business hosted two paid internships with Job Corps students, one of whom worked on revamping the store’s website. 
“It kind of gives those kids a chance to get out into the real world without some of the struggles that they have at home,” Moore said. “Getting away from where they are and coming to the Job Corps Center and having a chance at life.” 
Job Corps students also put together a “wonderful meal,” she said, for a local gathering called “Derby Days” celebrating the running of the Kentucky Derby. 
“All the Derby favorites: They made a virgin mint julep, all the cucumber sandwiches that you could eat,” Moore said. “They put their heart and soul into all of that, and that was a big deal downtown here in Sturgis.” 
Brown, the finance and administration director for the local center, said the backgrounds of students can vary depending on what circumstances qualify them to enroll. It’s not uncommon for students to show up with only a garbage bag of “old, dirty clothes.” 
Finding meaning in helping those students is what has kept Brown, a Union County native, working at the center for 11 years, starting as a career counselor for students. He’s loved the work since “day one.” 
“My whole job was about the student, whatever they needed to get through the program, get their credentials, get their high school diploma, get a good job,” Brown said. “It’s stressful and it’s hard, but it’s meaningful. And you can see it every single day — the meaning.” 
He believes Job Corps is unique from other educational opportunities because it provides young people a safe place, free of charge, to sleep, have regular meals and work on a career away from the challenges they left behind. To make sure these young people, he said, don’t fall through the cracks. 
“I don’t know what a lot of this population will do. I don’t know what options they really have,” Brown said.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_2356-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-06-05 11:08:15.310363

(Kyle Pfannenstiel/Idaho Capital Sun)It’s been more than 30 days since a hearing in a conflict over the language of a proposed 2026 reproductive rights ballot initiative, but with no decision yet from the Idaho Supreme Court, the group leading the push to restore abortion access in Idaho says the delay is hurting their organizing efforts.
Idahoans United for Women and Families launched its citizen-led initiative effort in April 2024 and submitted proposed ballot titles in August. A new state law also requires a fiscal impact statement to be attached to initiatives, and the group alleged Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador, a Republican who has been outspoken about his anti-abortion views, and the Division of Financial Management inserted language that was prejudicial. They pointed in particular to a statement that said costs associated with the prisoner population and the Medicaid budget could occur.
Idaho Supreme Court hears arguments in abortion ballot initiative lawsuit

As part of the initiative process, the Attorney General’s Office is responsible for drafting short and long ballot titles that summarize what the legislation would do if passed. State law says the language must describe the proposal accurately and use common language without phrasing that is likely to prejudice voters. 
The complaint filed by Idahoans United with the Idaho Supreme Court in late January called the statement biased and says it includes contradictory language, “wrongly implies” that Medicaid and corrections spending would increase, and “prejudicially includes an irrelevant reference to the state’s $850 million Medicaid budget.” 
Labrador’s office did not respond to requests for comment. In court filings, Labrador did not address the fiscal impact statement component of the complaint, and only spoke to the “fetus viability” language that Idahoans United said was objectionable because it is not medical terminology. Labrador said it is common parlance and there is no difference between that language and “fetal viability.” 
In a separate court filing, officials with the Idaho Division of Financial Management did not speak to the rationale for the fiscal impact statement, but restated the language and denied that it was prejudicial to the initiative. 
 Group filed motion to expedite Idaho Supreme Court ruling in abortion initiative case

The Idaho Supreme Court heard arguments April 25, and there have been no updates since then, despite a motion to expedite. The last court battle over ballot titles was in 2023, when Reclaim Idaho said Labrador’s office also prejudiced its initiative language about changing the state primary election system.
In that case, oral arguments were held on a Monday and a decision came out that Thursday, with a unanimous vote in favor of Reclaim Idaho. Ultimately, voters overwhelmingly defeated the initiative in the November 2024 election. 
Idaho has a citizen ballot initiative process, but only its Legislature can propose constitutional amendments, unlike many other states. So instead of a constitutional amendment, the voters are asked to approve a citizen-crafted piece of legislation to be adopted. The measure requires a simple majority of voters to pass.
Idahoans United submitted a policy that would establish a fundamental right to contraception and fertility treatments under state law, including in vitro fertilization, the right to make decisions about pregnancy and childbirth, legalize abortion before fetal viability, and preserve the right to abortion after viability in medical emergencies. 
Fetal viability would be determined by a physician and what treatment is available, but the commonly accepted gestational age of viability in the medical community is 23 to 24 weeks.

The group’s spokesperson and lead organizer, Melanie Folwell, told States Newsroom that the delay has forced them to cancel a planned kickoff rally on June 14 at the Idaho Capitol. The rally is now scheduled for June 28, in hopes there will be a decision by then.
The initiative needs more than 70,000 valid signatures from districts across the state, and organizers had hoped to gather 10,000 of those in June alone. But the initiative language must be finalized and approved before any signatures can be collected, and the signature goal must be reached by April 30, 2026, to qualify for the ballot.  
“We won’t get another June. We won’t get another crack at this in the coming months, and there are some real impacts to having to pursue a lawsuit,” Folwell told States Newsroom.
The frustration is not directed at the court, Folwell said, but rather at state offices that crafted the language.
“I can’t speculate as to their intent, but in providing us with unclear titles and fiscal impact statement, we have certainly been slowed down,” she said. “It didn’t need to be this way.”  
There will also be financial effects, she said, because adding pressure to the timeline will increase the costs associated with mobilizing volunteers and canvassers to gather signatures by the deadline.
Nate Poppino, spokesperson for the Idaho Supreme Court, told States Newsroom in an email that the court does not comment on judicial deliberations, and opinions are issued at the court’s discretion.
“Sometimes the issues the court must consider resolve quickly, and sometimes they require longer discussion,” Poppino said.
Each opinion starts with one authoring justice, he said, and a draft is circulated among the other justices who can edit and weigh in before anything is finalized. That includes details like wording and the legal issues involved.
“If it’s a situation that involves a dissent, that also is examined by the full court,” he said.

When Thomas Fugate graduated from college last year with a degree in politics, he celebrated in a social media post about the exciting opportunities that lay beyond campus life in Texas. “Onward and upward!” he wrote, with an emoji of a rocket shooting into space.
His career blastoff came quickly. A year after graduation, the 22-year-old with no apparent national security expertise is now a Department of Homeland Security official overseeing the government’s main hub for terrorism prevention, including an $18 million grant program intended to help communities combat violent extremism.
The White House appointed Fugate, a former Trump campaign worker who interned at the hard-right Heritage Foundation, to a Homeland Security role that was expanded to include the Center for Prevention Programs and Partnerships. Known as CP3, the office has led nationwide efforts to prevent hate-fueled attacks, school shootings and other forms of targeted violence.
Fugate’s appointment is the latest shock for an office that has been decimated since President Donald Trump returned to the White House and began remaking national security to give it a laser focus on immigration.
News of the appointment has trickled out in recent weeks, raising alarm among counterterrorism researchers and nonprofit groups funded by CP3. Several said they turned to LinkedIn for intel on Fugate — an unknown in their field — and were stunned to see a photo of “a college kid” with a flag pin on his lapel posing with a sharply arched eyebrow. No threat prevention experience is listed in his employment history.
Typically, people familiar with CP3 say, a candidate that green wouldn’t have gotten an interview for a junior position, much less be hired to run operations. According to LinkedIn, the bulk of Fugate’s leadership experience comes from having served as secretary general of a Model United Nations club.
“Maybe he’s a wunderkind. Maybe he’s Doogie Howser and has everything at 21 years old, or whatever he is, to lead the office. But that’s not likely the case,” said one counterterrorism researcher who has worked with CP3 officials for years. “It sounds like putting the intern in charge.”
In the past seven weeks, at least five high-profile targeted attacks have unfolded across the U.S., including a car bombing in California and the gunning down of two Israeli Embassy aides in Washington. Against this backdrop, current and former national security officials say, the Trump administration’s decision to shift counterterrorism resources to immigration and leave the violence-prevention portfolio to inexperienced appointees is “reckless.”
“We’re entering very dangerous territory,” one longtime U.S. counterterrorism official said.
The fate of CP3 is one example of the fallout from deep cuts that have eliminated public health and violence-prevention initiatives across federal agencies.
The once-bustling office of around 80 employees now has fewer than 20, former staffers say. Grant work stops, then restarts. One senior civil servant was reassigned to the Federal Emergency Management Agency via an email that arrived late on a Saturday.
The office’s mission has changed overnight, with a pivot away from focusing on domestic extremism, especially far-right movements. The “terrorism” category that framed the agency’s work for years was abruptly expanded to include drug cartels, part of what DHS staffers call an overarching message that border security is the only mission that matters. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has largely left terrorism prevention to the states.
ProPublica sent DHS a detailed list of questions about Fugate’s position, his lack of national security experience and the future of the department’s prevention work. A senior agency official replied with a statement saying only that Fugate’s CP3 duties were added to his role as an aide in an Immigration & Border Security office.
“Due to his success, he has been temporarily given additional leadership responsibilities in the Center for Prevention Programs and Partnerships office,” the official wrote in an email. “This is a credit to his work ethic and success on the job.”
ProPublica sought an interview with Fugate through DHS and the White House, but there was no response.
The Trump administration rejects claims of a retreat from terrorism prevention, noting partnerships with law enforcement agencies and swift investigations of recent attacks. “The notion that this single office is responsible for preventing terrorism is not only incorrect, it’s ignorant,” spokesperson Abigail Jackson wrote in an email.
Through intermediaries, ProPublica sought to speak with CP3 employees but received no reply. Talking is risky; tales abound of Homeland Security personnel undergoing lie-detector tests in leak investigations, as Secretary Kristi Noem pledged in March.
Accounts of Fugate’s arrival and the dismantling of CP3 come from current and former Homeland Security personnel, grant recipients and terrorism-prevention advocates who work closely with the office and have at times been confidants for distraught staffers. All spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal from the Trump administration.
In these circles, two main theories have emerged to explain Fugate’s unusual ascent. One is that the Trump administration rewarded a Gen Z campaign worker with a resume-boosting title that comes with little real power because the office is in shambles.
The other is that the White House installed Fugate to oversee a pivot away from traditional counterterrorism lanes and to steer resources toward MAGA-friendly sheriffs and border security projects before eventually shuttering operations. In this scenario, Fugate was described as “a minder” and “a babysitter.”
DHS did not address a ProPublica question about this characterization.
 Rising MAGA star
The CP3 homepage boasts about the office’s experts in disciplines including emergency management, counterterrorism, public health and social work.
Fugate brings a different qualification prized by the White House: loyalty to the president.
On Instagram, Fugate traced his political awakening to nine years ago, when as a 13-year-old “in a generation deprived of hope, opportunity, and happiness, I saw in one man the capacity for real and lasting change: Donald Trump.”
Fugate is a self-described “Trumplican” who interned for state lawmakers in Austin before graduating magna cum laude a year ago with a degree in politics and law from the University of Texas at San Antonio. Instagram photos and other public information from the past year chronicle his lightning-fast rise in Trump world.
Starting in May 2024, photos show a newly graduated Fugate at a Texas GOP gathering launching his first campaign, a bid for a delegate spot at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. He handed out gummy candy and a flier with a photo of him in a tuxedo at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate. Fugate won an alternate slot.
The next month, he was in Florida celebrating Trump’s 78th birthday with the Club 47 fan group in West Palm Beach. “I truly wish I could say more about what I’m doing, but more to come soon!” he wrote in a caption, with a smiley emoji in sunglasses.
Posts in the run-up to the election show Fugate spending several weeks in Washington, a time he called “surreal and invigorating.” In July, he attended the Republican convention, sporting the Texas delegation’s signature cowboy hat in photos with MAGA luminaries such as former Cabinet Secretary Ben Carson and then-Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.).
By late summer, Fugate was posting from the campaign trail as part of Trump’s advance team, pictured at one stop standing behind the candidate in a crowd of young supporters. When Trump won the election, Fugate marked the moment with an emotional post about believing in him “from the very start, even to the scorn and contempt of my peers.”
“Working alongside a dedicated, driven group of folks, we faced every challenge head-on and, together, celebrated a victorious outcome,” Fugate wrote on Instagram.
In February, the White House appointed Fugate as a “special assistant” assigned to an immigration office at Homeland Security. He assumed leadership of CP3 last month to fill a vacancy left by previous Director Bill Braniff, an Army veteran with more than two decades of national security experience who resigned in March when the administration began cutting his staff.
In his final weeks as director, Braniff had publicly defended the office’s achievements, noting the dispersal of nearly $90 million since 2020 to help communities combat extremist violence. According to the office’s 2024 report to Congress, in recent years CP3 grant money was used in more than 1,100 efforts to identify violent extremism at the community level and interrupt the radicalization process.
“CP3 is the inheritor of the primary and founding mission of DHS — to prevent terrorism,” Braniff wrote on LinkedIn when he announced his resignation.
In conversations with colleagues, CP3 staffers have expressed shock at how little Fugate knows about the basics of his role and likened meetings with him to “career counseling.” DHS did not address questions about his level of experience.
One grant recipient called Fugate’s appointment “an insult” to Braniff and a setback in the move toward evidence-based approaches to terrorism prevention, a field still reckoning with post-9/11 work that was unscientific and stigmatizing to Muslims.
“They really started to shift the conversation and shift the public thinking. It was starting to get to the root of the problem,” the grantee said. “Now that’s all gone.”
Critics of Fugate’s appointment stress that their anger isn’t directed at an aspiring politico enjoying a whirlwind entry to Washington. The problem, they say, is the administration’s seemingly cavalier treatment of an office that was funding work on urgent national security concerns.
“The big story here is the undermining of democratic institutions,” a former Homeland Security official said. “Who’s going to volunteer to be the next civil servant if they think their supervisor is an apparatchik?”
 Season of attack
Spring brought a burst of extremist violence, a trend analysts fear could extend into the summer given inflamed political tensions and the disarray of federal agencies tasked with monitoring threats.
In April, an arson attack targeted Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, who blamed the breach on “security failures.” Four days later, a mass shooter stormed onto the Florida State University campus, killing two and wounding six others. The alleged attacker had espoused white supremacist views and used Hitler as a profile picture for a gaming account.
Attacks continued in May with the apparent car bombing of a fertility clinic in California. The suspected assailant, the only fatality, left a screed detailing violent beliefs against life and procreation. A few days later, on May 21, a gunman allegedly radicalized by the war in Gaza killed two Israeli Embassy aides outside a Jewish museum in Washington.
June opened with a firebombing attack in Colorado that wounded 12, including a Holocaust survivor, at a gathering calling for the release of Israeli hostages. The suspect’s charges include a federal hate crime.
If attacks continue at that pace, warn current and former national security officials, cracks will begin to appear in the nation’s pared-down counterterrorism sector.
“If you cut the staff and there are major attacks that lead to a reconsideration, you can’t scale up staff once they’re fired,” said the U.S. counterterrorism official, who opposes the administration’s shift away from prevention.
Contradictory signals are coming out of Homeland Security about the future of CP3 work, especially the grant program. Staffers have told partners in the advocacy world that Fugate plans to roll out another funding cycle soon. The CP3 website still touts the program as the only federal grant “solely dedicated to helping local communities develop and strengthen their capabilities” against terrorism and targeted violence.
But Homeland Security’s budget proposal to Congress for the next fiscal year suggests a bleaker future. The department recommended eliminating the threat-prevention grant program, explaining that it “does not align with DHS priorities.”
The former Homeland Security official said the decision “means that the department founded to prevent terrorism in the United States no longer prioritizes preventing terrorism in the United States.”

The Delaware Division of Small Business (DSB) has awarded a new round of Encouraging Development, Growth and Expansion (EDGE) grants to 10 small businesses across the state, providing $650,000 to support a range of innovative and community-driven ventures.
Winners of the Spring 2025 EDGE grant competition were recognized during a ceremony held June 4 at Bally’s Resort in Dover. The awards were presented by DSB Director CJ Bell and Secretary of State Charuni Patibanda-Sanchez.
“I am incredibly excited by the diverse range of small businesses that we were able to support during this round of the EDGE competition,” said Bell. “These companies are contributing to the quality of life of Delawareans in a variety of ways. I’m proud that through this funding we are able to help elevate them to the next level.”
Launched in 2019, the EDGE program has now distributed nearly $8 million to 120 small businesses statewide. The initiative supports young Delaware businesses with fewer than 10 full-time employees through a competitive selection process, culminating in public pitch sessions to expert judges. Five businesses in STEM fields each receive up to $100,000, while five “Entrepreneur Class” businesses receive up to $50,000.
Patibanda-Sanchez emphasized the broader impact of this investment. “Small businesses enhance economic diversity in our state by helping create new industries, jobs and markets. When small businesses thrive, we all thrive,” she said.

This round’s recipients include ventures in mental health, biotechnology, menopause care, agritourism, and sustainable meat production. Several address significant public needs, from expanding therapy access in Wilmington to researching treatments for rare diseases.
The selected businesses reflect the program’s continued efforts to support historically underrepresented entrepreneurs. Since the EDGE program began, 54% of awardees have been woman-, minority-, or veteran-owned, with another 18% representing more than one of those categories.
In total, 139 businesses applied for the spring competition, matching the program’s initial 2019 turnout. Finalists presented in May at the BPG Brandywine Building in Wilmington, and 10 were selected: seven based in New Castle County, one in Kent, and two in Sussex.
Past EDGE winner Donny Legans, owner of Rail Haus in Dover, praised the program during the ceremony, describing the award as a catalyst for growth and strategic planning.
“Receiving the EDGE grant was a game changer for us,” Legans said. “It undoubtably made us a stronger business that forced us to look at our weaker areas and address them with a solid strategy.”

(Photo by Brian Venua/KMXT)Alaska school districts hiring from the Philippines are taking some of the country’s best and brightest teachers. It’s a win for Alaska kids, but what does that mean for students back in Southeast Asia? KMXT’s Brian Venua explores brain drain and brain gain in Part 5 of a five part audio series, Mabuhay sa Alaska.
When Alaska school administrators toured Pajo Elementary School, each class greeted them by welcoming them to the Philippines in both English and in Filipino. The administrators were there to see what the teachers they hire from the Philippines experience before moving to Alaska.
But the students are the other side of that story — These are kids that get left behind when Filipino teachers are hired abroad.
When recruiters opened up appointments for screening, all 720 spots were filled in just 16 minutes. The only advertising was a few posts on social media. But one consequence of hiring abroad is fewer quality teachers in the Philippines — a phenomenon known as brain drain.

Conversely, Alaska gets brain gain. Hiring teachers has largely been a success for the state’s kids. Recruiters on the 2025 trip picked some of the most highly educated teachers from the island nation. Kodiak Island Borough School District, for example, has more doctorate degrees from its 30 or so Filipino teachers than it does from its over 300 American hires.
“We were impressed with the quality of teachers that we met over there. And we were able to choose – from there – the top of the top,” said Cyndy Mika, the district’s superintendent. She said there have been more remarkable candidates than they can hire during recruiting trips.
It’s hard to say what the impact is on the Philippines, though.

Mika said that so far, a surplus of workers in the Philippines is helping address her district’s shortage.
“A lot of the teachers that we interviewed in the Philippines, when they first got their start, it was as a volunteer teacher,” she said. “They weren’t being paid because there weren’t jobs. They’re producing too many teachers.”
But Mika is concerned that taking so many highly qualified teachers could create a sort of skill ceiling there, if the country’s best teachers keep leaving for Alaska and other destinations.
That doesn’t change that her priority is the kids in the community where she works.
“My number one concern as a superintendent in Kodiak is getting the best quality teachers we can in front of our students,” she said. “If we didn’t have these Filipino teachers, who would we have?”

She said that without international hires, vacant teacher positions would lead to smaller teacher-to-student ratios and more burnout for her staff.
Remittance and returning teachers
It’s not a one-way street, though.
Many Filipinos working abroad send a lot of money home – 8% of the country’s economy, according to some reports. Their experience, professional development and cultural knowhow gained in the U.S. is valuable, too, and sometimes comes back.

Edna Auxtero is the administrator for Tagaytay Christian Academy, a private school about a two-hour drive from Manila. She said hiring Filipino teachers is a huge compliment to the country’s educational system.
“I’m so proud that they’re even interested to get Filipinos,” Auxtero said. “That’s always my dream – that the priority for employment in other countries are Filipinos.”

TCA’s principal, and many of its teachers, are alumni. Auxtero hopes some of them will go to Alaska someday and return with new skills.
“My hope is that they will come back to build the nation and impart all their knowledge, experiences to the next generation so that Philippines will rise up also,” she said.

“They can expect that for teachers under J1 visas,” said Serjoe Gutierrez, a Kodiak music teacher and one of the district’s first direct hires from the Philippines.
J1 visas require international hires to go back to their home countries after a few years. But Gutierrez, and many others, are on potential paths to permanent residency through H1B visas.

But he still thinks about kids he taught at a private school in Iloilo City.
“I do worry, sometimes,” Gutierrez said. He thought about it even before coming to Alaska. “I was thinking about it before resigning, but I told myself it’s for me. The kids, they would gain more experience – they’re still young. But I’m not getting any younger, so I need to do something for myself, too.”
Kodiak is his home now.
“I do love my country. I do love the Philippines, but I think being a teacher in Kodiak – being here in Alaska – opened a lot of opportunities for me,” he said.
He said he’s not sure he would have had the same chances to travel and play piano and violin publicly in the Philippines. He hopes to be one of the first to get a green card through the school and stay in the U.S. indefinitely.

Mike Dunleavy called a news conference on the governor’s floor of the Alaska State Capitol. The shades were drawn, and a handful of reporters lined a long conference room table, as Dunleavy spoke and took questions for over an hour, explaining his criticisms and his veto. 
In offices throughout the rest of the building, legislators on all sides of the politically contentious debate on how to fund Alaska schools, watched from behind closed doors, as well as school district leaders, news outlets, and Alaskans across the state — live, via the cameras of Gavel Alaska.

In the room, Gavel production crew Michael Penn operated a live camera broadcasting  Dunleavy, with Tulio Fontanella sitting to the governor’s right side, in a baseball cap, microphone in hand. 
During the May 19 news conference, Gavel Alaska was nearing the end of another legislative session. For nearly 30 years, Gavel has provided a free, public broadcast of the business of the state government to the rest of Alaska. A team of eight, mostly seasonal staff, operates cameras and broadcasts remotely from a ground floor production studio at KTOO Public Media, on Egan Drive along the waterfront of Juneau.
“It’s kind of the C-SPAN of Alaska,” said executive producer Will Mader, referring to the nonprofit cable TV network that has streamed the U.S. government in Washington, D.C., since 1979.
Above the chambers and committee rooms of the Alaska State Legislature, overlooking lawmakers’ debates, governors’ speeches, the prayers over floor sessions and the introductions of guests in the galleries, cameras and microphones capture the business of the State Capitol and Gavel broadcasts it live to Alaska. The team has just wrapped up covering another 120 day legislative session, with over 800 hours of live coverage broadcasting from the Capitol. 
The team of Gavel Alaska are used to dealing with technical problems, but now, they’re facing a potential new hurdle of federal cuts. Gavel’s crew finished the session at a sensitive time for public broadcasting. President Donald Trump has proposed large-scale cuts to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which provides a share of funding to KTOO and public media across the country and state. 
Looking closely at Gavel Alaska gives a sense of the work that goes into giving the public access to state government. While the people in front of the cameras make the news, the people behind them rarely capture public attention. 
Behind the cameras
On a late winter morning, Mader sits in front of a wall of monitors, gearing up for a busy day covering the Alaska State Legislature, which typically runs from January to May. 
Teams of two staff monitor three or four robotic cameras in each chamber of the House and Senate, the committee rooms, and the hallways. During hearings or floor sessions, they toggle between cameras to focus on who is speaking, add captions with names and titles, feature speakers’ presentations and provide information for public comment.

Mader said the most newsworthy topics are recorded and streamed on KTOO’s statewide public affairs TV channel, KTOO 360TV. It’s also transmitted via satellite through the Alaska Rural Communications Service statewide, for those without consistent internet. “So it’s available to anyone out in rural Alaska that can view it, just with an antenna,” he said.
Though all hearings are livestreamed online, on some days there can be up to six committee meetings at a time, so Mader said that can be a challenge deciding which three to feature at once. “We always cover House and Senate floor sessions, and we almost always cover finance (committee) meetings,” he said. “The budget is always the No. 1 issue in session. So that’s one reason for covering finance, as well as that it’s the last stop for most legislation before it gets to the floor.”
The Gavel broadcast launched in 1996, first with one cameraperson moving a manually operated camera between rooms of the Capitol to cover meetings, “which isn’t ideal, because people are facing all different directions,” Mader said. 
Eventually, the Legislature started some basic webstreaming with its own cameras. Ultimately the Legislature agreed to an informal partnership with Gavel and KTOO to provide a more quality broadcast.  
“They share access to the cameras, and then they get a higher quality video feed from those cameras,” said Mikko Wilson, production manager at KTOO. 
The Gavel production at the Capitol saw a major technological upgrade in 2020, when grant funding and the purchase of new robotic cameras arrived at the same time as the COVID-19 pandemic.
“We had the quotes for the cameras. And I picked up the phone and said, ‘Ship ’em. Send us the cameras, like we need the robots now!” Wilson said, smiling. “And so that was my COVID project in 2020, pulling about 2 miles of cable and installing the 40-something-odd cameras inside.” 
At the controls are new seasonal staff, like fresh college graduates learning broadcast production, as well as veteran Alaska journalists, like longtime Juneau photojournalist Michael Penn and former TV broadcaster Bob Laurie.
In a small studio off the main production bay, Laurie wrapped up covering a committee meeting and had time to talk. “I try to really listen closely to what is being said, so that I can make sure I get the right names up, the right explainers, and kind of follow the flow of what is going on in the room. It takes a lot of focus for me,” he said.     

  Bob Laurie, former TV reporter and production technician with Gavel in the studio on February 13, 2025 (Photo by Corinne Smith/Alaska Beacon)
 

Laurie first covered the Legislature as a young TV reporter, for a highly contentious session in 1981. 
“The leadership in the House, it took them a long time to organize…before they had their 21 votes together,” he said, to form a majority caucus. “We didn’t have the, you know, 121 day sessions, and people were dissatisfied with nothing getting through. Things were held up.”
He said he slept on someone’s floor while covering the action. “I was the first full-time television reporter from outside Juneau to cover the Legislature,” he said. “My competition followed about three days later — three days after I got on the air.”
That launched a television reporting career, then work in state government, before Laurie returned to cover the session seasonally with Gavel.
“So this is nice, clean. This is raw. All we’re doing is getting the different shots,” he said. “This is what is actually happening, so people can see their representatives at work.”
Some days Laurie is in the studio, and some days he’s in the Capitol operating a camera to cover live events, like speeches from the governor or Alaska’s U.S. senators. He said it’s an opportunity for Alaskans to watch their elected officials in action. 
“They can actually sit there and actually watch it and say, ‘Oh, that’s who I elected,’” he said. “Whether it’s good or bad. Without any editorial comment.”

Across the hall, Tulio Fontanella is covering a Senate Finance Committee hearing a report on the state’s oil revenues. He grew up in Juneau and just graduated from college with a degree in sports media. He said while there’s some comparisons to sports broadcasting, it’s much slower. 
“There will be times that you’ll stay on a wide shot, just because you don’t know who’s gonna talk next or how quickly they’ll be done talking,” he said. “There’s other people who pause a long time before they start speaking, so it’s a balancing act, getting that right.”

His partner in the booth on captions, Robbie Gabel, who also grew up in Juneau, is also in his first year of broadcast production. 
“I like when it’s a little more hectic. It’s a little slow. So it’s fun when they’re trying to get stuff in,” he said. “I like it when it’s more hectic and a lot more going on.”
The crew is on duty whenever legislators are live, so that means long hours and sometimes weekends, especially when bills are being voted on, and final budget negotiations take place at the end of May.
“It’s more complicated than someone would think,” Fontanella added. “This type of television, you know, is somewhat simplified, but also still more complicated than anyone would guess. Like Will does so much planning for what we do. And Mikko, with all the tech mishaps or whatever needs to be set up — they do a lot of work.”
Like C-SPAN, Gavel broadcasts the activities of all three branches of Alaska’s government: the Legislature; the executive, such as governor’s speeches or news conferences; and the judiciary, including oral arguments before the Alaska Supreme Court.  
At times, Gavel broadcasts emergency response updates, such as from the U.S. Coast Guard or National Weather Service; it provided updates when one of the strongest storms on record, Typhoon Merbok, hit in 2022, impacting more than 35 communities in Western Alaska.  
Gavel partners in Juneau and statewide
Gavel Alaska is an independent press outlet, but those broadcasts require close coordination with public offices around the state. 
For broadcasting the Alaska Supreme Court, that’s the court clerk’s office; for the Legislature, that’s daily coordination with the media team of the Legislative Affairs Agency, a nonpartisan support agency based in the Terry Miller Legislative Office on 6th Street behind the Capitol. 
The agency also provides webstreaming on the state’s website of all legislative floor sessions and committee meetings, for the public record, said Tim Powers, the agency’s chief technology and operations officer.

“So KTOO is going to do their high production quality for all the popular meetings, and we’re still going to create the record for everything that may not be as popular, yeah, and won’t have as high demand on television,” he said.
The agency also coordinates all call-ins for the public to comment. “You can testify on every bill in every committee in Alaska when they have public testimony, and that is not the case in other states,” he said. 
“In some other states, you have to go to the State House to testify. In some other states, you’re not allowed to testify, even if you do go to the State House, because they just don’t take it. So it’s unique, uniquely Alaskan, and I think it’s a benefit to us,” Powers said. 
Powers said typically they see an estimated 1 million minutes per year of teleconferencing. “Yeah, it’s a lot of people connected,” he said.
The Gavel livestream is watched closely by Alaska news outlets and journalists too, like Matt Acuña Buxton, who writes the political newsletter, the Alaska Memo.  
“Literally — and I mean literally — I couldn’t do my job covering the Alaska Legislature from Anchorage without Gavel Alaska’s hard work,” he said. “It’s a lot more than just a camera in a legislative hearing, and Gavel’s crews do so much behind the scenes to ensure we can see what’s going on in Juneau, whether it be news conferences or the beloved hallway cameras. 
“Their work with the broadcast during the day, which has to keep up with packed days of simultaneous hearings as well as the slow days, does a good job of balancing the big-ticket issues while also offering a wide look at things that you didn’t know needed to be on your radar.”
Federal funding under threat
KTOO receives local funding, as well as federal funding, whose future is now uncertain. 
The partnership with the state to broadcast Gavel Alaska is an informal one. “We don’t receive any state funding for actually making this happen,” said KTOO manager Justin Shoman, “So we’re really relying on these other sources.”
Since its start in 1996, the public television broadcast has been partly funded by the City and Borough of Juneau, to provide Alaskans access to the Capitol. Amid a long-running dispute on the location of Alaska’s capital, the city’s funding of the broadcast continues still today.
“Regardless of where the capital is in Alaska, it’s still inaccessible easily to a large number of people,” Mader noted. “So that’s why I think, of all the states, having this service is most crucial in Alaska.”
The Gavel Alaska staffing and production costs about $750,000 per year, Shoman said, with $455,000 funded by the city. 
The remaining roughly $295,000 is funded by a mix of sponsorships, underwriting, community donors and federal grant funding, including funding through the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which also supports the general TV operations of KTOO. “The majority of CPB funding goes to television. That’s simply because television is more expensive to produce,” Shoman said. 
That federal funding is threatened now, as Trump has proposed steep cuts to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. 
Shoman and other supporters of public broadcasting in Alaska are actively advocating, including flying to Washington, D.C., and meeting with Alaska’s congressional delegation, urging them to protect the funding. 
“For those who are concerned with the future of Gavel Alaska and that level of government, accessibility and transparency — it is reliant, in Alaska, on some federal funding, and it’s important that people know that,” Shoman said.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DSCF4772-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-05 11:08:15.310363

With $49,000 in student loan debt, Josue Villalpando figured becoming a homeowner was a long way off.

“The thought of purchasing a home was definitely floating around, however I never actually looked into it knowing that I had such a big burden with my student loans,” he said.

A recent graduate of the University of Illinois Chicago, Villalpando, 29, took out private loans to pay for college. Unlike federal student loans, private loans typically have higher interest rates and fewer forgiveness programs, making them harder for borrowers to pay off.

Then, his fiancé came across the SmartBuy program – an initiative set up by the state to help incentivize residents to purchase a home while paying off their student loan debt, one of the leading factors delaying homeownership among young adults.

SmartBuy pays up to $40,000 in student loans and contributes up to $5,000 towards a down payment or closing costs at the time of purchase.

“He showed it to me and said, ‘Hey, maybe, let’s fact check it, and let’s make sure it’s a real thing, because it’s almost too good to be true, right?’” said Villalpando, who received his degree in communication.

Records obtained by the Illinois Answers Project show that a total of 755 houses have been purchased through the program, with 482 still in process from the second round of applications.

Villalpando closed on his home in Lansing, Illinois in March.

“With my student loans being fully paid off, I know I can comfortably pay my mortgage without having to worry about financial constraints,” said Villalpando. “The SmartBuy program is what made me take the initiative.”

But the long-term viability of SmartBuy remains uncertain.

Renewal for the program is dependent on reallocation of state funding. After the first round closed in 2021, it took the state more than three years to reopen the program, which closed for the second time in February.

The uncertain timeline for program renewal raises questions about it being a viable option for tackling the staggering $63 billion in collective student loan debt the state faces.

Illinois has the seventh highest average state debt in the nation. Coupled with one of the highest unemployment rates in the country, the burden of these loans become even more substantial for some borrowers, effectively delaying the purchase of a home, the decision to start a family and progress towards economic advancement.

With federal student loan programs in disarray, innovative, state-level programs like SmartBuy offer an alternative answer to combating the crisis. But federal funding, legislative approval and borrower awareness remain barriers to sustained coverage and widespread success.

Student loans are also preventing qualified applicants from pursuing professions with costly higher education requirements, like legal and medical careers.

“Tuition for undergraduate and law school has grown at something like three to five times the rate of inflation over the last 40 years,” said Bob Glaves, executive director of the Chicago Bar Foundation, which promotes equitable access to justice and legal aid in Chicago.

“We don’t have a way to measure [this], but I think everybody knows how many people, particularly from economically disadvantaged backgrounds, are not even pursuing these careers, not even pursuing higher education, because they see the price tag and the amount of debt they’d be taking on and just aren’t going to do that,” said Glaves.

The burden of this long-term debt has created a financial paradox for many graduates.

“When we think of the American dream and [how] everybody should have equal opportunity, this is a big part of it — education,” said Glaves. “Being able to make that realistically accessible to everybody in a way that’s fair to everybody. We’re falling short of that in the system we have right now.”

What does student loan debt look like in Illinois?

Nicole Johnson, 35, is currently on track to receive her fourth higher education degree by the end of September — a master’s in journalism from Northwestern University’s Medill School.

This will be her third master’s degree in the past 12 years.

Johnson is a strong advocate for education, having worked in numerous public service roles, including as a former third grade teacher in Chicago Public Schools. In 2019, Johnson ran in the 20th Ward aldermanic election, losing to Jeanette Taylor in the general runoff.

“I wanted to be part of being able to provide young people with a good education, because education was the thing that opened so many doors for me and exposed me to a new world,” said Johnson.

Growing up in Englewood, Johnson was exposed to disparity and inequity at a young age.

Motivated by the stark economic inequities she witnessed in her own community, Johnson sought out numerous higher education degrees as a means to increase her earning potential.

“Your economic outcomes and possibilities are going to be quite limited unless you do some type of investment,” she said.

Her degrees haven’t come for free. Johnson’s current student loan balance is over $200,000, a number that would take decades to pay off without any kind of repayment or forgiveness program.

Johnson isn’t alone. Nearly 1.6 million Illinoisans are currently living with student loan debt.

The average borrower in the state owes about $39,000 in student loans, according to the Education Data Initiative, a research group that collects data and statistics on the U.S. education system.

More than half of all borrowers in the state are under the age of 35, and only 13.4% of student borrowers owe less than $5,000. A majority of borrowers owe more.

25 – 34 year olds account for the most borrowers of any age group – more than 558,000. But 35 – 49 year olds like Johnson have the highest total outstanding debt of over $22 billion.  Together, the two age groups account for almost 68% of the state’s federal loans.

While residents like Johnson have sought relief via. federal forgiveness options, recent changes and cuts at the federal level have made the future of these programs uncertain.

The current status of loan forgiveness

The Department of Education has been the U.S. government’s administrator of all federal aid programming since 1965, but this is soon to not be the case.

With the Trump administration’s announcement that student loan oversight will be moved to the Small Business Administration, and the U.S. Department of Education being effectively cut in half, many borrowers are left wondering how this will impact their relief options.

In February, former President Biden’s SAVE program – the lowest monthly income-driven repayment plan to date –  was issued an injunction by a U.S. appeals court. Several Republican-led states rejected the plan and sued the Biden administration, citing that it was “​​unlawfully trying to mass cancel hundreds of billions of dollars of loans.”

Monthly payments for those enrolled in SAVE have been placed in a period of forbearance, with accruing interest, until the court reaches a final decision.

On May 5, the Federal Student Aid office resumed its collection of many student loans, which had been effectively paused since March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Since Johnson has returned to school, her loans have been in deferment. But when she purchased a home in 2021, she said student loan and credit card debt notably impacted the mortgage rate she was able to qualify for.  “It was definitely an impediment,” said Johnson.

The dissolution of the U.S Department of Education has left millions of student loan borrowers, including Johnson, confused and wondering what the future of their repayments will look like in the wake of a departmental restructuring.

Rae Kaplan, a Chicago-based attorney specializing in student loan law and bankruptcy solutions, said she has witnessed despondency in a number of clients as a result of student loan debt.

“I’ve had people come in and tell me that they didn’t want to get married or have a family because their student loans were so daunting,” said Kaplan. “And the point is that student loans were meant to lift people up, not to be this weight dragging everybody down,” she said.

According to Kaplan, a majority of clients don’t even realize what options are out there.

Several federal and state-based forgiveness solutions can provide effective relief for borrowers over a period of time, even amidst the disorder of the FSA. They just need to know what their choices are, said Kaplan.

Relief options for Illinois residents

Johnson was formerly enrolled in the SAVE program, but like many other federal borrowers, qualifies for other income-driven repayment plans like Public Service Loan Forgiveness.

To qualify for PSLF, individuals must work full-time for a governmental body or select non-profit organization. PSLF forgives the total remaining balance on all federal student loans after 120 monthly payments determined by a qualifying repayment plan.

“Essentially, you only have to make payments on your loans for 10 years… and the payment is very reasonable, because it’s about 10% of your discretionary income,” said Kaplan.  “So for a lot of people, that means the monthly payment is no more than their cell phone bill,” she said.

Working on and off in the public sector for nearly a decade, Johnson already has 93 qualifying monthly payments towards her student loans. Her nearly six figure balance will be completely forgiven once she completes the remaining 27 over the next two years.

Kaplan estimates that nearly 30% of Illinois residents qualify for this program, along with additional state-based loan forgiveness and repayment opportunities.

According to the Education Data Initiative, only about 18% of eligible student borrowers end up applying for loan forgiveness at all.

“We go on WGN TV, we go on WGN radio, and try to get the word out that if you are an Illinois resident and you work in the public sector, there are some really good options out there to get your loans reduced and forgiven, but people think that it must not apply to them,” Kaplan said. “I hear all the time.”

Johnson says borrowers may also remain unaware of forgiveness programs because of prevailing social taboos. “Honestly, student loan debt is not a conversation,” she said. But specialists like Kaplan are working to change that by speaking openly about local repayment options.

The Illinois Student Assistance Commission, a state-based government agency that provides higher education resources to students and families, administers a number of relief programs for residents.

Dollar amounts for each award are subject to annual reviews by the Illinois General Assembly and the Office of the Governor, but last year the state awarded nearly $4 million in loan repayments to qualifying residents through their seven ISAC-administered programs. ISAC has increased funding for most of those programs for the 2025 fiscal year.

Last year, 649 residents enrolled in an ISAC repayment program, but many more than that qualify for the award, according to Kaplan. Frequent federal policy changes and extended loan repayment uncertainty during the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to lowered demand, according to ISAC.

“We’ve been in an extended period of uncertainty with respect to loan repayment since 2020,” said Lynne Baker, managing director of communications at ISAC. “There were extended forbearances as a result of the pandemic, which meant that there was a period when people didn’t have to pay on their loans and likely were not focused on loan forgiveness programs,” she said.

Although a majority of borrowers’ student loans are federally allocated, in 2019 to 2020 approximately 10% of college graduates in Illinois had private student loan debt.

In response to growing concerns about the impacts of large private student loans, The Office of the Illinois State Treasurer created the Student Empowerment Fund in 2024, a $1.5 billion investment fund providing capital for lower-rate private loans for residents attending in-state institutions.

“This program aims to alleviate student debt burdens in Illinois and make it possible for more students to pursue higher education,” said Eric Krol, director of communications for the Treasurer’s Office.

Kaplan said while it’s essential to know what relief programs exist, the best way to tackle student loan debt is preemptively.

“Having a good plan and strategy, knowing the laws, knowing who should be the federal parent, plus borrower, and exactly what those payments are going to look like is really key, and can really avoid wasting a lot of money,” she said.

“For 90% [of borrowers] there’s something you can do to lower your payments and even get on track to have your loans forgiven. I just don’t want people who have loans to feel hopeless, because I talk to a lot of people every day who feel hopeless about their loans,” said Kaplan.

The SmartBuy solution

Illinois will have the greatest decline in the number of new homeowners in the next two decades – a decrease of more than 7% by 2040, according to the Urban Institute, a non-profit economic and social policy research firm.

While multiple factors can be linked to this decline, data from the Federal Reserve suggests historic levels of student loan debt are to blame.

A little over 20% of the decline in homeownership rates among 24-32 year olds from 2009 to 2014 can be attributed to rising student loan debt across the country.

“Student loan debt is one of the single largest barriers delaying younger households from achieving their dream of homeownership,” said Illinois Housing Development Authority (IHDA) Executive Director Kristin Faust in a press release.



[caption id=""attachment_69873"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1024""] Through the SmartBuy program, Josue Villalpando was able to close on his home in Lansing, Illinois in March 2025. “With my student loans being fully paid off, I know I can comfortably pay my mortgage without having to worry about financial constraints,” said Villalpando. (Provided by Josue Villalpando)[/caption]



The state came up with SmartBuy as a proposed solution. The program was created using a $25 million capital bill fund from Gov. JB Pritzker’s 2019 Rebuild Illinois Plan.

“Through SmartBuy, we have seen that this targeted relief can help new buyers overcome this financial burden and secure a home much earlier, allowing for a better opportunity to start building equity,” Faust said.

The first round of SmartBuy paid off an average of $26,700 in student loan debt per buyer, with the second round expected to average $28,800 per buyer.

Of course the program does come with specific eligibility requirements.

A buyer’s full student loan debt must be paid off at the time of purchase. If their debt exceeds $40,000, they must make up the difference at the time of closing. Villalplando said he needed to come up with an extra $9,000 before closing on his Lansing home.

Buyers also need to have a minimum credit score of 640 and live in the home for at least three years after closing or repay a portion of the debt assistance. IDHA determines the interest rate on the home’s mortgage.

So far, of the 631 loans closed in the first round, 15, did not make it through the three year forgiveness period. IDHA told the Illinois Answers Project they do not possess data as to why the borrower had to sell.

Chicago residents must have a household income of less than $134,000 and the purchase price for a one unit home must be under $610,000 and no more than $754,000 for a two-unit.

“There is no requirement in terms of where the home is or the census tract it’s in,” said Jason Finn, a Chicago-based realtor who works with SmartBuy applicants.

According to data obtained from IDHA, about 87% of homes purchased in the first round and 75% of homes purchased in the second round of the program were located in the Chicago region of Illinois.

“This is the sixth different IDHA program that I’ve worked with, and, for the folks that can benefit, I think it’s a bigger boom than any of the other programs they’ve had,” said Finn.

“I’ve had a lot of clients that have huge amounts of student debt, well into the six figures. Many of them aren’t working in a career that was envisioned when they incurred all that student debt. So, I’d love to see more opportunities like this.”

What begins as an investment in future prosperity can become a prolonged financial strain that limits career choices and delays other life milestones. The SmartBuy program hopes to make Villalpando’s story a more common one.

“I know many people who have student loan debt just following them for 15 plus years, and it seems like it’s never ending,” said Villalpando.

“So I just hope [SmartBuy] keeps going,” he said.

A new proposal on student loan debt

Even with available state-sponsored and federal forgiveness programs, and unique opportunities like SmartBuy, eligibility for these options can be so specific that many borrowers still fall through the cracks. For example, the borrowers who work in service-oriented careers but don’t qualify for PSLF.

That is what led members of the Chicago Bar Foundation, the charitable arm of the Chicago Bar Association, to develop a comprehensive legislation proposal addressing the coverage gap.

“We had an advocacy committee that really started this process of getting feedback on, how did [student debt] get like this? How did we get to this position now where it costs so much to go to school and we have people graduating with these mortgage sized debts?,” said Glaves.

The proposed legislation includes a simplification of current repayment programs by incorporating a multi-tiered income-based repayment program that places stricter limits on borrower loan sizes.

“It really has to be done with some more accountability on the amount that’s borrowed in the first place, both on the schools and the borrower,” said Glaves. “Otherwise taxpayers are on the hook for a lot of this.”

Glaves believes setting realistic borrowing limits will also mitigate national student loan default rates, which have declined in recent years, though such limits may prevent students from accessing sufficient funds to cover their educational costs.

The initiative also suggests Congress should allow bankruptcy options as a last resort. While not impossible, Glaves said filing for bankruptcy is extremely difficult within the current financial aid system.

“Someone gets in a situation where that income based approach isn’t going to work for them, there should be an option to file for bankruptcy at that point, as there is in every other kind of instance, in our country,” said Glaves.

Filing for bankruptcy typically results in additional consequences for borrowers, impacting their credit score and ability to acquire future loans. But if necessary, this option can substantially aid borrowers who, for reasons out of their control, aren’t able to complete their degrees and now have a mountain of debt to pay off.

The proposal has received support from the Illinois delegation and a general recognition from Congress of the need for a unified legislation approach, but Glaves expects it will not be passed during the current political term. Still, he remains hopeful.

“This is just one of those issues that, because it really does require some bigger changes to the system, we’re going to continue to work on,” said Glaves. “Even if there isn’t a lot of promise to have this happen in the short term politically.”

With an uncertain political landscape and climbing student debt, borrowers like Johnson wonder what the future of education will look like without a clear plan in place.

“Education is going to look different in 20 years, who knows what’s going to happen,” said Johnson. “In my mid-30s I’m thinking, okay how are my kids going to go to school?”

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM)New Mexico’s relatively cool and moist weather so far this spring will dry and warm up in coming weeks, putting fire managers and forecasters on high alert for wildfires before the start of the seasonal monsoon rains this summer.
This year’s low snowpack has already put much of the state in drought conditions, and Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham recently declared a state of emergency and additional actions to prevent fires over the coming weeks.
Recent rains around the state offer some relief, as May and June typically emerge as some of the driest months, said George Ducker, a wildfire prevention and spokesperson at the New Mexico Forestry Division.
But the projected warm temperatures through the next several weeks could mean the recent spouting of new plants could aggravate the problem, he said.
“We could see a substantial dry up of these flashy fuels, the grasses and even shrubs,” Ducker said. “Then, if you get a start, get a little bit of wind — there would be more fuel to burn.”
The recent rains did not herald the start of the monsoon, the seasonal tropical patterns that provide Arizona and New Mexico with critical moisture, said Andrea Bair, a forecaster with the National Weather Service Western Region based in Salt Lake City, at a National Integrated Drought Information System presentation Tuesday.
Rather, she said monsoons are expected to start in mid-June and could be stronger than past years, but hot temperatures will continue to dry out the soils and stress plants across much of the Southwestern U.S.
“The drought looks to continue throughout the season and the monthly outlook forecasts,” she said. “So not a lot of relief is expected.”
The rains lessened the acute risks of fire in the Southwest, said Jim Wallmann, a senior forecaster for the National Interagency Coordination Center Predictive Services. But other parts of the county are seeing wildfires “extremely early” in the fire season, he said, noting the 1,000-acre Banana Lake fire in Montana.
“We’re having to spread our resources over a much greater footprint of the country,” Wallmann said. “That could affect how big a fire gets in California, if we’re stretched and can’t send everything to California while it’s burning; we’ll be on fires burning everywhere else.”
Ducker said the concerns about availability for resources to fight wildfires is “a bridge we’ll cross when we come to it,” and said the state is working to be prepared.
“We have the resources to be able to jump on fires as they start,” Ducker said. Our federal partners seem to be in the same place where they’re ready to respond, so right now we’re just waiting for June to see what it shows us.”

Larry Rhoden speaks to the media during a press conference on March 13, 2025, at the Capitol in Pierre. (Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)Republican South Dakota Governor Larry Rhoden signed an executive order this week to plan for future disasters as the Trump administration works to shift the responsibility for disaster relief to state and local entities.
“We pray that the most challenging circumstances will never arise, but we are preparing so that South Dakota can face such situations with determination, resilience, and grit,” Rhoden said in a press release.  
President Trump has called the Federal Emergency Management Agency a “disaster” and suggested it might “go away.” FEMA is led by Homeland Security Secretary and former South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem. 
Trump signed an executive order in March titled “Achieving Efficiency Through State and Local Preparedness,” which says “federal policy must rightly recognize that preparedness is most effectively owned and managed at the State, local, and even individual levels.”
The Trump order also instructs federal agencies to reevaluate grants, contracts, and technical assistance funding programs. FEMA has since ended the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program. The 2021 program aimed to direct $1 billion in funding toward infrastructure projects to help communities across the U.S. “reduce their hazard risk” as they “build capability and capacity.” According to a tally of federal cuts compiled and updated weekly by the governor’s office, $8.9 million in South Dakota projects were set to benefit from BRIC grants.
End of FEMA program affects drinking water, building code updates, tornado shelter in SD

Critics say the shift in disaster relief responsibilities and funding from the federal government to state and local governments will leave poorer, rural states unprepared and unable to respond.
Rhoden says the task force will “support” the Trump administration’s executive order. 
Rhoden dubbed the group the Governor’s Resilience and Infrastructure Task Force, or GRIT. He said the task force will serve as an advisory body to “develop policy recommendations, assess risks and vulnerabilities, and support long-term planning and investment in critical infrastructure systems across our state.”
The task force will be chaired by Lt. Gov. Tony Venhuizen. Adjutant General Mark Morrell of the South Dakota National Guard will serve as vice chair. Venhuizen said the task force is more than a response to President Trump ending programs and planning to shift responsibilities to states. He said the concept of the task force has been under consideration since last year.

Kim Reynolds talks to reporters May 17, 2022, after signing legislation dealing with biofuels at a farm near Prairie City. (Photo by Kathie Obradovich/Iowa Capital Dispatch)As she considers whether to sign legislation limiting the use of eminent domain for carbon pipelines, Gov. Kim Reynolds faces a decision that will forever define her legacy in the Iowa Republican Party: whether to uphold the constitutional rights and the property rights of Iowa landowners, or whether to put ethanol industry profits ahead of those rights.
The party platform unequivocally supports landowner rights. The Iowa House and Senate, both controlled by Republicans, have passed bipartisan legislation that would protect those rights. This should not be a difficult choice.
However, there are many special interest groups urging the governor to veto House File 639, claiming it would harm the ethanol industry and derail future economic development opportunities in the state. But if those claims were true, why do nearly 30% of Iowa’s ethanol plants choose not to participate in this risky CO₂ pipeline venture? Why is Summit Carbon Solutions suing multiple Iowa counties over zoning ordinances, the very tools those counties use to guide and protect local economic growth?
The self-serving arguments of the ethanol industry do not stand up to scrutiny. Privately owned carbon dioxide pipelines do not align with the constitutional definition of “public use” necessary for eminent domain, and they do not justify using the government’s “takings” power to force private landowners to participate in a speculative business enterprise. Essentially, these special interests are asking the governor to pick economic winners and losers at the expense of constitutional rights.
Importantly, HF 639 does not stop the pipeline project, nor does it prevent voluntary easements. In fact, Summit has already secured all necessary voluntary agreements in Minnesota and must now do the same in South Dakota to meet Iowa Utilities Commission conditions for construction here. Iowa landowners deserve the same rights as landowners in our neighboring states.
If this project truly serves a vital economic need and garners legitimate support, it can move forward through the free market—without coercion, and without undermining the rights of landowners.
I commend Gov. Reynolds for engaging a broad range of stakeholders in this conversation. Listening to the public and not just to special interests is essential for crafting sound public policy, but it does not change the dilemma facing the governor: constitutional rights vs. special interest profits.
By signing HF 639, Gov. Reynolds would uphold constitutional rights, curb the misuse of eminent domain for private profit, demonstrate her commitment to the Republican Party’s property rights platform, protect landowners from inadequate insurance coverage, and strengthen the public accountability of the Iowa Utilities Commission.
It would ensure she is forever remembered as a champion of the Republican Party’s commitment to constitutional rights and private property rights.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/reynolds-gaggle-5.17.22-prairie-city-biofuels-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-05 09:01:09.284234

For 32 years, the kidnapping and murder of 6-year-old Willie Cook remained a mystery. 
Then, in 2008, sheriff’s deputies in Siskiyou County got their first big break: A man came forward to say he had witnessed the kidnapping. Steve Marshall was only 10-years-old when Willie disappeared, but his memory of that August day remained vivid. 
So vivid, in fact, that the District Attorney’s Office built its case around his testimony, charging a local man with murder. 
Deep inside the file, however, lay evidence that would cast doubt on Marshall’s testimony. Would anyone discover it? 
To find out, read the gripping narrative of the cold case from CalMatters investigative reporter Anat Rubin. 
The story is part of a series exploring how poor people accused of crimes in California are routinely convicted in California without anyone investigating the charges against them. 
Defense investigators are perhaps the most important safeguard against wrongful convictions. But, as Rubin found, close to half of California’s 58 counties do not employ any full-time public defense investigators. 
Among the findings of her investigation:

Of the 10 California counties with the highest prison incarceration rates, eight have no defense investigators on staff. 
In Riverside, for example, the district attorney has 30% more lawyers than the public defender but 500% more investigators.
Hidden in the data is the greatest tragedy of failing to investigate cases: wrongful convictions. 

Maurice Possley, a leading expert on exonerations, said that a failure to investigate is at the heart of most of the cases he reviews. He’s astounded by what he finds when he looks at the evidence. 

Possley: “If someone had just made the effort. This was all sitting there.”

Air quality regulators are expected to vote Friday on rules that aim to phase out water heaters and other heating systems powered by natural gas, writes CalMatters’ Alejandra Reyes-Velarde.
Officials at the South Coast Air Quality Management District — which oversees four counties in the Los Angeles basin including Orange County and parts of L.A. and San Bernardino counties — say that home appliances are one of the largest sources of smog-causing gases in the region.
If the rules are approved, 30% of heating appliances sold in the region must be zero-emissions beginning in 2027. Consumers also wouldn’t be required to swap out their appliances immediately, but could buy electric-powered heat pumps when it comes time to replace their natural gas water heaters, central heating systems or furnaces.
Contractors and developers oppose the phaseout, citing higher costs: Installing a heat pump in lieu of a natural gas water heater costs $2,000 more, and replacing a furnace costs $8,000 more.

On Wednesday the California Supreme Court heard arguments involving a lawsuit against state regulators for their decision to dramatically reduce the compensation customers with solar installations receive for the excess energy they generate. 
As CalMatters’ Malena Carollo explains, in 2022 the California Public Utilities Commission slashed compensation payments utilities paid homeowners with rooftop solar panels by around 75%. The commission said the updated rates reversed what it saw as unfair subsidies to well-to-do solar customers, striking a balance between affordability and encouraging renewable energy alternatives. Since then, demand for rooftop solar projects has taken a nosedive.
The rooftop solar industry, ratepayers and renewable energy groups opposed the reduction and three environmental groups are suing the commission. They argue that the commission didn’t properly consider benefits to customers and disadvantaged communities when it changed the rules. The court is expected to issue its decision in about a month.

Though federal immigration agents cannot be blocked from accessing places they are legally authorized to enter, California’s Democratic-led Senate passed a series of bills Monday that would limit cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. Read more about what the handful of these bills would do from CalMatters’ Jeanne Kuang.






California Voices
CalMatters columnist Dan Walters: With the deadline to pass the state budget drawing near, lawmakers will have to either make difficult spending cuts, increase the state’s chronic deficit or raise taxes.
California’s landmark environmental law has been used to cause harm, and state lawmakers should pass a bill that would limit its reach for some housing projects, write Nick Yost, creator of the environmental section of the California Department of Justice, and Daniel Yost, founding board member of Peninsula Clean Energy.

The revenue picture now “looks worse than we expected,"" according to the report's author.
The post Falling office building values still a concern for Boston’s budget, think tank says appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","IT’S ROUND 2 for Mayor Michelle Wu and the Boston Policy Institute. The think tank that repeatedly clashed with City Hall over taxes is out with a follow-up to their report last year that Boston is facing a stormy revenue picture in the years ahead, as remote work has led to a loss in the value of office buildings. Their takeaway, as put by Evan Horowitz, the Tufts University analyst and author of both last year’s report and the one out Thursday: The revenue picture now “looks worse than we expected.” The city’s $4.6 billion operating budget heavily relies on property taxes, which are calculated based on assessed values of a property and an applied tax rate. Commercial property taxes make up a third of the budget. The think tank’s latest report says property taxes are a “very stable” source of revenue, having helped Boston power through past economic downturns. But several notable buildings, such as 101 Arch Street and 400 Atlantic Avenue, are now trading hands at discounts ranging from 50 to 70 percent. With hybrid work, high mortgage rates, and federal tariffs leading to increased costs, “there’s no reason to expect a near-term turnaround in the value or profitability of office spaces,” the report said. The report added that “the total assessed value of all office properties in Boston fell 9 percent in FY 2025 (in real terms), a one-year decline comparable only to the [2008] financial crisis and the bursting of the [2001] dot-com bubble. And while those earlier, recession-induced drops were short-lived, today’s slump seems more durable.”The Boston Policy Institute’s new report, like the one in 2024, doubled down on what it termed a city budget “shortfall” due to falling office building values, saying the new estimate totals $1.7 billion over the next five years, revising up from $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion. Wu administration officials have previously disputed the think tank’s use of the word “shortfall,” noting any revenue decrease from commercial property taxes would have to be made up by an increase in residential property taxes. The mayor, joined by House lawmakers, pushed for property tax shift legislation last year on Beacon Hill, only to see it die in the Senate. The legislation would have temporarily shifted more of the tax burden onto commercial businesses in order to avoid a spike in residential property taxes. The Boston Policy Institute, a nonprofit, has emerged as a rival to a longtime city watchdog, the Boston Municipal Research Bureau (BMRB). While BMRB gets money from the city’s top businesses, like Fidelity and State Street, the BPI does not reveal its donors. As with the February 2024 report, the think tank provided Thursday’s report under an embargo, meaning reporters could not share the findings with the Wu administration for comment. The latest report comes as Wu faces a challenger, Josh Kraft, the son of New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft. The younger Kraft, a longtime nonprofit executive, has criticized Wu for declining to cut the city’s budget. Wu, for her part, has said her administration is “preparing for worst case scenarios while refraining from preemptive disruption of city services,” and noted that cuts would lead to fewer police and firefighters. In her fiscal year 2026 budget proposal, she proposed slowing growth, with the operating budget coming in at $4.8 billion, a 4.4 percent increase from the previous year, down from a 7 percent increase the year before that. In May, Wu touted Moody’s Investor Service and S&P Global Ratings, two ratings agencies, both handing the city a AAA bond rating, the same week that Moody’s downgraded the United States. The city has held the top credit rating, an indication of fiscal health, since 2014. “Boston’s commercial and retail properties continue to rebound from elevated vacancy rates seen during the pandemic and these metrics now compare favorably to similar large metro areas in the US,” S&P wrote in its assessment, dated May 13. “It is working to address the effects of declining office building values, which are not expected to affect the city’s revenue collections due to the structure of its tax collections, but may result in a shift of the tax burden to residential taxpayers due to the city’s dual tax rate,” the rating agency added. S&P also noted the city’s effort to convert some downtown office space into residential properties in a bid to boost foot traffic, improve housing supply, and stabilize property values. “These office conversions face several challenges; the success of this program, however, will be felt over an extended time horizon,” the agency’s analysts wrote.The post Falling office building values still a concern for Boston’s budget, think tank says appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/0Traffic.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-05 09:01:09.284234

In California, there’s no guarantee.","On Aug. 28, 1976, sometime between 7:30 and 8 p.m., a 6-year-old boy named Willie Cook disappeared from the bed of his father’s pickup in Happy Camp, a secluded logging community in Northern California’s Klamath National Forest. Willie’s father, Bill Cook, had been working on his lawn mower at a repair shop in the center of town. When he was done, he told Willie to wait in the truck with the family dog while he ducked into the bar across the street. He was gone less than 20 minutes. The sun had set behind the mountains, but there was still light in the sky.
Cook searched the area on foot, then drove in the direction of the family home. After he circled town a couple more times, he called law enforcement to report that his son was missing. He gave the local deputy a description: Willie was 42 inches tall and weighed 45 pounds. He was wearing a black baseball jersey, jeans and white tennis shoes. His right eye was blue, and his left eye was a mix of blue and brown. He was, Cook said, “a very good boy, and had never wandered off in the past.” 
By midnight, 150 people were searching for Willie, combing the dense woods surrounding the town. But Cook did not believe his son was lost in the forest. From the moment he had walked out of that bar, he was certain that someone had taken him. “I felt it,” he said. “I felt it all over.”
Willie’s body was discovered six months later in a small cardboard barrel at a campground along the Klamath River, more than 50 miles from Happy Camp. The Siskiyou County sheriff’s office launched a murder investigation but never solved the case. 
After 32 years, sheriff’s deputies got their first big break when a man came forward to say he had witnessed the kidnapping. Steve Marshall was only 10 years old in 1976, but his memory of that August day was vivid: He was sitting alone in his mother’s blue station wagon, parked outside the Headway Market, within view of the repair shop and the old bar. He was eating a vanilla ice cream cone. His brother was inside the market with their mother. They would be having spaghetti for dinner that night — his favorite.

Marshall seemed to remember what happened next as though it were unfolding in slow motion: The sound of a logging truck as it roared past. Willie’s Labrador wagging his tail. And a young man in blue jeans and a vest, his long hair in two braids, standing on the opposite side of the street, staring at the boy and his dog.
Marshall recognized him. His name was Gregory Nelson. And Marshall said he had a clear view of him as he crossed the street, grabbed Willie, shoved him into a VW bus and drove off, disappearing down the one-lane highway that cut through town. Marshall had tried to tell his mother what he’d seen, but she’d brushed him off. For the next few decades, he mostly kept it to himself. But the memory, he said, had haunted him.
The Siskiyou sheriff arrested Nelson, then 51, and brought him in for questioning. He had a couple grams of methamphetamine and several syringes in his pocket. After two days of interrogation, he confessed. The following day, the sheriff told a local reporter that a cold case is like a puzzle. “After 32 years, we’re finally getting the pieces put together.”
Nelson was charged with kidnapping and murder. Siskiyou’s chief public defender, Lael Kayfetz, thought there was little chance of overcoming a signed confession and an eyewitness account. Then the prosecutors turned over the recordings of Nelson’s interrogation. When Kayfetz watched the footage, she said, “my eyeballs fell out of my head.” 
She realized she needed to test the claims against her client, but she couldn’t do it on her own. “I’m an expert on the law,” Kayfetz said. “I’m not an expert on getting the facts.” She needed an investigator. 
The prosecutors were working closely with detectives at the sheriff’s office, issuing warrants and building a case. They also employed their own team of five investigators. 
That year, Siskiyou County’s public defender didn’t have a single defense investigator on staff. 
***
Lawyers have a constitutional obligation to investigate every case. But a CalMatters investigation found that poor people accused of crimes, who account for at least 80% of criminal defendants, are routinely convicted in California without anyone investigating the charges against them. Close to half of California’s 58 counties do not employ any full-time public defense investigators. Among the remaining counties, defendants’ access to investigators fluctuates wildly, but it’s almost always inadequate.
The cost of this failure is steep, for individual defendants and for the integrity of California’s criminal justice system. Of the 10 California counties with the highest prison incarceration rates, eight have no defense investigators on staff, according to an analysis of staffing and prison data. 
The lack of investigators affects counties throughout the state, from poor, rural areas like Siskiyou to the state’s largest and most well-funded public defense offices. Los Angeles employed just 1 investigator for every 10 public defenders — one of the state’s worst ratios, according to the most recent data from the California Department of Justice. Only seven California counties met the widely accepted minimum standard of 1 investigator for every 3 attorneys. 
The situation is most alarming in the 25 California counties that don’t have dedicated public defender offices and pay private attorneys to represent indigent people in criminal court. Most of these attorneys receive a flat fee for their services, and the cost of an investigator would eat away at their profits. Some counties allow contracted attorneys to ask the court for additional funds for investigations, but court records show the attorneys rarely make those requests. 
In Kings County, which has one of the highest prison incarceration rates in California, contracted attorneys asked the court for permission to hire an investigator in 7% of criminal cases from 2018 to 2022. In Lake County, attorneys made those requests in just 2% of criminal cases over a three-year period; in Mono County, it was less than 1%. To earn a living from meager county contracts, research shows, private attorneys and firms must persuade defendants to accept plea deals as quickly as possible. An investigation is an expensive delay.
Defense investigators interview witnesses, visit crime scenes, review police reports and retrieve video surveillance footage that might prove the defendant was on the other side of town when a crime was committed, or that an assault was an act of self-defense. They do work that most lawyers are not trained to do. Without them, police and prosecutorial misconduct — among the most common causes of wrongful convictions — remain unchecked, significantly increasing the likelihood that people will go to prison for crimes they did not commit.
“Law is important, but the facts are what influences the law,” said Aditi Goel, executive director of the Sixth Amendment Center, a national nonprofit focused on improving indigent defense. “The heart of a case is what happened.”
***
In 2008, Kayfetz and her four staff attorneys were left to sleuth most cases on their own, and they worried about what they might be missing. Siskiyou County provided them with a small budget to contract with a private investigator, but the Nelson case, which had already spanned three decades, would burn through their entire investigation fund for the year. Still, Kayfetz didn’t feel as though she had a choice. Nelson was facing life in prison, and the sheriff was in the papers talking about closure for the Cook family. 
She called Rob Shelton, an investigator who had spent most of the previous two decades in law enforcement — first with the Coast Guard, then as a harbor patrol officer in Ventura, and recently as a probation officer for Siskiyou. He’d crossed over into defense investigations, and this would be his first homicide case for the public defender’s office.

Nelson’s mug shot had by then been published on the front page of the Siskiyou Daily News. His hair was graying, and his cheeks were deeply sunken. Shelton knew that look. He had seen it on the probationers he had monitored, people whose hard lives were etched into their faces. He had come to view their struggles with the law as a symptom of their poverty and addiction. But he also believed Nelson was guilty. It was hard for him to imagine that the sheriff would pursue a case without concrete evidence, and even harder to believe that the district attorney would push it toward trial. 
Kayfetz handed Shelton the records she’d gotten from the prosecutors, and he spent those first few weeks combing through old police reports.
As he made his way through the documents, he found black-and-white copies of photographs the sheriff’s deputies had taken as they searched Happy Camp in the days after Willie’s disappearance: The chain-saw repair shop where the truck had been parked. The old bar across the street. And a building that looked as though it had recently burned down. It was familiar to Shelton, though he couldn’t initially place it.
Then one day, while he was staring at the photo, it clicked. It was the Headway Market, where Marshall said his mother had been shopping when he witnessed the kidnapping.
“There was no store,” Shelton said. “There was just ruins.” 
Shelton walked down the street to the Siskiyou County assessor’s office to pull records on the property. The market, he learned, had burned down a few months before Willie Cook was taken.

California is the birthplace of public defense. The nation’s first public defender office opened in Los Angeles in 1913. By the time the U.S. Supreme Court established in 1963 that defendants have the right to an attorney in state criminal proceedings, more than a dozen California counties were already providing free representation to poor people accused of crimes.
As the nation caught up, California slipped behind. The state kept its defender system entirely in the hands of its counties. Today, it is one of just two states — alongside Arizona — that don’t contribute any funding to trial-level public defense, according to the Sixth Amendment Center. The state does not monitor or evaluate the counties’ systems. There are no minimum standards, and for many defendants there are no investigations — even in the most serious cases.
Meanwhile, prosecutors have robust, in-house investigative teams. In Riverside, the district attorney has 30% more lawyers than the public defender but 500% more investigators, state data shows, in addition to the support of the county sheriff and various municipal police departments. This pattern repeats throughout the state. In what is supposed to be an adversarial legal system, indigent defendants and their attorneys are often on their own, facing an army of investigators who are working to secure a conviction. 
Hidden in that data is the greatest tragedy of failing to investigate cases: wrongful convictions. The National Registry of Exonerations is filled with cases in which convictions were overturned when someone finally looked into the prisoner’s claims, years or even decades after they were imprisoned. 
Hundreds of those cases are in California. In one exoneration out of Fresno, Innocence Project investigators found nine witnesses who corroborated their client’s alibi: He was more than 25 miles away at a birthday party at the time of the crime. In a recent case out of Los Angeles, investigators found evidence of their client’s innocence in a police detective’s handwritten notes, material that had been included in a file turned over to the defense before trial. If their cases had been investigated on the front end, these men might have been spared a combined 30 years in prison. 
Maurice Possley, the exoneration registry’s senior researcher, said that a failure to investigate is at the heart of most of the registry’s 3,600 cases.
When he looks at the evidence that overturned these convictions, he’s astounded the defense didn’t find it when the case was being prosecuted. 
“If someone had just made the effort,” he said. “This was all sitting there.”

Shelton was in his early 40s when he got the Nelson case. He had been living in Siskiyou for years, but he hadn’t shed his Southern California accent. He was soft-spoken, smiled often, and had the easy mannerisms of someone who had spent a lot of time at the beach. It didn’t take long for him to build a rapport with Nelson, and he visited him frequently at the Siskiyou County jail. Nelson told him he had no memory of the events that Marshall had recounted for the deputies. Those claims of innocence had sounded hollow to Shelton, but the picture of the burned market changed his thinking about the case. Now he wondered whether anything Marshall had said was true.

Detectives with the Siskiyou sheriff’s office had interviewed Marshall several times in October 2008, a month before they arrested Nelson. Kayfetz requested those recordings, and she and Shelton listened to the tapes.
In the first interview, Marshall initially hedged his words. When a detective asked him whether he saw Willie — who was Marshall’s cousin — on the day he was taken, he said that it “seemed like” he did. Then he said that he watched Nelson grab Willie and put him in the van, where another man was crouching in the passenger seat.
“You saw that?” the detective asked. 
“That was with my own eyes I saw that,” Marshall said. 
Minutes later, in a second accounting, Marshall added an accomplice — the woman who would later become Nelson’s wife slid the van door open and jumped inside before they drove off. Three days later, an additional woman appeared in the story — the wife’s sister — and the man in the passenger seat was gone. 
It was remarkable to Shelton that the detectives didn’t challenge Marshall on these discrepancies. Each time he told the story, he added details — the ice cream flavor, the face his brother made at him as he walked into the market.
When a detective asked whether Marshall had said anything to his mother when she came back, he replied that he had tried but that his brother was teasing him. “That’s why I just threw it aside,” he said. “Because my brother, he made me mad.” Marshall eventually told his mother what had happened, he said, but neither of them mentioned it to Cook when they joined the search party later that night.

A newspaper clipping related to the Willie Cook murder case from the Sept. 15, 1976 edition of the Sacramento Bee.
In a separate interview with detectives, Marshall’s mother corroborated his account. “I should have listened to him,” she said. “It was like he was trying to tell all of us that he had seen who took Willie. Is that possible? But nobody would believe him, because he was a little boy.”
In one of the recordings, the detectives alluded to some kind of legal trouble Marshall was facing. “You’re taking care of us, and we’re going to scratch your back in return,” a detective had promised him. 
During his fourth and final recorded interview with detectives, Marshall had something new to share: He wasn’t just a witness to Willie’s kidnapping. He was also a witness to his murder. Months after the kidnapping, Marshall said, he took a trip with his father to visit his grandparents on the Hoopa reservation, some 70 miles from Happy Camp. It was there, he said, while hiding behind a tree in the back of Nelson’s house, that he saw Nelson take Willie out of a locked van and heard him say, “This is the last time you’re going to even breathe air.”
“I’m standing right there, and I’m watching him from that tree,” he told a detective. “I’m watching him put his hands around that little boy and strangle him until that little boy was dead.”
The detective conducting the interview initially seemed alarmed by this change in the story. She told Marshall that her sergeant would need to speak with him “about the differences in your statement from the first time that we talked to you.” She left the room but came back alone. “I think you and I pretty much clarified everything,” she said. 
In her report, she wrote that Marshall had witnessed the murder “four or five days” after the kidnapping. That was an error — Marshall repeatedly said four or five months had passed between the kidnapping and the murder, according to a transcript of the interview. But that error would find its way into Nelson’s confession.
From Marshall’s testimony, police and prosecutors created their theory of the crime, interview transcripts and court filings show. They proposed Nelson was a pawn in a scheme hatched by his sister-in-law — one of the women Marshall named as an accomplice — who wanted to hurt Cook by taking his son. Maybe she had been jealous of his success. Maybe she wanted to avenge her husband, who had been tried, and later acquitted, for the murder of Cook’s brother. 

A newspaper clipping related to the Willie Cook murder case from the Feb. 23, 1977 edition of The Dunsmuir News. 
Nelson and his sister-in-law were both Native American. To Kayfetz, law enforcement’s assumption that they would kidnap and kill a child as an act of revenge, or in a fit of jealous rage, played into racial stereotypes and became the “underlying stench” of the case. 
The evidence had suggested that Willie was kidnapped by a sexual predator. His body was naked when it was discovered. Now law enforcement posited he was murdered in a family feud. 
Even Willie’s father initially had a hard time believing this theory. “I just can’t imagine that,” Cook told a detective in 2008. “Over something that stupid? My gut feeling is no.”
But the deputies were insistent. Eventually, Cook began to come around to the possibility that Nelson was the killer. 
Deputies exhumed Willie’s body, but it did not provide any new evidence. Far too much time had passed.
***
When Shelton began working on the case, he was shocked whenever he discovered that law enforcement had made a mistake, or that prosecutors had failed to turn over a key document. 
He would burst into Kayfetz’s office, saying, “You’re not gonna believe this!” And Kayfetz would tell him, dryly, “There’s no Santa or Easter Bunny, either.” 
He would soon lose that sense of disbelief. 
As the investigation progressed, Shelton became convinced that Marshall had invented most of his story. Marshall had given detectives the names of other potential witnesses, but those turned out to be dead ends. Still, Siskiyou’s district attorney, Kirk Andrus, seemed determined to move forward, and Nelson was losing hope. 
Then, one day, while he was looking through old police files, Shelton found a list of materials the deputies had entered into evidence in 1976. It included references to interviews they recorded with potential witnesses. Shelton scanned the list and saw Marshall’s name. The prosecution’s star witness had spoken to officers just days after Willie disappeared. If law enforcement still had access to these recordings, they hadn’t shared them with the defense.
When Kayfetz asked the district attorney’s office to turn over the evidence, the prosecutors said they didn’t have it. But Shelton learned the tapes from the case had recently been digitized and enhanced by the Justice Department, at the request of the Siskiyou detectives. Kayfetz filed a second motion to get the recordings. When the judge ordered the prosecutors to explain how the tapes had gone missing, they said that they had found them and that they had been lost on a detective’s desk, according to court documents.

Soon Kayfetz and Shelton were listening to Marshall, 10 years old, answering questions about the evening Willie disappeared. There was no ice cream. Marshall’s brother was not in the car, but his older sister was. Their mom didn’t go to the grocery store, but she did stop at a liquor store to buy a TV Guide. When they drove through the center of town, Marshall waved to Willie, who was sitting in his dad’s truck. 
“I said, ‘Hi, Willie,’ and he said ‘Hi’ back. And I said, ‘Where’s your dad?’ And he said, ‘He’s in the bar.’” When they drove by again, Willie was gone. 
“Am I allowed to go now?” Marshall asked the detective. 
In a separate interview that same day, Marshall’s mother corroborated her son’s account. Nobody mentioned Nelson. Nobody said anything about witnessing a kidnapping.
***
Shelton felt as though they were pulling a string and unraveling the district attorney’s case. 
He discovered that Marshall had a motive for becoming useful to law enforcement in the fall of 2008. He had violated the terms of his probation for a drunken-driving conviction and was facing prison, but police kept the violation off his record, Shelton said.
Kayfetz was encouraged by the evidence that was mounting in Nelson’s favor, but if the case went to trial, she would have to contend with the fact that he had confessed to the crime. 
She sent the footage of his interrogation to Richard Leo, a University of San Francisco law professor and one of the nation’s foremost experts on coerced confessions, and asked him to testify on Nelson’s behalf. She couldn’t afford his fee — she was already pushing the outer limits of her budget. And when she first reached out, Leo told her he didn’t have time to take on another case. But she begged him to watch the footage before he made up his mind.
Even now, almost 17 years later, he remembers how stunned he had been when he first saw it. Among the 2,400 cases he’s consulted on, he said, the Nelson case stands out as one of the most egregious examples of a coerced confession he has ever seen. He called it “a form of psychological torture.” 
“There’s a sequence to this — a long interrogation, lie to the suspect about evidence, attack the suspect’s denials, cause him to doubt his memory,” he said. “Sometimes you see this person denying and admitting at the same time: ‘I couldn’t have done this. I have no memory. You’re telling me I did this, maybe I did this.’”
Leo said Nelson was subjected to almost every tactic known to lead to a false admission of guilt. He agreed to do the case for a reduced fee — a “bro deal,” Kayfetz called it — in exchange for permission to include it in a future book.
More than 12% of the wrongful convictions listed on the National Registry of Exonerations involved false confessions. In a recent case in San Bernardino, police officers pushed a man to admit to killing his father after he called police to report him missing. During a marathon interrogation, officers told the man they had conclusive evidence of his guilt and got him to agree with a gruesome scenario that they had pulled, it seems, from thin air. A few hours after he confessed, police officers located the man’s father. He was alive and well.

In 2007, the Bureau of Justice Statistics conducted a census of the nation’s public defender offices. It found that 40% had no investigators on staff and that 93% failed to meet the National Association for Public Defense’s industry standard of at least 1 investigator for every 3 attorneys. 
The study made it clear that, across the country, investigators were seen as a luxury, not a necessity. CalMatters interviews with top public defenders in several states, along with recent reports examining indigent defense systems, suggest that’s still the case.
In Mississippi, only eight of the state’s 82 counties have public defender offices. The rest rely on private attorneys who are paid a flat fee — one that rarely covers the cost of an investigator. A 2018 report found that, in many Mississippi counties, with the exception of murder cases, the attorneys “never hire investigators and have no time to investigate cases themselves.” Appointed attorneys told researchers they would “get laughed out of court” for requesting additional funds for an investigator. 
Public defender systems that are funded and controlled by state legislatures also have severe investigator shortages. The head public defender in Arkansas, Gregg Parrish, said he has only 12 staff investigators, responsible for assisting in felony cases, including capital cases, in all of the state’s 75 counties. Minnesota’s top public defender, William Ward, said he is trying to maintain a ratio of at least 1 investigator for every 7 public defenders but knows that’s not enough. “I would rather have a great investigator and an average lawyer than an average investigator and a great lawyer,” he said. “Investigators make all the difference on a case.”
Colin Reingold remembers one case in particular from his time as a public defender in Louisiana’s Orleans Parish. His client was accused of breaking into a car, but he insisted he was entering the car to leave a note offering to do yard work.
Reingold sent an investigator to the car owner’s house, but there was no one home. His client had two prior felonies, and a car burglary would qualify him for a life sentence. When the prosecutor offered 10 years in exchange for a guilty plea, Reingold advised him to take the deal. But his client begged him to find the note, he said. 
That year, Orleans Parish had 65 public defenders and three investigators. The one assigned to the man’s case refused to give up. She tried for six weeks to find the car’s owner. In the week before the plea hearing, she stopped by his home almost daily. One evening, he answered the door. He said, “Oh yeah, I still have that note!”
Reingold presented the note as evidence, and his client was released from jail. 
It was, he said, a rare stroke of luck. “The scary thing is, we don’t know all the other times we’ve missed things like that.”

Just weeks before Nelson’s trial was set to begin, the prosecution was still turning over discovery materials. 
Shelton began to make his way through the latest batch. Many of the documents were familiar — duplicates of reports and transcripts he had already reviewed. But he stumbled on a few photographs, tucked into the file, that he hadn’t seen before. In the foreground of one of the pictures, leaning up against a trailer home, something caught his eye — a cardboard cylinder, not quite 2 feet tall. It looked just like the barrel in which Willie’s body was found. 
“Jesus Christ, man. That’s it right there,” he said to himself. “It was in their hands. They had it all along.”
The trailer belonged to a man who had lived in Happy Camp in the 1970s and whom everyone knew as Sonny. He washed trucks for a local logging company and lived on the owner’s property. Cook told police he had been on that property with Willie the day of the kidnapping, which is probably why the deputies photographed the area.
When Shelton went back to Happy Camp to learn more about Sonny, he discovered he had been arrested less than a year after Willie’s body was found, when a 5-year-old boy told his parents that Sonny had sexually abused him. The boy’s family had owned the logging company, and Sonny had been their employee. Prosecutors didn’t file charges, and Sonny was released.
According to documents Kayfetz filed with the court, the boy, who was in his late 30s when Nelson was arrested, had always wondered about the connection between Willie’s murder and his own abuse. His grandmother once told him she believed the cardboard barrel had come from their family’s property — she said it was a container for the detergent that Sonny used to wash the trucks.

He had recently searched for the Cook case online and was surprised to find that it had been reopened and that Nelson had been charged with the crime. He wondered: Did the police know about Sonny?
The local press had published a phone number for the Siskiyou detective’s bureau, urging people to come forward with relevant information about the crime. He called and left a message, but no one called him back. He called a second time and explained to a receptionist who he was and why he was calling. He was still waiting for a reply. 
Sonny did eventually go to prison for sexually abusing a child. A mother reported him to the police when she learned he had been molesting her son for years. She told investigators that after Sonny was sentenced, other boys came forward to say he had abused them as well, according to a statement filed in court. He died in 2001.
To Shelton, these discoveries seemed like “a game changer.” He shared the details with Kayfetz. “I was like, ‘This is done,’” he said.
But the jury would not get to see the photo of the barrel or hear from Sonny’s accusers. The prosecution fought to exclude the evidence, arguing it didn’t prove Sonny had ever met Willie, let alone had kidnapped and killed him. And the judge agreed.
“It never even made it to court,” Shelton said. “Our job was to create reasonable doubt. We never planned to solve this case and figure out who did kidnap Willie. But I think we did, and no one cared.” 
The case would radically alter Shelton’s beliefs about the justice system and his perception of how police and prosecutors operate. “I used to be on their team,” he said. “And when I worked for the defense I started to see that, you know, sometimes it’s more about winning than actual justice.” 
He began to view his job as “quality control” for law enforcement agencies.
“Some district attorneys are wonderful and they disclose everything,” he said. “They’re not all like that. And so, if you’re a defendant and you draw a dishonest attorney, well, is that it? Is your fate sealed?”
It would be, Shelton said, if you didn’t have anyone to look into your side of the story.

Over the past 20 years, California has introduced ambitious legislation aimed at reducing incarceration, earning the state a reputation as a leader in criminal justice reform. But those efforts are routinely undermined by California’s failure to provide defendants with a proper investigation of the charges against them. 
“That’s what’s so shocking — that it’s California,” said Goel, of the Sixth Amendment Center. “There’s perception, and then there’s reality. When will the state look in the mirror and see what it really is?”
Investigations affect every part of the criminal justice process. They’re not just about figuring out whether a client is innocent. Even if a case is moving toward a plea deal, an investigation can turn up information that forces a prosecutor to reduce the charge or compels a judge to grant bond or shorten a prison sentence. 
Lawyers are discouraged from interviewing witnesses on their own. If a witness later changed their story or disappeared before trial, the attorney might have to testify on their client’s behalf and recuse themself from the case. 
California lawmakers are considering a bill that could bolster defense investigations by eliminating flat-fee contracts. But it faces opposition from county officials, who say it would force them to increase their defense budgets without helping them pay for it. 
New York was once very similar to California. Its counties managed their own public defender systems, without much input or funding from the state, until a class-action lawsuit, settled in 2015, led to statewide changes. 
New York created an office tasked with improving public defense, eventually giving it some $250 million to dole out each year. Counties that take the money must prioritize certain aspects of public defense, including investigations. In a recent report to the agency overseeing the effort, these counties consistently said the ability to investigate cases was among the most profound impacts of the new funding. Some described specific cases that ended in acquittal or significantly reduced charges as a result.
California was also sued over claims it failed to provide competent defense. To settle the lawsuit, filed in Fresno County, Gov. Gavin Newsom in 2020 expanded the scope of the Office of the State Public Defender, which had previously handled death penalty appeals, to include support and training for county-based public defender systems.
But the governor committed only $10 million in one-time grants to the effort, and that money has since run out. 
***
Nelson’s trial began in September 2009. The case hinged on Marshall’s account and Nelson’s confession. Kayfetz built much of the defense on what Shelton had discovered. 
The jury deliberated for six days and could not come to a decision. Seven jurors believed Nelson was guilty of murder, and five did not. Six believed he had kidnapped Willie, the other six did not. The judge declared a mistrial. A few weeks later, Andrus, the district attorney, announced he was dismissing the charges against Nelson and his sister-in-law, whose kidnapping case was awaiting trial. 
In a press release, Andrus said it was “the most difficult and painful decision I have made in my professional career.” He told a news reporter that his office had a heavy caseload and didn’t have the staff to prosecute the case. Andrus noted that he could always refile the charges if new evidence emerged or a new witness came forward. 
Nelson was released, but he didn’t get to go home. He had to answer for the drugs he had on him at the time of his arrest and was sent to a Humboldt County jail. 
“I left here just to be interviewed, and 16 months later I got out,” Nelson said from his home in Hoopa. “They got their hook in me, and they kept it in me. There’s nothing you can do when you’re in that situation.”

Nelson said he’s certain he would be in prison if not for Shelton. “He believed what I told him,” he said. “Without that investigator, you don’t have a chance.”
Marshall and his mother have since died. 
Shelton retired from defense investigation last year. He was initially hesitant to talk about the Nelson case and insisted that he had only been doing his job. He said he doesn’t want to be the hero of a story that is still, at its core, a tragedy. “Imagine being Bill Cook,” he said. 
Although CalMatters was unable to reach Willie’s parents, a Facebook group dedicated to his memory, which has been inactive since 2016, includes posts from family members who express the belief that Nelson is guilty. 
That’s what compounds the tragedy of the case for Kayfetz.
“They took a decades-old bandage off of these people’s hearts and just ripped it off,” she said. “It’s every kind of miscarriage of justice.”
Last year, the Siskiyou public defender’s office finally got its first staff investigator. Kayfetz said she needed to “clone him.” She cobbled together funding from a couple of new grants to hire a second, who started earlier this year. But she said it’s still not enough. 
The Nelson case, she said, “rose and fell on the quality of the investigation.”
For his part, Andrus said he doesn’t believe Shelton’s work had much impact on the case. He said the prosecutors and sheriff’s deputies had always known that Marshall was “a compromised witness.” 
“There were so many nails in the coffin of Steve Marshall’s credibility that it didn’t need more,” he said. “He was not the kind of person that we would want to rely on in a murder case.” 
He said they had a duty to “look into his statement, see if we can corroborate it.” And Nelson had confessed. The other evidence they gathered, he acknowledged, “was not very strong.” 
They pushed the case forward anyhow. 

How we reported on California’s lack of public defense investigators
To report and write this story, CalMatters reviewed police reports, case files and other materials related to the kidnapping and murder of Willie Cook and the subsequent case against Gregory Nelson. We spoke with more than 45 people and made an effort to interview everyone who is named in the article. Some people have since died, could not be reached or declined our invitation. To quote people we could not speak with directly, including Bill Cook, Steve Marshall and Marshall’s mother, we relied on transcripts from recorded interviews with law enforcement.
CalMatters also analyzed staffing data, incarceration rates and caseloads for California’s 58 counties. We obtained this data from the California Department of Justice, the Judicial Council of California and the Vera Institute of Justice, as well as from court records.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/101324-The-Investigators-MG-CM-05.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-05 09:01:09.284234

It needs a reform that can retain its benefits and deal with its downsides.,"Guest Commentary written by

Nick Yost
Nick Yost created and formerly led the environmental section of the California Department of Justice. As general counsel of the Council on Environmental Quality under the Carter administration, he was lead draftsperson of National Environmental Policy Act regulations.


Daniel Yost
Daniel Yost is an attorney and the former mayor of Woodside. He was a founding board member of Peninsula Clean Energy.


In 1947, decades before the federal Clean Air Act, California’s leaders began regulating the causes of harmful air pollution. It was also our state that, in 2006 under Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, passed arguably the most aggressive greenhouse gas reduction law in the world, setting off a global race for climate action.
California’s leadership on the environment has a well-deserved reputation.
So it is with a great deal of pride, and no small amount of sadness, that a growing flaw in the California Environmental Quality Act, one of the principle legal mechanisms we use to protect clean air and water, conserve sensitive lands and habitats and address the pollution that causes climate change, is now cause for concern. 
CEQA, as its colloquially known, embodies the proposition that you should “look before you leap” on issues that could have negative environmental or public health impacts. The law’s core legal principle holds that decisionmakers should know the environmental consequences of their actions before taking them.
This purpose remains a worthy one. Unfortunately, over time CEQA has led to unfortunate and inadvertent consequences — in particular, it is commonly used to block much-needed housing in California. But the law is not only harmful in its use: The mere threat of a CEQA lawsuit is enough to stifle new housing developments since such suits can add substantial time, cost and risk for builders who already face daunting construction costs.
The dilemma is how to retain the beneficial essence of CEQA while dealing with the downsides. A bill in the California legislature deals with this and deserves support.
Assembly Bill 609 creates an exemption from CEQA for infill housing projects that are compliant with local laws and not in environmentally sensitive locations. “Building up” in urban locations reduces development pressure on open land in outlying areas. It also reduces commute times and reduces pollution.
As a father and son with lifetimes of experience in environmental causes, we write with some ambivalence. Decades ago, one of us was responsible for the emergence of CEQA as a “super statute,” drafting the amicus brief to the California Supreme Court in Friends of Mammoth v. Mono County — the bedrock case in which the court ruled CEQA extended a public “right of action” against private activity.
Some may view any changes to CEQA as a “camel’s nose under the tent,” inevitably leading to its demise. Our view is the opposite: Like all laws, CEQA derives its social license from its good-faith application. But when a bedrock environmental law is used to cause measurable environmental harm — for example, by displacing housing developments to agricultural and open lands — that undermines political support for the law.
Thoughtful reforms such as AB 609 can maintain CEQA’s core focus on environmental protection, while enabling housing to be built more quickly, cheaply and sustainably.
For those that view climate change as one of the key issues of our time, infill housing is a critical solution. For those that want to see California’s environmental values shape the nation, without cheaper housing, California will lose population and electoral power to other states. 
After the 2030 census, projections show that California could lose four congressional districts (and four electoral college votes), while states with cheaper housing, like Texas and Florida, stand to gain.
If reducing the cost of housing alone is not enough, then for those that care about the environment and climate change, there is plenty to love in the growing push to legalize more infill homes in our cities.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/080719_LosAngeles_AW_CM_61.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-05 09:01:09.284234

Highly publicized immigration raids have rattled the community and prompted lawmakers to push for more laws protecting immigrants.


Hospitals. Schools. Shelters.
Those are some of the places that California lawmakers want to shield from immigration arrests and raids. They advanced a package of bills this week as President Donald Trump’s administration continues its ramped-up deportation campaign around the country. 
The Democratic-dominated Legislature can’t block federal agents from entering places where someone has allowed them to be. They also can’t stop ICE from going where officers have the  legal authority to be, such as immigration courthouses. But the bills the state Senate passed Monday push local officials to limit cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and to require agents to get a warrant to enter. 
One bill would bar immigration agents from entering “nonpublic” parts of schools without a warrant. Another would do the same in hospitals, and prohibit health care providers from sharing patients’ immigration status with federal authorities unless they have a warrant. Another would limit immigration agents from accessing homeless or domestic violence shelters. 
Other bills limit information sharing. One would require California health departments, when issuing birth certificates, to shield the parents’ countries of birth from the publicly viewable portion of the document. Another would require cities and counties that license street vendors — a business dominated by immigrants — from sharing information about licensees with federal authorities.
Senate Majority Leader Lena Gonzalez, a Long Beach Democrat who authored the schools bill, said she was responding to a recent string of highly publicized raids and other enforcement operations that have rattled immigrant communities and threaten to send workers, students and patients into hiding.
ICE last week raided two San Diego restaurants in a search for workers allegedly living in the country illegally, setting off a confrontation with protesters outside. Immigration agents in April showed up trying to speak with students at two Los Angeles elementary schools; school administrators turned them away. That month they also detained a group of day laborers in the parking lot of a Pomona Home Depot. 
The lawmakers’ proposals sailed through the Legislature so far, and passed the Senate this week with near-unanimous support from Democrats. They now head to the Assembly.
“Every student, regardless of their immigration status, should be given the right to a free and fair education,” Gonzalez said.

Sen. Jesse Arreguin, a Berkeley Democrat who authored the hospitals bill, said it was “about making sure that people can access health care in California without fear of being arrested or deported.”
Though Republicans generally opposed the bills, some acknowledged they were concerned about the widespread fear sown by the sight of federal agents. For Republicans, the politics of a flashy GOP-led immigration crackdown remain delicate in California, where more than one in four residents is foreign-born. 
Sen. Marie Alvarado-Gil, a Modesto Republican, criticized Democrats for what she called overblowing “a problem that is very real” and said she was worried school officials would be stuck between state law and complying with federal agents’ requests or orders.
“I definitely believe we have a problem in this state, and we exacerbate that problem by continuing to instill fear in young people,” she said during debate about Gonzalez’ schools bill. “When we talk about ICE agents in masks and instill fear that way, we are doing a disservice to the educational system.”
Her Republican colleague Rosilicie Ochoa Bogh joined Democrats in voting for the bill limiting law enforcement access to schools. She opposed the other bills, including one requiring school officials to notify parents, staff and community members if immigration agents come to campus.
“When someone enters the school we always want to make sure they’re official,” the Redlands lawmaker said. “Putting in statute knowing and asking whether or not someone has a warrant or has an official capacity to enter the school, is really a no-brainer.”

California resists Trump’s immigration crackdown
Kevin Johnson, an immigration law professor and former dean of the UC Davis School of Law, said he expects the legislation, if enacted, would have a limited effect on ICE operations, given that the state is already engaged in a yearslong back-and-forth with the federal government over whether to cooperate with immigration authorities. 
The Departments of Justice and Homeland Security are both trying to withhold federal funding from California over its sanctuary law that prohibits state and local police from arresting immigrants on behalf of ICE, and limits their cooperation in transferring detainees to immigration custody. Federal courts upheld the law during the last Trump administration.
In his second term, Trump is further pushing the boundaries in an aggressive effort to curb both illegal and legal forms of immigration. That includes everything from rescinding a longstanding policy of avoiding arrests in “sensitive locations” such as churches, schools and hospitals, to arresting immigrants when they show up for required check-ins or immigration court hearings, to seeking to deny U.S. citizenship from immigrants’ American-born children.
The state may have the authority to shield babies’ parents’ birthplaces from public view, Johnson said, but he theorized that if the U.S. Supreme Court allows Trump to repeal birthright citizenship, the federal government could require people to show proof of their parents’ birthplace to become an American citizen. 
“They can only do so much to limit what the federal government can do,” Johnson said of the state. “We’re in the middle of a long, protracted skirmish between the state and federal governments on immigration.”
Still, he said, forcing federal agents to get warrants to search for or arrest someone could help immigrants feel safer going out in public. 
“We at least have to get the federal government to think about complying with the law, as opposed to just sending out hordes of ICE agents wherever,” he said.
Immigrant aid groups set to lose funding

The effort to protect vulnerable immigrants comes as California nonprofits are scrambling to respond to increased enforcement and competing for limited resources. 
California spends $60 million a year on immigration legal aid and in a special session in December gave that fund a one-time boost of $10 million. 
Some Democratic lawmakers this year have backed advocates’ requests to further increase that funding even as the state stares down a $12 billion budget deficit. Gov. Gavin Newsom has already proposed other cuts to immigrants’ social services to address the shortfall. 
One program that would run out of money without new funding is the Children’s Holistic Immigration Representation Project, a pilot program started in 2022 to provide lawyers and social workers for unaccompanied minors facing deportation.
Originally slated to last through summer 2024, the program has helped about 800 immigrants who arrived as children. The California Department of Social Services has kept it going with a one-time $4.2-million boost in money originally budgeted for other immigration legal services. That money will run out at the end of June.
This year, advocates and legal service providers say they’re not expecting there to be any extra money to go around. 
When California made $5 million of the legal aid funding available this year, organizations across the state applied for six times that amount, said Lisa Hoffman, co-executive director of the East Bay Sanctuary Covenant in Berkeley. 
Hoffman said state funding helps her nonprofit pay caseworkers and attorneys to represent 50 young immigrants between ages 17 and 22. The clients, many of whom fled violence in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, get help with their cases and assistance enrolling in school, securing transportation and going to the doctor. 
“By investing in these services now, it prevents much more serious, longer-term problems,” she said. “Even if they are allowed to stay, but they drop out of school or don’t get the support they need, it’s going to create much bigger and more expensive problems down the road in terms of homelessness, mental health challenges.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/120224_Deportation-Protest_FG_CM_05.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-05 09:01:09.284234
,California,2025-06-05 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,California is failing to provide a vital safeguard against wrongful convictions,Anat Rubin,,,,,https://calmatters.org/investigation/2025/06/public-defense-investigators-takeaways/,"If you’re accused of a crime, will someone investigate your side of the story? In California, there’s no guarantee.","A CalMatters investigation has found that poor people accused of crimes, who account for at least 80% of criminal defendants, are routinely convicted in California without anyone investigating the charges against them. 
Close to half of California’s 58 counties do not employ any full-time public defense investigators. Among the remaining counties, defendants’ access to investigators fluctuates wildly, but it’s almost always inadequate.
The cost of this failure is steep, for individual defendants and for the integrity of California’s criminal justice system.
Defense investigators interview witnesses, visit crime scenes, review police reports and retrieve video surveillance footage that might prove the defendant was on the other side of town when a crime was committed, or that an assault was an act of self-defense. They do work that most lawyers are not trained to do. Without them, police and prosecutorial misconduct — among the most common causes of wrongful convictions — remain unchecked, significantly increasing the likelihood that people will go to prison for crimes they did not commit.
In our new investigation, we examine the consequences of this pervasive issue through a reopened kidnapping and murder case in Northern California’s Siskiyou County.
Here are the takeaways:
1. Of the 10 California counties with the highest prison incarceration rates, eight have no defense investigators on staff. 
The lack of investigators affects counties throughout the state, from poor, rural areas like Siskiyou to the state’s largest and most well-funded public defense offices. 
Los Angeles employed just 1 investigator for every 10 public defenders — one of the state’s worst ratios, according to 2023 data from the California Department of Justice. Only seven California counties met the widely accepted minimum standard of 1 investigator for every 3 attorneys.

2. The situation is most alarming in the 25 California counties that don’t have dedicated public defender offices and pay private attorneys. 
Most of these private attorneys receive a flat fee for their services, and the cost of an investigator would eat away at their profits. Some counties allow contracted attorneys to ask the court for additional funds for investigations, but court records show the attorneys rarely make those requests. 
In Kings County, which has one of the highest prison incarceration rates in California, contracted attorneys asked the court for permission to hire an investigator in 7% of criminal cases from 2018 to 2022. In Lake County, attorneys made those requests in just 2% of criminal cases over a three-year period; in Mono County, it was less than 1%. To earn a living from meager county contracts, research shows, private attorneys and firms must persuade defendants to accept plea deals as quickly as possible. An investigation is an expensive delay.
3. Prosecutors have an overwhelming advantage when it comes to investigator staffing. 
In Riverside, the district attorney has 30% more lawyers than the public defender but 500% more investigators, state data shows, in addition to the support of the county sheriff and various municipal police departments. 
This pattern repeats throughout the state. In what is supposed to be an adversarial legal system, indigent defendants and their attorneys are often on their own, facing an army of investigators who are working to secure a conviction.

4. Hidden in the data is the greatest tragedy of failing to investigate cases: wrongful convictions. 
The National Registry of Exonerations is filled with cases in which convictions were overturned when someone finally looked into the prisoner’s claims, years or even decades after they were imprisoned. 
Hundreds of those cases are in California. In one exoneration out of Fresno, Innocence Project investigators found nine witnesses who corroborated their client’s alibi: He was more than 25 miles away at a birthday party at the time of the crime. In a recent case out of Los Angeles, investigators found evidence of their client’s innocence in a police detective’s handwritten notes, material that had been included in a file turned over to the defense before trial. If their cases had been investigated on the front end, these men might have been spared a combined 30 years in prison. 
Maurice Possley, the exoneration registry’s senior researcher, said that a failure to investigate is at the heart of most of the registry’s 3,681 cases.
When he looks at the evidence that overturned these convictions, he’s astounded the defense didn’t find it when the case was being prosecuted. 
“If someone had just made the effort,” he said. “This was all sitting there.”
5. California, once a leader in public defense, has fallen far behind.
The nation’s first public defender office opened in Los Angeles in 1913. By the time the U.S. Supreme Court established in 1963 that defendants have the right to an attorney in state criminal proceedings, more than a dozen California counties were already providing free representation to poor people accused of crimes.
As the nation caught up, California slipped behind. The state kept its defender system entirely in the hands of its counties. Today, it is one of just two states — alongside Arizona — that don’t contribute any funding to trial-level public defense, according to the Sixth Amendment Center. The state does not monitor or evaluate the counties’ systems. There are no minimum standards and, for many defendants, no investigations — even in the most serious cases.
Investigations affect every part of the criminal justice process. They’re not just about figuring out whether a client is innocent. Even if a case is moving toward a plea deal, an investigation can turn up information that forces a prosecutor to reduce the charge or compels a judge to grant bond or shorten a prison sentence. 
Lawyers are discouraged from interviewing witnesses on their own. If a witness later changed their story or disappeared before trial, the attorney could have to testify on their client’s behalf and recuse themself from the case. 
6. This is a national problem.
In 2007, the Bureau of Justice Statistics conducted a census of the nation’s public defender offices. It found that 40% had no investigators on staff and that 93% failed to meet the National Association for Public Defense’s industry standard of at least 1 investigator for every 3 attorneys. 
The study made it clear that, across the country, investigators were seen as a luxury, not a necessity. CalMatters interviews with top public defenders in several states, along with recent reports examining indigent defense systems, suggest that’s still the case.
In Mississippi, only eight of the state’s 82 counties have public defender offices. The rest rely on private attorneys who are paid a flat fee — one that rarely covers the cost of an investigator. A 2018 report found that, in many Mississippi counties, with the exception of murder cases, the attorneys “never hire investigators and have no time to investigate cases themselves.” Appointed attorneys told researchers they would “get laughed out of court” for requesting additional funds for an investigator. 
Public defender systems that are funded and controlled by state legislatures also have severe investigator shortages. The head public defender in Arkansas, Greg Parrish, said he has only 12 staff investigators, responsible for assisting in felony cases, including capital cases, in all of the state’s 75 counties. Minnesota’s top public defender, William Ward, said he is trying to maintain a ratio of at least 1 investigator for every 7 public defenders but knows that’s not enough. “I would rather have a great investigator and an average lawyer than an average investigator and a great lawyer,” he said. “Investigators make all the difference on a case.”
7. New York stands as a model of how to reform the system. 
New York was once very similar to California. Its counties managed their own public defender systems, without much input or funding from the state, until a class-action lawsuit, settled in 2015, led to statewide changes. 
New York created an office tasked with improving public defense, eventually giving it some $250 million to dole out each year. Counties that take the money must prioritize certain aspects of public defense, including investigations. In a recent report to the agency overseeing the effort, these counties consistently said the ability to investigate cases was among the most profound impacts of the new funding. Some described specific cases that ended in acquittal or significantly reduced charges as a result.
California was also sued over claims it failed to provide competent defense. To settle the lawsuit, filed in Fresno County, Gov. Gavin Newsom in 2020 expanded the scope of the Office of the State Public Defender, which had previously handled death penalty appeals, to include support and training for county-based public defender systems.
But the governor committed only $10 million in one-time grants to the effort, and that money has since run out.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/100923_CARE-Court_AH_CM_06.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-05 09:01:09.284234

(Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)An effort to mitigate devastating flooding in Ellicott City is moving forward with the announcement of two $5 million loans to complete projects that will divert storm-driven flash flooding away from downtown Ellicott City businesses.
The $10 million in loans are the first of from a state account created in 2021. In Ellicott City, the money will go toward two projects designed to move tens of thousands of gallons of floodwater per second off Main Street.
State and county officials are already looking to other projects, even as its ability to secure federal loans and disaster recovery aid remains uncertain.
“At a time when we’re watching the federal government cancel supports for emergency management and telling states and local jurisdictions that if tragedy happens, you are now on your own, in Maryland, we’re choosing to move differently and actually invest in our local jurisdictions, both in preparation and also in recovery,” Gov. Wes Moore said Wednesday as he toured the site.
Officials said the projects could be duplicated in other areas prone to similar floods including an area of western Maryland ravaged last month by flood waters.
“It’ll be used 100% here” in Maryland, said Department of Emergency Management Secretary Russ Strickland. “It’s not dependent on federal money, which, right now, obviously, we’re in a very uncomfortable situation with Washington.”
In January, President Donald Trump called for eliminating the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and FEMA in April said it was canceling funding for the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities, or BRIC, program. The move hit funding earmarked for fiscal years 2020-2023, putting roughly $1 billion in projects approved in the Chesapeake Bay watershed in jeopardy.
Scores of federal lawmakers — Republicans and Democrats — have called for BRIC funding to be restored.
The Ellicott City projects, meanwhile, will proceed with state money.

Tunneling equipment — a 300-foot long device nicknamed “Rocky” — is expected to begin cutting a channel a mile long and 18-feet wide through granite 150 feet below ground. It will stretch from the west end of Ellicott City and terminate at the Patapsco River, with the capacity to move 26,000 gallons of water per second from downtown Ellicott City to the river.
A second project, called the Maryland Avenue Culvert, will move water from the Tiber-Hudson branch to the Patapsco River.
The two projects are part of a massive effort to make the historic mill city prone to flooding more resilient.
The county is coupling the projects with water retention ponds. Three ponds, with a combined capacity of over 12 million gallons, are already been built. Others remain in the design phase.
Howard County Executive Calvin Ball (D) called it “the single largest public works project” in county history.
“When complete, these projects will work together to reduce the quantity and the velocity of water on Main Street during major flooding events, and make Ellicott City a national, if not international, model of resiliency,” Ball said.
Moore said the projects will “save lives … but also help save the community and will also help save the state money.”
“Because, you know, what’s more expensive than preparing for the next big flood? Having to recover from the next big flood — immeasurably more expensive,” he said.
Moore said every dollar spent on flood mitigation saves taxpayers “an average of $6 in return when it comes to recovery costs.”
Flood-prone Ellicott City has seen three major events since 2011, including what was called a once in a 1,000-year storm in 2016, when flooding along Main Street damaged buildings and killed two people. Two years later, another storm dumped 8 inches of rain in two hours on Ellicott City.
The floods resulted in plans to make the area more flood-resilient, demolition of some buildings, debris clean up after big storms, an alert system, automated gates to high-ground areas and the stormwater retention ponds and diversion systems.
Initial cost estimates of $82 million in 2019 had grown to $130 million four years later due to costs of expanding the project — most notably the north tunnel project — and  “external economic factors,” including inflation. But the project also grew more expensive as officials widened the diameter by 20% and more than tripled its length to a mile.
FEMA cancels $1 billion for flood prevention projects in Chesapeake Bay region

Money for the project comes from a revolving loan fund created in 2021.
“Even as we were fighting for Ellicott City, we realized that this was a bigger problem than this one town and the rest of the state could learn from us,” said Sen. Katie Fry Hester (D-Howard and Montgomery), who sponsored the Resilient Maryland Revolving Loan Fund and who was at Wednesday’s event.
She said the Northeast has seen “a 70% increase in extreme rainfall since the 1950s and the Chesapeake Bay could rise by five feet, by 2050. I’ve seen some horrible projections where we’re looking at $19 billion worth of damage if we do not invest. But that is not what we’re doing, because we are being proactive.”
The $10 million in loans for the Ellicott City project are about half the state’s revolving account. Strickland said so far there has been little competition for the money.
Jurisdictions that use the money agree to pay it back over time. Strickland said a repayment agreement with Howard County has not been finalized.
Del. Courtney Watson (D-Howard) said Wednesday the projects in Ellicott City could be a model for other parts of the state.
“We were lucky enough to be the first to be able to put these policies in place, to be able to figure it out, to do something that’s never been done before, to solve a tedious, complex public infrastructure project and puzzle for threats that didn’t exist 20 years ago,” Watson said.
“We hope to model and assist other jurisdictions who are facing the same type of problems, such as Westernport,” she said.
More than 5 inches of rain fell in Allegany and Garrett Counties on May 14, triggering flash floods that overwhelmed roads, schools and homes, and damaged utilities. Areas including Westernport and Lonaconing were some of the hardest hit. Moore declared a state of emergency in the region — an early step toward seeking aid from FEMA.
Strickland said initial damage estimates could be completed as early as next week. The threshold for seeking federal aid comes in at around $12 million, he said.
“I think we’re going to meet that,” Strickland said.
Strickland said he’s “cautiously optimistic” that federal aid will still come through, but is also looking at contingency plans. One such plan would use money from the state’s disaster recovery fund as well as a catastrophic event fund.
When asked if the funds could cover the potential $12 million in damages, Strickland said: “I think it would be very close.”

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)President Donald Trump recently signed a resolution expanding motorized access to remote regions surrounding Lake Powell. 
The resolution — sponsored by Utah Republican Rep. Celeste Maloy — overturns a policy from the National Park Service that limits where off-road vehicles can drive in parts of Glen Canyon National Recreation Area. 
Under the rule, which was implemented during the Biden administration, conventional vehicles were still allowed to travel existing routes within the recreation area. But about 25 roads amounting to roughly 26 miles were closed to specialized off-road vehicles, like dirtbikes, ATVs or side-by-sides. 
Maloy and other members of Utah’s congressional delegation say the resolution allows for greater recreation opportunities in the area, and criticized the Biden-era rule for going against the will of locals. Opponents to the resolution, which included Democrats in Congress and a number of environmental groups, argue that expanding vehicle access could cause severe damage to the region’s most sensitive and pristine environments.
“Orange Cliffs, Gunsight Butte, and Canyonlands National Park’s Maze District will be impaired by noisy, destructive off-highway vehicles. It’s a dark day for all who love Southern Utah and Glen Canyon’s wild places.’’ said Hanna Larsen, a staff attorney for the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, in a statement last month.

The resolution, which passed the House in April, the Senate in May and was signed by Trump on May 23, invokes the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to review and overturn federal rules.
It’s the latest in nearly two decades of political back-and-forth over motorized recreation in Glen Canyon. 
For years, environmental groups criticized the National Park Service for its loose regulation of off-road vehicles around the recreation area. In 2005, groups sued over the lack of enforcement. In  2008, the service settled and agreed to create an off-road vehicle management plan. 
Then in 2021, the first Trump administration released a new plan that opened up much of the recreation area to all kinds of motorized use. 
The Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance sued two years later, arguing the administration’s plan failed to take all of the environmental impacts into consideration. The National Park Service settled again, agreeing to close the Lake Powell shoreline to motorized use, unless water levels were “sustainable.” It also put restrictions on ATV and side-by-side use in certain areas.
In January, the park service rule officially went into effect. Maloy said in a statement Tuesday that her resolution was a result of constituent concerns over the rule’s “nonsensical restrictions on motorized access.”
“We took legislative action and, through this (Congressional Review Act), reversed a rule pushed through by the previous administration. Utahns shouldn’t be shut out of decisions that affect their own backyard. Now we can continue to recreate in the National Recreation Area. Thank you to our Senators for working with me to get this done for Utah,” Maloy said.

Utah’s two Republican senators, Mike Lee and John Curtis, also celebrated the resolution becoming law. Curtis called it an “an important step to ensure our public lands remain open to the people.” Lee said it makes it clear that “environmental groups don’t get to dictate our National Recreation Areas through backroom deals.” 
“This was a classic case of sue-and-settle policymaking where bureaucrats caved to activists and cut Americans out of the process. That’s not how representation is supposed to work,” Lee said in a statement. “I’m proud President Trump signed this CRA into law.” 
Managed by the National Park Service, Glen Canyon National Recreation Area was formed in 1972 and borders several national parks and monuments, like Bears Ears, Capitol Reef and Canyonlands. It covers Lake Powell, the second-largest reservoir in the country, which attracts millions of visitors each year. In 2023, the service recorded more than 4.7 million visits.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/020225_Lake-Powell_16-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-05 08:09:34.853824

(Alander Rocha/Alabama Reflector)The Alabama State Employees’ Insurance Board (SEIB) has narrowed its search for a CEO to three finalists from an initial pool of 49 individuals.
Members of the SEIB executive committee on Wednesday laid out a timeline for the final selection process, which started after William Ashmore, the board’s outgoing CEO of SEIB, which oversees health insurance for state employees, announced his retirement in March. The three remaining candidates were selected after initial screenings and interviews conducted by ITAC Solutions, a Birmingham-based recruiting firm, based on criteria established by the board, including leadership and industry experience.
“I believe that the list does reflect a strong group of individuals who will align competencies,” said Charles Baughman, a consultant with ITAC Solutions, which conducted the candidate search for the board.

After the meeting, Ashmore said that “as far as (he knows),” Sally Corley, chief operating officer of the board, was one of the three candidates selected to interview for the position. Corley has worked for the board since 2013 and was the board director of government affairs before becoming COO.
“With her 12 years of experience (with SEIB), she was one of the most qualified internal candidates we had,” Ashmore said after the meeting, adding that she expressed interest in the position.
Corley would be the first woman to lead the board. Prior to Ashmore’s tenure as CEO, which started in 1988, the board was under the Retirement Systems of Alabama and led by CEO David Bronner.
Corley said in a text message that she applied for the position but still did not know if she was a finalist.
The selection process will proceed as follows:

Finalist information will be presented to the board chair for distribution to the full board, allowing members to review the materials and prepare questions.
The executive committee will interview the candidates in an open meeting on June 16, using questions submitted in advance by the full board.
At the end of the June 16 meeting, the executive committee will vote to select their preferred candidate and present that recommendation to the full board.
The full board will convene on June 18 to hold a final vote on whether to accept or reject the executive committee’s recommendation.

Ashmore said during the meeting that his timeline for retirement is flexible to allow a smooth transition. A new hire could potentially start as soon as July 1, but the board agreed that an external candidate, especially one from out of state, may need at least a month after being hired.
“If the need is not there, then I’ll go ahead and retire on July 1,” Ashmore said.

,California,2025-06-05 12:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,"California’s deficit dilemma: Cut spending, borrow money or raise taxes?",Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/06/california-budget-deficit-dilemma/,"Gov. Gavin Newsom estimated there's a nearly $20 billion hole in the budget, but if lawmakers restore his Medi-Cal cuts the hole could grow $10 billion larger.","The California Legislature has just a few days to pass a 2025-26 state budget to meet the state constitution’s June 15 deadline.
The deadline will be met, if for no other reason than legislators would, at least theoretically, have their salaries suspended were they to miss it.
However, the budget they enact may bear only a passing resemblance to what will eventually, perhaps many months later, become a complete fiscal plan.
The revised budget that Gov. Gavin Newsom proposed a month ago projects that general fund tax revenues for the year would be about $20 billion short of covering the spending that he has proposed — and that’s after counting the billions of dollars in reductions, primarily in health care and other services for the poor, he’s asked the Legislature to swallow. 
Newsom would roll back expansions that he and legislators happily enacted when they erroneously believed the state had a huge surplus. Newsom now says the cuts are necessary to balance the budget — although it would still have, by his own numbers, the $20 billion gap between income and outgo that he would cover with temporary fixes, such as on- and off-the-books borrowing, tapping emergency reserves and accounting gimmicks. He plans to tap $7.1 billion from the budget rainy day fund, bringing the shortage closer to $12 billion. 
So that’s the dilemma. Newsom and legislators are getting very heavy pressure from advocates for the endangered services, such as Medi-Cal coverage for undocumented immigrants, to back off. However, restoring them in the budget would cost about $10 billion, thus increasing the state’s chronic deficit and requiring either reductions in other spending categories or more short-term patches.
The dilemma’s large amounts of money, uncertainty about the effects of President Donald Trump’s tariffs and proposed federal spending reductions — and ideological divisions among Capitol Democrats over what to do — all point to the passage of a paper budget to meet the constitutional deadline while debate and negotiations continue indefinitely.
Underlining the situation is an acknowledgement by the administration, backed up by the Legislature’s budget analyst, Gabe Petek, that the hole in the budget is what’s called a “structural deficit,” meaning that spending now on the books is $10 to $20 billion a year higher than expected revenues.
Petek’s office has calculated that since Newsom became governor in 2019, spending has risen by an average of 9% a year while revenues have increased by just 6% a year, and if the gap continues, the state’s debt from borrowing could reach $42 billion within a few years.
The bottom line of all these numbers is that no matter what they do on this budget, it will continue to leak red ink until there is a day of reckoning.
There is another way out of the conundrum if the Capitol’s politicians want to take it — raise taxes.
Labor unions, advocates of health care and social programs and the most left-leaning members of the Legislature want to do it. Various taxation schemes are floating around the Capitol, mostly suggesting raising taxes on corporations to avoid directly taxing voters.
In its recent review of the state’s budget situation, Petek’s office raises the tax increase alternative, saying it “ultimately is a difficult judgment call for the Legislature” with political consequences as well as financial ones.
Newsom — who’s clearly looking ahead to what he’ll do after his governorship ends 19 months hence — has repeatedly rejected tax increases, preferring to get through each year with short-term fixes.
Moreover, increasing corporate taxes would amplify the state’s image as having an extraordinarily difficult and expensive business climate.
Will Democrats, who have complete control over the state finances, bite the bullet by either rolling back spending or increasing taxes, or will they, as former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger was fond of saying, merely “kick the can down the road?”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/121923_MediCal-Expansion_LJ_CM_06.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-05 08:09:34.853824

A message seeking comment from Shaw was left Wednesday morning.
Dunham and her husband had their daughter Aria through in-vitro fertilization (IVF), which they had to seek outside of Alabama. The Alabama Supreme Court ruled in February 2024 that frozen embryos outside the womb are “children,” which caused fertility clinics in the state to close.
“No family should have to leave their home state to pursue the dream of parenthood,” she said. “I know what it means to desperately want a child, to fight for that chance, and to finally hold that miracle in your arms. That empathy drives my career, my faith and my life, and it’s why I’m stepping up now.”
Associate Justice Jay Mitchell, who wrote the majority opinion in the ruling, is running for Alabama attorney general in 2026.
Lawmakers quickly passed a bill in March 2024 intended to provide the clinics immunity, and most services resumed. The bill did not address the court ruling that frozen embryos were unborn children.
Dunham is currently a referee in Jefferson County’s Juvenile Court and an attorney at Magic City Fertility Law, helping couples navigate the legal complexities of assisted reproduction, according to the release. As a referee, Dunham conducts hearings and makes findings like a judge would, but her decisions are not final.

After a pandemic-era pause, repayments on defaulted student loans restarted last month, and many borrowers are running into barriers. (Photo by Seth Wenig/The Associated Press)Over the past few months, Celina Damian’s phone has been ringing off the hook with one bewildered, anxious question after another: “What kind of loan is this?” “Am I in default?” “Will the government really take my wages?”
“Sometimes they just don’t know where to start,” said Damian, California’s student loan servicing ombudsperson.
“I’m talking to borrowers from all ages, from new borrowers to — I have 80-, 90-year-old borrowers,” she said.
The federal government last month restarted collections on defaulted loans. State student loan ombudspersons such as Damian have become some of the only sources of contact for worried borrowers lost in a tangle of information about their loan status and repayment options.
The U.S. Department of Education began collecting on defaulted student loans in May for the first time since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020.
Federal student loans issued by the U.S. Department of Education come with fixed rates, set repayment plans and borrower protections. Private servicers handle billing, repayment-plan enrollments and defaults.
More than 5 million borrowers are in delinquency, and nearly 10 million — about 25% of the federal student loan portfolio — are at risk of default within months, according to data from the U.S. Department of Education.
States can’t cancel that debt, but they do register and oversee servicers operating in their states, run ombuds offices, tweak tax rules and offer outreach or limited grants — actions aimed at reducing defaults and the economic fallout.
Universities try 3-year degrees to save students time, money

When borrowers default, states will likely feel the economic impact. They might lose tax revenue as homebuying stalls. They could end up paying more for Medicaid and social services if borrowers need to rely on them.
A borrower is considered delinquent after missing a payment to the servicing companies that handle billing, repayment plan enrollments, and defaults. After 90 days without a payment, the delinquency will be reported to credit bureaus. For two types of loans, they go into default after 270 days —about nine months — without a payment.
Damian’s office, established under California’s Student Borrower Bill of Rights, began as a narrow statutory role but now serves as a hub for outreach, “Student Loan 101” workshops and escalated complaints to federal agencies.
Roughly 16 states plus the District of Columbia have followed suit, creating ombuds offices to guide borrowers through confusing paperwork and misinformation. Damian believes these ombuds offices should be in every state, as borrowers across the country will likely have similar questions.
“If you don’t have an ombudsperson or even just a person at the state level who can educate borrowers, that will make a difference,” Damian told Stateline. “These borrowers are trying to pay, but the system is broken. No other financial product works this way.”
Student loans became a key issue during last year’s election race, with President Joe Biden blocked by the U.S. Supreme Court in his effort to cancel or reduce $400 billion worth of debt for 43 million Americans. His administration did, however, forgive loans for millions under other programs.
That includes nearly 48,000 South Carolinians who got their debts reduced or wiped out, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
Biden’s already reduced SC student loans by $2.6B. Clyburn hopes newest plan secures more votes.

But President Donald Trump opposes most loan forgiveness programs, and in May, the U.S. Education Department issued a “Dear Colleague” letter to higher education institutions, reminding them of their legal obligations to help former students understand repayment responsibilities and access support.
Some conservative economists say that federal loan forgiveness and financial aid hurt all students, offering colleges an incentive to raise tuition or lower their own institutional aid.
Winston Berkman-Breen, the legal director at the Student Borrower Protection Center, a nonprofit aimed at protecting borrowers and improving the repayment system, said that more than 2 million borrowers are stuck in a backlog of unprocessed applications for income-driven repayment (IDR) plans — calculated pay structures meant to keep payments affordable based on a borrower’s income.
Other borrowers have called federal agencies for help only to find that U.S. Education Department staff, including servicer-oversight teams, have been laid off as the Trump administration works toward dismantling the department entirely.
“There was an expectation to repay,” Berkman-Breen said. “But there was also an expectation that people would have access to affordable plans. That promise has broken down.”
States now have three primary tools to address student loan debt, Berkman-Breen said: enforcement actions to protect consumers, such as the 39-state lawsuit against servicer Navient; legal oversight by suing to uphold or challenge federal policy; and direct outreach to help public servants access Public Service Loan Forgiveness and similar programs.
Nineteen states now require registration for companies that service student loans, he said. And more than a dozen states align with federal policy to exempt forgiven loan balances from state income taxes.
 ‘Can’t wait for Washington’

Connecticut state Rep. Eleni Kavros DeGraw, a Democrat, calls student debt “a drag on the economy,” and said states can’t afford to wait for Congress — mired in partisan gridlock over student loan forgiveness — to find common ground.
“[Student debt] is stopping people from buying homes, starting families and fully participating in the economy,” she told Stateline. “That hurts us as a state, as a city, and we can’t wait for Washington to figure it out.”
Last year, Connecticut created a bipartisan reimbursement program that provides up to $20,000 for graduates of local colleges who make payments and complete community service. The state has distributed more than $2 million so far.
These South Carolinians owed more than $120,000 in student loans. Now their debt is forgiven.

Kavros DeGraw hopes the program can serve as a model, and has already talked with lawmakers in other states on possibly developing their own versions of it.
“These were people who were already paying,” Kavros DeGraw said. “It just made sense. I think it’s something that other states could explore this session, and it would provide an immense deal of relief.”
Lawmakers in other states also have considered student loan legislation. This year, New Jersey introduced bills to register education lenders and cap interest rates. Lawmakers in New Mexico, New York and North Carolina have proposed Borrower Bill of Rights legislation. Arizona has a registration bill for private servicers. None of these measures has advanced far.
According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, more than 20 states have enacted laws expanding loan forgiveness, repayment programs and servicer oversight in recent years.
Several states are also investing directly in workforce-aligned loan forgiveness: Georgia expanded its service-cancelable loan program to cover dental students working in rural areas. Idaho created a loan repayment incentive for rural nurses. Kentucky now offers $5,000 stipends to attract new teachers. Maryland authorized Anne Arundel County to launch a local forgiveness program for public school educators.
 Repayment

Student loan stress is not evenly distributed. Seven states, all with Republican‐controlled legislatures, report delinquency rates above 30% among borrowers required to make payments.
Mississippi leads the nation with a conditional delinquency rate of nearly 45% — meaning borrowers who should be making payments are late. That’s just ahead of Alabama, West Virginia, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana, all of which have rates above 31%, according to recent data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
By contrast, Illinois, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Vermont and New Hampshire maintain delinquency rates below 15%.
Experts say this chasm reflects deeper systemic differences, such as lower median incomes in higher delinquency states, along with weaker consumer protections and a higher share of students attending for-profit institutions or leaving college without a degree.
States also have promoted the federal Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, established in 2007, that offers help to public service professionals. New Mexico has an outreach campaign that includes prospective teachers and health care workers. Maine has provided guidance to public defenders on how they can take advantage of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program and touts a related state tax credit on a marketing site to lure new residents.
Scholarship program that enables debt-free college now available in 13 SC counties

“States can regulate and enforce, but they can’t fix the structural problems in how repayment is administered,” said Michele Zampini, senior director of college affordability at The Institute for College Access & Success, a research organization that advocates for students. “They’re helping around the edges, but the core system is still broken.”
A November report from the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau found at least 3.9 million borrowers received misleading or inaccurate bills from servicing companies.
“The repayment system is not in a good place to provide the services and repayment options borrowers are legally entitled to,” Zampini said.
The Student Loan Borrower Survey, conducted between October 2023 and January 2024, found that 61% of borrowers who received debt relief made a beneficial life change earlier than they otherwise could have. Yet borrower awareness remains dangerously low: Nearly 42% of federal borrowers have only been on the standard repayment plan, and 31% of those didn’t know other options, such as an income-based plan, existed.
In California, a major part of Damian’s job in the past few months has been to help borrowers access existing forgiveness programs.
Meanwhile, new federal policy proposals could reshape repayment entirely. The Trump-backed One Big Beautiful Bill Act would consolidate existing IDR plans into a single tiered structure, with lower-income borrowers paying flat monthly rates and higher earners contributing 8% of their income. The bill also proposes extending standard repayment terms to 30 years — raising concerns it could delay forgiveness and inflate total interest costs.
The bill passed the U.S. House and is pending in the Senate.
 ‘Incentive to hike prices’

Andrew Gillen, a Cato Institute research fellow who recently testified before Congress, argues that any meaningful fix must address the incentives driving rising tuition — namely, federal aid being tied directly to college sticker prices.
“The link between rising tuition and increasing aid is what drives the Bennett Hypothesis, where federal student aid, in the form of loans, can lead to higher tuition costs at colleges and universities,” Gillen said in an interview. “If we instead use the median cost of attendance to calculate aid eligibility, we remove colleges’ incentive to hike prices just to capture more aid.”
Even without agreement on blanket forgiveness, experts agree on smaller bipartisan steps: streamlined repayment, stronger servicer oversight and targeted help for borrowers with the greatest need.
“We don’t want people defaulting. We don’t want payments that are too high for people just out of school. That should be the bipartisan starting point,” Zampini said.

Melanie Scheible took the lead on negotiating with Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo's office on his crime bill. (Photo: Jeniffer Solis/Nevada Current)In the end, Gov. Joe Lombardo’s wide-ranging crime bill to stiffen penalties for DUI offenses, retail theft, and crimes on the Las Vegas Strip died because the Nevada State Legislature simply ran out of time.
In the final hours of the session, the state Senate and Assembly passed slightly different versions of Senate Bill 457 with overwhelming bipartisan support, but the Senate was forced to adjourn before it could take a second vote to approve the last-minute amendments added by the Assembly.
Its death underscores the risk of rushing complex public policy through the legislative process at the last minute.
The bill was first introduced in early April, but it was only in the final five days of the session that the policy was publicly debated, amended, amended again, and voted on. As it raced toward the finish line, there were myriad unanswered questions around the fiscal cost of implementing the bill, as well as the interpretation of last-minute amendments.
At one point, hours before the Legislature’s midnight deadline, ACLU of Nevada Executive Director Athar Haseebullah told lawmakers the bill, and the process for passing it, was plagued with red flags.
“It is a joke that this body, this committee is forced to hear this at 5 p.m. on sine die,” Haseebullah said, referring to the term used to mark the end of a legislative session. “We are now here being told this is what needs to be passed because, what? Democrats need to seem tough on crime. This is not tough on crime. It’s stupid and reckless. It’s totally unacceptable. You should not have been put in this position. It’s an embarrassment.”
Hours later, Haseebullah and other opponents of AB457 would find an unexpected ally in state Sen. Ira Hansen and the rest of the Senate Republicans. The caucus, angry about an unrelated resolution, began a series of parliamentary motions to slow down voting. The crime bill was incidentally one of the victims.
While opponents of the crime bill were relieved at the end result, the process has left a bad taste.
Haseebullah noted the bill was changing frequently in its final hours that the lawmakers “couldn’t possibly have fully read within a 2-hour window” before voting on it.
“The fact that the bill didn’t receive a vote after this much backdoor dealing is probably karmic,” he said in a statement. “I almost feel bad for the Governor at this point because he went from purporting to address theft issues to having his bill turned into a nefarious attempt to bolster the power of the resorts and to allow warrantless wiretapping of Nevadans. You almost can’t make this up.”
‘Nobody gets what they want’
Lombardo’s bill “Safe Streets and Neighborhoods Act” was introduced April 7, the 64th day of the 120-day session.
Since its first hearing May 28, the bill received persistent criticism from groups not involved with drafting the bill language. Public defenders, the ACLU and criminal reform advocates argued that the bill lacked any input from opponents.
John Piro with the Clark County Public Defender’s office added the bill also lacked any data to support proponents’ claims that it was needed to address safety issues. 
Washoe County District Attorneys took the lead on the bill presentation, which also received proposed amendments by the Nevada Resorts Association.
The versions of the bill lawmakers voted on Monday sought harsher penalties for people who destroy property while committing theft, stronger punishment for children who assault teachers, and enhanced penalties for people who assault hospitality workers. The Assembly version also would have enabled Clark County to re-establish a court specific to prosecuting crimes within the Las Vegas Strip resort corridor.
The Senate passed the bill 20-1 at 2:12 p.m. Monday Democratic state Sen. James Ohrenschall cast the lone dissenting vote. 
The Assembly voted 36-6 to pass an amended version of the bill at 11:15 p.m. Democratic Assemblymembers Venicia Considine, Tanya Flannagan, Jovan Jackson, Selena La Rue Hatch, Cinthia Zermeño Moore, and Erica Roth opposed.
What made it to – but not over –  the finish line was markedly different from what Lombardo originally proposed. 
While campaigning for governor, Lombardo, then Clark County sheriff, pledged to roll back modest criminal justice reforms passed in 2019 that lowered penalties for non-violent theft and drug crimes and increased access to diversion programs.
SB 457’s initial version proposed reducing the felony threshold for theft from $1,200 to $750 and changing the state’s bail process by excluding holidays from the 48-hour mandatory hearing provisions. 
These provisions were stripped from the bill.
What remained in the bill through several revisions was harsher punishments for people charged with repeated felony DUIs, stalking and possession of child pornography.
It also stricter punishment for youth who commit repeated crimes against teachers or social service workers, while also limiting eligibility for diversion programs for those convicted of felony abuse, neglect or exploitation of children or the elderly.
During the Senate vote, Democratic state Sen. Melanie Scheible encouraged lawmakers to vote for the legislation, saying it focused on “smash and grab crimes” and improved DUI statutes.
“SB 457 is a comprehensive public safety bill that ensures we have safety for people who work in our schools, shop at our businesses and people who drive on our roads,” Scheible said. “SB 457 has been a collaborative effort between stakeholders, primarily between myself and the governor’s office.”
After the bill passed the Senate, it was heard by the Assembly Judiciary Committee at 4 p.m. Monday. At that meeting, the Nevada Resort Association emerged to pitch its own proposed amendments. The Nevada Independent around that time reported that the amendment was being pushed by the NRA and the Culinary Union.
The provisions of the bill added behind the scenes by the NRA requires Clark County to adopt ordinance that “designates the geographic boundaries of one or more corridors in which the commission of crime poses a significant risk to public safety and the economic welfare of this State due to the high concentration of tourists at the resort association’s request.”
The bill would prohibit anyone who violates the ordinance from entering the resort corridor for at least a year. 
Nevada Resort Association lobbyist Matt Griffin said the group first submitted the amendment to the Senate Judiciary Committee, chaired by Scheible, several weeks ago. 
Haseebullah told lawmakers that if it was submitted three weeks ago and the ACLU and public defenders only learned about it Monday, that in itself is a red flag. 
“It is totally unprofessional beyond measure,” he said during the hearing. “I don’t know if that lies at the governor’s steps or at Chair Scheible’s steps.”
In a statement to the Current, a spokesperson for the Nevada Senate Democratic Caucus wrote that Scheible did incorporate concerns for a variety of people, adding, “just like with any piece of legislation, nobody gets everything they want.”

Thomas Sheng/U.S. Marine Corps)The University of Maryland Global Campus should pay out $69 million to run out the contracts of two independent businesses it created that came under sharp criticism from legislators and legislative auditors last year.
That was the recommendation of the University System of Maryland’s Board of Regents Finance Committee, which quickly voted Wednesday to extend the $46 million-a-year contract for UMGC Ventures for another 18 months, while the online university works to pull it and another spun-off unit back in-house.
Ventures handles the online UMGC’s information technology services, and the university is “not currently positioned to perform these functions in-house,” the resolution said as justification for the extension.
The resolution notes that it does not increase the current contract with Ventures, which handles UMGC’s information technology services, but merely extends it a current rates. The contract will start July 1 and run through Dec. 31, 2026, the length of time UMCG officials said it will take reintegrate Ventures and the other independent unit called AccelerEd, a subsidiary of Ventures.
“The requested contract extension does not increase the annual contract from the current value of fiscal year 25,” UMGC President Gregory Fowler told the committee via Zoom. “But it does provide us with a necessary runway to implement the reintegration services without disruption of these, which are critical IT services as we are trying to move forward.”
Fowler said a consulting firm had been hired to craft a reintegration plan and assess the university’s relationship with the two units.
“I just want to say thank you for dealing with a difficult situation, and for your summary that you sent out,” committee member William T. “Bill” Wood said during the brief discussion on the issue. “That was really helpful to read that and understand,. And congratulations on almost getting through the whole thing.”
“Thank you, Regent Wood,” Fowler said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The move to reintegrate offices came after a critical August 2024 audit completed by the state Office of Legislative Audits (OLA), which stated the online university’s creation of AccelerEd and Ventures cost too much money and appeared to skirt normal university procedures.
UMGC created the two companies under a University System of Maryland policy called the High Impact Economic Development Activities program. Under HIEDA, campuses in the system are allowed to give preferential treatment to businesses they spin off, under specific circumstances.
According to the audit, the campus created Ventures in 2016 as a tax-exempt holding company for UMGC businesses that the university seeded with $15 million. A year later, UMGC spun off its information technology office into AccelerEd.
Ventures had $215.3 million in revenues from fiscal years 2017 to 2022, the audit said, but about $198.1 million of that came from UMGC. And of the $198.1 million, about $184 million of those service agreements were made without competitive bids and with little oversight afterward, the audit said.
While HIEDA policy doesn’t require institutions to seek competitive bids, the audit noted that “the law does not mandate exclusive use of these entities.”
University officials defended the arrangement in the audit, and when they appeared before the joint committee nearly three months later, in a November hearing, they said they still stood by “the intent” of the program, even if there were issues in how that intent was executed.
The university hired Attain Partners of McLean, Virginia, to study the companies, with a plan focused on seven areas that included governance and leadership alignment, communication and change management, finance and budgeting and technology.
According to an executive summary Attain presented in May, Ventures and AccelerEd helped create 174 jobs , supported St. Mary’s College of Maryland and the University of Maryland Eastern Shore, provided $1.5 million in scholarships and established three technology programs.
The summary also highlighted legal advice offered by Florida-based Holland & Knight, which has a Washington, D.C., office. It said Ventures met its IRS designations and complied with UMGC rules by conducting business “on an arm’s length basis.”
Some members of Ventures’ board of directors were not appointed by the university, governor or executive authority, so its board didn’t require a quorum, and the university “has no veto power or ability to reverse decisions,” the consultant’s report said.
“It does not appear that Ventures would be subject to audit by UMGC or the University System of Maryland without either volunteering to do so or judicial deliberation,” according to the summary.
Among Attain’s recommendations was to develop “a 12–18-month implementation plan to incorporate the necessary frameworks, mechanisms, and structures within Ventures to support the commercialization lifecycle,” and it said that if UMGC absorbed AccelerEd’s staff and services back into the university, it “addresses the majority of OLA audit concerns.”
The Finance Committee’s recommendation will be presented to the full Board of Regents, which is scheduled June 13 at 8 a.m. at the University System of Maryland at Hagerstown.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/7759030-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-05 08:09:34.853824

(Getty Images)Indiana education officials presented the first draft of a sweeping new school accountability framework Wednesday, marking a major step toward replacing the state’s previous A-F grading system with a model that instead “values the unique skills and strengths of each student.”
The proposal, shared at the Indiana State Board of Education’s June meeting, outlines a point-based system designed to measure a broader range of student outcomes — from academic proficiency to work-based learning and attendance, as well as soft skills like communication and collaboration. 
The school performance model is still in development and must undergo a months-long rulemaking process that includes multiple rounds of public comment and revisions. 










The model no longer evaluates schools based on how well all of their students do on a single assessment.


– Ron Sandlin, Indiana Department of Education’s chief innovation officer


A final version is expected to be adopted by the state board by December. State law now requires the first round of school grades under the new system to be issued in fall 2026.
“This model is intentionally designed to encourage schools to support and nurture the unique skills and strengths of each student,” said Ron Sandlin, Indiana Department of Education’s (IDOE) chief innovation officer, who co-presented the draft. “The model no longer evaluates schools based on how well all of their students do on a single assessment. Rather, it shifts, and it evaluates schools on their ability to help individual students be on track for postsecondary success.”
What the new model could include
The shift is part of a broader effort mandated by House Enrolled Act 1498, signed into law earlier this year. The legislation, authored by Rep. Bob Behning, R-Indianapolis, requires the state education board to adopt a new school accountability model by December 2025, with implementation beginning in the 2026–27 school year. 
The move follows a years-long push to update Indiana’s previous A-F grading system, which has been effectively suspended since 2018 amid transitions in state testing and COVID-related disruptions. 
During the pause, schools instead received performance report cards posted online. The cards offered data on test scores, graduation rates, attendance, and postsecondary readiness, but stopped short of assigning a single letter grade.
Story continues below.

Supporters of a revamped system, including Republican Gov. Mike Braun and key GOP lawmakers, maintain that it provides needed clarity and transparency for parents. But critics, including some Democrats and educators, have warned against oversimplifying complex school dynamics when evaluating overall performance.
The new system, as proposed, aligns closely with Indiana’s recently redesigned high school diploma and the state’s “Graduates Prepared to Succeed” (GPS) characteristics — a set of five competencies state leaders say matter most to lifelong success: academic mastery, work ethic, communication and collaboration, civic and digital literacy, and career readiness.
Under the draft framework, schools would earn points based on student outcomes at four key checkpoints.
Each student’s “score” combines academic mastery — such as ILEARN or SAT performance — with additional indicators including regular attendance, completion of college-level coursework, progress in English language acquisition, and participation in work-based learning or credential programs.

For example, a hypothetical third-grade student who scores just below proficiency in math but passes the IREAD reading exam and maintains high attendance would earn 90 points under the proposed model — compared to zero points under the current A–F system.
“That student is on track,” Sandlin said. “We want to support and cultivate their interests and strengths, and this model values that.”
In third grade, evaluations would specifically assess “essential” math and literacy using ILEARN standardized test scores. Third grade reading proficiency and “regular attendance” rates would be factored in, too.
ILEARN scores would also be used to determine academic mastery for students in grades 4–8. But other points could be earned for good attendance rates, for high percentages of students proficient in science and social studies, and for “advanced” students who take accelerated coursework before high school. 
By the end of ninth grade, students should have earned at least 10 high school credits. Evaluations for high schools would also factor in student participation in college and career ready coursework; proficiency on a biology-specific standardized test; PSAT scores; school attendance; and English language learner progress. 
Accountability points for 12th grade could additionally be earned based on SAT proficiency, and if students complete any of the following: a new diploma “seal,” work-based learning, or a credential of value. Like at other checkpoints, school attendance and English language learner advances would also qualify for points.
Positive feedback so far — and more to come
Board members and school leaders largely praised the more “student-centered approach” at Wednesday’s meeting.
“I think our new accountability model completes the story for students,” said board member Byron Ernest. “We are creating, now, an environment where we can finally tell that story, and  just applaud that and encourage us to keep that. … This makes our accountability truly student-driven. It’s not about the school. It’s about the student.”
The draft rule proposes awarding maximum points to high school students who graduate with an “honors plus” diploma seal. 
Indiana Education Secretary Katie Jenner emphasized that those credentials now carry “real currency” in Indiana and can lead to automatic admission at public universities, guaranteed interviews with major employers, or advancement opportunities in the military.
Indiana education officials green-light high school diploma overhaul

IDOE’s Chief Strategy Officer Jacqueline Kronk noted that the model was shaped by more than a year of stakeholder feedback, including input from educators, parents, industry leaders and community members.
“This hasn’t been altered or updated in over 10 years, and so obviously we need to think through the additive process and the change management,” she said.
A 30-day public comment period will begin later this summer once the draft rule is officially published. A second round of revisions is expected before the board votes on a final version in December.
“We have zero intention or plan (to adjust) those cut scores to make it easier on schools and kids. We want to keep that rigor and that standard high in Indiana and be very honest about where we are,” Jenner said. “But we want to see the full picture of each child, because so often, when you just do pass or fail … you sometimes lose students in those models.”
“We want to hear from Indiana to get this landed in the best possible spot in December,” she continued. “And we know … we’ll get to the best spot by humbly listening and refining.”
Feedback can be submitted via a QR code or online portal once the rule is published. Department officials will also host additional focus groups and public hearings this fall.
“This is a really good rough draft,” said board member B.J. Watts. “And I think, as we’ve shown before with the diploma work, this board listens.”

Instead, let’s invest in ideas that reflect Vermont’s values and realities.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Tim Maciel: Consolidation is not the answer.","This commentary is by Tim Maciel of Brattleboro. He is a director on the Windham Southeast School District board and a member of the Rural School and Community Alliance.The narrative that began with Gov. Phil Scott’s education transformation bill, H.454, continues to echo across Vermont, from legislative halls to local school board meetings: our education system — with its high per-pupil spending and low student-to-staff ratios — is unsustainable and in urgent need of dramatic restructuring. I reject that narrative.As a director on the Windham Southeast School District board and a member of the Rural School and Community Alliance, I offer a different perspective — one grounded in equity, community voice and whole-child education.Yes, Vermont ranks near the top nationally in per-pupil spending. But this is not a symptom of inefficiency. It reflects our rural geography, aging infrastructure and our commitment to personalized learning.This point has been raised repeatedly — in legislative testimony, public forums, and op-eds — by superintendents, teachers, parents, and education advocates (see, for example, David F. Kelly’s May 30 commentary in VTDigger). In fact, education spending as a percentage of total state spending has stayed the same for two decades. Yet these facts continue to fall on deaf ears in Montpelier.READ MORE
We are a rural state. Many of our schools are small because they must be. Consolidation would mean unacceptably long commutes for students, loss of community identity and weakened ties between families and schools — and it would discourage young families from moving there. The fixed costs of education — heating, transportation, staffing — do not scale down when districts merge.This isn’t a matter of opinion. Research shows that school consolidation rarely delivers promised savings and often harms students and communities (see “Consolidation of Schools and Districts: What the Research Says and What it Means”).Critics also point to Vermont’s slipping test scores. But standardized test results don’t tell the full story of educational success — especially in communities like ours, where we prioritize curiosity, civic engagement, emotional well-being and environmental stewardship alongside academic achievement in basic skills. We know that test scores correlate more with out-of-school factors — poverty, housing instability, trauma — than with teacher quality or school size.Even if we wanted to improve test scores alone, would any teacher argue that the way to do it is by increasing class sizes, reducing mental health staff or putting kids on buses for an extra hour each day? It just does not make good sense.We’ve seen what works. Just this year, Putney Central and Guilford Elementary — along with the Compass School in Westminster — were three of only 15 schools nationally recognized for exemplary “whole child” education. They were praised for fostering school-wide climates of nurturance, community involvement and integrated social-emotional learning.Would this be possible in a 400-student mega-school with fewer adults per child?Yes, Vermont has the lowest student-to-staff ratio in the country. That’s not a flaw — it’s a quality of our educational system. It allows our schools to nurture individual learners, build strong relationships and intervene early when students need support.While Brattleboro Union High School’s graduation rates have lagged slightly behind the state average (a challenge our district is actively addressing), Vermont as a whole continues to boast one of the highest graduation rates in the nation. More tellingly, Vermont students are far more likely than their peers nationally to complete college within four years — a clear sign that our graduates are well prepared for life after high school.If we’re serious about solutions, let’s stop repeating false claims of consolidation. Instead, let’s invest in ideas that reflect Vermont’s values and realities. We could:Update the funding formula to account for real cost drivers like rising health insurance premiums;
Support the development of regional boards of cooperative educational services to share specialized services like transportation and special education;
Expand our commitment to community schools — schools that also serve as hubs for health care, social services and family support.Change is needed — but it must be smart, equitable and rooted in the strengths of our communities, not a misguided obsession with economies of scale.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Tim Maciel: Consolidation is not the answer.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Commentaries_featured-image-25.png,,,2025-06-05 07:02:20.155822

(AP Photo/Lindsey Wasson)Every four months, Philippe Knab, the reentry and eviction defense program director for Washington’s Office of Civil Legal Aid, compiles a report on eviction trends across the state. Since 2021, each review has painted a worse picture than before – especially the most recent one. 
“The number of people being displaced right now is at a historic high in Washington state,” said Knab. “January 2025 was the single highest month we’ve ever seen seasonally. February and March were just a hair under that.”
In King County alone, eviction filings in January 2025 were 66% higher than pre-pandemic levels.
“It’s pretty mind-boggling,” he said.
Evictions in Washington have been steadily increasing over the last few years, with no signs of slowing. The spike stems from rising rents coupled with stagnant wages, lack of affordable housing and the expiration of pandemic-era eviction protections such as increased rental assistance. Filings statewide reached an all-time high in 2024, having increased by 53% since 2019. And fiscal year 2025 is on pace to surpass those numbers. 
The increase in evictions is stretching Washington’s Right to Counsel program thin. The statewide program began in 2021 as the first of its kind in the nation, and it’s meant to ensure that low-income tenants have access to legal representation while navigating the eviction process, which greatly increases a person’s likelihood of winning their case and accessing housing resources.
“Until about six months ago, I used to start every presentation on this topic by saying, ‘We’ve represented every single low-income tenant who’s eligible since 2021,’” said Knab, who oversees the state’s Right to Counsel program. “We can’t say that anymore, because we finally got to a point in King County where we couldn’t keep up.”

The uptick in evictions is happening amid a record-setting homelessness crisis, with proposed cuts on the horizon to federally funded safety net programs that help low-income households stay afloat. As of late May, the Trump administration plans to cut the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s rent assistance program for low-income households by around 40%. And a proposal moving through Congress seeks to cut roughly $700 billion from Medicaid, which provides free or reduced health care to those with limited incomes. The cut would impact more than 600,000 Washington residents throughout the state. 
“People can’t afford the rent, and it’s gonna get worse as the federal government cuts Medicaid and other critical safety net services,” said Michele Thomas, the director of policy and advocacy with the Washington Low Income Housing Alliance. 
Housing advocates in Washington hope a newly signed law limiting how much a landlord can increase rent each year will help prevent evictions by ensuring renters aren’t priced out of their units. Washington is the third state to implement rent stabilization statewide, following Oregon and California.
The bill, signed into law by Gov. Bob Ferguson in May, caps yearly rent increases to 7% plus inflation, or 10% – whichever is lower. For mobile home park residents, rent is not allowed to increase more than 5% in a year. Under the new law, which went into effect immediately, landlords are required to provide tenants with 90 days’ notice before raising rent. 
While housing advocates are celebrating the win, Thomas stressed there’s still a long way to go to address the state’s housing affordability crisis.
“It’s not going to keep rents affordable, it’s just going to keep tenants from being (price) gouged,” she said. “There will be tenants who will get rent increases that they can’t afford, and that sets them up for eviction because there’s no place else affordable to move.”
Right to Counsel program strained
The state saw a lull in eviction filings during the height of the pandemic due to local and federal eviction moratoriums and an increase in the availability of rental assistance, according to state data. But as those protections have wound down, evictions have skyrocketed. 
State data shows that eviction filings in 2024 were the highest on record, increasing by nearly 41% from 2023. Eviction filings so far this fiscal year are on pace to once again break that record. 
In places like Clark County, which has the highest eviction rate per capita in the state, nearly 1 in every 300 residents has gone through an eviction proceeding. 
“I think people are unfortunately feeling pretty comfortable with it, and what that means is that the numbers are continuing to go up,” Knab said. 
“Over 30% of the folks that come through eviction court identify as having a disability,” he added. “Over 40% are people of color.”
Some counties, such as King and Kitsap, saw the number of evictions filed more than double from fiscal year 2023 to 2024. Other counties that have seen large percent increases year over year include Douglas, Whatcom, Skagit and Snohomish, according to data from the Office of Civil Legal Aid.
Knab said before the Right to Counsel law was passed in 2021, less than 10% of tenants were represented by a lawyer during an eviction proceeding. Up until recently, they were able to represent nearly all of those eligible. 

While eviction filings continue to increase, outcomes for renters have improved in part due to the program, according to Knab. Since the program began in 2021, 56% of people facing an eviction were allowed to remain in their housing, with the case either being dismissed or resolved through an agreement between the tenant and landlord. His office doesn’t have access to reliable data from before the program was implemented, but he said he’s seen how the program has fundamentally changed the dynamics unfolding in courtrooms across the state.
“The idea of this program, and what it’s been able to do in five years, I think is pretty astounding,” he said.
Sean Flynn, the president and executive director of the Rental Housing Association of Washington, said the Right to Counsel law has extended the time it takes to conduct an eviction, costing property owners more money because of increased legal fees and missed rent payments. The influential advocacy organization lobbies on a local and state level on behalf of property owners, managers and investors.
Before the Right to Counsel program was implemented, evictions were more of a “business transaction” that moved quickly, he said, because many of the cases ended in a default ruling on behalf of the property owner if a person missed their court date. Now, each case is getting “dragged through the courts.”
“Why would you want to keep a tenant in a unit that they can’t afford to pay the rent?” he said. “Nine times out of ten, they don’t have the money, and it’s due to lack of resources. We need better subsidies for the tenants. Keeping someone housed who can’t afford it doesn’t solve the underlying problem.”
Knab pushes back against the narrative he often hears from landlords and lawyers who represent them that the eviction process is too slow and that the Right to Counsel program is to blame. “They will say, ‘You used to be able to give a five-minute pitch and get your writ,’” he said, referring to the formal name of an eviction notice. “And it’s like, well, that’s not how courts are supposed to work.
“If you look at consumer credit or foreclosures, you’re talking years here,” said Knab, who previously worked as a public defender and spent nearly a decade representing low-income tenants in New York City before moving to the Pacific Northwest. “We’re talking not even months, we’re talking weeks (for evictions).”
Early in 2025, Knab’s office started having to triage cases in King County because his office couldn’t keep up with the flood of evictions being filed by landlords. Each eviction filing represents a household, so it can include multiple people.
Priority was given to cases involving disabled tenants, those with language access issues or households with children. “Everyone still got to talk to a lawyer, but the numbers just got too high,” Knab said. “We’re hoping to get back to a place where we can represent everyone.”
He said the long eviction timelines in King County, which at times were as long as 40 weeks, were unacceptable, but he said the flood of eviction filings was to blame, not the Right to Counsel program.
To try to address landlords’ concerns, Knab’s office worked with King County to create an expedited docket for cases where landlords believe tenants pose a health and safety concern. But the “flood of cases” that was alluded to never materialized. Fewer than 10 cases have been expedited under those conditions, he added.
Flynn said the small number of health and safety cases is not because they don’t exist, but because the definition for those cases is too narrow. “We’d like to see that expanded,” he said.
Eviction crisis felt around the state
Hannah Swensen, the managing attorney for the Spokane Housing Justice Project, said the two small firms that represent tenants who qualify for the Right to Counsel program have been able to serve everyone there who’s eligible so far. But it’s become more challenging. 
Spokane County saw a 30% increase in eviction filings from fiscal 2023 to 2024, with 1,544 evictions being filed in the first nine months of this fiscal year. The county has the fourth-highest number of eviction filings in the state, behind King, Pierce and Snohomish counties. 
Last year, Swensen’s team of four full-time lawyers represented 590 eviction-related cases, often hearing between 12-30 cases a day, four days a week. 
To resolve more issues before they land in the courts, they opened an eviction prevention clinic out of the downtown Spokane library.
Twice a month, a tenant can come and get legal advice regarding their housing and learn about the resources that could help stave off an eviction notice, such as disability support or rental assistance. 
An eviction filing, even if a person wins their case, still shows up on a person’s rental history and makes it harder to find housing in the future. The experience can be life-altering, especially for low-income households that receive support from the federal Housing Choice Voucher Program, formerly known as Section 8, Swensen said. Getting an eviction boots them from the program and can make them ineligible for the benefits in the future.
In Washington, 21% of renters are considered extremely low income, with the number of available rental units for this income bracket falling short by 166,912 homes, according to data from the National Low Income Housing Coalition.
Renée Rooker, the executive director of the Walla Walla Housing Authority for 33 years, said evictions increased after pandemic-era eviction protections expired and property managers were able to “get rid of the bad actors who just wouldn’t behave and wouldn’t go to the resources in the community that could help them with the rent,” Rooker said. 
The Walla Walla Housing Authority recently stopped taking applications for its Housing Choice Voucher Program for low-income renters because the waitlist was too long. In 2024, only a “handful” of families were pulled off the waitlist, according to Rooker. “We already have a waitlist of 1,200, and when we can’t get to you for three, four or five years, to me, that’s unfair,” she said.
Rooker, whose organization provides housing to around 2,000 households through various subsidized housing programs, said that since the onset of the pandemic, tenants have continued to struggle paying their rent. 
“I don’t know if it’s a mentality of ‘We don’t have to pay the rent or someone will bail us out, or we can live here long enough and we get to live rent free,’” said Rooker, noting that a few local nonprofits offer rental assistance, but there isn’t enough to meet the need. “I don’t know the rationale, but it’s not that they don’t have the income or we wouldn’t have housed them.”
Swensen said she’s never come across a case where a tenant simply didn’t want to pay the rent. It’s one of the many misconceptions she often hears that is far from her typical client.
“It’s vets with disabilities who struggle to get in touch with the resources they need. It’s single moms with kids who have missed only one or two months of rent cause they didn’t get their child support or because of an injury,” Swensen said. “It’s elderly residents who can’t keep up with rent increases because it’s more than their social security can handle.”
“These are the faces of eviction,” she said. 
New rent stabilization law
Deb Wilson, the president of the Leisure Manor Tenants Association, was part of a group of mobile home residents that helped push for passage of the rent stabilization bill. 
For years, the owner of the mobile home park in Aberdeen had been increasing the rent and pricing residents out, often referred to as an “economic eviction.” At one point, residents at the mobile home park were faced with a 55% rent increase. 
“We had several people, probably six or seven, that left within a few months of getting that first rent increase,” recalled Wilson, who has lived in the park since 2015. “They just couldn’t afford it.”
Wilson and her neighbors started meeting regularly in February 2022 to push back against their landlord, ultimately filing hundreds of complaints with the state Attorney General’s Office. Their efforts led to the Attorney General’s Office requiring the owner of the park, Hurst & Son, to reimburse tenants $5.5 million, following a yearslong investigation from Cascade PBS. The results helped inform the rent stabilization bill that lawmakers passed this year, which was hotly debated and ultimately whittled down.
The law includes a handful of situations where a landlord is exempt, including in owner-occupied housing situations, where the owner lives on-site; if the unit is already subsidized as affordable housing through a state or federal program; or if the apartment was recently built. (The unit remains exempt for 12 years.)
“We needed stability, because older folks, especially on fixed income, or young families on fixed incomes, you can’t live day by day, going, ‘Oh my gosh, what is the next rent increase going to be?’” Wilson said. 
Since the bill passed, Wilson and her husband have decided to get a dog. They lost theirs in 2016. “Now we know how much the rent might increase every year, we think we can make it work,” she said.
She said it seems like a small thing, but those things add up. 
“It’s the difference between being able to buy one more medication that you were supposed to be taking, but you couldn’t because you couldn’t afford it,” she said. “It’s going to make a huge difference.”
Flynn, who lobbied against the rent stabilization bill, fears the new law will have unintended consequences for property owners and the overall housing market, leading to a “slow bleed” of small to medium-sized landlords getting out of the rental business because it’s no longer as profitable. 
He also believes the new law will drive down housing quality because landlords will be less able to keep up with maintenance costs if they aren’t able to increase rents by more than 10% each year. The law might also disincentivize developers from building if the profit margins are decreased too low while expenses, including insurance and construction costs, continue to increase. 
Jeffrey Gustaveson, a staff member with the Aberdeen-based nonprofit Firelands Workers United, is grateful the rent stabilization bill passed, but he says even the 7% rent increase plus inflation allowed under the cap would be crippling for a family living paycheck to paycheck.
“That can be a couple thousand dollars a year for a family living on the edge,” Gustaveson said, whose organization focuses on improving access to health care, affordable housing, child care and good-paying jobs in Grays Harbor and Pacific counties. 
“The drum I’m beating right now is that these rent caps are a serious win and will actually prevent eviction, which was the whole point of the policy,” he said. “It’s not a perfect policy, and no one at any point said that it was going to be the solution to the housing crisis.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/AP25108837654542-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-05 08:09:34.853824

(Photo via Florida Sugar Growers Co-op)In 1960, the TV show “The Twilight Zone” aired an irony-soaked episode called “Eye of the Beholder” that played around with the axiom about where beauty truly lies. In it, a bunch of grotesque doctors try to make a gorgeous woman (played by Donna Douglas from “The Beverly Hillbillies”) look like them, because conformity matters more than anything to their grotesque leader.
I was reminded of this episode last week while reading up on the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that Congress has been debating.
In case you haven’t heard about OBBBA and how controversial it is, consider this: Despite being strongly endorsed by our own grotesque leader, the bill squeaked through the House of Representatives by a single vote. Now it goes over to the Senate, where it’s liable to face even more opposition. I sure hope it does, anyway.
This “beautiful” bill contains a lot of ugliness. It will add trillions to the federal deficit, news that led to none other than Elon Musk calling it an abomination. It slashes food stamps for seniors to give billionaires a tax cut. And it makes such drastic changes to Medicaid that it’s led to a dispute in Iowa over how many people will die.
But what grabbed my attention is the really big favor it includes for Florida’s Big Sugar.
The feds already prop up our sugar industry with expensive government subsidies. This bill boosts that subsidy even higher, from 19.75 cents per pound to 24 cents per pound.
Bear in mind that the sugar industry produces about 8 trillion tons of sugar every year. A hike of a nickel on a pound of sugar equals an awful lot of dough.
  Eve Samples via Friends of the Everglades
“It’s egregious that this polluting industry — which Florida taxpayers have paid well over $2 billion to clean up after — is poised to reap even more profits if this budget bill passes the U.S. Senate,” said Eve Samples, executive director of Friends of the Everglades.
Samples questioned how boosting the profits of the sugar industry fits in with the goals of an administration that says it’s going to “Make America Healthy Again.”
Maybe in this case the slogan should be altered to “Make Big Sugar’s Profits Healthy.”
 Protected at every level
The sugar industry may be headquartered in South Florida, but it’s long been king in both Tallahassee and Washington.
“This industry is protected at every level,” Samples said.
For instance, take its horrible air pollution.
From October to May every year, Florida’s sugar companies burn their 400,000 acres of fields to prepare for harvest, thus getting rid of the outer leaves of the cane stalks.
It’s an old-fashioned practice that other countries have banned. So much burning sends billows of thick smoke floating across the little towns by Lake Okeechobee, showering down what residents refer to as “black snow” that coats their houses and cars and the lungs of the unlucky.
Four years ago, the Florida Legislature passed a bill — with support from both parties — that makes it much harder for anyone harmed by all this soot to sue the sugar industry.
Gov. Ron DeSantis, when he was a congressman, repeatedly voted against federal price supports for the sugar industry. When he moved into the governor’s mansion in 2019, he called for all the members of the South Florida Water Management District board to resign for being too pro-sugar.
But when the Legislature handed DeSantis its bill to protect the sugar industry against suits over its burning practices, he signed it into law without a word of protest.
Or take water pollution. Twenty years ago, the industry deployed 40 lobbyists — picture an army marching in bespoke suits and Italian loafers — to persuade lawmakers to extend the deadline for cleaning up Everglades pollution from 2006 to 2026.
The bill sailed through, and then-Gov. Jeb “Punctuation Marks Are Cool!” Bush — a self-described Everglades advocate — signed it behind closed doors.
The industry controls these politicians so utterly that if sugar executives demanded they line up and start dancing to the old Archies hit “Sugar Sugar,” they’d say, “Sweet!”
 Money makes the world go ’round
The main reason Big Sugar always gets what it wants is that it’s ready to spend Big Bucks to get it. As the song from “Cabaret” put it so well, “Money makes the world go around!”
According to the Dirty Money Project database created by the folks at the Vote Water environmental group, between 2018 and 2024 Florida’s sugar industry spent $36 million on Florida political contributions.
  Alfonso Fanjul and Jose Francisco “Pepe” Fanjul via the Florida Agricultural Hall of Fame)
In the past year alone, Big Sugar gave more than $5.2 million to Florida politicians, including $3.1 million donated by U.S. Sugar, $2.1 million donated by Florida Crystals, and just over $43,000 by the Sugar Co-op.
Acting like an always-available ATM has its advantages. Access, for example.
On Presidents’ Day in 1996, Bill Clinton was busy breaking up with Monica Lewinsky in the Oval Office when the phone rang. The caller: Sugar magnate Alfonso Fanjul Jr., of Florida Crystals.
Clinton spent 20 minutes on the phone with him, listening to Fanjul complaining. The sugar baron was upset about Vice President Al Gore’s proposal of a penny-a-pound tax on Florida sugar growers to pay for cleaning up the Everglades. After that phone call, Clinton shelved the plan.
Incidentally, the Dirty Money website shows that the company Fanjul runs with his brother Pepe, Florida Crystals, donated $1 million last year to the super-PAC known as Make America Great Again Inc. You can probably guess which grotesque presidential candidate it supported.
The industry has already seen a benefit, Patrick Ferguson of the Sierra Club told me. Three years ago, former President Joe Biden banned imports from a sugar company based in the Dominican Republic named Central Romana over evidence the company used forced labor, i.e. slaves.
Central Romana is run by the Fanjuls, and in March the current administration quietly removed the Biden ban. Maybe they count “being concerned about slavery” as being in favor of DEI. Can’t have that!
It’s not just politicians who reap the benefits of sugar’s bucks. In the 1960s, the sugar industry paid Harvard scientists to produce research that played down the connection between sugar and heart disease. Instead, they shifted the blame to saturated fat.
One of the scientists paid by the sugar industry went on to become head of nutrition at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. He helped draft the forerunner to the federal government’s dietary guidelines.
That’s why environmental advocates weren’t at all surprised to see Big Sugar included in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

“Big Sugar is once again getting gifts they really don’t deserve,” Ferguson said.
 Up goes the price
Sugar has been getting special treatment from the federal government since the days when Alexander Hamilton was a real guy and not a smash Broadway show.
In 1789, Congress imposed a tariff on imported sugar to raise revenue for the struggling young nation. It was the first substantive legislation passed by the young nation, and it was signed into law by the first president, George Washington.
Despite that connection to our Founding Fathers, you know who’s been the most critical of federal policy on propping up Big Sugar? Right-wing think tanks like the Cato Institute. Eight years ago, Cato published a paper titled, “Candy-Coasted Cartel: Time to Kill the U.S. Sugar Program.”
When I talked to him this week, the author of that Cato paper, Colin Grabow, pointed out something about the OBBBA’s nickel-per-pound boost for Big Sugar that hadn’t occurred to me:
“This is basically raising the cost of sugar in the United States,” he said. “We just had an election where people were complaining about the cost of things.”
Yeah, I told him, I recall a lot of people fussing over the price of eggs before going to the polls in November.
“Now, instead of reforming the system,” Grabow said, “we’re just going to hand them more money and make sugar more expensive.”
I heard similar points from Vincent Smith of the equally right-wing American Enterprise Institute. The boost called for by the bill is “a pretty dramatic increase,” he said.
That will make all the goods that contain sugar — soft drinks, cookies, cake, applesauce, cereal, you name it — cost more as well. As an avid consumer of Publix sweet tea, hearing this made me do a classic spit-take.
Smith joked that making sugar and its related products so much more expensive may be good news for dentists but not for family pocketbooks.
  Colin Grabow via the Cato Institute
Grabow pointed out, “You can bet that the language related to sugar in the bill is directly due to lobbyists.’
 What do the senators say?
I tried contacting officials from the sugar companies about all this, but I just couldn’t sweet-talk them into speaking with me.
The closest I got to a quote was this statement from Ryan Duffy, senior director of corporate communications for U.S. Sugar, who told me via email, “We typically don’t comment on pending legislation.”
Of course, the more important folks to talk to would be our two senators. Everyone wants to find out where they stand on the Big Bad Wolf — er, I mean, One Big Beautiful Bill. But they didn’t respond to my requests for comment either.
Our senior senator, Rick Scott, has a long history of being tucked in Big Sugar’s hip pocket. Last year, when he was running for re-election, the sugar companies made big donations to his campaign’s super-PAC.
In his story on those donations, my colleague Mitch Perry pointed out the hypocrisy of Scott’s pro-sugar stance. When he first ran for governor 15 years ago, he blasted his GOP primary opponent, Bill McCollum, for accepting contributions from Big Sugar.
“He’s owned by U.S. Sugar,” the Orlando Sentinel quoted Scott saying of McCollum. “They’ve given him nearly a million dollars for his campaign. And it’s disgusting.”
Scott apparently thought it was a lot less disgusting when Big Sugar’s big payouts were going into his coffers, not McCollum’s. He hasn’t turned down a dime from them since.
In fact, as governor, Scott was one of quite a few Republican officials who accepted hunting trips to Texas from a sugar company, then declined to answer reporters’ questions about it.
Yet Scott says he has serious qualms about the One Big Beautiful Etc. He doesn’t believe it cuts enough federal fat, so he says he’s inclined to reject it.
  U.S. Sen. Rick Scott (photo via the Scott campaign)
“I think there’s plenty of us would not vote for it in the Senate,” he said, according to CBS News.
Then we come to Florida’s newest senator, the recently appointed Ashley Moody. When she was Florida’s elected attorney general, the former Plant City Strawberry Festival queen was no friend to the environment. She also fought several absurd legal battles on the behalf of Mr. Grotesque. So far, she hasn’t indicated whether she’s in the same position as Scott or not.
If you’re inclined to bang your head against the wall, I’d encourage you to call or email these two and demand they stop this giveaway to a polluting industry. But bear in mind, they may not listen to you.
After all, the more money the sugar companies rake in, the more they can give away to our elected officials. That’s right — by boosting their profits, we’re enabling the sugar companies to continue to spend so freely on buying the favors of our politicians.
But I do have suggestion. If Scott and Moody say, “The heck with my constituents!” and vote to pass this bill for Big Sugar, I think every single one of us should send them our grocery bills, demanding a refund.
A tsunami of grocery store receipts inundating the senators’ offices would be, I think, a beautiful thing to behold.

Mike Braun speaks to a crowd at Moontown Brewing Company in Whitesville after nabbing the Republican nomination for governor on May 7, 2024. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)The principal campaign committee that supported Indiana Gov. Mike Braun through his U.S. Senate tenure has recast itself into a “nonconnected” political action committee (PAC).
That means it supports or opposes more than one federal candidate and isn’t a separate segregated fund or party committee.
Braun’s campaign arm declined to answer questions on why the changes were made or how the PAC plans to spend its money. Kevin Broghamer, who was listed as the entity’s treasurer and designated agent, did not reply to a request for comment.
In the amended statement of organization filed May 12, Mike Braun for Indiana renamed itself the Freedom and Opportunity Fund.

Such a conversion “is not uncommon,” per Brendan Glavin of OpenSecrets, a nonpartisan Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit that tracks and analyzes campaign finance and lobbying data.
Glavin, a director of insights, noted President Donald Trump did the same with his principal campaign committees after the 2020 and 2024 elections.
“The (federal) Braun campaign had no money left over, and there is no issue with coordination since the (federal) campaign no longer exists,” he said. The entity ended March with about $11,000 cash on hand, according to a quarterly filing dated April 15. 
It’s an alternative to simply terminating old committees, according to Federal Election Commission guidance for conversions to multicandidate committees. Both Glavin and FEC spokesman Myles Martin directed the Capital Chronicle to it.
The Freedom and Opportunity Fund is listed as a nonqualified PAC, not a multicandidate committee.
Those must have been registered with the FEC for at least six months, received contributions from at least 51 entities and contributed to at least five federal candidates, according to the agency. Multicandidate committees can contribute up to $5,000 per candidate per election.
Looking back — and ahead
Mike Braun for Indiana, the principal campaign committee, popped into existence in August 2017, according to an FEC filing — about three months before its namesake resigned from the Indiana General Assembly to run for U.S. Senate.
It supported Braun during his bid, which he won in 2018, and throughout his six-year tenure in Washington, D.C.
But almost five months ago, when his U.S. Senate term ended and he took office as Indiana’s leader, the committee became obsolete.
To convert itself, a committee must amend its statements of organization to change its title — candidate names aren’t allowed — and change the committee type, according to the FEC.
In the filing, Braun’s committee became the Freedom and Opportunity Fund, with the box for a nonconnected PAC also ticked. Braun has used the “freedom and opportunity” tagline throughout his speeches as governor and used it to title his first-term agenda.

Other information that has changed must also be updated. For example, the PAC swapped out treasurers, changed its physical and digital addresses and ditched a longstanding collection of affiliated entities that were listed in past statements of organization.
“After the conversion, the committee remains responsible for resolving any outstanding obligations, such as debts and unrefunded impermissible contributions,” the FEC continued.
The PAC still owes nearly $500,000 from loans Braun made to his federal campaigns in 2018 and 2024, according to the first quarter filing.
It also ended the previous year with a balance in the red by nearly $2,000, but in a May 5 filing, former Treasurer Thomas Datwyler assured the FEC that several uncleared checks meant the bank account never went negative or was overdrawn.

Despite the rhetoric from both Democrats and Republicans, the people who keep freight moving – the engineers, conductors, car inspectors, and signal maintainers, were left standing at the station once again.
Assembly Bill 446, a bill shaped by rail labor and safety experts, should have sailed through. It proposed common-sense measures: limits on train length, minimum crew requirements, better lighting in railyards, oversight of contract carriers, and functional defect detectors. These were not radical demands. They were safeguards forged from decades of experience and, in many cases, tragedy. But instead of passing legislation to protect workers and communities, lawmakers threw up roadblocks. A fiscal note from the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada didn’t clarify cost, it inflated it. It was less about what AB446 would require, and more about what the agency wanted to avoid.
We have heard all the excuses before. But this time, it was not just Republican opposition. It was Democrats too. The same ones who have claimed to champion labor, who have stood on union stages during campaign season and nodded along while we talked about precision scheduled railroading (PSR), fatigue, and unsafe practices. They nodded, then turned around and did nothing. Again.
If this feels familiar, it is because it is. It was only a few years ago that President Biden and Congress imposed a contract on railroad workers, denying them the right to strike after years of being overworked and under-protected. It was the so-called “most pro-labor administration in history.” But when push came to shove, labor was shoved aside.
Now, in Nevada, a state where rail labor has long played a role in shaping public policy, those same patterns are emerging. Lawmakers, many of whom we have supported cycle after cycle, abandoned us when it counted. And I do not want to be the one to say “we told you so,” but at some point, it becomes impossible not to.
There is a bigger story here than a single bill. This is about the slow erosion of labor’s power in Nevada. While unions fight to hold the line, corporate lobbyists wine, dine, and whisper their way into influence. Big business does not just want a seat at the table anymore. They want the table, the chairs, and the menu. If labor does not start pushing back, and soon, we will be on the outside looking in for good.
This moment should be a wake-up call. It is not enough to endorse candidates and hope they do the right thing. Labor in Nevada needs to remember its muscle. We need to show up louder, smarter, and more unified. We need to stop handing over endorsements and donations without demands. And we need to hold every lawmaker accountable, regardless of party, who sides with corporate interests over worker safety.
To be clear, some lawmakers did express support. A few backed the bill and spoke up, even as the rail lobby quietly moved behind the scenes. But good intentions were drowned out by indifference, misinformation, and political convenience. And in the end, those who supported the bill were left holding the bag.
This is not just about rail labor. It is about emergency vehicles stuck at blocked crossings. It is about toxic chemicals rolling through our communities on nearly three-mile-long freight trains with no crew oversight. It is about rail yards so poorly lit that workers have tripped and been injured just doing their jobs. What protects us protects you too. And when lawmakers choose silence over safety, we all pay the price.
Rail labor will keep fighting. We do not have the luxury of giving up. But we are not going to keep playing nice while lawmakers play political games with our lives. We are organizing. We are watching. And come the next session, or the next election, we will be back at the table. If they do not set a place for us, we will bring our own chairs.
It is time for the labor movement in Nevada to take stock, get serious, and stop financing its own betrayal.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/high-speed-rail-brighting-1024x592.png,,,2025-06-05 07:02:20.155822

Some members of the Lapeer District Library Board have also been working to craft a policy to keep certain materials out of children’s hands without running afoul of the law.
The effort stretches back several years to 2023, as community members sought to have several books pulled from library shelves.
Susan Hough, a member of the steering committee of Fight 4 the First, which advocates against censorship within the library district, said many of the books challenged deal with gender or LGBTQ issues.
Among those books was the award-winning “Gender Queer: A Memoir,” a frequently challenged graphic novel which details author Maia Kobabe’s coming of age tale as a person who identifies as nonbinary and asexual.
The source of the challenge stems from its inclusion of some drawings depicting nude characters and sexual scenarios, prompting opponents to label it pornographic.
Lapeer County Prosecutor John Miller suggested he might file criminal charges against employees or library officials if the book was not pulled from shelves. However, Amy Churchill, who was serving as the director of the library at the time, retained the ACLU of Michigan as legal counsel. The organization sent Miller a letter warning that taking action would threaten First Amendment freedoms, and violate his ethical duties as a prosecutor. When the challenge against the book was rejected, Miller took no action. 
In the years since that incident, candidates with a conservative ideology have come to hold a majority of seats on the nonpartisan board, with some new members carrying ties to the initial book challenges.
In February, Hough said members of Fight 4 the First Lapeer uncovered a memo while reviewing the board’s public records responding to a request for an opinion on policies to restrict access to certain books, including proposals to move certain children’s books to an adult section, or putting certain books behind glass or the circulation desk, requiring a patron to ask for access.
20FEB2025 Legal Memo Regarding Book Restrictions
Anne Seurynk, an attorney with the Foster Swift law firm who the board had retained as counsel, warned that adopting any of the proposals would place the library on “at best, shaky Constitutional ground” and would put the library at risk of being sued and losing. That could saddle the district with the cost of its own attorneys fees and the fees of their legal challenger.
Seurynk also served as corporate counsel for the Cromaine District Library, providing them with a similar notice regarding its own efforts to sequester controversial materials.
 During a meeting of the Lapeer Tea Party in March, the board’s Vice Chair John DeAngelis and Secretary Peggy Brotzke discussed efforts to limit the materials children can access.
DeAngelis was unable to offer details on what these restrictions would look like, but told attendees that the board would be consulting with its attorney on the issue. He later offered a rough timeline of six months for presenting potential options.
“We don’t want to get sued. We don’t want to burn up our funds in attorney fees,” DeAngelis said.“We want to do it the right way, so it will take some time. It won’t happen overnight.”
DeAngelis and Brotzke did not respond to a request for an interview prior to publication, nor did board Chair Kari Kohlman.
DeAngelis during the Board’s March meeting put forward a motion to replace Foster Swift with a local firm, Rickard, Denney, Leichliter, Childers & Bosch, with DeAngelis saying he would like to use local counsel to keep the board’s money within the community. The motion passed with support from Kohlman, DeAngelis, Brotzke and Trustee Carol Brown, despite protest from former board chair Bill Marquardt and treasurer Perry Valle.
On its website, Rickard, Denney, Leichliter, Childers & Bosch describes its legal practice as “advising and assisting individuals, churches, and other religious organizations in defending and taking full advantage of their religious freedom under federal and state law.” Other areas of practice include general civil litigation, representing individuals with small to medium-sized businesses, estate planning, real estate matters, zoning issues and other issues of land use.
Based on Brotzke’s information request for the library’s collections policy during her first board meeting in February, Hough expects to see proposals to amend the district’s collection policy soon. The board’s next meeting is set for June 19, with Fight 4 the First Lapeer planning to hold a “Read-In for Freedom” at DeAngeli Library the same day. 
The group held a similar rally in mid-May prior to a board meeting that ended up being canceled due to a lack of a quorum.

Although Brotzke and DeAngelis focused their concerns on protecting children and ensuring they are unable to access inappropriate materials, Hough said the question of what is appropriate varies from person to person.
“That’s why we have library professionals who have been highly trained in child development and in literacy and in book selection, who use many tools, including professional reviews, publisher’s reviews, etc., as well as their own personal knowledge to select books and place them in – what are considered by a professional – an appropriate place in the library,” Hough said.
When it comes to determining whether a book belongs in a library, Hough said she preferred to trust the professionals.
“I don’t know about you, but I prefer to let my medical doctor guide me in medical decisions, and I prefer to let my attorney guide me in legal decisions. And I believe library professionals have the training and the expertise to guide us in what’s appropriate,” Hough said. 
Hough further noted that libraries legally cannot have obscene materials on their shelves.
While the Foster Swift memo makes clear that placing restrictions on materials could violate the U.S. Constitution, there’s no such thing as First Amendment police, Hough said. That means there’s no defense against these types of policies unless community members and free speech organizations are watching and willing to respond.
Should the board move forward with the policies and face legal consequences, Hough raised concerns about how that could impact funding for Lapeer libraries.
“That’s money that should be used to provide materials for our community, provide services, because it’s way beyond books” Hough said, pointing to  other benefits like internet access and community programs.“There’s just so much in our library that enriches the community, and all of these attacks are going to end up having fiscal outcomes.”

Photo by Max Nesterak/Minnesota Reformer.I’ve been a Minnesota sports fan my whole life, so I know false hope. Every year, at least one of our teams shows signs of championship form, only to see that promise wiped out in some new, heartbreaking fashion. (Thank goodness for the Frost and Lynx.) 
Unfortunately, I worry Minnesota workers are now in a similarly tenuous position — on the brink of meaningful progress, but susceptible to a sudden loss.
That’s the conclusion reached in the latest State of Working Minnesota, an annual look at the status of working people in the North Star State. Over the past year, working families have made significant strides, including record-high job numbers and a record-low uninsured rate. But like a Minnesota team on the precipice of glory, there are reasons to worry. Federal policies advanced by the Trump administration, Elon Musk and congressional Republicans could undo years of growth for working Minnesotans.
Let’s start with the good news. In 2024, Minnesota added more than 40,000 jobs, outpacing gains from the previous year. Construction, education, health services and government jobs led the way —sectors that are vital to both our economy and our communities. 

The state’s unemployment rate remained low, while labor force participation rates stayed high, indicating a relatively large portion of the state is trying to work and finding work. Gains have been particularly strong for certain groups. In a dramatic turnaround, Minnesota now boasts the lowest Black unemployment rate in the Midwest after having the region’s highest rate during the Great Recession. Among prime working-age adults (25 to 54), Minnesota has the second-highest labor force participation rate in the nation.

At the same time, the North Star State made real headway in tackling economic inequality. In 2024, the gap between high and low earners fell to a 25-year low. We’ve enjoyed a 56% decline in the share of Minnesota workers earning poverty-level wages over the past ten years. More than half of Latino workers took home wages that put them below the poverty line in 2014, whereas today it is just 16%.  

One explanation for these gains: Organized labor is showing signs of resurgence in Minnesota. Countering a decades-long decline, union membership jumped nearly 7% in 2024. Women led the way, with unionization among female workers rising 20%. The state’s workers are also demonstrating an increased interest in unions. The past two years saw the most union elections in nearly two decades, and these elections had a higher success rate than at any point since 2000. These wins are more than symbolic: Union workers in Minnesota now earn a median wage 20% higher than their non-union peers.

Minnesotans are finding family-sustaining jobs, and they are safer while working. In 2024, Minnesota posted the lowest rate of workplace fatalities in the Midwest. Outside of the workplace, our uninsured rate hit a historic low of 4%, the fourth lowest in the nation, and a 52% decline since 2013. A big part of this drop can be attributed to the rising number of Minnesotans getting health coverage through Medical Assistance, which is what we call our Medicaid program. Contrary to the stereotype of this care going to people who are not working, working families have come to increasingly rely on Medical Assistance.

To be sure, there are plenty of areas where more work is needed. Minnesota’s gender wage gap grew in 2024, with Minnesota women making approximately 81 cents on the male dollar. While the state can claim one of the highest rates of employer-provided health coverage in the country, we also suffer  the nation’s largest level of racial inequality in this coverage. 

Ultimately, the gains made for Minnesota’s workers indicate a state moving in the right direction, as well as the need for further investments to address these outstanding issues. 
By contrast, federal policy changes portend a full-scale reversal to benefit the rich at the expense of working Minnesotans. 
Republican plans to cut Medicaid to partially pay for tax cuts for the wealthy would decimate health care for working people, with particularly strong impacts in communities of color and rural areas. Federal cuts promoted by the richest man in the history of the world have targeted key areas of job growth in Minnesota: education, health, and construction jobs to build a green future. And, the Trump administration has made no secret of its desire to weaken unions, undermining one of the most effective tools workers have for raising wages and protecting benefits.
As Minnesota sports fans, we’re used to heartbreak we don’t control. We can’t make the kick go through the uprights or hit the game-winning three. 
But when it comes to public policy, we’re not just spectators. Lawmakers — and the public who hold them accountable — have a real say in what happens next. 
The progress made by Minnesota workers in 2024 didn’t happen by chance; it was the result of deliberate policy choices, robust public investments, and strong labor protections. 
We may not be able to change the score on the field, but we can still fight for a future where that kind of progress isn’t easily undone.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/P1024031-1024x683-1.jpeg,,,2025-06-05 07:02:20.155822

(Photo by New Jersey Monitor)Six years ago, New Jersey legislators expanded the statute of limitations for survivors of sexual assault, responding to a wave of victims looking for justice years or even decades after abuse at the hands of predatory clergy, Boy Scout leaders, and others entrusted to care for children.
But the state has found itself increasingly in victims’ crosshairs as they seek justice for sexual abuse they suffered in the government’s custody, from foster care to state-run homes.
Officials paid more than $23 million to settle over a dozen of these complaints last year. They were among 332 payouts, totaling almost $178 million, that the state made in 2024 to resolve legal claims involving state employees, agencies, and property, according to records the New Jersey Monitor obtained under the Open Public Records Act.
Two of the largest payments in 2024 — $12 million and $6.8 million — went to women for sexual abuse they endured in foster placements, one dating back to 1987 and the other to 1963. The women said they reported the abuse while still in the care of their molesters, but child welfare workers did little to investigate and just moved them to other foster homes where they encountered new abusers.
Spokespeople from the state Department of Children and Families did not respond to a request for comment.
Several men received settlements for sexual abuse they endured while in state-run homes decades ago.
One said four male employees and two male residents at the New Lisbon Developmental Center, a state-run home in Burlington County for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, sexually assaulted him starting in 1950, when he was 8 years old, until he aged out of the system at 18. He received a $3.5 million payout. Another man who alleged he was abused at New Lisbon, where he was placed in 1987 at age 8, received $99,000 to settle his lawsuit.
Abuse also occurred at the now-shuttered Arthur Brisbane Child Treatment Center in Monmouth County, according to a man who said he was 13 in 1983 when an employee there began molesting him. That employee, Thomas Grisard, was later convicted, and the state paid the victim $750,000 last year to resolve his lawsuit.
Beyond those cases, public transit continued to fuel the most lawsuits against the state, with complaints lodged about passengers injured in bus and rail accidents, workers hurt on the job, and pedestrians and bicyclists injured or killed by NJ Transit buses. People also sued over medical malpractice at public hospitals, faulty roads and bridges, workplace discrimination and harassment, mistreatment by police and prison guards, and civil rights violations.
The $177.9 million the state paid to settle lawsuits last year was $56 million more than it paid in 2023 to resolve 364 claims and the highest since 2021, when 287 lawsuits cost the state $196 million.
Thirty-five cases cost the state $1 million or more, representing 73% of the total disbursed. The largest payout — $12.5 million — went to Shelley Pritchett, a former correctional officer for the Juvenile Justice Commission who said her bosses forced her to resign after she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.
Plenty of people settled for peanuts, too, with the smallest payout, $150, going to an East Orange man who said he was hurt when another car hit the NJ Transit bus in which he was riding.
Cases that resulted in payouts last year include:

Dion Miller, who spent 20 years in prison for an elderly neighbor’s murder. Miller maintained his innocence and was exonerated in 2023. The state paid him $995,000 to settle his lawsuit.
Scott Lupia was a locomotive engineer who alerted his supervisors to a broken air conditioner in his cab one sultry day in July 2020. His bosses ordered him to continue working even though temperatures hit 114 degrees in his cab, according to his suit. He passed out at the controls 40 minutes after leaving Penn Station, hitting his head and suffering career-ending injuries, the suit says. The state paid him almost $12.4 million after he won his case at trial.
Zenaida Gonzalez received $4 million after child welfare workers took her baby because she was struggling with an abusive partner and mental health challenges. The baby, Alison Chavez, was 16 months old when she died in 2012 of head trauma while in a foster home.
Donald Turner Jr., a public works employee in Hawthorne, got $3.9 million after a pedestrian bridge where he was clearing snow in March 2019 collapsed onto the roadway below, and he was seriously injured.
Two women who reached out to a state-run crime victim compensation office for help filed lawsuits after an employee sexually harassed them. The state paid one $424,000 and another $400,000 over their claims that Guilherme Jamarino, an employee who was later criminally charged, sent them sexually explicit pictures and videos of himself.
Jasmine Roach received $500,000 for the 2014 sexual assault and murder of her 9-year-old daughter at the hands of a paroled sex offender.
Muhammad Muslih and his family got $3.5 million after computers, cash, jewelry, and more that Montclair police seized from their home during a 2019 search went missing when the family tried to retrieve it after resolving the accusations against them.

 The state made money too

While millions flowed out in lawsuit payouts, almost $430 million went back into state coffers due to the civil enforcement work of the state’s attorneys.
Attorney General Matt Platkin said successful settlements involved environmental cases, consumer issues, taxation matters, and debt recovery actions.
“We’ve stopped scams, halted questionable business practices, and made polluters pay—and in the process we’ve returned hundreds of millions of dollars back to the State and our residents,” Platkin said in a statement. “These results translate into a better quality of life for all New Jerseyans. I will always fight to make sure that costly and damaging misconduct is corrected, whether that stems from polluters, consumer fraud, or others who engage in unlawful business practices.”
The amount recovered last year fell from 2023, when Platkin’s office recouped nearly $600 million. Among 2024’s largest recoveries:

The chemical company Solvay Specialty Polymers USA paid $179.8 million for remediation and natural resource damages stemming from contamination at its Gloucester County facility.
The state received $125 million from Orsted after the wind energy company abandoned plans to build two offshore wind projects in New Jersey’s coastal waters.
New Jersey will get more than $30 million as part of a $700 million nationwide settlement with Johnson & Johnson to resolve complaints stemming from its marketing of talc-based baby powder.
The state received $18.5 million in compensation for groundwater contaminated by the gasoline additive methyl tertiary butyl ether.

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerNational anti-abortion advocates and two Vermont-based crisis pregnancy centers have dropped a 2023 federal lawsuit against the state over a law passed the same year that made the centers, specifically, subject to existing state laws targeting false and misleading advertising. The two centers, and others like them around the country, provide counseling and some basic obstetrics from an anti-abortion perspective.The end of the case came just two weeks after lawmakers made substantial changes to the legal language that prompted the suit in the first place. Gov. Phil Scott signed the changes into law on May 13 as part of a broader package that supporters say will bolster protections for reproductive and gender-affirming health care in the state.The legal group spearheading the suit, Alliance Defending Freedom, claimed in a press release last week that lawmakers amended the 2023 measure — which passed with overwhelming House and Senate support — “as a result” of the group’s litigation. But in interviews this week, legislative leaders said that framing wasn’t accurate.The lawsuit’s plaintiffs included Aspire Now, a pregnancy center in Williston; Branches Pregnancy Resource Center, another in Brattleboro; and National Institute of Family and Life Advocates, a nationwide anti-abortion advocacy nonprofit. Lawyers for the plaintiffs described the 2023 law as “viewpoint discrimination” against the centers. They argued it ran afoul of protections granted by the First Amendment and impinged on the centers’ ability to effectively serve people seeking their support.House Majority Leader Rep. Lori Houghton, D-Essex Junction, seen on the opening day of the Legislature at the Statehouse in Montpelier on Jan. 8, 2025. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerPro-abortion rights advocates, including backers of the 2023 law, have accused crisis pregnancy centers of advertising in a misleading way that lures in patients considering an abortion in hopes of persuading them to change course once they’re in the door.Some of what the plaintiffs took issue with in the 2023 law came in several pages of legislative “findings,” including the assertion that some crisis pregnancy centers “have promoted patently false or biased medical claims about abortion, pregnancy, contraception, and reproductive health care providers.” The law went on to state that a crisis pregnancy center whose advertising was “untrue or clearly designed to mislead the public about the nature of services provided” would be liable for committing “an unfair and deceptive act and practice in commerce.”But the measure enacted last month stripped from state law the specific references to crisis pregnancy centers added two years ago. It also nixed lawmakers’ findings that the centers sometimes provide misleading or outright inaccurate information.Attorney General Charity Clark discusses a settlement between Vermont and 42 other states with Johnson & Johnson, a company that made baby powder with talc in it, during a press conference in Montpelier on June 11, 2024. File photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerInstead, the new law replaced references to the pregnancy centers with more general language stating “any person” who makes false or misleading claims about health care services they provide is subject to the existing laws designed to protect consumers.While lawyers for the centers said the changes were prompted by their lawsuit, Sen. Ginny Lyons, D-Chittenden Southeast — who co-sponsored this year’s law and chairs the Senate Health and Welfare Committee, which reviewed it — disputed that.Lyons said in an interview Tuesday that she thought it was a good idea to broaden the language passed in 2023 to encompass more health care providers than just crisis pregnancy centers — but that idea had nothing to do with the legal challenge. She said she had concerns that preceded the lawsuit with how the language approved in 2023 singled out one type of health care provider. “I’m very glad that we did it. But it was not in response to a lawsuit,” said Lyons, who also helmed the same committee in 2023, speaking about the changes in this year’s law, S.28. “We want to ensure that anyone who is working in this arena has high ethical standards — and adheres to those ethical standards.”She also noted crisis pregnancy centers would still be subject to false and misleading advertising statutes under the latest law, even though they aren’t named explicitly.Vermont House Majority Leader Lori Houghton, D-Essex Junction, who chaired the House Health Care Committee in 2023 and still sits on the panel this year, also pushed back against the characterization that the changes were prompted by the lawsuit, saying, “I do not agree with it at all.”Houghton added that legislators heard testimony from a number of different witnesses about the changes — some for, and others against — before approving them. Supporters included Planned Parenthood of Northern New England, which wrote in a late March memo to the House committee that it was “pleased to see these standards elevated for all medical professionals.”The majority leader noted, though, she was “personally disappointed” that some of the legislative “findings” about crisis pregnancy centers were removed from the law this year. Alliance Defending Freedom did not respond to a request for comment this week about its decision to drop the lawsuit. The conservative, Christian legal group is based in Arizona and played a key role in the successful effort to overturn Roe v. Wade in 2022. Crisis pregnancy centers have expanded their reach in recent years as abortion clinics have been shuttering at the same time. The centers ramped up activity after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade. Without a nationwide right to an abortion and with dozens of states outlawing or restricting access to the procedure, the centers have proliferated to fill the void. With that expanded reach, though, has come intensifying scrutiny of the facilities, particularly for their advertising strategies. There are seven such facilities in Vermont, according to the Crisis Pregnancy Center Map, a project of the University of Georgia.Vermont Attorney General Charity Clark’s office had been defending the state in the lawsuit. Clark wrote in an emailed statement Tuesday she was “pleased” the suit had been pulled.She also signalled support for the changes enacted this month, saying that when she testified to legislators as the 2023 law was being written, she supported “a broader bill that more closely aligns with the changes” legislators made recently.“I will always support strong consumer protection laws that prohibit lying, misrepresentation, and obfuscation across all sectors of Vermont’s economy,” Clark wrote.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Anti-abortion advocates drop federal lawsuit against Vermont after lawmakers nix language targeting crisis pregnancy centers.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ginny-lyons-1-20250416-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-06-05 07:02:20.155822

The Vargas endorsement also followed Cavanaugh saying he has a “stronger record of being a leader in the Legislature” than Vargas. 
Vargas, a Democrat who represented South Omaha in the Legislature and on the Omaha Public Schools board, narrowly lost twice to U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., with the 2024 margin being less than two percentage points.  
“Denise’s leadership and proven record of bringing people together to solve our toughest problems is why I’m proud to support her campaign for Congress,” Vargas said. 
Powell said she wants to build on the energy and enthusiasm Vargas brought to his House races.
“It is a tremendous honor to have the support of a dedicated public servant, leader and friend like Tony Vargas,” Powell said. 
Powell already has secured endorsements from some Cavanaugh colleagues in the Legislature from Omaha’s State Sens. Margo Juarez and Dunixi Guereca, and other elected officials in the district, which includes all of Douglas and Saunders Counties and parts of suburban Sarpy County. Cavanaugh’s new campaign has yet to announce any endorsements.

Powell and Cavanaugh are the two highest-profile Democratic candidates in the race so far. Also running are Mark Johnston and Evangelos Argyrakis.
Powell is running as an outsider, but she has the support of some top local Democratic donors from her time leading the nonpartisan nonprofit Women Who Run, a group that encouraged more women to consider running for office and equipped them with the tools to do so.
Cavanaugh is part of a local political dynasty, seeking to follow his father into the same 2nd District seat he held in the late 1970s. His sister, State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh, serves in the Legislature alongside him.
In her statement responding to Cavanaugh’s announcement, Powell didn’t mention the senator by name but said, “Nebraskans deserve better than lip service from career politicians.”
“I’m running to bring courage and common sense back to DC,” Powell said in the statement. 
She also received the endorsement from Square One Politics, a group focused on recruiting and discovering young, diverse, progressive candidates. Vargas became the group’s executive director earlier this year.

Whoever emerges from the 2026 Democratic primary will have to navigate Nebraska’s most politically divided and diverse district, with a slight GOP tilt. 
National and state Democrats have been using the recent Omaha mayoral race as evidence of growing voter “energy” against President Donald Trump and political fuel for the congressional midterms.
Bacon has said both Democrats are too progressive to represent a purple district. Republicans are waiting on Bacon to decide whether to run again. Bacon has said he would announce this summer whether he would retire from Congress.

Kurtis Gregory of Marshall is sponsoring the bill to set aside state tax money to finance new and renovated stadiums for Kansas City sports teams (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Gov. Mike Kehoe expanded the agenda of the special session Wednesday enough to win Missouri Senate passage of bills with money for disaster recovery in St. Louis, changes to property taxes policies and tax incentives to finance new or improved stadiums in Kansas City. 
Initially scheduled to go in at 10 a.m., the Senate finally convened about seven hours later. Talks over what sweeteners Kehoe needed to get his key objective — tax incentives to finance new or renovated stadiums for the Kansas City Chiefs and Royals —- culminated in his revised agenda.
“After productive conversations with members of the Missouri General Assembly this week, we are amending our special session call to allow for additional legislation in the areas of disaster relief, tax policy, and budget investments,” Kehoe said in a news release. “We appreciate legislators working together to use this as an opportunity to show up for our communities by acting swiftly to help those in crisis, while also making smart decisions that secure opportunity for the future.”
Under the constitutional limits on a special session, the governor must “state specifically each matter on which action is deemed necessary.” Any attempt to address an issue not listed in the call for the session can be ruled out of order.
The special session began Monday and can continue for up to 60 days. Kehoe is seeking quick action because both teams have offers from Kansas to relocate.
The spending bill passed 23-10 in the early morning on Thursday, winning with a coalition of Democrats and Republicans with only Republicans opposed. The bill to finance the stadiums went to the House on a 19-13 vote, with three Democrats joining 10 Republicans in opposition.  
For several hours the chamber stalled on the stadium bill, working late into the night. The bill includes all the tax provisions necessary to finance the stadiums, plus disaster relief provisions and an expansion of a tax credit program supporting amateur sporting events.

Shortly before 1 a.m., the impasse cleared and bill sponsored by state Sen. Kurtis Gregory was given initial approval. Within a few hours, the final votes were held and the Senate adjourned until June 16.
For several hours, debate focused on a proposal from state Sen. Joe Nicola, a Republican from Independence, to freeze the maximum increase in annual property tax bills at 5% in some counties.
  State Sen. Tracy McCreery, a Democrat from Olivette, took a vocal stand Wednesday night opposing state funding for stadiums in Kansas City and St. Louis. She is show during the May 14 session when Republicans used a procedural move to shut down debate on a constitutional amendment to ban abortion (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
Then state Sen. Tracy McCreery, a Democrat from Olivette, said she had heard enough.
“This discussion that we’ve had the last several hours is just an effort for the governor to try to get a couple of votes out of the Freedom Caucus for the stadium funding scheme,” McCreery said.
She said Kehoe agreed to Nicola’s amendment and added it to the call to wear down opposition. Then she blamed Kehoe and Republicans for using a procedural move to shut down debate during the regular session on an abortion ban and repeal of the sick leave law approved by voters in November.
Kehoe could have had the stadium plan passed if the procedural move was not used, McCreery said. 
“Here we are tonight, masquerading that we care about people and the amount of money that they’re paying for things,” McCreery said. 
Democrats don’t trust Republicans, she said, and the Senate should not trust the House. Until the appropriation bill, which totals $361 million including $175 million in general revenue, passes the House.
The House refused to pass a bill with $235 million of the same projects and $282 million of additional spending during the session. House Republican leaders waited for the Senate to adjourn on the last day for passing appropriations before revealing that the bill would be spiked. 
“We should not be doing anything until (the spending bill is passed) and over the House, and then the House has to have it on its way to the governor before we should be taking any action on anything else,” McCreery said.
The stadium funding plan would allocate state taxes collected from economic activity at Arrowhead and Kauffman to bond payments for renovations at Arrowhead and a new stadium for the Royals in Jackson or Clay counties.
The cost is estimated at close to $1.5 billion over 30 years.
State Sen. Kurtis Gregory, a Republican from Marshall and sponsor of the stadium bill, said the public support for keeping the Chiefs and Royals in Missouri was both a good economic investment and a good investment in the state’s image.
“What’s at stake if those teams go across the state line is over $2 billion of economic activity inside of the state of Missouri, over 13,000 jobs, and we just let the state of Kansas poach the pride and joy of the western side of the state,” Gregory said.
The teams must give Kansas an answer by June 30 on an offer to pay 70% of the cost of new stadiums. Missouri’s offer is to cover about half the cost.
Some senators have grumbled that the teams should make a commitment to stay in Missouri if the bill is passed. Gregory said their desire to stay should be apparent.
“I also contend that the teams want to stay in Missouri, because if they wanted to go to Kansas, I believe they would have already signed on the dotted line to move those teams,” Gregory said.
The spending bill was increased because of demands from St. Louis Democrats that Kehoe address the uncertainty over when or whether President Donald Trump will declare a federal disaster for the May 16 St. Louis tornado.
That brought a new $100 million appropriation for storm victims in the city of St. Louis. Previously, the disaster provisions in the call — $25 million for the Missouri Housing Trust Fund to be distributed by the Missouri Housing Development Commission and a tax credit for amounts paid as insurance deductibles — were all applied equally to counties included in disaster requests. Kehoe has submitted four storm events this spring, with damage in 37 counties, to Trump for disaster requests. Two have been granted.
The magnitude of the St. Louis tornado — a 22-mile path of destruction that cost five Missouri lives and damaged an estimated $1.6 billion in property damage — surpasses all other damage so far in the state.
Damage to public property in the two disasters that have been declared is estimated at $52 million.
The other new money added to the spending bill settled an issue for state Sen. Stephen Webber, a Democrat from Columbia. A state contribution to the new research reactor at the University of Missouri, which Kehoe cut from $50 million to $25 million to find money for disaster aid, was returned to $50 million.
  Sen. Mike Moon, R-Ash Grove, speaks in defense of Freedom Caucus members during a May 14, 2024, debate. (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
The only opposition to the spending bill on the floor came from state Sen. Mike Moon, a Republican from Ash Grove, who said the university should tap its $1.4 billion endowment to pay for the reactor. 
And Moon said he didn’t like the disaster relief funds.
“The money that is going to be received by those who were hurt is nowhere near the amount that’s going to cause them to be compensated and fully restored,” Moon said.
If the state starts paying to repair property after storms, he said, people will not buy insurance.
“I don’t think some of this is the proper function of government,” Moon said. “Compassion, certainly. But unless people take personal responsibility and do the things they should be doing so that we don’t have to, when is this going to end?”
The tax change Nicola is trying to enact would cap increases in real property tax bills at 5% every two years, corresponding to the reassessment cycle. Officials in 34 counties would have the option of putting the cap in place through a ballot measure.
The proposal is a response to rapid increases in property values and the resulting increase in tax bills. There was no estimate available of the potential cost to local governments. Nicola said there were enough protections to make sure all current revenue is maintained and new voter-approved levies are paid.
“Our property tax system in this state, in my opinion, is a disaster,” Nicola said.
The amendment is the price of his vote, he told the Senate.
“I am a hard no on the stadium tax bill unless we get some solid property tax relief for my people in Jackson County,” Nicola said. “I told the governor of this on Monday I can count on one hand how many of my constituents want me to vote for the stadium.”

The vending machines are part of an effort to see “less people losing their lives from substance use,” the executive director of Addison County’s Turning Point Center said.

Turning Point is a nonprofit organization with 12 satellite locations around the state that focuses on helping people through addiction recovery.The dispensers will also provide fentanyl and xylazine test strips, educational harm reduction kits, first aid kits and hygiene supplies such as socks, toothbrush, toothpaste, sunscreen, bug spray and hand sanitizer, Wallace said.The two vending machines in Middlebury and Bristol, both in Addison County, are funded through a $100,000 grant from the Vermont Department of Health. The Turning Point Center determined which supplies to offer after assessing the highest needs of the community and will continue to rotate supplies as needs change, Stephanie Busch, injury prevention program director at the Vermont Health Department, said in a statement to VTDigger. An external disposal container for sharp items is available alongside the vending machine, she said.“Placement of these vending machines ensures more flexible and responsive access to supplies and treatment services information to better serve the whole community,” Busch said.While people struggle with addiction across the state, Wallace said resources are often sent to Vermont’s more densely populated areas. “In rural communities, resources are always lacking,” she said. The vending machines will complement the Turning Point of Addison County’s other addiction recovery related-work, such as the recovery coaching program and a street outreach program, which primarily serves the region’s unhoused population, Wallace said. Overall opioid-related deaths fell in the state in 2024, but xylazine-related deaths rose 10%, from 32% in 2023 to 42% in 2024, according to a Vermont Department of Health report. Efforts to offer free and readily available overdose prevention resources are important to continue to reduce drug-related deaths, save lives and help people on the path to addiction recovery, Wallace said.“I think that education, advocacy and access to resources is a huge piece of what’s driving this reduction in overdose deaths,” Wallace said. “This is our effort and strategy to continue that reduction and to continue seeing less people losing their lives from substance use.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Free, 24-hour naloxone vending machine opens in Middlebury, Bristol to come.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Narcan-Naloxone-Opioids-Nasal-Spray-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-06-05 07:02:20.155822

The nonprofit, which serves 93 counties across Nebraska and Iowa, is concerned about the impacts of potential cuts to federal food assistance, particularly in rural areas (Photo courtesy of Food Bank for the Heartland).People in Marsha Keene’s community are already struggling to cover the basics.
Most of the clients Keene serves at the Susanna Wesley Family Learning Center in southeast Missouri are working but still rely on federal food assistance to keep up with ever-increasing costs.
The center provides a domestic violence shelter, parenting education and summer camps to struggling families stretched thin by living expenses. Keene, the center’s CEO, worries about how her clients can absorb significant cuts to food stamps, officially called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.
“I don’t see communities just being able to absorb that need,” she said. “I don’t know what the impact is going to be yet, but I cannot imagine that it’s going to be good.”
Billions in cuts to federal food assistance are looming as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a major tax and spending package that would slash federal spending on domestic programs to extend tax cuts passed during President Donald Trump’s first term. U.S. House Republicans passed the package in a 215-214 vote, and it’s now before the Senate.
Cuts to SNAP would affect residents of every state in all types of communities, but advocates fear the fallout could especially hit rural people, who are more dependent on food stamps, the largest anti-hunger program in the nation.
The legislation that passed the House would cut food assistance by an estimated $300 billion, according to the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. One key provision of the bill would expand work requirements to include people between 55 and 64 years old and those with children aged 7 or older. It would also tighten rules for counties with high unemployment rates.
Together, the changes would remove more than 3 million Americans from the program in an average month, reducing spending by more than $92 billion over 10 years, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
The legislation will likely face changes in Senate negotiations. The measure was endorsed in a letter signed by 20 of the nation’s 27 Republican governors.
A greater share of rural residents currently rely on SNAP than those in metropolitan areas, according to the Food Research & Action Center, a nonprofit focusing on hunger and health among the impoverished. Rural hunger is already on the rise and grocery stores face an uphill battle to keep going in the most isolated parts of the country.
In her corner of Missouri, Keene said, limited job opportunities leave many workers struggling to cover housing and grocery bills. Nearly a quarter of residents live below the poverty line in Mississippi County — almost double the state and national averages.
She recalled her own recent trip to the grocery store, where high prices caused her to forgo items on her list such as orange juice and meat. “And I have a pretty good job,” she said.
“The SNAP cuts are definitely going to make an impact because we already have hungry kids.”
 ‘I’d probably close the doors’

The National Grocers Association has opposed the potential cuts, saying SNAP provides not only critical food, but also meaningful boosts to local employment and economies. The organization, which represents retail and wholesale grocers, said cuts will particularly hurt independent and rural stores.
“Cutting SNAP would harm the most vulnerable Americans and threaten the viability of community grocery stores that are depended upon by their local economies and neighborhoods,” the association said in a May statement.
Facing competitive pressures from online retailers and big-box stores with lower prices, rural grocery stores are already struggling to remain viable.
But deep cuts to SNAP would have an uneven impact on rural stores.
For Kay Voss, the cuts would be catastrophic at her Stratton Country Market in southwest Nebraska. She estimates 40% of sales are paid for with SNAP.
“I’d probably close the doors,” she said.
That’s a possibility with or without federal changes: Struggling to turn a profit in the town of about 340 people, Voss said the market likely won’t last much longer.
“There’s nothing to be made on the grocery side,” she said.
Several grocery store operators interviewed by Stateline were more optimistic. Some said they believed locals were using their federal benefits at chains in nearby cities for cheaper prices or anonymity.
Tasha Malay, one of the owners of Malay’s Market in western Kansas, said SNAP made up less than 2% of the store’s sales last year.
While she believes cuts to the federal program are “a terrible idea” broadly, she said it won’t make a huge difference for her store.
“I think the people that qualify are utilizing it, but I think that they’re spending the dollars elsewhere,” she said.
Profit margins are famously slight in the grocery industry, especially for rural stores facing an onslaught of competition from dollar stores whose bulk purchasing allows them to offer much lower prices.
“When they’re operating on such thin margins anyways, that could have a huge impact on whether or not the store can remain open,” said Carlie Jonas, a policy associate at the nonprofit Center for Rural Affairs.
The center has worked with lawmakers to preserve rural grocery stores, which provide locals with social connections in addition to fresh meat and produce. Proposed legislation to fund $2 million in rural grocery assistance did not win approval from the Nebraska legislature because of the state’s challenging budget cycle, Jonas said.
That figure, though, pales in comparison to new costs Nebraska could face if the proposed SNAP changes are enacted.
One component of the federal legislation would shift billions of costs from the federal government to states to administer SNAP.
A Nebraska-based think tank estimates the state would have to spend at least $39 million a year to make up for the lost federal funds.
“Every single state is going to have to make some really difficult decisions,” Jonas said.
In Wisconsin, state officials estimate the changes would cost the state $314 million per year.
“This is over a quarter billion dollars each year that Wisconsin couldn’t use for our health care, our roads, our schools, or our economy,” Wisconsin Medicaid Director Bill Hanna said in a May statement.
U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, downplayed the impacts of the changes.
“We are not cutting SNAP,” he said May 25 on CBS News’ political show “Face the Nation.” “We’re working in the elements of fraud, waste and abuse. SNAP for example, listen to the statistics, in 2024, over $11 billion in SNAP payments were erroneous.”
A PolitiFact breakdown published May 29 disputed Johnson’s remarks, concluding that three independent analyses show millions of people could lose SNAP benefits.
 ‘It’s time to sound the alarm’

Food insecurity is already on the rise in rural America.
Even in heartland areas where farming is central to the local economy, many have trouble accessing fresh and affordable food.
“We’re seeing food insecurity across the entire state rise, but really disproportionately in our more rural areas,” said Tim Williams, government affairs and advocacy officer at Food Bank for the Heartland, an Omaha, Neb.-based nonprofit serving 93 counties across Nebraska and Iowa.
Williams said cuts to the SNAP program will drive up demand on food banks, especially in rural areas that have long struggled with access and transportation to secure fresh foods. In sparsely populated areas such as western Nebraska, it’s difficult to get to grocery stores — if they exist at all.
“There are counties in the state where there are more cows than people, and so things are very spread out,” he said. “They can be very difficult to get to. Sometimes there’s only one pantry or one grocery store in a county.”
The federal food program works in tandem with food banks to keep people from going hungry, Williams said. And cuts to federal aid will unquestionably affect nonprofits.
“It will put a disproportionate burden on the charitable food system that they can’t sustain because they’re already seeing too many people,” he said.
Susie Boelter, executive director of the North Country Food Bank, said it’s time to expand food assistance — not cut it. She told the North Dakota Monitor her nonprofit has experienced “staggering increases” in need over the past three years.
For every meal the food bank provides across its 21-county service area in North Dakota, SNAP provides nine, she said.
“Any additional cuts will put a ton of pressure on our emergency food system,” Boelter said. “Food banks are good at getting food into the hands of people who need it, but it’s time to sound the alarm.”

A new report puts us among the top 10 states for tech manufacturing growth. But proposed federal budget changes could undercut our economic competitiveness by weakening one of our most important tools for ensuring we have the talent to remain competitive: the federal Pell Grant.
More than 92,000 Missourians used the Pell Grant last year to pursue a postsecondary degree or credential, from recent high school graduates to working adults seeking new skills or career changes. The Pell Grant, the foundation of need-based federal student aid, helps cover tuition at public and private institutions for low- and moderate-income students. Most recipients come from families earning less than $40,000 a year, and many juggle jobs, caregiving responsibilities and coursework to pursue their education.
Congress is currently negotiating the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” a budget package that includes income tax cut extensions and significant reductions in federal education funding. The U.S. House’s proposal, which advanced in May, includes Pell Grant eligibility restrictions that could cut access to this critical source of aid for 66,960 Missouri students. An estimated 21,050 Missouri students would lose their Pell Grant entirely, threatening their ability to pursue and complete their education and training.
The U.S. Senate is actively working to finalize these cuts. If the changes proposed in the House bill are enacted, students would be required to take 30 credit hours per semester to receive a full Pell award, up from the current 24.
While that may seem like a relatively small change, it’s a huge deal for students working while in school, those with family responsibilities, and those who can’t afford to take a fifth class. For them, this is a $1,500 annual cut.
If Missouri is committed to business growth, we must also invest in the talent pipeline to drive that growth. Each additional postsecondary graduate generates 5.6 additional support jobs and contributes roughly $111,832 to Missouri’s GDP. We all benefit when everyone has access to training and education to pursue their choice of a rewarding career. For many students, the Pell Grant is what makes these pathways possible.
Missouri’s students shouldn’t have to take on a mountain of debt to build skills for in-demand, high-wage jobs. The Pell Grant puts education within reach. Cutting it now would slow our progress and threaten our economic success. Congress should protect and strengthen the Pell Grant, not cut it.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/student-loan-debt.jpeg,,,2025-06-05 07:02:20.155822

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Less than 24 hours after Aisha Braveboy declared victory in the special election for Prince George’s County executive, the Democrat and current county state’s attorney is already making moves.
Braveboy announced Wednesday that Maxene Bardwell will serve as chief administrative officer and second-in-command for the county. Bardwell, a Prince George’s resident, currently works as an internal audit manager in the Montgomery County Executive’s office.
“I consider this offer to be just an example of forward thinking by County Executive-elect Braveboy to make sure that she has best-in-class skill and experience in her administration working for the people of Prince George’s County,” Bardwell said in a statement.
Braveboy’s will not be official until next week, as election officials are still counting and certifying votes. But in election night returns, the latest posted by county officials, she had just over 89% of the vote over Republican challenger Jonathan White.
But event before Tuesday’s election, after surviving a nine-candidate Democratic primary in March, Braveboy had pulled together a preliminary transition team comprised of some top elected officials and business and community leaders.
The team included transition co-chairs include Attorney General Anthony Brown (D) and Bowie State University President Aminta Breaux, Capitol Connections President Michael Arrington and High-Quality Care Nursing CEO Joy Davis.  About a dozen people are on an executive committee that includes state Sen. C. Anthony Muse (D-Prince George’s), Del. Joseline Peña-Melnyk (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel) and Erek Barron, former U.S. Attorney for Maryland.
Braveboy’s transition team also notes various committee co-chairs, including At-Large Councilmember Calvin Hawkins (D) to serve on a group dealing with Corrections and Returning Citizens Services, and former county executive County Executive Rushern L. Baker III, co-chair of a committee to assess the county’s finances, government structure and operational efficiency. Both Hawkins and Baker ran against Braveboy in the March primary.
State Sen. Ron Watson (D-Prince George’s) will co-chair a committee focused on education, employment and workforce development.
If her victory is confirmed, Braveboy would be sworn in on June 19, the Juneteenth holiday.
Shoemaker shuffles off
When Carroll County voters go to elect a state’s attorney in 2026, current State’s Attorney Haven Shoemaker Jr. will not be an option. Shoemaker, a Republican, announced Monday that he will not seek reelection after serving one term as the county’s top prosecutor.
In a statement released by his office, Shoemaker said that serving as state’s attorney “has been the honor of a lifetime,” but added that “at this point in my life, it’s time to let someone else have a try.”

“By the time I leave office, I will have been an attorney for 34 years and will have held political office for 30,” his statement said. “It is time for me to spend some quality time with my wife, Patty, at long last. She has made tremendous sacrifices as I pursued careers in both the law and politics, and without her support, I would not have accomplished anything.”
Shoemaker was born in Baltimore but moved with his family to North East where he attended high school before earning a bachelor’s degree in political science from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, in 1987. After two years in the Army National Guard, he attended Widener University School of Law, graduating with honors in 1992, and opened his own law practice in Hampstead in 1994.
His political career began with election to the Hampstead Town Council 1997, followed by election as major in 2003, a job he held until 2010, when he was elected to the Carroll County Commission. Shoemaker was elected to the House of Delegates in 2014 and served from 2015 to 2023, serving as minority whip in 2022. He was elected to his current position in 2022.
“I still have a year and a half left of my term. I will continue to work diligently for you during this time as I have over the last 30 plus years,” his statement said. “The people of Carroll County deserve nothing less.”
Brown adds Maryland to more lawsuits
Has Maryland moved from friend of the court to best friend of the court?
Attorney General Anthony Brown said Wednesday that Maryland has signed on to friend of the court briefs in two separate federal lawsuits in as many days.
Maryland was one of 19 states and the District of Columbia that filed an amicus curiae — friend of the court — brief on Tuesday urging the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to uphold Michigan’s ban on “conversion therapy,” the medically discredited therapy that claims to convert the sexual orientation or gender identity of LGBTQ individuals. A federal district court upheld Michigan’s law restricting the therapy, but that ruling was appealed by the therapist and the Catholic Charities group in southeastern Michigan that sued to overturn the law.
Maryland banned the use of conversion therapy on minors in 2018, one of 25 states with laws on the books — Arizona and Pennsylvania have prohibitions issued through executive orders — restricting such therapy.
The Michigan brief said all the states “have strong interests in regulating the practice of health care, including care relating to mental health, within their boundaries to protect public health and safety. Amici States additionally share compelling interests in protecting the health, safety, and well-being of children and youth, and in affirming the dignity and equal worth and treatment of LGBTQI+ minors.”
Maryland, other states, take more legal actions against Trump administration

And Maryland was one 18 states and the District that filed an amicus brief Wednesday urging the full 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to reconsider a ruling by a three-judge panel of the court in a Voting Rights Act case brought by a tribe in North Dakota.
The Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians sued the state of North Dakota in 2021, claiming that the state’s redistricting plan illegally diluted Native American voting strength in violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. A federal district judge agreed and ordered the state to redraw its districts, and when it did not, the judge imposed the tribe’s recommended redistricting plan.
But on appeal, a panel of the circuit court overturned that ruling, finding that Section 2 applies to states and other governments, but does not confer a right on private individuals to bring a legal challenge.
The Turtle Mountain brief argues that not only does Section 2 allow private actions in voting rights cases, but participation by private groups is critical to protecting those rights.
“Private parties are instrumental in identifying voting-related issues, and for decades, private actions have been a welcome and necessary supplement to state efforts to ensure legal compliance,” the brief said, supplementing federal prosecutors and state officials who may not have the resources to pursue voting rights cases. “Private parties are typically best equipped to identify and pursue violations. They have extensive on-the-ground knowledge and develop the necessary connections with stakeholders and community members to build cases.”
Annapolis mayoral hopefuls to debate
With Annapolis Mayor Gavin Buckley term-limited after serving two four-year terms, voters may be starting to think about the next mayor, who will be chosen this fall. Residents have a chance to hear the two announced candidates so far at a mayoral debate next week.
The June 10 debate between two Democrats, Alderwoman Rhonda Pindell Charles and former Alderman Jared Littmann, is being hosted by the Caucus of African American Leaders at the Wiley H. Bates Legacy Center.
Carl Snowden, convener of the caucus, wrote in email Monday that topics up for discussion include affordable housing, DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) programs and other matters affecting the city. Another topic could be sanctuary cities: Annapolis was one of 10 municipalities in Maryland identified by the Trump administration last month as sanctuary jurisdictions, along with eight counties and the state itself. The administration has threatened federal funding for the more than 500 jurisdictions it identified nationwide.
Snowden said his group will have a monthly meeting one hour before the debate scheduled to start at 6 p.m.

	“We contend that an informed electorate is the key to an effective democracy,” Snowden said. “We commend all candidates who are running for public office. They are willing to be scrutinized, chastised, and criticized in their pursuit of serving the public.”
Littman, who served on the city council for five years until his term ended in 2017, declared his candidacy in January 2024. He has also worked as an associate county attorney in Montgomery County and served on the national board of True Value Hardware.
Pindell Charles, a retired prosecutor and member of the council since 2009, seeks to make history as the city’s first elected Black mayor. Alderman John Thomas Chambers Jr. (R), who was Black, served on an interim basis for two months in 1981, following the suicide of Mayor Gustav Akerland (R).
Candidates have until July 28 to file for the Nov. 4 election, according to the city’s election calendar. The caucus plans to hold a candidate’s forum after the deadline for any contested city council races in the city’s eight wards.

(Photo by Seth Wenig/The Associated Press)Over the past few months, Celina Damian’s phone has been ringing off the hook with one bewildered, anxious question after another: “What kind of loan is this?” “Am I in default?” “Will the government really take my wages?”
“Sometimes they just don’t know where to start,” said Damian, California’s student loan servicing ombudsperson.
“I’m talking to borrowers from all ages, from new borrowers to — I have 80-, 90-year-old borrowers,” she said.
The federal government last month restarted collections on defaulted loans. State student loan ombudspersons such as Damian have become some of the only sources of contact for worried borrowers lost in a tangle of conflicting information at the federal level about their loan status and repayment options.
The U.S. Department of Education began collecting on defaulted student loans in May for the first time since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020.
Federal student loans issued by the U.S. Department of Education come with fixed rates, set repayment plans and borrower protections. Private servicers handle billing, repayment-plan enrollments and defaults.
More than 5 million borrowers are in delinquency, and nearly 10 million — about 25% of the federal student loan portfolio — are at risk of default within months, according to data from the U.S. Department of Education.
States can’t cancel that debt, but they do register and oversee servicers operating in their states, run ombuds offices, tweak tax rules and offer outreach or limited grants — actions aimed at reducing defaults and the economic fallout.
When borrowers default, states will likely feel the economic impact. They might lose tax revenue as homebuying stalls. They could end up paying more for Medicaid and social services if borrowers need to rely on them. And students with loan debt may be reluctant to go into lower-paying public-sector work, leading to staffing shortages at state agencies.
A borrower is considered delinquent after missing a payment to the servicing companies that handle billing, repayment plan enrollments, and defaults.
Damian’s office, established under California’s Student Borrower Bill of Rights, began as a narrow statutory role but now serves as a hub for outreach, “Student Loan 101” workshops and escalated complaints to federal agencies.
Roughly 16 states plus the District of Columbia have followed suit, creating ombuds offices to guide borrowers through confusing paperwork and misinformation. Damian believes these ombuds offices should be in every state, as borrowers across the country will likely have similar questions and little help at the federal level.
“If you don’t have an ombudsperson or even just a person at the state level who can educate borrowers, that will make a difference,” Damian told Stateline. “These borrowers are trying to pay, but the system is broken. No other financial product works this way.”
Student loans became a key issue during last year’s election race, with President Joe Biden blocked by the U.S. Supreme Court in his effort to offer relief to 40 million Americans. In its waning days, his administration did forgive loans for some 150,000 borrowers under previous programs.
But President Donald Trump opposes most loan forgiveness programs, and in May, the U.S. Education Department issued a “Dear Colleague” letter to higher education institutions, reminding them of their legal obligations to help former students understand repayment responsibilities and access support.
Some conservative economists say that federal loan forgiveness and financial aid hurt all students, offering colleges an incentive to raise tuition or lower their own institutional aid.
Winston Berkman-Breen, the legal director at the Student Borrower Protection Center, a nonprofit aimed at protecting borrowers and improving the repayment system, said that more than 2 million borrowers are stuck in a backlog of unprocessed applications for income-driven repayment (IDR) plans — calculated pay structures meant to keep payments affordable based on a borrower’s income.
Other borrowers have called federal agencies for help only to find that U.S. Education Department staff, including servicer-oversight teams, have been laid off as the Trump administration works toward dismantling the department entirely.
“There was an expectation to repay,” Berkman-Breen said. “But there was also an expectation that people would have access to affordable plans. That promise has broken down.”
States now have three primary tools to address student loan debt, Berkman-Breen said: enforcement actions to protect consumers, such as the 39-state lawsuit against servicer Navient; legal oversight by suing to uphold or challenge federal policy; and direct outreach to help public servants access Public Service Loan Forgiveness and similar programs.
Nineteen states now require registration for companies that service student loans, he said. And more than a dozen states align with federal policy to exempt forgiven loan balances from state income taxes.
‘Can’t wait for Washington’ 
Connecticut state Rep. Eleni Kavros DeGraw, a Democrat, calls student debt “a drag on the economy,” and said states can’t afford to wait for Congress — mired in partisan gridlock over student loan forgiveness — to find common ground.
“[Student debt] is stopping people from buying homes, starting families and fully participating in the economy,” she told Stateline. “That hurts us as a state, as a city, and we can’t wait for Washington to figure it out.”
Last year, Connecticut created a bipartisan reimbursement program that provides up to $20,000 for graduates of local colleges who make payments and complete community service. The state has distributed more than $2 million so far.
Kavros DeGraw hopes the program can serve as a model, and has already talked with lawmakers in other states on possibly developing their own versions of it.
“These were people who were already paying,” Kavros DeGraw said. “It just made sense. I think it’s something that other states could explore this session, and it would provide an immense deal of relief.”
Lawmakers in other states also have considered student loan legislation. This year, New Jersey introduced bills to register education lenders and cap interest rates. Lawmakers in New Mexico, New York and North Carolina have proposed Borrower Bill of Rights legislation. Arizona has a registration bill for private servicers. None of these measures has advanced far.
According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, more than 20 states have enacted laws expanding loan forgiveness, repayment programs and servicer oversight in recent years.
Several states are also investing directly in workforce-aligned loan forgiveness: Georgia expanded its service-cancelable loan program to cover dental students working in rural areas. Idaho created a loan repayment incentive for rural nurses. Kentucky now offers $5,000 stipends to attract new teachers. Maryland authorized Anne Arundel County to launch a local forgiveness program for public school educators.
Repayment
Student loan stress is not evenly distributed. Seven states, all with Republican‐controlled legislatures, report delinquency rates above 30% among borrowers required to make payments.
Mississippi leads the nation with a conditional delinquency rate of nearly 45% — meaning borrowers who should be making payments are late. That’s just ahead of Alabama, West Virginia, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana, all of which have rates above 31%, according to recent data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
By contrast, Illinois, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Vermont and New Hampshire maintain delinquency rates below 15%.
Experts say this chasm reflects deeper systemic differences, such as lower median incomes in higher delinquency states, along with weaker consumer protections and a higher share of students attending for-profit institutions or leaving college without a degree.
States also have promoted the federal Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, established in 2007, that offers help to public service professionals. New Mexico has an outreach campaign that includes prospective teachers and health care workers. Maine has provided guidance to public defenders on how they can take advantage of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program and touts a related state tax credit on a marketing site to lure new residents.
“States can regulate and enforce, but they can’t fix the structural problems in how repayment is administered,” said Michele Zampini, senior director of college affordability at The Institute for College Access & Success, a research organization that advocates for students. “They’re helping around the edges, but the core system is still broken.”
A November report from the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau found at least 3.9 million borrowers received misleading or inaccurate bills from servicing companies.
“The repayment system is not in a good place to provide the services and repayment options borrowers are legally entitled to,” Zampini said.
The Student Loan Borrower Survey, conducted between October 2023 and January 2024, found that 61% of borrowers who received debt relief made a beneficial life change earlier than they otherwise could have. Yet borrower awareness remains dangerously low: Nearly 42% of federal borrowers have only been on the standard repayment plan, and 31% of those didn’t know other options, such as an income-based plan, existed.
In California, a major part of Damian’s job in the past few months has been to help borrowers access existing forgiveness programs.
Meanwhile, new federal policy proposals could reshape repayment entirely. The Trump-backed One Big Beautiful Bill Act would consolidate existing IDR plans into a single tiered structure, with lower-income borrowers paying flat monthly rates and higher earners contributing 8% of their income. The bill also proposes extending standard repayment terms to 30 years — raising concerns it could delay forgiveness and inflate total interest costs.
The bill passed the U.S. House and is pending in the Senate.
‘Incentive to hike prices’
Andrew Gillen, a Cato Institute research fellow who recently testified before Congress, argues that any meaningful fix must address the incentives driving rising tuition — namely, federal aid being tied directly to college sticker prices.
“The link between rising tuition and increasing aid is what drives the Bennett Hypothesis, where federal student aid, in the form of loans, can lead to higher tuition costs at colleges and universities,” Gillen said in an interview. “If we instead use the median cost of attendance to calculate aid eligibility, we remove colleges’ incentive to hike prices just to capture more aid.”
Even without agreement on blanket forgiveness, experts agree on smaller bipartisan steps: streamlined repayment, stronger servicer oversight and targeted help for borrowers with the greatest need.
“We don’t want people defaulting. We don’t want payments that are too high for people just out of school. That should be the bipartisan starting point,” Zampini said.

A few days later, lawmakers advanced the larger bill — a sweeping list of President Donald Trump’s priorities — but stripped the federal lands provision.
Yet leaders on both sides of the issue say the battle over selling off federal lands is likely just heating up.
Some conservatives in Western states have complained for decades that the feds control too much of the land within their borders. They see a long-awaited opportunity in a Trump administration that’s sympathetic to their cause. Public lands advocates are bracing for more attempts to turn land over to states, industry groups and developers.
“The threat level is red alert,” said Randi Spivak, public lands policy director with the Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental nonprofit. “Some of these states have been champing at the bit for decades to privatize. They’re certainly not going to let this opportunity pass without an aggressive effort.”
 The ‘balance sheet’

In Western states, where most federally owned lands are located, some leaders view these lands as a treasured inheritance — places reserved for all Americans and critical for wildlife, tourism and outdoor recreation. Others feel that too much of the land in their states is controlled by officials in Washington, D.C., leaving it off-limits for development and curtailing its economic value.

Trump officials and allies have embraced the latter view. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum has repeatedly called federal lands America’s “balance sheet,” describing them as untapped assets worth trillions of dollars. He has launched an effort to identify federal lands suitable for housing development.
Other proposals have centered around using land sales to pay for tax breaks or to finance Trump’s proposed government-run fund that could invest in stocks or real estate.
For some state leaders, the newfound interest at the federal level to turn public lands into cash — along with Trump’s cuts to land management agency staff — aligns with a long-standing movement to reduce federal ownership.
“I look at it as an opportunity to say, ‘Hey, turn it over to the state,’” said Utah House Speaker Mike Schultz, a Republican.
Utah leaders have made the most forceful push to challenge federal land ownership. The state filed a legal challenge last year seeking to take control of more than 18 million acres of “unappropriated” lands — parcels held by the federal government without a specific designation such as a national park or monument. That effort hit a roadblock earlier this year when the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the case.
But with Trump in the White House, state leaders may pivot from challenging the feds in court to seeking their cooperation.
“We would love if the federal government just turned it over to us and said, ‘Here, manage these lands,’” Schultz said. “That’s an option as well. Those are discussions that are happening. Everything is on the table.”

Schultz declined to say which federal officials have been involved in discussions about transferring lands to the state.
Some lawmakers in Wyoming backed a state resolution this year — which ultimately failed — calling on Congress to hand over all federal lands except for Yellowstone National Park. Idaho lawmakers passed a measure calling on the feds to turn over a wildlife refuge to the state. And Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo, a Republican, has called for a “systematic release” of federal land in the state.

But public lands also have many supporters in Western states, including some prominent Republican members of Congress, such as Reps. Mike Simpson of Idaho and Ryan Zinke of Montana. Zinke was Interior secretary for two years during the first Trump administration.
John Leshy, who served as solicitor for the U.S. Department of the Interior during the Clinton administration, said proposals to dispose of federal lands tend to be stymied by fierce public backlash.
“Federal lands are really popular,” he said. “It’s political poison [to sell off public land]. It’s a different West now. Public attitudes have changed.”
Leshy also noted that livestock ranchers especially benefit from discounted lease rates offered by the federal government.

 Housing and development arguments

The most recent clash over the future of federal lands was the amendment sponsored by a pair of congressional Republicans last month. The measure would have directed the Bureau of Land Management to sell more than 500,000 acres of land in Nevada and Utah. Local governments would have been able to buy the land at market value, with no restrictions on how they used it.
Backers said the sale would bring in revenue to cover Trump’s proposed tax cuts, while allowing local governments to build much-needed housing on the parcels. Utah GOP Sen. Mike Lee said he will try to revive the measure as the Senate considers the bill this month, E&E News reported.
In Nevada, where 85% of land is owned by the federal government, some leaders say their communities are hemmed in by a checkerboard of public lands that constrain development. The city of Fernley, which is growing rapidly, would have acquired 12,000 acres under the proposal.
“We need housing,” said Benjamin Marchant, Fernley’s city manager. “The city can’t plan roads and water lines, sewer lines and gas lines, when you have federal land between two parcels that want to develop. This will bring a practical and helpful consolidation of all these lands into one developable area.”
Nevada leaders have long worked on proposals to transfer some federal lands to local governments and allow for increased growth. But some lawmakers say the latest push bypassed that collaborative process — and failed to include safeguards that the money raised from the sale of the lands would be reinvested into conserving public lands elsewhere.
“It was a complete betrayal of everything we’ve worked on in this state,” said Assemblymember Howard Watts, a Democrat. “This amendment is trying to sell off half a million acres of Nevada’s public lands in order to pay for tax cuts for billionaires. This is not going to address our housing problem. These lands are positioned to be sold off for other forms of development and extraction.”
Similar debates are happening in Utah. In southwestern Utah’s Washington County, local officials say the disposal of federally controlled land could help alleviate the region’s housing crisis and increasingly strained infrastructure.
The county is experiencing rapid population growth — in 2022, St. George, the county seat, was the fastest-growing metro area in America. County and city leaders hoped the amendment would have helped them manage the growth. The measure would have disposed of roughly 11,500 acres of federally controlled land in Utah, selling it at market value to local governments.
The proposal received pushback from all sides, including environmentalists, hunting and fishing groups, House Democrats and even conservatives.
“[The amendment] is consistent with how U.S. Department of the Interior Secretary Burgum thinks about federal public lands, as simply assets on a ledger to be sold off,” said Steve Bloch, legal director for the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, an environmental nonprofit. ” … It’s just antithetical to how Westerners think about the federal public lands that make up so much of our landscape.”

Washington County Commissioner Adam Snow, a Republican, said a lot of the opposition was misguided. The county would have acquired almost half of the land earmarked for disposal, and Snow said much of that would have been used to widen existing roads and construct new ones that are bordered by Bureau of Land Management property.
“These were not pristine wilderness lands. Some of the environmental groups tried to make it sound like we’re selling off Zion National Park, and that’s not even close to true,” Snow said. “If we can just not have to deal with the federal government every time we want to chip seal a road or improve an intersection, that would be really nice. Because we have to ask ‘Mother, may I?’ for everything out here.”
Local leaders say federal parcels could help ease housing pressures as well. Snow said transferring parcels to the city or county is one of the only ways to stop the area from becoming wildly expensive.
“We’re running out of room real quick,” he said. “ … There is still private land to develop, but they’re going to charge an absolute premium.”
The amendment that was stripped from the House bill was widely criticized for not having any restrictions on what could be done with the land.
“There was no language whatsoever that would require Washington County or St. George to do anything with these lands. They could lease them for development. They could sell them outright,” said Bloch.

 The costs of public lands management

In Utah, lawmakers have created a state Department of Land Management — essentially a placeholder agency that would be funded and staffed only if their effort to assume control of large swaths of federal land succeeds. Schultz, the House speaker, said the state is committed to keeping the lands in the public domain, reopening roads and campgrounds closed by the feds.
“We’d just take over the job from the federal government,” he said. “It is something that the state absolutely would do, and we’d do it more efficiently, more effectively and we’d have better outcomes.”
Schultz said the state could bring in the revenues needed to manage the land by raising lease prices for oil and gas operations on parcels currently managed for drilling.
But some public lands advocates say that’s not realistic. The federal Bureau of Land Management employed more than 950 people in the state as of 2024, and feds also assume the expensive task of wildfire management on their lands.
“If you look at the history of what Utah has done with their lands, they’ve sold more than half of them,” said Devin O’Dea, Western policy and conservation manager with Backcountry Hunters & Anglers. “We’re certainly of the perspective that states could not handle the economic costs of managing these lands. Their hand would be forced; they would have to sell these lands in order to deal with those costs.”
John Robison, Idaho Conservation League public lands and wildlife director, said Simpson — the Idaho congressman — and the state’s two senators have all won praise from constituents for their work on public lands compromises.
“Savvy Idaho politicians know that public lands are popular,” he said.
But other state leaders insist their governments are better equipped to manage the lands. Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador, a Republican, was among the officials who signed an amicus brief in support of Utah’s lawsuit against the feds.
“We live here, we work here, and we are far better stewards of our forests and resources than federal bureaucrats in Washington,” Labrador said in a statement. “ … If Idaho owned this land, we could lease it for timber, grazing, and mining — just like the federal government does — but reinvest that revenue right here in Idaho.”

Sides level charges at one another as society seeks “diversified fundraising” and other changes.
The post Wyoming Historical Society divorces, fights with fundraising partner appeared first on WyoFile .","The Wyoming Historical Society has divorced itself from its longtime fundraising partner, the Wyoming Historical Foundation, saying the breakup is necessary for “diversified funding” and other changes.
The two nonprofits have been closely associated for about 30 years; the society collecting and preserving Wyoming history since 1953 with the foundation raising money and supporting an endowment to promote those efforts.
Now the two entities are at war.
The Historical Society, which publishes the highly regarded Annals of Wyoming, says membership has lagged and that the old organizational structure hamstrings it in supporting all Wyoming organizations interested in preserving and interpreting the state’s history. The foundation contends the new leadership is ripping the nonprofit away from its grassroots base that’s centered on individual county historical groups. At least two of those have reportedly cancelled summer events over the spat.
The fundraising foundation heard complaints from the society’s member chapters — which represent various counties — that the society’s executive director was unresponsive and delinquent in her tasks, Historical Foundation President Ann Chambers Noble of Cora said. The Historical Society hired executive director Alexandra “Aley” Philp a year and a half ago after Executive Secretary Linda Fabian retired.
“Many of the members were disenfranchised.” Ann Chambers Noble
The transition hasn’t worked, Noble said.
“Members would send in a check for their dues, and the check wouldn’t be canceled for six or seven months,” Noble said. “Phone calls would go unanswered. The chapters did not get their tax documents.”
The new Historical Society director Philp said any delays were due to changes the society made as it found itself facing a funding crisis, including sending her out of the office to raise money. To set a new course, the Historical Society is changing from a member- and chapter-based organization, that once included chapters from 22 Wyoming counties, to a donor-based group.
“It was only sustainable for another 3-5 years,” Philp said of the organization’s structure and budget. “Something had to change.”
“Hijacked!”
A bruising battle is ongoing, with Historical Foundation supporters launching a Facebook page that proclaims Philp has “hijacked” the organization. Critics of the Historical Society say that the group’s board, reconstituted after resignations, has broken bylaws as it changed them to allow the society to ditch its membership structure and raise funds independently.
For its part, the Historical Society has distributed emails and statements blasting the critics. The Historical Society and its board members, Philp said, have been subject to resistance, hostility and threats.
Historical Foundation supporters “have expressed their dissatisfaction to change in a very negative manner,” she said.
Depending on who you ask, the spat began last fall either because of Historical Foundation complaints over Philp’s performance or Historical Society efforts to redirect the Historical Foundation’s annual $30,000-$50,000 in donations. That money had been aimed toward savings or an endowment, but the Historical Society wanted to use the funds for other things, Philp said.

Amid the turmoil, the fundraising foundation proposed an audit. The Historical Society said it couldn’t afford one.
The proposed change in use of Historical Foundation funds “was met with a lot of resistance and eventual hostility that led to the attacks on the way we needed to move forward,” Philp said.
In February, the troubles hit the Historical Society executive board as the board passed a no-confidence vote against board president Jessica Flock. The Albany County business owner, educator and historian then resigned. Other board members quickly followed, Philp said.
Those remaining on the Historical Society board began to fill the vacancies, as advised by an attorney, Philp said. On March 12, the society announced its separation from the foundation.
The Historical Society sought to change its bylaws to enable its new course, asking members to vote for the change from a membership organization to a donor-based one. Noble said she and others didn’t get an invitation to vote and called foul.
“Apparently, it was set up on some kind of Google document,” Noble said. “If you don’t have a Google email address, you couldn’t vote.
“Let’s be real,” Noble said. “A lot of our members are elderly. We have members that don’t even have computers.
“It was deeply frustrating for me that we were having this major, major vote which was against the bylaws,” Noble said. “Many of the members were disenfranchised.”
90-year-olds voted
“It’s unfortunate if they could not figure it out,” Philp said. She was available to help anybody with problems and did so the four or five times she got calls asking for assistance, she said.
“We had members in their 90s who were able to vote,” Philp said. It was accessible to anyone with an email address.”
The vote for new bylaws passed with 589 in favor, Philp said.
Meantime, at the urging of the fundraising Historical Foundation, 146 Historical Society members signed a statement of no confidence against society leadership and Philp, according to documents Noble provided. The statement alleged an illegal process to change bylaws, “secret meetings, and systematic retaliation against concerned members.”
That “retaliation” includes about a dozen cease and desist letters, Noble said, including one to her.

Noble and others “have been led astray with a misinformation campaign, inflammatory remarks, erroneous accusations, and inaccurate claims regarding our Executive Director Aley Philp and other members of the Executive Committee,” the March 11 letter from the executive committee reads. “We wish to remind you that any actions taken to libel, defame, slander, or retaliate against current or former board members, staff, or volunteers of the Wyoming Historical Society will not be tolerated.”
The Historical Foundation said the bylaw change should be nullified. It’s also girding for more conflict and passed its no-confidence statement criticizing the Historical Society on to the foundation’s own attorney.

(Screenshot from National Archives film)The liberation of Gathemo, France, won’t be found in many history books about the Second World War.
After all, it was one town among hundreds on a map that needed to be taken from the occupying Germans in the slow, methodical, grinding Battle of Normandy that began on D-Day: June 6, 1944. That’s when the Allies landed soldiers on five beaches and airborne troops dropped behind enemy lines as part of the war to wrest Europe from Nazi Germany.
Public perception may condense what happened after the invasion into simple terms: The Allies landed, established a beachhead and the fight was over. Tragically, it did not all end in a matter of days and the cost was steep – nearly 210,000 Allied casualties, and around 400,000 German losses.

Throughout the summer, the Allies pushed the German Army back through tiny villages, cities, farmland, hedgerows and plains in a war of attrition. U.S., British, Canadian, and other allied forces gained ground – sometimes only in mere yards — each day.
By August, the Germans were retreating and desperately attempting to avoid becoming encircled. Gathemo soon found itself in the midst of the maelstrom.
For the first time in the war, Pennsylvania’s own 28th Infantry Division was leading the way to try to liberate the town, flanked by the veteran 4th and 29th divisions.

The men and women of Gathemo have never forgotten the men who wore the red keystone patch – dubbed the “bloody bucket” by the Germans – on their shoulders.
Nearly 81 years later, the community will show its gratitude on Saturday by unveiling a memorial honoring nine men from the 28th who gave their lives so Gathemo could be free and  are renaming a street after the division.
At a time when international relations are tense and some American leaders are questioning alliances in Europe, the gesture is a reminder of how deep the bond runs between the French and their liberators. And the commemoration that will take place Saturday began because one man wondered what happened to his great-uncle in the war.
He could never have imagined where his search would lead.
 ‘Filling in the blanks’

Fifty-year-old Shaun Nadolny doesn’t have any ties to Pennsylvania.
The assistant airport operations manager for Milwaukee County in Wisconsin is a self-described history lover, whose grandfather Leo Nadolny fought in the Pacific Theater with the Marines against the Japanese.
Shaun Nadolny’s dad, born four years after the war ended in 1949, was named after Leo’s brother Jerome Francis, who was one of nine men killed in Gathemo. The two brothers never knew each other’s whereabouts while in combat, so Leo didn’t learn about Jerome’s death for nearly a year.
Letters from his parents informing him about the loss weren’t reaching him, so tragically, he kept asking about his brother when writing home.

Like most families at the time, the Nadolnys didn’t know much about Jerome’s service, except that he died in France. A family member has the Purple Heart that was issued posthumously.
“I’ve learned a lot about my grandpa, Leo, because in about 2001, I sent a letter to the government saying, ‘As part of the Freedom of Information Act, I was wondering if you could share his military file.’ And they did,” he said.
The packet arrived about 18 months later and provided him with a window into his grandfather’s wartime experiences – where he fought, the battles he survived and even the ships he was transported on in the Pacific.
“It kind of led me down this path about his brother Jerome, that we knew nothing about. We just literally had a picture of his cross on his grave over in Brittany (France), and a picture of him. That’s all my dad ever had,” he said. “He just knew that, ‘Hey, I was named after my uncle who I never met who was killed over in France.’”
About a decade ago, he wrote the government again with a request for Jerome’s military file. He wasn’t as fortunate this time around. The records were believed to have been destroyed in a fire at the National Personnel Records Center in St. Louis in 1973. It was one of up to 18 million service members’ files lost.
He did receive some basic information: Jerome’s draft enrollment card and where he was originally buried in France before his remains were repatriated in the Brittany American Cemetery.
Another key detail came from a picture of Jerome’s grave marker. He served in the 109th Infantry Regiment, as part of the 28th Infantry Division. Prior to the war, the 28th was a Pennsylvania National Guard unit based at Fort Indiantown Gap in Lebanon County. It was nationalized by the federal government in February 1941.
“I just started kind of looking into that unit in that division,” Nadolny said. “A friend said, ‘Hey man, you’re kind of at a dead end with this research on your great uncle. You should look at a 28th Infantry Facebook group or a family group, because you’re not going to get anything more from the government.’”

So in the group, he ended up in touch with a Frenchman, Christophe Clement, who works in logistics. But, his real passion is World War II history. When he was 15 or 16, he would ride his bike from cemetery to cemetery to make sure the graves of Allied soldiers were well kept. He’s studied in Canada to be a historical adviser and volunteers with the Mike Pride Mobile Museum. Clement’s Facebook page is filled with pictures and videos – historical and current – of his efforts to keep the memory of Allied soldiers alive.
But, he has always felt a connection to the men wearing the keystone symbol on their uniforms and helmets. His hometown of Senlis was liberated by the division. During WWI, a soldier from the 28th died there and another five were killed in the same area during the second worldwide conflict.
Clement connected Nadolny with a retired lieutenant colonel from the 28th – Corey Angell, who served in Iraq and Afghanistan and who has a passion for documenting the history of his beloved unit.
Angell soon was able to add a few more pieces to the puzzle for Nadolny – Jerome’s company, his death from a gunshot wound and how he was identified by his paybook.
“So, they kind of started filling in just some of the blanks,” Nadolny said. “And all I ever was doing for the last 15 years was just learning a little bit more about my family history.”
 ‘Just another guy’

Clement had an idea after corresponding with Angell and Nadolny – to build a memorial to the 28th’s fallen in the nondescript town of Gathemo in Normandy. The idea blew Nadolny’s mind. He figured his great-uncle was just a typical grunt doing his job. After all, he wasn’t part of the D-Day landings or some super soldier that earned a chestful of medals.

“He’s just another guy. He came after the invasion, and was killed very early in – Aug. 12,” he said. “Nothing heroic about it.”
Nadolny didn’t want his relative to be singled out, so Clement did some digging and learned the names of eight other members of the 28th who were killed in the fight to liberate the townspeople from four years of German occupation.
“When you search for information about soldiers or about combat actions or whatever, it really is like a police inquiry,” Clement said, speaking through a translator.
Clement is an old pro at working to honor the memory of Allied soldiers who paid the ultimate price on French soil. About a dozen years ago, he started working to create monuments to members of the 28th around his part of France.
He will turn 40 on Saturday, the same day as the ceremony, which will have special significance because Clement says it will be the last monument he helps build. Organizing the tributes is becoming increasingly complicated, said Clement, who has worked to preserve the memory of 15 members of the Bloody Bucket who were killed in France during the world wars and an estimated 400 other Allied soldiers.
 The Battle

The 28th Infantry Division didn’t enter the conflict until about a month-and-half after D-Day – July 22, 1944 – and landed at Omaha Beach. At that point, the Allies were building  momentum toward a breakout inland.
The division found itself in hedgerow country (known to the French as “bocage”).
The fighting across the terrain  – made up of farm fields broken up by a series of overgrown hedges and trees that towered above walls of dirt that could reach up to six feet in height— was slow, brutal and hindered any sustained advance.
Six days after arriving on French soil, the 28th suffered its first casualty when an officer was seriously wounded.
But its biggest test to come was in Gathemo, beginning on Aug. 7.
“The 28th Division troops got their first experience in hedgerow warfare during the fighting at Percy and Hill 210, but they faced a far more intense test a week later at Gathemo and Hill 288, just outside the town,” said Walter Zapotoczny an author, Army veteran, former command historian of the 28th Infantry Division and president of the 28th Infantry Division Association.

Jerome Nadolny and his fellow soldiers in the 109th regiment were among the first American troops moving toward the town around 6:30 a.m. Waiting for them, according to Zapotoczny, was at least half of the German 84th Infantry Division, an 88-mm anti-tank battalion, the 84th Division artillery and other enemy forces.
After hours of heaving fighting and nightfall approaching, three battalions of the 28th dug in – without much forward progress. But, the Germans weren’t done. As the Allies had learned through Africa, Sicily, and Italy, their enemy utilized the counterattack as a favored tactic.
Major Paul F. Gaynor, who was commanding the regimental anti-tank company described what happened next:

Three German tanks accompanied by more than 100 infantrymen came out of Gathemo. The tanks were equipped with searchlights which were used to illuminate the area where the men were digging in. Direct fire from the tanks’ guns and machine guns at ranges of 60 to 75 yards caused heavy casualties. The accompanying infantrymen, who were equipped with a large number of automatic weapons, took advantage of the confusion. 
Bazookas were quickly brought into action (by U.S, troops)….the tanks and their infantry support withdrew to Gathemo upon meeting this resistance.”

The next day didn’t yield much gain in ground. The 28th advanced another 300 to 400 yards. The Germans may have been in retreat, but continued to fight tenaciously. It wouldn’t be until the morning of Aug. 10 that American troops entered the town, and by the afternoon Gathemo was liberated.
“The battle of Gathemo caused the greatest losses and the most resistance up to that point in the 28th Division’s experience,” Zapotoczny added,  “It was at Gathemo that the 28th Division endured its most brutal battle of the Northern France campaign.”
The cost in and around Gathemo was the lives of nine members of the 28th, including three from Pennsylvania:
An estimated 235 men were wounded.
On Aug. 19, the 77-day Battle of Normandy came to an end with the Germans in full retreat and tens of thousands captured when the Falaise pocket was closed by Allied troops.
“Although not directly involved in the fiercest fighting at Chambois, where Polish and Canadian forces sealed the pocket, the 28th Division’s aggressive advance helped prevent German units from escaping to the east or regrouping, effectively pressing the western and southern flanks of the pocket,” Zapotoczny said.
A mere 10 days after the German defense of Normandy collapsed, the men of the Bloody Bucket were taking part in the liberation day parade throughout Paris.

 Tracking down the relatives

As plans for the dedication ceremony took shape, Cory Angell, the retired 28th Division officer, continued to try to reach as many families of the nine soldiers killed in Gathemo as possible to give them a chance to attend in-person or watch it online.
He spends his spare time researching photos and videos throughout history of the men and women who served in the country’s oldest Army division.
“We’re kind of a small group, right? A lot of people just retire and move on. There’s some of us that are just diehards and I’m one of them,” Angell said. “I’m an old soldier, retired from the division which I grew up with. Really, the beginning and end of my career was in the division wearing the keystone patch.”
Since Pvt. Irwin S. Fox was from Pittsburgh, he turned his attention to trying to find his relatives.
Military records show Fox enlisted in the Army on Jan. 9, 1944, just months before the invasion. He was assigned to the 110th Infantry Regiment with the 28th Division.
Angell started by Googling the names of the nine soldiers. With Fox, he was able to make a connection to Pittsburgh. He then reached out to the Heinz History Center, who put him in touch with the Pittsburgh Jewish Genealogy Society.
“The guy said, ‘Last I can tell, that family moved to Columbus, Ohio. Let me put you in touch with a guy for Jewish history in Columbus, Ohio.’ And that’s how they go, ‘Yeah, we got him. Here’s her phone number.’”
Soon, he was on the phone with Evelyn Fox Weiner, Irwin’s 89-year-old niece.
“What was a real joy to me and I hope that all those that are involved can really appreciate it when we do find the family members, the three that we found have been amazed and thrilled,” Angell said. “People are like, ‘What? You’re kidding me.’”
 ‘My grandmother became a Gold Star mother’

Fox was a first-generation American. His grandfather was from Ukraine and his grandmother grew up in Latvia. He graduated from Schenley High School in Pittsburgh’s North Oakland neighborhood. His mom, dad, sister and brother eventually moved to Squirrel Hill. He was married to Josephine Greenberg. A picture from 1944 shows a striking couple – Josephine sporting a knee-length skirt and a clean-shaven Irwin in uniform with his right arm casually, but firmly around her hip.
He was 29 when he died in combat.
“He was very loving and nice,” said Weiner. “He was revered enough that my family had another son who was named after him.”
His namesake, Irwin S. Fox, is 77-years-old and lives in Phoenix, Arizona, with his wife.
He didn’t know much about his uncle until about 1964, when he came across some old photos.
“All I knew was that he was killed shortly after D-Day. I didn’t know any of the details until I saw the gravestone,” Fox said. The headstone is marked with his uncle’s date of death, Aug. 13, 1944. “I just knew from history that he was in hedgerow country in France.”

Irwin Fox and his wife recorded a message on a record to his parents, after Passover in the spring of 1944. The audio and photos were provided to the Capital-Star by his namesake, Irwin S. Fox. (Audio slideshow produced by Tim Lambert)
Fox’s death in Gathemo hit the family hard and Weiner isn’t sure her grandmother ever recovered from the loss of her youngest child.
“I remember the Blue Star in the window in their apartment and their home at that time, if you had somebody in the service, it was a small banner,” said Weiner, who still has the telegram from the War Department informing the family of his death. “Then my grandmother became a Gold Star mother after he was killed.”
When the war was over, families had to decide whether to bring the remains of their loved ones home or whether they would remain buried in Europe. Fox’s mother chose to have his body returned to the U.S.
In March 1949, he was buried at Shaare Torah Cemetery in Whitehall in Allegheny County.
A family photo dated Sept. 15, 1964, shows his mother standing in front of his grave marked by an American flag. Her graying hair peeks out from her yellow headscarf and she’s wearing a long, black coat. Her hands are clasped and her face is grief-stricken.
“I think that’s the most poignant picture I have,” Irwin Fox said.

The family is grateful to have learned a little bit more about Irwin’s short time in France, but will not be able to make the ceremony.
“It meant enough, and Irwin was revered enough, then when we found out about it, which was only two weeks ago, that there were 15 members of our family that were ready to go to France, really, to be there at that dedication, that’s how quickly we all wanted to be there to honor and to share what we could with him,” Weiner said. “Due to logistics and complications due to travel, it’s not happening. We all revered Irwin’s service to the United States and what he did and the sacrifice that he made. It totally changed several generations.”
She and Irwin are touched by the gesture of the people of Gathemo.
“The people actually cared what Americans did and the sacrifice they made (It) had an effect on the world. That is wonderful,” Irwin said. “It kind of renews in me to want to make a difference in the world.”
Weiner said it’s gratifying that the town is remembering the soldiers who died to liberate it from the Germans.
“It never replaces a life, but does it give hope or meaning or set something up for generations to come,” she said.
  ‘Such a rewarding feeling’

The next puzzle piece was tracking down another fallen soldier with Pennsylvania connections.
Not much is known about Pfc. Merritt Boyle’s military service. He was from Chinchilla, Lackawanna County, and served in the 109th Infantry Regiment of the 28th Infantry Division.
He’s buried at the Shady Lane Cemetery in Dixon City.

Angell had a lead on another namesake – 53-year-old Merrit Boyle of Old Forge,, who trains athletes, owns a gym and does life coaching.
It turns out, though, that Merrit doesn’t really answer his phone.
So Angell reached out to the 109th Infantry Regiment Association in Scranton and one of their members just showed up at Boyle’s doorstep.
“I came back from walking my dogs and I locked both doors and I’m setting up my schedule for the day and I heard a banging on the back door. I’m like, ‘Who the hell is banging on my back door?’” he said. So, I’m looking at him and he said, ‘Are you Merrit?’”
The two talked for about 90 minutes about the division, about where Merritt was killed and the upcoming ceremony. The talk started to fill in some blanks for the younger Boyle.
He had heard some stories about the man he was named after – like how he loved his country and was only in France a short time before his death.
Like, how his grandmother, Marjorie, who was Merritt’s mother, asked her daughter, Mary, to name one of her children after her fallen son.
“They weren’t planning on having another kid. I’m the youngest by six years, so I was kind of like a surprise,” he said. “Marjorie went to my mom and said, ‘Look, it would mean a lot for me to keep his legacy alive,’ because Merritt was a very special person to her. You could tell just from talking to her, telling me stories, and I remember sleeping over at her house and she’d be telling me great stories on how he was always into trouble.

The twist is they spelled his name wrong on his birth certificate. As his namesake, he has one “T” in his name.
“I love that I have that legacy. I’ve always felt a connection to him when I pray at night, I always have that connection that there’s someone watching me,” Boyle said. “That’s why it was such a rewarding experience to find out a little bit more of his history and I learned a lot from talking to many people that were very helpful and getting me up to pace with some of the details of where he was and what happened.”
Boyle said his uncle didn’t get a chance to live his life.
“I feel him live through me in many regards. …  That I was named after him and (in) his honor and that just hearing how they spoke of him, it made me want to do better,” he said. Merrit does have a wooden carving Boyle made when he was in service and the flag that was put over his coffin when his remains were returned to Pennsylvania.
He is grateful to know his uncle’s memory will live on in the land where he fell.
“We kind of sometimes today get caught up in the politics and the cynicism a lot of times of Republican or Democrat, all this kind of stuff. To see 80 years later that there’s still appreciation for what those great men did gives such a rewarding feeling,” he said.

Between 2019 and 2024, patients in rural Tennessee lost access to 362 independent doctors and 344 independent medical practices, the report commissioned by the Physicians Advocacy Institute found. 
Some of those doctors simply ceased practicing in rural areas, while others became employees of larger healthcare systems. 
Tennessee, like other states, has seen consolidation of hospital systems that out-compete or buy out independent physician practices — a marked trend particularly in the state’s northeast region, where Ballad Health now operates as a virtual hospital monopoly for more than a million people with no other alternative for inpatient healthcare. Ballad has also bought out or folded in previously independent physician practices. 
Such consolidations raise important policy questions, the report’s authors note. They include the “erosion of physician autonomy,” and “higher healthcare costs and potential declines in quality.”
A renegotiation of a deal between Tennessee officials and Ballad that has allowed the hospital system to operate despite anti-monopoly rules has since lowered the previous quality of care standards the state once held system responsible for meeting.  
“Consolidation of physician services under hospitals and corporate entities in rural areas raise concerns about reduced access, rising costs and potential declines in care quality,” the report said.

June 4, 2025 | Photo by Erick Diaz VelizThe email raised concerns among members of Michigan State University’s international community.
On Thursday afternoon, international students at MSU received an email from the Office for International Students and Scholars, or OISS, “strongly” recommending them not to leave the United States, among other recommendations.
The email, signed by Krista McCallum, director of OISS, was delivered independently to foreign students, but with the same content: An important update in response to recent federal government actions affecting the international academic community, both those already legally in the country and those still in process to enter.
By the end of May, a cable signed by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and obtained by The Associated Press stated that the U.S. government decided to halt new student visa interviews for foreign applicants to U.S. colleges, where they plan to use the review of social media activity as a filter to vet foreign applicants.
Additionally, the U.S. Department of State released a press statement in which Rubio specified that “under President Trump’s leadership,” Chinese students’ visas will be “aggressively” revoked, including those “with connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields.”
“Our current understanding is that previously scheduled visa interview appointments will proceed as planned. However, most embassies and consulates have suspended scheduling new appointments,” the message said.
McCallum advised those students who are still in the U.S. not to leave the country.
“For students and scholars inside the U.S.: We strongly advise that you do not travel outside the United States,” McCallum said in the communication.
For those currently outside the country who require a visa to return, McCallum recommended staying in close contact with the U.S. embassy or consulate in their area. Additionally, for those unsure about the validity of their visas, the email included a link where students could check their current visa stamp.
MSU spokesperson Amber McCann reiterated one more time that the international community on campus is essential to the university’s academic and professional development, adding that “The university is closely monitoring recent federal policy changes and updates concerning international students and scholars.”

“We will continue to advocate for policies that enable us to welcome international students and scholars from around the world and promote global engagement,” McCann concluded.”
As it is happening across the country, within MSU’s international community, concerns about not returning home over the summer due to the severity of recent policy changes had already become a recurring topic, while those who traveled expressed concerns about their return. Many students had already decided not to travel back to their home countries, fearing potential issues with immigration when attempting to re-enter the U.S.
“It’s no longer just about having your paperwork in order; now it feels like crossing the border comes with a real risk of running into trouble,” said Diego Granados, an MSU PhD student in biochemistry who is from Mexico. “The atmosphere has changed. Every time you see another international student, you ask them if they’re traveling this summer, because of the political climate.”
At the end of the email, McCallum expressed her support and concern for the international community and reiterated, as in previous communications stated by MSU, the university’s commitment to international students, who have increasingly become targets of federal government policies nationwide.
“I understand that this news and the uncertainty surrounding it may be frustrating. Please know that MSU remains strongly committed to our international Spartan community. We will continue to welcome students and scholars from around the world, and we will advocate for policies that support your presence and success,” the email said.
MSU students had already protested what they considered to be the lack of action by MSU officials regarding the protection of the international community. And after only receiving statements and emails, they considered the university to be taking an insufficient stance.

“I think they just want to play it safe and make sure we don’t leave,” said Granados. “Honestly, it just feels awful. It’s like this message is formalizing that feeling we already had, that even if you have legal status and you’re pursuing a degree, going back home is now something risky. It might go wrong. You might not be able to come back.”
Luis Torres, an MSU PhD student in Kinesiology who is from Puerto Rico, highlighted the targeting of the immigrant community in general and how it escalated to academic fields.
“The pattern is evident: the criminalization of undocumented immigrants was amplified, university students who protested were stigmatized, and now the focus shifts to the entire international student community,” said Torres.
“A state that restricts access to education under current pretexts can justify future encroachments on fundamental rights, eroding democracy for the benefit of a privileged minority,” he finished.
Additionally, among foreign students, the protection of their identity or hiding their opinions have increasingly become a concern, showing a decline in freedom of speech within the community.
“It makes you feel trapped. Like, I’m here, and I can’t cross the border or talk openly about it because they check my phone, don’t like something, and I’m not allowed to reenter to finish my studies. That’s really how it feels,” finished Granados.
A request for comment was sent via email to Krista McCallum, director of OISS, but has yet to be returned.

Public outcry was swift and forceful after a U.S. House committee last month hastily approved an amendment directing the federal government to sell off more than half a million acres of public land.
A few days later, lawmakers advanced the larger bill — a sweeping list of President Donald Trump’s priorities — but stripped the federal lands provision.
Yet leaders on both sides of the issue say the battle over selling off federal lands is likely just heating up.

Some conservatives in Western states have complained for decades that the feds control too much of the land within their borders. They see a long-awaited opportunity in a Trump administration that’s sympathetic to their cause. Public lands advocates are bracing for more attempts to turn land over to states, industry groups and developers.
“The threat level is red alert,” said Randi Spivak, public lands policy director with the Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental nonprofit. “Some of these states have been champing at the bit for decades to privatize. They’re certainly not going to let this opportunity pass without an aggressive effort.”
 The ‘balance sheet’

In Western states, where most federally owned lands are located, some leaders view these lands as a treasured inheritance — places reserved for all Americans and critical for wildlife, tourism and outdoor recreation. Others feel that too much of the land in their states is controlled by officials in Washington, D.C., leaving it off-limits for development and curtailing its economic value.










Some of these states have been champing at the bit for decades to privatize. They're certainly not going to let this opportunity pass without an aggressive effort.


– Randi Spivak, public lands policy director with the Center for Biological Diversity



Trump officials and allies have embraced the latter view. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum has repeatedly called federal lands America’s “balance sheet,” describing them as untapped assets worth trillions of dollars. He has launched an effort to identify federal lands suitable for housing development.
Other proposals have centered around using land sales to pay for tax breaks or to finance Trump’s proposed government-run fund that could invest in stocks or real estate.
For some state leaders, the newfound interest at the federal level to turn public lands into cash — along with Trump’s cuts to land management agency staff — aligns with a long-standing movement to reduce federal ownership.


The federal government controls 24.1 million acres in Colorado, or 36% of the state.


“I look at it as an opportunity to say, ‘Hey, turn it over to the state,’” said Utah House Speaker Mike Schultz, a Republican.
Utah leaders have made the most forceful push to challenge federal land ownership. The state filed a legal challenge last year seeking to take control of more than 18 million acres of “unappropriated” lands — parcels held by the federal government without a specific designation such as a national park or monument. That effort hit a roadblock earlier this year when the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the case.
But with Trump in the White House, state leaders may pivot from challenging the feds in court to seeking their cooperation.
“We would love if the federal government just turned it over to us and said, ‘Here, manage these lands,’” Schultz said. “That’s an option as well. Those are discussions that are happening. Everything is on the table.”

Schultz declined to say which federal officials have been involved in discussions about transferring lands to the state.
Some lawmakers in Wyoming backed a state resolution this year — which ultimately failed — calling on Congress to hand over all federal lands except for Yellowstone National Park. Idaho lawmakers passed a measure calling on the feds to turn over a wildlife refuge to the state. And Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo, a Republican, has called for a “systematic release” of federal land in the state.
But public lands also have many supporters in Western states, including some prominent Republican members of Congress, such as Reps. Mike Simpson of Idaho and Ryan Zinke of Montana. Zinke was Interior secretary for two years during the first Trump administration.
John Leshy, who served as solicitor for the U.S. Department of the Interior during the Clinton administration, said proposals to dispose of federal lands tend to be stymied by fierce public backlash.
“Federal lands are really popular,” he said. “It’s political poison (to sell off public land). It’s a different West now. Public attitudes have changed.”
Leshy also noted that livestock ranchers especially benefit from discounted lease rates offered by the federal government.
 Housing arguments

The most recent clash over the future of federal lands was the amendment sponsored by a pair of congressional Republicans last month. The measure would have directed the Bureau of Land Management to sell more than 500,000 acres of land in Nevada and Utah. Local governments would have been able to buy the land at market value, with no restrictions on how they used it.
Backers said the sale would bring in revenue to cover Trump’s proposed tax cuts, while allowing local governments to build much-needed housing on the parcels. Utah GOP Sen. Mike Lee said he will try to revive the measure as the Senate considers the bill this month, E&E News reported.
In Nevada, where 85% of land is owned by the federal government, some leaders say their communities are hemmed in by a checkerboard of public lands that constrain development. The city of Fernley, which is growing rapidly, would have acquired 12,000 acres under the proposal.
“We need housing,” said Benjamin Marchant, Fernley’s city manager. “The city can’t plan roads and water lines, sewer lines and gas lines, when you have federal land between two parcels that want to develop. This will bring a practical and helpful consolidation of all these lands into one developable area.”
Nevada leaders have long worked on proposals to transfer some federal lands to local governments and allow for increased growth. But some lawmakers say the latest push bypassed that collaborative process — and failed to include safeguards that the money raised from the sale of the lands would be reinvested into conserving public lands elsewhere.
“It was a complete betrayal of everything we’ve worked on in this state,” said Assemblymember Howard Watts, a Democrat. “This amendment is trying to sell off half a million acres of Nevada’s public lands in order to pay for tax cuts for billionaires. This is not going to address our housing problem. These lands are positioned to be sold off for other forms of development and extraction.”
Similar debates are happening in Utah. In southwestern Utah’s Washington County, local officials say the disposal of federally controlled land could help alleviate the region’s housing crisis and increasingly strained infrastructure.
The county is experiencing rapid population growth — in 2022, St. George, the county seat, was the fastest-growing metro area in America. County and city leaders hoped the amendment would have helped them manage the growth. The measure would have disposed of roughly 11,500 acres of federally controlled land in Utah, selling it at market value to local governments.
The proposal received pushback from all sides, including environmentalists, hunting and fishing groups, House Democrats and even conservatives.
“(The amendment) is consistent with how U.S. Department of the Interior Secretary Burgum thinks about federal public lands, as simply assets on a ledger to be sold off,” said Steve Bloch, legal director for the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, an environmental nonprofit. “It’s just antithetical to how Westerners think about the federal public lands that make up so much of our landscape.”

Washington County Commissioner Adam Snow, a Republican, said a lot of the opposition was misguided. The county would have acquired almost half of the land earmarked for disposal, and Snow said much of that would have been used to widen existing roads and construct new ones that are bordered by Bureau of Land Management property.
“These were not pristine wilderness lands. Some of the environmental groups tried to make it sound like we’re selling off Zion National Park, and that’s not even close to true,” Snow said. “If we can just not have to deal with the federal government every time we want to chip seal a road or improve an intersection, that would be really nice. Because we have to ask ‘Mother, may I?’ for everything out here.”
Local leaders say federal parcels could help ease housing pressures as well. Snow said transferring parcels to the city or county is one of the only ways to stop the area from becoming wildly expensive.
“We’re running out of room real quick,” he said. “There is still private land to develop, but they’re going to charge an absolute premium.”
The amendment that was stripped from the House bill was widely criticized for not having any restrictions on what could be done with the land.
“There was no language whatsoever that would require Washington County or St. George to do anything with these lands. They could lease them for development. They could sell them outright,” said Bloch.
 The costs of management

In Utah, lawmakers have created a state Department of Land Management — essentially a placeholder agency that would be funded and staffed only if their effort to assume control of large swaths of federal land succeeds. Schultz, the House speaker, said the state is committed to keeping the lands in the public domain, reopening roads and campgrounds closed by the feds.
“We’d just take over the job from the federal government,” he said. “It is something that the state absolutely would do, and we’d do it more efficiently, more effectively and we’d have better outcomes.”
Schultz said the state could bring in the revenues needed to manage the land by raising lease prices for oil and gas operations on parcels currently managed for drilling.
But some public lands advocates say that’s not realistic. The federal Bureau of Land Management employed more than 950 people in the state as of 2024, and feds also assume the expensive task of wildfire management on their lands.
“If you look at the history of what Utah has done with their lands, they’ve sold more than half of them,” said Devin O’Dea, Western policy and conservation manager with Backcountry Hunters & Anglers. “We’re certainly of the perspective that states could not handle the economic costs of managing these lands. Their hand would be forced; they would have to sell these lands in order to deal with those costs.”
John Robison, Idaho Conservation League public lands and wildlife director, said Simpson — the Idaho congressman — and the state’s two senators have all won praise from constituents for their work on public lands compromises.
“Savvy Idaho politicians know that public lands are popular,” he said.
But other state leaders insist their governments are better equipped to manage the lands. Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador, a Republican, was among the officials who signed an amicus brief in support of Utah’s lawsuit against the feds.
“We live here, we work here, and we are far better stewards of our forests and resources than federal bureaucrats in Washington,” Labrador said in a statement. “If Idaho owned this land, we could lease it for timber, grazing, and mining — just like the federal government does — but reinvest that revenue right here in Idaho.”

He acknowledges the challenges about running in an electoral landscape that hasn’t elected any Democrat to a statewide office since 2018, but says the environment is ripe for that to change in 2026.
“We will be in every community, building trust and building relationships and building a coalition that will ultimately and successfully win an election where a Democrat hasn’t won in 30 years and where the voter registration rolls are against us,” he said in a phone interview with the Phoenix on Wednesday.
“In Florida we are in the midst of a generational affordability crisis,” he added. “Everybody feels it. I mean this has been affirmed everywhere I’ve gone, every group I’ve sat with. The affordability crisis is number one on the minds of every Floridian. Wherever you live, whatever your socioeconomic status – whatever your party registration – the affordability crisis is number one. I would make the case that Republicans in Tallahassee have contributed to it, and will continue it. They won’t do anything about it, and we will. I will.”
The 52-year-old Pinellas County resident is the first major Democratic candidate to enter the race for governor in a seat that will be vacated next year by a term-limited Ron DeSantis. It’s been quite the evolution for man who previously described himself as a “George H.W. Bush Republican” for much of his adult life before leaving the GOP in 2018 to become a political independent, and then only officially joining the Democratic Party six weeks ago.
Florida hasn’t had a Democrat occupying the governor’s mansion in Tallahassee since Buddy MacKay finished out Lawton Chiles’ second term in office in January of 1999. Since then there has been eight years of Jeb Bush, four years with (then Republican) Charlie Crist, eight years with Rick Scott, and so far nearly six-and-a-half years of the DeSantis revolution.
Jolly’s previous elected experience in office is limited – he defeated Democrat Alex Sink in a special congressional election in early 2014 following the death of venerable Republican lawmaker C.W. Bill Young. After coasting to re-election that fall, Florida’s 13th Congressional District was redrawn and became friendlier for a Democratic pick-up, which is what happened when Crist defeated him in the fall of 2016.
Jolly was an early member of the GOP “Never Trumper” caucus, and his critiques of Donald Trump in his first term in the White House catapulted him into a political analysis spot for MSNBC (his contact has been paused since he began exploring a gubernatorial run, an MSNBC source told the Phoenix in April).
The independent spirit
Jolly officially left the GOP in 2018 and became a political independent, where he actively worked on efforts to provide an alternative to the two-party political system. First with the Serve America Movement (SAM) in 2021 where he served as the executive chairman, and then later with Andrew Yang and Christine Todd Whitman with the Forward Party in 2022.  
It was during his period with SAM that he actively discussed the possibility four years ago as running as a political independent candidate for governor in Florida for 2022, but ultimately decided not to.
Currently the Republican front-runner for the GOP nomination for governor next year is U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds. But there’s also likely to be at least one independent candidate in the race with state Sen. Jason Pizzo saying he’s likely to join the campaign for governor this fall.
“We won’t know who qualifies for the governor’s race until next June, and that’s very important,” Jolly says. “Because our job between now and next June is to build a campaign that appeals to independents. As you know I helped mobilize the independent space for six years, and I would beg the parties that we are available to you. Speak to us, reach us, don’t ignore us. Don’t slap us down. And so Jason Pizzo’s right that the independent voter has been ignored by the major parties for too long. The answer to that is not to argue with Jason, it’s to build the Democratic Party that reaches out to independents. And if I do that, then we’ll build a coalition that Jason Pizzo or John Morgan can look at and say,’Wow. I like what I see over there.’”
The Trump Factor
Jolly’s opposition to Trump has been a central part of his brand over the years, but he tells the Phoenix that the 2026 election is about the people of Florida, not the current president of the United States.
“I believe the president has taken us in the wrong direction, just as I believe Gov. DeSantis has, but this race is not about Donald Trump,” he says. “Not for one moment is this race about Donald Trump. This race is about the affordability crisis in the state of Florida. Republicans will try to make this race about Donald Trump. They will try to make it about division, not unity. My job every day on behalf of this coalition, is to keep us focused on the affordability crisis. Investing in public schools. Providing for safe communities. Restoring dignity to people across the state of Florida. This is an open seat governorship race. I stand by my view of the president, but this race is not about the president.”
While the Florida Legislature is currently working overtime to get a budget passed, GOP lawmakers and Gov. DeSantis have talked about delivering property tax relief to Florida homeowners, most likely via a constitutional amendment that the voters would have to approve in the fall of next year. Jolly says his biggest concern about the discussion in Tallahassee on the issue so far is that the GOP has “no plan for where the revenue comes from to provide for safe communities and good schools, and they just want to chase the property tax cuts.”
He says the state needs to look at a “broad based property tax reform package” that maintains the Save Our Homes amendment that limits annual property tax increases to 3% while also providing “dramatic relief” for first-time home buyers.
University of North Florida political science professor Michael Binder says that the obvious parallel in assessing Jolly’s candidacy is with Crist, who left the Republican Party to become an independent during his last year as governor in 2010, ultimately losing a Senate bid to Marco Rubio. He officially became a Democrat in 2012 and lost two bids for governor: In 2014 by one point to Rick Scott, and in 2022 to DeSantis by 19 points (in between he served in what had been Jolly’s congressional seat for six years).
“Charlie Crist was unable to connect with base Democrats and get them to the polls,” Binder says of the 2022 contest. “If Jolly can do that, and that’s going to be a challenge being a former Republican, then maybe you might have a race that was closer. You might get a race that’s in the single digits. But if this is a similar circumstance where Democrats are not motivated, if Jolly cannot connect with the base of the Democratic Party, then there’s absolutely no chance.”
Binder adds that Pizzo’s likely entry as an independent means that both he and Jolly would be taking up what he calls a “moderate, non-MAGA type with maybe some Republican leanings” that are occupying the same ideological lane.
So far, the Florida GOP doesn’t seem too concerned.
“David Jolly has lost before, and he will lose again,” said Republican Party of Florida Chairman Evan Power in a statement issued earlier this week. “Floridians won’t trust a slick opportunist who simply can’t be trusted. Jolly has no platform, no base, and no chance in Florida.”
Jolly says while Trump’s actions in the White House will dominate the news headlines over the next year and-a-half, his campaign will be about making Florida better for everyone.
“It’s about responsibly delivering government and providing for safe communities and good schools and a property insurance and property tax construct that actually works … If that’s what we’re talking about for the next 16 months? Then we become a coalition for change and Republicans are offering more of the same, and we win the race.”

(Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)Who knew there were this many things that had to be fixed?
The legislative sessions in Idaho, Montana, Wyoming and Washington are over. Depending on your political perspective, the benefits — or damages — will be felt for years to come.
One thing that isn’t in dispute? Lawmakers couldn’t help but introduce a record number of bills in Idaho, Montana and Wyoming. Washington may also be added to that list, depending on what happens in the second part of its biennium.
More pieces of legislation were prepared for Idaho’s 2025 session than in the last 30 years

In Idaho, lawmakers introduced nearly 800 pieces of legislation — the highest mark going back at least 16 years. Less than 50% of the legislation actually made it across the finish line.
Higher numbers are expected in Idaho, as lawmakers now individually introduce and approve every state department budget, rather than just one large state budget.
Still, the numbers are staggering, not only for lawmakers who work at the state capitol, but also for citizens who try to follow the session and be involved in the process. Making it more challenging in Idaho is the sometimes minimal lack of notice regarding hearings for bills that have been introduced. We’ve recommended that lawmakers commit to a Rule of Three to allow citizens more time to be engaged.
In Montana, lawmakers also hit a record of 1,761 bills introduced, with a little more than half being signed into law by Gov. Greg Gianforte.
Montana’s joint Rule 40-40 “allows members of the Montana Legislature to request an unlimited number of bill or resolution drafts before December 5. After that date, a member may request the Legislative Council to prepare no more than seven bills or resolutions. Unused requests by one member may be granted to another member. The limits do not apply to code commissioner bills or committee bills.”
In Wyoming, which divides sessions among general session years and budget years, lawmakers also hit a record of 556 bills introduced. But only 31% became law.
Washington state lawmakers were by far the least productive, passing only 19.5% of the more than 2,000 bills they introduced. And they’re not done yet, as Washington works on a biennium and lawmakers will return next January to continue increasing the number.
Passing legislation certainly isn’t a contest. And this column is in no way an encouragement to increase the across-the-finish-line percentages.
But it is worth pointing out that introducing legislation takes time and resources — resources that are provided by taxpayers (so perhaps a new state rock shouldn’t be high on a lawmaker’s list). More bill introductions also make tracking your elected official’s work more difficult.
Some states, including Arizona, California, New Jersey, Colorado, North Carolina, Florida, North Dakota, Indiana, Louisiana and Montana have sought to restrict how many bills a legislator can introduce each session.
Do all states need a rule that limits a lawmaker’s appetite for more and more legislation? Maybe. But we’d rather see a self-imposed diet.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Thirteen of Tennessee’s 33 senators declared a conflict of interest before voting on a $1.9 billion business tax break in 2024, including one whose companies reaped the benefits of the cut and a prior state grant.
Two years before winning the seat in 2018, Republican Sen. Shane Reeves of Murfreesboro received a million-dollar FastTrack grant from the state Department of Economic and Community Development when he opened TwelveStone Health Partners in Rutherford County in 2016. The company invested nearly $15 million to create 200 jobs for the packaged medication, healthcare services and medication equipment company. 
A pharmacist by trade, Reeves started the business after he and his former business partner, Rick Sain, sold Reeves-Sain Drugstore and EnTrustRx, a specialty pharmacy business, to Fred’s Inc. for $66 million. TwelveStone has expanded several times over nine years, opening infusion centers in multiple locations, including Virginia and Georgia.



Senators declaring a conflict of interest with tax rebate bill:

Paul Bailey, R-Sparta
Ferrell Haile, R-Gallatin
Joey Hensley, R-Hohenwald
Jack Johnson, R-Franklin
Adam Lowe, R-Calhoun
Jon Lundberg, R-Bristol (no longer in office)

Kerry Roberts, R-Springfield
Paul Rose, R-Covington
John Stevens, R-Huntingdon
Page Walley, R-Savannah
Bo Watson, R-Hixson
Dawn White, R-Murfreesboro
Ken Yager, R-Kingston



Nearly a decade later, TwelveStone Health Partners and TwelveStone Holdings are two of 16,000 Tennessee businesses receiving a franchise tax refund of more than $10,000 after Republican lawmakers pushed the measure backed by Gov. Bill Lee through the legislature last year.
Reeves told the Lookout this week that TwelveStone met all requirements for receiving the 2016 grant and now employs nearly 300 people. Asked whether he’s concerned about the appearance of double-dipping, Reeves described himself as a “part-time citizen legislator” the first four months of the year and chief executive officer of TwelveStone the rest of the time.
“My job is to do what’s best for our company. I would never expect any more or less for my business than anyone else’s,” Reeves said in a text statement.
Chairman of the Senate Energy, Agriculture and Natural Resources Committee, Reeves said he is “comfortable” with the reporting ranges in the refund law, calling them a “fair compromise” for transparency. 
Listings on the state Department of Revenue website show categories for companies receiving refunds up to $750, between $750 and $10,000 and more than $10,000. The lists totaling 60,000 companies were posted May 31 and are to remain available to the public for 30 days.
Senators were reluctant to publicize any of the companies when they took up the bill last year, passing it 25-6, with former Sen. Art Swann of Maryville the only Republican to vote in opposition. Two members did not vote.
But the House demanded some form of transparency, though Democrats and public records advocates say the ranges aren’t specific enough considering the amount of money rebated to some of the world’s largest companies, including FedEx and 13 subsidiaries, Ford Motor Co. and AT&T. The House passed the measure 69-23, largely along party lines.
The Tennessee Senate uses a policy called Rule 13 as part of its code of ethics that allows senators to declare a conflict of interest, without giving details, but allowing them to vote based on their conscience and obligation to constituents. The House has no rule requiring members to state a conflict of interest before votes that could affect them or their businesses financially.
In addition to Reeves, Democratic Sen. Jeff Yarbro of Nashville, who voted against the tax cut and refund, declared Rule 13 before last year’s vote.

Yarbro told the Lookout this week he pulled out of the partnership track at Bass, Berry & Sims law firm so he wouldn’t be part of its financial decisions.
“I’m not opposed to any business or citizen taking a refund from the government. Who wouldn’t? If I qualified for a refund, I’d take it. But I still think it’s bad public policy,” Yarbro said in a statement to the Lookout.
Yarbro added that, while he felt the bill ran contrary to public interest, he understood it would benefit many businesses in his Senate district, including the firm where he works, thus he declared the potential conflict of interest before the vote. 
Yarbro and state Rep. John Ray Clemmons of Nashville also proposed a bill they said would enable the state’s franchise tax law to withstand constitutional muster without making rebates. Republican leaders declined to consider it.
When the matter arose last year, the Department of Revenue told lawmakers it received a challenge to the state’s franchise tax on business property, leading most to say the tax cut and refund was justified in averting an expensive legal fight. Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti also advised lawmakers to avoid litigation.
Other key legislators such as House Majority Leader William Lamberth of Portland said the reductions were simply good tax policy and not necessarily based on concern about a legal threat. No lawsuit was filed against the state in advance of the vote.
Republican Sen. Brent Taylor, former owner of Brentwood Funeral Services in Shelby County, voted for the measure last year after declaring Rule 13 but didn’t apply for the tax refund.
“I just didn’t think it was appropriate for me to have voted for the franchise tax cut and then go out and benefit from it, because I knew I’d have reporters … calling and wanting to know if I thought it was appropriate to take the refund and also vote for it,” Taylor said.",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Shane-Reeves001-copy-1024x706.jpg,,,2025-06-05 06:03:40.764489

Wisconsin is one of only six states that doesn't put any money into early childhood education. (Photo by Kate Rindy)Children are born into this world innocent. They did not choose their parents. They did not choose to be born into poverty. They do not get to choose if a parent is addicted to drugs or alcohol. Children do not get a choice to be born into an environment of neglect. Children do not choose to grow up in a home with violence. Children do not get a choice to be abused or assaulted. Children do not choose to be born with a disability. Children do not get to choose if they can access medical care. Children do not get a choice on whether they are even wanted or loved. 
Adults do have choices. In Wisconsin, we  have chosen to have a state where children are the largest demographic living in poverty. We have chosen to allow some children to live with constant hunger. We have chosen not to support children with disabilities. We are still choosing not  to create systems to support children who have experienced adversity like abuse and neglect. We made the choice to create an education system based on the income of the people living in the community. We choose to allow children to be uncared for. We as a community have made these choices deliberately and without shame. 
Consequently, we have chosen for those children to be  less likely to graduate from high school, more likely to fail at a job, have poor health (which is connected to stress in the early years) and to be statistically more likely to be placed in the prison system. 
We, as a state, have chosen to prioritize funding for  prisons and spend nothing on early care and education, one of only six states that don’t invest a penny in early childhood programs, even though we know that when children have access to quality early education that they are more likely to graduate high school, have higher incomes, be healthier, and are less likely to enter the prison system. We have chosen to remove health care options for children by not expanding Badgercare. We are soon to be the only state that does not provide postpartum Medicaid, risking the lives of new mothers and  increasing the likelihood that children will have to grow up without them. We have decided that children with disabilities will receive services not based on their actual needs, but based on the budget  for special education, which our state keeps at the barest minimum. 
We have chosen to make the word “welfare” into a bad word. Welfare by definition is the health, happiness and fortunes of a person or group. And we have chosen to deny the health, happiness and fortune of children in our state. Referring to a bipartisan push for Medicaid expansion to cover postpartum care, Assembly Speaker Robin Vos has said he  “cannot imagine supporting an expansion of welfare.” Why is providing welfare to support the health and wellbeing of children or anyone for that matter a negative concept? Why are we so afraid that if we support people in need  that it somehow takes away from us? For example, why would providing children with free lunches at school be a bad thing to do? Why would ensuring that children have access to medical care regardless of whether their parents can afford it or not be bad to do? Why would ensuring that children have access to quality care and education in their early years, regardless of their parents’ income, be a bad thing? Why would ensuring that children with disabilities have access to the services they need be bad? Why is it wrong  to have systems in our state that ensure we are doing everything we can to give all children the best opportunities to grow, thrive and become productive members of our communities? 
Rep. Vos and Joint Finance Committee co-chairs Sen.Howard Marklein (R-Spring Green), and Rep. Mark Born (R-Beaver Dam) all disagree with creating and funding policies that support our children. Time and time again, they have voted down policies that would have provided support to children. They have continued to forgo our future by not investing in our children. Instead,  they invest in the wealthiest in our state and invest in our punitive prison systems. They invest in large businesses with expensive lobbyists who demand tax breaks and deregulation. They invest in those most likely to donate to their campaigns. These grown-up white men cannot stand the idea of anyone, even a child, getting help from the state. If they had to pay for school lunch, they figure, so should  everyone else. If they had to pay for their child’s medical visit, then so should everyone else. If they had to pay for child care, then so should everyone else. They are incapable of seeing past their privileges. They cannot appreciate what it is like to be a child born into an environment that causes  harm and the trajectory that puts the child on. However, they will certainly be there when that child becomes an adult and enters the prison system. They are more than willing to pay for incarceration and punishment. 
That’s not just financially irresponsible — we spend about four times as much to keep someone in prison as we spend on education —  it’s inhumane, and it impoverishes our state and condemns children to unnecessary suffering and a bleak future.

By a 4-3 majority, the court awarded attorney fees to the plaintiffs in Montana Environmental Information Center and Earthworks vs. Office of the Governor. This is certainly not an unheard-of occurrence; other cases have reached the same conclusion. 
In reaching this conclusion, the majority reversed the district court’s denial of attorney fees.  That’s not unusual either. 
Here’s what distinguishes this case in the eyes of the dissenting justices: The majority had the temerity to offer guidance in what has been a confusing and inconsistent area of the law. 
Here’s the skinny: The plaintiffs asked the governor for copies of a wide range of documents. After about five months of dilly-dallying, the governor denied the request. The plaintiffs sued,  relying on the right-to-know provision of the Montana constitution (Article II, Section 9). They  won. 
When the plaintiffs filed to recover attorney fees for their litigation, district court denied the  request. In the view of the district judge, the governor’s Office “did not act out of bad faith,  indolence, or unreasonable delay.” This denial was at issue before the Supreme Court. 
In the 61 pages of ensuing verbiage, one nugget shines. It’s a simple, single-sentence statute: 	
    

 
2-3-221. Costs to prevailing party in certain actions to enforce constitutional right to know. A  person alleging a deprivation of rights who prevails in an action brought in district court to  enforce the person’s rights under Article II, section 9, of the Montana constitution may be  awarded costs and reasonable attorney fees.
 

In statutory interpretation, the word “may” carries clear meaning: The district court has discretion  to decide whether to award the costs and fees. In order to reverse that decision, the Supreme  Court must determine that district court abused its discretion. 
At the onset of the majority opinion, Justice Laurie McKinnon wrote, “When a party succeeds in  litigation based on a right to know request, it has performed a public service in ensuring that  Montana’s government is appropriately transparent and accountable to the people.” 
This statement follows precedent in at least two other cases (Bozeman Daily Chronicle v. City of  Bozeman Police Department (1993), Associated Press, et al. v. Montana Department of Revenue  (2000)). So far, so good.
On this basis, the majority took the next step: “A presumption towards awarding fees when a  plaintiff vindicates their constitutional right to know follows naturally in the context of the  right.” 
This is what set the dissenters’ teeth on edge. Justice Jim Rice’s dissent said the majority “abandons actual law and backfills the vacuum with its own creation made of whole cloth.” 
I don’t see it. In fact, Justice James Jeremiah Shea pointed out that “both this Court and the United States Supreme Court have long recognized, on a number of occasions, the necessity of creating  frameworks to guide the discretion of lower courts in applying statutory awards of attorney  fees.” 
Well, reasonable people can (and should) disagree. What puzzles me was Justice Rice’s swerve into accusing the majority of bias against a Republican administration and partisan weaponizing of the law. Where did that come from? 
When Justice McKinnon took the unusual step of responding to Rice’s “highly inappropriate  and unprofessional attack,” Chief Justice Cory Swanson weighed in. His self-proclaimed in-depth  reading of Shea’s dissent found “nothing offensive or personal in his criticism.” 
I find that artificially ingenuous and doubly repugnant. 
McKinnon wrote a well reasoned majority opinion that furthers our understanding of the right to know. It deserves respect rather than ridicule.

Patrick Morrisey held a ceremonial bill signing for Senate Bill 765, which establishes a Troops to Teachers program on Wednesday, May 21, 2025 at Hedgesville Middle School in Hedgesville, W.Va. (West Virginia Office of Gov. Patrick Morrisey | Courtesy photo)As a former educator at the high school and college levels, my interest in public and private and collegiate avenues of acquiring knowledge through education remains steadfast, even though I no longer teach; instead, I write books and commentaries that I hope will not only resonate with my readers but make a difference (however slight) in the way they see the world around them, asking, “What can I do? What will my contribution be to minimizing the escalating concerns that plague educational institutions and the teachers who deliver that knowledge?”
And if all we do is look at the overwhelming task, we’ve already been defeated in answering those questions. Yes, the issues are countless and to tackle any single one of them is a monumental task. Still, we can take that thousand piece puzzle and break it down, one piece at a time or better still, put it together one piece at a time.
As I read of education’s global concerns, I also make certain to read of what is happening in my own backyard, from what the new administration didn’t do this past legislative session for students and schools and teachers to what they did do: school vaccines, for instance. 
The powers that be continue to push aside the very real teacher vacancies that continue to escalate. Recently, Amelia Ferrell Knisely reported that Gov. Patrick Morrisey signed a bill creating “Troops to Teachers,” in an attempt to address West Virginia’s teacher shortage, a program that aims to put veterans in the classroom. He called the program a “common sense solution.”
Let’s remind ourselves that one reason for the teacher shortage in West Virginia is low teacher pay, compared to surrounding states. Until that discrepancy is remedied, the exodus of teachers in West Virginia will continue to rise. And the multi-leveled, arduous journey for these veterans to become certified teachers might reach beyond common sense. In fact, there’s a bit more to it than that.
George Bernard Shaw is credited with the phrase, “Those who can, do; those who can’t, teach.” In fact though, it was Aristotle who first said, “Those that can, do; those that understand, teach.” There’s a world of difference between the two sentiments. Shaw suggests that teachers are those who don’t know or haven’t learned their discipline. It’s absurd, and my suggestion would be to not repeat those words to an educator. Let’s be clear: teachers are highly skilled and experienced in their fields, with strong communication, interpersonal and pedagogical skills. The profession involves planning, delivering lessons and assessing student learning. It’s a teacher’s ability to articulate and explain complex concepts clearly, not simply perform a task, that educates and enlightens.  And if we, as students, are very fortunate, it is those very teachers who choose that profession in order to share their knowledge and passion with us that catapult us to our highest heights, giving us every possible opportunity to excel and succeed. 
I’m often asked why, in my commentaries, do I never offer a solution to a problem. Why do I focus only on the human factor? My answer never changes. I hone in on the human factor because I’m a humanist, because if I didn’t stay true to my core, then I would in fact be doing a disservice to those high school and college and graduate school professors who made certain that my liberal arts education was as well-rounded as they could impart. And until each and every one of us recognizes and prioritizes this undeniable truth, we cannot begin the journey to heal the wounds that scar each of us. Too, I will not disrespect my teachers or myself by even putting forth a viable solution to problems for which I’m not qualified. Are you following me? 
I know that Harvard University is under the spotlight right now, but I’ve always maintained that my West Virginia education could stand with pride alongside any other respected institution of higher learning. There are countless individuals (particularly those occupying offices of power) who can and must implement programs and support educators to make certain that not only I can continue to speak those words of praise but that every learned student to follow me can say them with pride as well.
There’s a great line from the movie “Cold Mountain,” when an aged woman who lives isolated in the mountains kills a goat in order to help an escaped soldier heal: “Bird flies somewhere, picks up a seed, [expels] the seed out, plant grows. Bird’s got a job, [seed’s] got a job. And you’ve got a job.” Can we please — each of us — do our job, rather than being so self-absorbed and concerned with who gets credit for what. As elementary as it may sound, let’s work together. It’s the only way progress moves forward.  Who cares who gets credit? Shouldn’t the only thing that matters be that the job got done?

(Capital-Star file)Pennsylvania schools would be required to integrate child abuse awareness and prevention into their curriculum under a bill being proposed in the state House of Representatives.
“We need to educate (children) when they are young. Sometimes by second grade, it’s already too late. They’ve already been abused. But at least if they hear the program and they get it, we can then provide them with help,” said Abbie Newman, CEO of global and external affairs at Mission Kids Child Advocacy Center in Norristown.
Newman testified Tuesday at a hearing for the legislation before the House Children and Youth Committee.
No votes happened. Just an informational hearing with expert testimony. That’s the furthest the measure has gone, though, with versions introduced during every legislative session since 2019.
More than half of states already require schools to teach child abuse awareness and prevention, according to the bill’s sponsor state Rep. Mary Jo Daley (D-Montgomery).
The Department of Education would jointly develop the age-appropriate curriculum for students in kindergarten through high school with another state agency (likely Human Services) under the current version of House Bill 460, according to legislative researcher Ryan Kline.
“We want to make sure we get this right,” he said, noting the legislation probably will change.
Proponents emphasized the need to engage experts — such as local child advocacy centers certified to provide preventative education — to help develop and deliver the curriculum. That could mitigate unintended consequences like traumatizing students and adding to the already overwhelming workload of public school teachers and faculty, they said. 
They also advised modeling evidence-based programs such as the Safe and Health Communities Initiative recently highlighted in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
Researchers found rates of both substantiated and unsubstantiated child sexual abuse reports dropped after they’d implemented a three-pronged intervention in schools and surrounding communities across five counties in Pennsylvania. They reached nearly 15,000 second graders in the classroom and more than 14,000 adults through a combination of formal training and public education campaigns during 2018 through 2020.
Asked how to improve the bill, one expert said a two-year launch seemed rushed.
“This is too important an issue,” said Benjamin Levi, a professor in the departments of humanities and pediatrics at Penn State College of Medicine. “As a pediatrician, I’ve dealt with both reporting [and] the long-term consequences. As a researcher, I’ve looked at these issues. As someone who’s developed educational programs, I know how hard it is to implement this. So I just want to caution that as we move forward, we need to be careful, deliberate, and evidence-based.”
Levi noted, for example, the potential for reporting to increase. That could overwhelm the state’s ChildLine reporting conduit if it remains resourced as is. He pointed out that ChildLine has about half the staff of its counterparts in Illinois and Michigan, which have comparable populations.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/state-capitol-harrisburg-copy-1024x460.jpeg,,,2025-06-05 06:03:40.764489

(Stock photo by Matt Gush/Getty Images)The North Carolina Senate Judiciary Committee voted in favor of a bill Wednesday that would expand state requirements for sheriffs to detain undocumented immigrants for retrieval by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
The bill, known as House Bill 318 or “the Criminal Illegal Alien Enforcement Act,” passed the North Carolina House in April and is now set for a vote by the Senate Rules Committee Thursday morning. It represents a continuation of the detention requirements passed in November under House Bill 10.
Rep. Carson Smith (R-Pender), a former sheriff, described the bill as an attempt to “clarify and make a few changes” to the law after seeing it in effect. HB 318 would expand the requirement for verifying immigration status from a specific set of felonies to all felonies as well as any impaired driving offenses. It also modifies the requirements for releasing individuals in custody under ICE detention orders.
Under the proposed law, a judge or magistrate would inquire into the immigration status of any defendant charged with a felony or impaired driving offense at their pretrial release hearing. If their status cannot be determined, they would be held for an additional two hours after an inquiry to ICE on whether they are subject to any detention orders.
“If an ICE detainer and warrant is received, they’re taken to the judicial official, probably the magistrate, to determine that they are the person that is subject to that detainer and that administrative warrant,” Smith said. “If they are, they will be held up to 48 hours after whatever point they would otherwise be released for ICE to come pick them up.”
Democrats and members of the public spoke out against the bill, arguing that it damages rather than furthers public safety. Sen. Lisa Grafstein (D-Wake) said she believes the requirements violate the U.S. Constitution, given that they would require sheriffs to carry out the ICE hold even when the individual in question has been exonerated or had their charges dismissed.
“We’re talking about keeping people where the state has no constitutional interest in holding them,” Grafstein said.
Under the terms of the existing law, sheriffs must only hold individuals in custody for 48 hours after the ICE detention order is received. The new proposal would require a 48-hour hold beginning when they would otherwise be released from custody.
Sen. Sydney Batch (D-Wake) said the proposal also violates the rights of crime victims, preventing them from getting justice if the offender is subject to deportation.
“As a victim myself, I wanted my day in court to testify against my offender, which I had the ability to do,” Batch said. “This new change would mean that if he were here and there was an ICE detainer, he would then be deported prior to the time of which I would have my day in court.”
Mary Ross, an activist with Democracy Out Loud who spoke during the public comment period, said deporting someone based only on allegations of a crime is “a really cruel way to treat people.”
“They’re people who are our neighbors, and most of whom are working hard, doing great work with us,” Ross said. “I just object to, essentially, judge and jury — the police officer arrests somebody and, boom, they’re a convicted criminal and a prisoner and they’re gone.”
The bill passed the Judiciary Committee hours before another bill on immigration, Senate Bill 153, passed the House. That measure, the “North Carolina Border Protection Act,” now heads to Gov. Josh Stein’s desk for his consideration.

At the heart of the push is Sustainable Aviation Fuel, or SAF, a biofuel derived from sources like corn grain, municipal solid waste, wet waste, and agricultural residues. Though not yet widely used, SAF is gaining traction thanks to its lower emissions and growing interest from regional policymakers.
The aviation industry has yet to fully embrace the alternative fuel, largely due to the high cost of production and limited infrastructure for storage costs. But with international interest rising and U.S. climate policies shifting, local leaders remain hopeful that a wider transition is on the horizon.
In the first three quarters of 2024, U.S. production of SAF reached 30 million gallons — a sharp increase of just five million in 2021, according to recent data collected by the U.S. Department of Energy.
“I’m very optimistic about its ability to survive because it goes straight to the farmers, and it is really about American-made products,” said Ed Hubbard, general counsel and vice president of governmental affairs for the Renewable Fuels Association. “If you can fall within the framework of ‘American energy, greatness and dominance,’ I think that those are the aspects that survive throughout the process.”
Hubbard warned that if the Trump administration withdraws incentives for SAF, it would contradict its own America First Investment Policy — a doctrine designed to pressure companies into manufacturing domestically instead of overseas.
On Tuesday, Hubbard joined a panel discussion in Washington, D.C., focused on raising awareness about SAF. The event highlighted the formation of a working group, a directory of aviation-related associations, and plans for a traveling presentation aimed at engaging government and aviation leaders.

The panel was hosted by the Greater Washington Region Clean Cities Coalition (GWRCCC), which works to promote affordable, local transportation fuels, energy-efficient mobility systems, and other fuel-saving practices. 
The federal government developed a strategy to encourage the commercial-scale production of SAF through a plan called the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Grand Challenge.
Under President Joe Biden’s administration, the initiative set primary goals to reduce costs, bolster energy security, and significantly increase the production and use of SAF. Key targets include achieving a 50% reduction in life cycle emissions compared to traditional fuels and meeting production milestones of three billion gallons annually by 2030 and 35 billion gallons by 2050 — enough to meet all domestic demand.
Given the significant impact of jet travel on the environment, advocates hope SAF can help mitigate the pollution it causes. In 2022, aviation accounted for 2% of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), and that share is expected to grow. The agency noted that aviation has experienced faster growth in recent decades than rail, road, and shipping.
“They pollute the environment, and the closer you live to those environments, the more negative it is on public health,” said Antoine Thompson, CEO and executive director for GWRCCC.
Data provided by GWRCCC at Tuesday’s meeting showed a combined 622 private and public airports between Maryland and Virginia.
Virginia began considering sustainability strategies at its airports earlier than other states. The commonwealth has a total of 406 public and private airports, 400 of which are privately owned.
In July 2016, the Virginia Department of Aviation (VDOA) commissioned the Virginia Airports Sustainability Management Plan — a voluntary guide for Virginia’s public airports to define their own sustainability priorities and needs.
Rusty Harrington, chief planner with VDOA, was one of the contributors to the plan. 
“We have so many people that are working in parallel, and (the meeting) has been an opportunity for us to see what everyone else is working on and find some mutual common ground opportunities,” Harrington said.
Beyond SAF, Harrington noted that researchers also exploring advancements in engine technology, as well as the use of using electrification and hydrogen resources.
As for Virginia’s role in environmental stewardship, Harrington said the commonwealth is taking it very seriously.
“We want to protect the resources that we have, and we want to lessen our impacts in almost every activity we do — from design, construction, operation, maintenance of our airports — with the goal of securing and balancing the economic, the environmental and the social impacts of any of our actions,” Harrington said. “We like to think we’re doing a very good job of that because it’s inherent in whatever we do in airport development.”

New legislation proposed by Virginia’s Capitol Hill lawmakers and their colleagues could prevent cost-sharing for prenatal, childbirth, neonatal, perinatal and postpartum care, keeping families from being saddled with big bills after birth. 
U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond, remembers the stress and fear of dealing with placenta previa, a life-threatening maternal condition, when carrying her second child, Samantha. Her placenta wasn’t in the right position, placing her and her fetus at risk and spurring a cesarean section birth and neonatal intensive care unit stay for the baby once it was born. She also remembers the extra medical costs that were associated with managing the condition to keep both herself and her daughter alive. 
The condition is rare but tricky if it develops later in pregnancy as McClellan’s did, and exemplifies how costly maternal care can be, especially if there are complications or emergencies. Bipartisan and bicameral legislation she helped create would provide birth-related benefits similar to the ones offered by Medicaid to Americans who are covered by private health insurance.
Reducing out-of-pocket costs like copays can help more families stay on top of monitoring conditions to prevent crises and be better able to respond when they do arise, McClellan said.
“The idea here is this will help get more people in for prenatal and preventative care so that hopefully you will have fewer emergencies,” McClellan explained. 
U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Virginia, said if the measure becomes law, it would represent a big shift in maternal health care for the country. 
“Childbirth should be free in the United States, and that’s a big idea,” Kaine said , who is a co-patron of the Senate version of the bill. 
That’s already the case in some countries, while in others like Finland, France and Great Britain, costs are curbed for expecting families and efforts to reduce maternal and infant mortality rates have proven successful.
Applying the concept to America is something that Vice President J.D. Vance (who also serves as president of the Senate) has previously been on board with, Kaine said. 
Last year, Kaine workshopped the idea with then-Sen. Vance before he was tapped to be President Donald Trump’s running mate. Kaine then connected with Sens. Cindy Hyde-Smith, R-Mississippi, Josh Hawley, R-Missouri, and Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York, to introduce the bill this year. 
“Bringing a child into the world is costly enough without piling on cost-share fees that saddle many mothers and families with debt,” Hyde-Smith said in a statement announcing the legislation. “By relieving financial stresses associated with pregnancy and childbirth, hopefully more families will be encouraged to embrace the beautiful gift and responsibility of parenthood.” 
The House and Senate versions of the bill can unify the “left and the right, the ‘pro-choice’ and the ‘pro-life,’” Kaine said, adding that the measures could fare well in the nation’s legislative branch and end up on Trump’s desk.

Getty Images.The Ohio Senate’s version of the state’s two-year budget would reduce the number of students who would be eligible to receive the Governor’s Merit Scholarship and it would come with strings attached. 
The Governor’s Merit Scholarship currently awards the top 5% of each high school graduating class a $5,000 scholarship each year to attend an Ohio college or university. The Senate’s version of the budget would reduce it to the top 2% of each high school starting with the 2027 fiscal year.

The Senate also added a provision requiring students who receive the scholarship to stay in Ohio for three years immediately after graduation. Students attending graduate school would be an exception, but the expectation would remain that they would come back to Ohio for three years after graduate school, said Ohio Senate President Rob McColley, R-Napoleon.
“Part of the reasoning for that is we want to keep our best and brightest in Ohio,” McColley said. “It stands to reason that if we want to keep them in Ohio, we should actually require them to stay in Ohio post-graduation.”
If a student who received the Governor’s Merit Scholarship moved out of the state within those three years after graduating, they would have to pay back a portion of the aid they received, McColley said.
“We do want some teeth to that,” he said.
Ohio House Speaker Matt Huffman, R-Lima, said the three-year requirement would be almost impossible to implement. 
“I think it would be extraordinarily difficult to police saying you must stay in Ohio for three years,” Huffman said. “I suppose we can try to penalize them and all that.”
Todd Jones, president and general counsel of the Association of Independent Colleges and Universities of Ohio (AICUO), said he is open to the state’s three year retention after graduation. 
“We’re very sympathetic to the need of the state to help retain people in Ohio who are getting financial assistance,” he said. “We wouldn’t oppose it not being there, but it’s certainly a judgment call for the legislature to make on that, and we’re sympathetic to their desire to keep folks in Ohio.”
The Senate’s version of the budget eliminated provisions the Ohio House added regarding additional requirements for private colleges to continue to participate in the Governor’s Merit Scholarship. 
The House had added language to the budget that would have required private colleges to comply with parts of Senate Bill 1 — Ohio’s new higher education law that bans diversity and inclusion efforts and regulates classroom discussion, among other things. 
Jones was happy that was nixed from the budget. 
“It’s important that we retain students in Ohio and keep our best and brightest here,” Jones said. 
The Senate decided to take that language out of the budget after hearing concerns from many private universities, McColley said. 
The Governor’s Merit Scholarship was enacted through the last state budget two years ago and 76% of the state’s 6,250 eligible students from the class of 2024 accepted the scholarship. Eighty-seven percent of Ohio students accepted the scholarship in its second year and 11 rural counties had a 100% acceptance rate. 
The Senate’s version of the budget trims how much money is allocated to the scholarships. It keeps it at $47 million for fiscal year 2026, but reduces it to $56.4 million in fiscal year 2027. Gov. Mike DeWine’s and the House’s version of the budget allocated $70 million for fiscal year 2027. 
Senate Bill 1 compliance
The Senate’s version of the budget ties a portion of the State Share of Instruction to compliance with Senate Bill 1. 
“We wanted to make sure that everybody at the university level was following through with the conditions and regulations in Senate Bill 1,” said Ohio Sen. Jerry Cirino, R-Kirtland. “We have the ability to decide how we’re going to fund things. … If they are viewed as in compliance, nothing will be withheld from their SSI share, which would be their normal proportion of the SSI dollars.”
Huffman said he supports tying a portion of the State Share of Instruction to compliance with S.B. 1. 
“If the universities aren’t going to apply state law then there needs to be some incentive to make sure that they do,” he said. 
House Minority Leader Allison Russo, D-Upper Arlington, is against tying State Share of Instruction to compliance with S.B. 1. 
“I firmly oppose S.B. 1, so tying more compliance to S.B. 1, which I think is an extremely flawed piece of legislation, obviously we oppose that portion,” she said. 
Senate Minority Leader Nickie J. Antonio, D-Lakewood, said she thinks the provision is outrageous. 
“It’s also following the pattern that we’re seeing at the national level of intimidation and bullying, frankly, telling people that if you don’t comply with what we say, then we’ll just punish you and we’ll withhold money,” she said.

After a pandemic-era pause, repayments on defaulted student loans restarted last month, and many borrowers are running into barriers. (Photo by Seth Wenig/The Associated Press)Over the past few months, Celina Damian’s phone has been ringing off the hook with one bewildered, anxious question after another: “What kind of loan is this?” “Am I in default?” “Will the government really take my wages?”
“Sometimes they just don’t know where to start,” said Damian, California’s student loan servicing ombudsperson.
“I’m talking to borrowers from all ages, from new borrowers to — I have 80-, 90-year-old borrowers,” she said.
The federal government last month restarted collections on defaulted loans. State student loan ombudspersons such as Damian have become some of the only sources of contact for worried borrowers lost in a tangle of conflicting information at the federal level about their loan status and repayment options.
The U.S. Department of Education began collecting on defaulted student loans in May for the first time since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020.
Federal student loans issued by the U.S. Department of Education come with fixed rates, set repayment plans and borrower protections. Private servicers handle billing, repayment-plan enrollments and defaults.
More than 5 million borrowers are in delinquency, and nearly 10 million — about 25% of the federal student loan portfolio — are at risk of default within months, according to data from the U.S. Department of Education.
States can’t cancel that debt, but they do register and oversee servicers operating in their states, run ombuds offices, tweak tax rules and offer outreach or limited grants — actions aimed at reducing defaults and the economic fallout.
Universities try 3-year degrees to save students time, money

When borrowers default, states will likely feel the economic impact. They might lose tax revenue as homebuying stalls. They could end up paying more for Medicaid and social services if borrowers need to rely on them. And students with loan debt may be reluctant to go into lower-paying public-sector work, leading to staffing shortages at state agencies.
A borrower is considered delinquent after missing a payment to the servicing companies that handle billing, repayment plan enrollments, and defaults.
Damian’s office, established under California’s Student Borrower Bill of Rights, began as a narrow statutory role but now serves as a hub for outreach, “Student Loan 101” workshops and escalated complaints to federal agencies.
Roughly 16 states plus the District of Columbia have followed suit, creating ombuds offices to guide borrowers through confusing paperwork and misinformation. Damian believes these ombuds offices should be in every state, as borrowers across the country will likely have similar questions and little help at the federal level.
“If you don’t have an ombudsperson or even just a person at the state level who can educate borrowers, that will make a difference,” Damian told Stateline. “These borrowers are trying to pay, but the system is broken. No other financial product works this way.”
Student loans became a key issue during last year’s election race, with President Joe Biden blocked by the U.S. Supreme Court in his effort to offer relief to 40 million Americans. In its waning days, his administration did forgive loans for some 150,000 borrowers under previous programs.
But President Donald Trump opposes most loan forgiveness programs, and in May, the U.S. Education Department issued a “Dear Colleague” letter to higher education institutions, reminding them of their legal obligations to help former students understand repayment responsibilities and access support.











These borrowers are trying to pay, but the system is broken. No other financial product works this way.


– Celina Damian, California student loan servicing ombudsperson



Some conservative economists say that federal loan forgiveness and financial aid hurt all students, offering colleges an incentive to raise tuition or lower their own institutional aid.
Winston Berkman-Breen, the legal director at the Student Borrower Protection Center, a nonprofit aimed at protecting borrowers and improving the repayment system, said that more than 2 million borrowers are stuck in a backlog of unprocessed applications for income-driven repayment (IDR) plans — calculated pay structures meant to keep payments affordable based on a borrower’s income.
Other borrowers have called federal agencies for help only to find that U.S. Education Department staff, including servicer-oversight teams, have been laid off as the Trump administration works toward dismantling the department entirely.
“There was an expectation to repay,” Berkman-Breen said. “But there was also an expectation that people would have access to affordable plans. That promise has broken down.”
States now have three primary tools to address student loan debt, Berkman-Breen said: enforcement actions to protect consumers, such as the 39-state lawsuit against servicer Navient; legal oversight by suing to uphold or challenge federal policy; and direct outreach to help public servants access Public Service Loan Forgiveness and similar programs.
Nineteen states now require registration for companies that service student loans, he said. And more than a dozen states align with federal policy to exempt forgiven loan balances from state income taxes.
‘Can’t wait for Washington’
Connecticut state Rep. Eleni Kavros DeGraw, a Democrat, calls student debt “a drag on the economy,” and said states can’t afford to wait for Congress — mired in partisan gridlock over student loan forgiveness — to find common ground.
“[Student debt] is stopping people from buying homes, starting families and fully participating in the economy,” she told Stateline. “That hurts us as a state, as a city, and we can’t wait for Washington to figure it out.”
Last year, Connecticut created a bipartisan reimbursement program that provides up to $20,000 for graduates of local colleges who make payments and complete community service. The state has distributed more than $2 million so far.
More public colleges admit high schoolers even before they’ve applied

Kavros DeGraw hopes the program can serve as a model, and has already talked with lawmakers in other states on possibly developing their own versions of it.
“These were people who were already paying,” Kavros DeGraw said. “It just made sense. I think it’s something that other states could explore this session, and it would provide an immense deal of relief.”
Lawmakers in other states also have considered student loan legislation. This year, New Jersey introduced bills to register education lenders and cap interest rates. Lawmakers in New Mexico, New York and North Carolina have proposed Borrower Bill of Rights legislation. Arizona has a registration bill for private servicers. None of these measures has advanced far.
According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, more than 20 states have enacted laws expanding loan forgiveness, repayment programs and servicer oversight in recent years.
Several states are also investing directly in workforce-aligned loan forgiveness: Georgia expanded its service-cancelable loan program to cover dental students working in rural areas. Idaho created a loan repayment incentive for rural nurses. Kentucky now offers $5,000 stipends to attract new teachers. Maryland authorized Anne Arundel County to launch a local forgiveness program for public school educators.
Repayment
Student loan stress is not evenly distributed. Seven states, all with Republican‐controlled legislatures, report delinquency rates above 30% among borrowers required to make payments.
Mississippi leads the nation with a conditional delinquency rate of nearly 45% — meaning borrowers who should be making payments are late. That’s just ahead of Alabama, West Virginia, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana, all of which have rates above 31%, according to recent data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
By contrast, Illinois, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Vermont and New Hampshire maintain delinquency rates below 15%.
Experts say this chasm reflects deeper systemic differences, such as lower median incomes in higher delinquency states, along with weaker consumer protections and a higher share of students attending for-profit institutions or leaving college without a degree.
States also have promoted the federal Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, established in 2007, that offers help to public service professionals. New Mexico has an outreach campaign that includes prospective teachers and health care workers. Maine has provided guidance to public defenders on how they can take advantage of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program and touts a related state tax credit on a marketing site to lure new residents.
Transparency bills seek to reveal the true costs of college

“States can regulate and enforce, but they can’t fix the structural problems in how repayment is administered,” said Michele Zampini, senior director of college affordability at The Institute for College Access & Success, a research organization that advocates for students. “They’re helping around the edges, but the core system is still broken.”
A November report from the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau found at least 3.9 million borrowers received misleading or inaccurate bills from servicing companies.
“The repayment system is not in a good place to provide the services and repayment options borrowers are legally entitled to,” Zampini said.
The Student Loan Borrower Survey, conducted between October 2023 and January 2024, found that 61% of borrowers who received debt relief made a beneficial life change earlier than they otherwise could have. Yet borrower awareness remains dangerously low: Nearly 42% of federal borrowers have only been on the standard repayment plan, and 31% of those didn’t know other options, such as an income-based plan, existed.
In California, a major part of Damian’s job in the past few months has been to help borrowers access existing forgiveness programs.
Meanwhile, new federal policy proposals could reshape repayment entirely. The Trump-backed One Big Beautiful Bill Act would consolidate existing IDR plans into a single tiered structure, with lower-income borrowers paying flat monthly rates and higher earners contributing 8% of their income. The bill also proposes extending standard repayment terms to 30 years — raising concerns it could delay forgiveness and inflate total interest costs.
The bill passed the U.S. House and is pending in the Senate.
‘Incentive to hike prices’
Andrew Gillen, a Cato Institute research fellow who recently testified before Congress, argues that any meaningful fix must address the incentives driving rising tuition — namely, federal aid being tied directly to college sticker prices.
“The link between rising tuition and increasing aid is what drives the Bennett Hypothesis, where federal student aid, in the form of loans, can lead to higher tuition costs at colleges and universities,” Gillen said in an interview. “If we instead use the median cost of attendance to calculate aid eligibility, we remove colleges’ incentive to hike prices just to capture more aid.”
Even without agreement on blanket forgiveness, experts agree on smaller bipartisan steps: streamlined repayment, stronger servicer oversight and targeted help for borrowers with the greatest need.
“We don’t want people defaulting. We don’t want payments that are too high for people just out of school. That should be the bipartisan starting point,” Zampini said.

(Photo: Greg Childress) The state Senate on Wednesday unanimously approved legislation meant to help the state’s struggling child care industry. 
House Bill 412 would allow larger class sizes in child care centers if the staff-to-child ratio stays the same.  
Child care center employees would be able qualify as lead teachers if they have five years of teaching experience as an alternative to a North Carolina Early Childhood Credential. 
The bill would also set up a workgroup on developing group liability insurance plans for child care providers. 
“A lot of child care centers are having trouble finding and keeping insurance,” said Sen. Jim Burgin (R-Harnett).
Child care businesses tend to operate on thin profit margins. At the same time, child care is unaffordable for many families. 
Child care centers face staff shortages that force them to limit enrollment. Wages are low and many workers do not have health insurance through their employers. 
The median wage for child care workers in the state was $11.69 in 2022, according to a report last year from the Center for the Study of Child Care Employment. More than 40% of early childhood educator households participated in safety net programs the report said.  
Legislators are focused on child care this year, with lawmakers considering increases in child care subsidies, and with an active task force Gov. Josh Stein assembled looking at questions of child care financing and funding, child care for the public sector workforce, and child care worker compensation.
Wide swaths of the state are considered child care deserts. Rural families are more likely to use home-based child care or have friends and family watch their children, according to the NC Early Childhood Foundation. 
House Bill 309, which makes it clear that for building-code purposes, home-based child care should be treated as a residence and not commercial building, also passed the Senate unanimously.

If you get a chance, check out a recent essay authored by retired Legislative Fiscal Analyst Richard Bostic. It was posted by Raleigh’s News & Observer.
In it, Bostic, who spent 31 years advising state legislative leaders, issues a loud and clear warning about the fiscal cliff toward which our state is speeding.
His simple and straightforward message: it’s imperative that GOP lawmakers rethink their massive, planned cuts to corporate and personal income taxes.
And his reasoning is equally straightforward.
Several core public structures and services – schools, state employee pay and retiree benefits, infrastructure – are already inadequate even as our population is growing and aging.
Now add the looming threats of climate change, federal funding cuts and an economic downturn and the picture grows even more ominous.
The bottom line: As Bostic observes, delaying or repealing planned tax cuts isn’t just about balancing a spreadsheet — it’s about protecting our schools, our infrastructure and our people. State lawmakers should heed this insightful warning.

Jerry Cirino, R-Kirtland, the chair of the Senate Finance Committee, stands in the background.
Photo: Morgan Trau, WEWSOhio Republican senators have proposed a flat income tax for the state’s top earners, which would result in a projected $1 billion loss in the general revenue fund.
Bailey Williams is like the average Ohioan — earning less than six figures a year. According to census data, the median income in the state is about $68,000. He’s worried about the Senate’s newly proposed state budget.
“The services that made me who I am today, public education made me who I am today. I worry about those opportunities being there for my younger siblings,” Williams said.
He is also a researcher with the nonpartisan organization Policy Matters Ohio and is evaluating a budget provision — one that creates a flat income tax of 2.75%.
There are three income tax brackets in Ohio. Those making up to $26,000 do not need to pay state income tax. Ohioans earning between $26,000 and $100,000 pay a tax of 2.75%. Those making more than $100,000 have to pay 3.5%.
Senate President Rob McColley (R-Napoleon) said that the highest earners in the state will have their income tax payment reduced to 2.75%.
“Every tax cut we do in the future will involve every single person equally, on a percentage basis,” McColley said.
State data reveals that this could result in a loss of about $1.1 billion in the General Revenue Fund.
How would Ohio make up the deficit from the tax?
“One of two ways,” Williams said. “We’re going to see increases in regressive taxes, most likely the sales tax, or we have to make do with less — less government services.”
Many cuts for programs that benefit lower-income families have already been proposed in the budget. Funding for schools, Medicaid, libraries, lead abatement, food banks and child care face funding decreases from the current status or from the governor’s budget.
When McColley was asked how he defends cuts to Medicaid, lead poisoning prevention and child care while allowing a lower tax rate for wealthier Ohioans, he said the “growth in Medicaid spending has been exponential.”
According to the Legislative Service Commission, a nonpartisan agency that works with the legislature, the proposed budget would result in a 4% decrease in spending, with billions of dollars in cuts.
He said that there was already an “awful lot” of lead program funding and said that they were keeping child care the same as before. However, the budget would cut the governor’s proposal of offering Publicly Funded Child Care to families earning up to 160% of the federal poverty level, keeping it at the current 145% threshold.
“No multimillionaire needs a $10,000 tax cut bankrolled by cutting lead abatement or Medicaid,” Williams said.
McColley said the elimination of 11% of the state’s income tax revenue would not actually impact funding because he predicts companies will move to Ohio to take advantage of that lower tax rate.
“A lower tax burden has had a positive economic development and brought more jobs to the state,” McColley said. “It’s brought more investment in the state.”
The budget will continue to be heard, and a final version will need to be agreed upon by the Senate and House by the end of June.

Steven Vladeck, for instance, praised Souter for “just how seriously he took his job as a justice — and a judge.” At the same time, however, as longtime Supreme Court observer Linda Greenhouse noted in The New York Times, Souter’s “name was on so few significant opinions and his profile at the court was so low that after his first few years, legal academia essentially stopped paying attention to him.”
Not all of legal academia. 
Among scholars who study state courts and state constitutions, Souter was notable for the experience at the state level that he brought with him to the Supreme Court. During his tenure as a member of New Hampshire’s highest court, that court contributed to the development of state constitutional law in significant ways. The Granite State stood at the forefront of the jurisprudential phenomenon known as the “new judicial federalism” — the practice of state courts interpreting the individual rights provisions of their own constitutions independently of the Supreme Court’s rulings on the parallel protections contained in the federal Bill of Rights.
The new judicial federalism was inspired, in large part, by an essay published in the Harvard Law Review in 1977. Alarmed by the extent to which the Supreme Court was retreating from the robust protection of individual rights under the federal constitution, Supreme Court Justice William Brennan reminded readers that “State constitutions, too, are a font of individual liberties, their protections often extending beyond those required by the Supreme Court’s interpretation of federal law.” 
In other words, individuals and advocates should consider, in appropriate cases, the depth and reach of state constitutional individual rights provisions.
The New Hampshire Supreme Court heard Brennan’s call. In its 1983 decision in State v. Ball, the high court held that, when state constitutional issues are properly raised, the state courts have “a responsibility to make an independent determination of the protections afforded in the New Hampshire Constitution.” To ignore this obligation, the court continued, would be to fail in the duty to defend the state constitution, which in turn would undermine “the federalism that must be so carefully safeguarded by our people.”
A commitment to the independent interpretation of the state constitution necessarily entails the development of approaches and modes of analysis suited to that particular constitutional context, which Justice Souter recognized in a 1986 case, State v. Bradberry. Souter had been appointed to the high court when the court issued its opinion in Ball, but he did not participate in the decision. Bradberry thus presented an opportunity for him to explain the stakes for state constitutional law in individual rights cases: “If we place too much reliance on federal precedent,” he wrote, “we will render the State rules a mere row of shadows; if we place too little, we will render State practice incoherent. If we are going to steer between these extremes, we will have to insist on developed advocacy from those who bring the cases before us.”
Justice Souter’s plea for support from the bar in state constitutional cases continues to resonate. In our treatise on state constitutional law, “The Law of American State Constitutions,” my co-author Bob Williams and I referred to Souter’s opinion in Bradberry as a definitive statement on the matter. In the book, we echoed the perspective articulated in his opinion: State courts that rely wholly on federal law in interpreting their state constitutional rights protections risk diminishing those protections, while too little respect for federal precedent risks isolating a state’s law from the larger, national discourse about the meaning of common individual rights provisions.
His experience with state constitutional law and the new judicial federalism distinguished Justice Souter’s career from that of most of his fellow U.S. Supreme Court justices, and the New Hampshire Supreme Court’s commitment to fostering independent state constitutional interpretation in State v. Ball has distinguished it from other state courts. 
In Bradberry, Justice Souter maintained that the commitment represents but an initial step toward reckoning with state constitutional text. In ascertaining the meaning of the state’s charter, Souter advised, the state’s courts should expect to rely on counsel representing each side of a case to illuminate the text. 
Such advocacy allows judges to consider the full range of interpretive possibilities that may lie in particular provisions of the New Hampshire Constitution — and creates an alternative to relying exclusively on the views of nine judges in Washington, D.C., who are tasked with construing a similar but fundamentally different constitution",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/souterlegacy-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-05 05:04:33.221669

Ohio Senate President Rob McColley, R-Napoleon, and Ohio Sen. Jerry Cirino, R-Kirtland, introduced the Senate’s version of the budget Tuesday and it took out language the Ohio House added that would have changed the Housing Trust Fund, created in 1991 and administered by the Ohio Department of Development.

The Housing Trust Fund is funded by a portion of the fees collected by county recorders, with half of the fees staying with the county and the other half going back to the fund — which requires at least 50% of the funds be spent in non-urban areas. The House budget would have removed the requirement for county recorders to send the state Department of Development money to reallocate the funds, making it less effective across the state.
“We are incredibly thankful to our champions in the Senate who understand that the Ohio Housing Trust Fund is the state’s most powerful tool for fighting homelessness and expanding affordable housing,” Amy Riegel, executive director of the Coalition on Homelessness and Housing in Ohio, said in a statement. 
The Housing Trust Fund provided emergency shelter for more than 27,000 Ohioans last year, she said. 
The Senate added $100 million worth of housing provisions in the budget that will create two programs — the Residential Economic Development District grants and Residential Development Revolving Loan Program. 
The Residential Economic Development District is a $10 million program. 
“(This program) is aimed at going to areas where there is an awful lot of anticipated housing growth, particularly areas around major economic development projects, and incentivizing local governments around those areas to streamline their zoning codes, to put zoning codes in place, in some cases, that will allow for these housing projects to move forward more efficiently,” McColley said. 
The Residential Development Revolving Loan Program would support building new, single-family residential homes in rural parts of the state. The Senate’s budget would direct $90 million into a revolving loan fund for local governments to finance the program. 
“What we’re seeing in many rural parts of the state are areas where it is simply uneconomical for home developers to come in and build in many of our rural communities because of the fact that the cost of infrastructure is so onerous in those areas that the amount of homes they would need to build just to break even is simply way more than that local market can absorb,” McColley said.  
The Senate’s version of the budget would also move the Ohio Housing Finance Agency to under the Department of Development.
The budget now goes to a conference committee, where Senate and House leaders have closed-door negotiations to come up with a final budget. Both chambers have to pass the bill and it will then be sent to Gov. Mike DeWine, who must sign the budget by the end of the month.

(Getty Images)LGBTQ+ Pride Month in a red state tends to have a certain edge. Even the most earnest celebration of freedom and belonging can feel like one of those disposable plastic ponchos, quickly unwrapped to keep off the rain. You appreciate it, you value it, but it can’t last forever.
Yet us gay people persist in living across all 50 states, and in every country around the globe besides. We’re most definitely here in Kansas.
You can make a joke or two about the Wizard of Oz (heck, I even wrote a column about it), but we’re still here, we’re still queer, and we’re still asking everyone to get used to it. Rather than opine about the meaning of the exercise, I thought I’d kick off the month by highlighting eight LGBTQ+ Kansans. (A hat tip to our friends over at the Manhattan Mercury, who published a similar list last year.)
If I left off important folks, please let me know. We have a lot of June left!
 
Melissa Etheridge
The Leavenworth-born singer-songwriter rocketed to fame in the late 1980s and early 1990s. A husky-voiced rocker, she blazed trails by coming out publicly all the way back in 1992. She’s since recorded a live album at the Topeka Correctional Facility.


 
William S. Burroughs
Beat-adjacent writer Burroughs was born in St. Louis and notably lived in Tangiers and New York. He relocated to Lawrence in 1991, however, and lived there until his death in 1997. The city’s Burroughs Creek Trail now bears his name.


 
Rep. Sharice Davids
The state’s Democratic representative for the 3rd District made history in 2018 as the first LGBTQ+ and Native American member. She has now been re-elected three times, which perhaps should raise some eyebrows among national Dems.


 
Cassandra Peterson (Elvira)
Any child of the 1980s (and I was one) knows the vampy Elivira on sight. The woman below the wig was Manhattan-born Cassandra Peterson, who revealed her two-decade relationship with a woman in her 2021 memoir.


 
Janelle Monae
This Kansas City, Kansas, native first caught my husband’s eye through her 2010 album, “The ArchAndroid.” She has since recorded more albums, acted in movies and now identifies as nonbinary, using she/her or they/them pronouns.


 
Gilbert Baker
Born in Chanute and graduating from Parsons High School, Baker created the iconic rainbow pride flag in 1978. Queer icon Harvey Milk, the San Francisco politician and activist, asked him to do so. As an unwelcome note, the Trump administration plans to remove Milk’s name from a Navy ship. Just to show that Making America Great Again includes insulting a slain veteran.


 
Stephanie Byers
Former State Rep. Stephanie Byers of Wichita was elected in 2020 as the state’s first transgender lawmaker.  Suffice to say, she put up with an awful lot during her term in office. However, I found her grit and vibrant personality a constant inspiration.


 
Matthew Vines
The Wichita native Vines attended Harvard and caused a sensation by arguing that Christianity doesn’t condemn same-sex marriage or relationships. He founded the nonprofit Reformation Project and wrote the book “God and the Gay Christian.”


 
Bonus: your Kansas Reflector opinion editors
This might sound like a bit of a cheat, but so be it. Both founding Reflector opinion C.J. Janovy and yours truly have written about our community many times. Janovy even published a book on the subject. Listen, living here might not always be easy. But there’s still a heck of a lot to celebrate.
I plan to spend at least a bit of time doing just that.

Susan Collins (R-ME) delivers election night remarks to supporters and staff on Nov. 3, 2020 in Bangor, Maine. (Scott Eisen/Getty Images)Editor’s Note: This story is part of a series about U.S. Sen. Susan Collins’ role during the second Trump presidency. 
The first time Biddeford resident Anthony Burgess could vote in 2014, he cast his ballot for Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins. A registered Democrat, he wanted to contribute to the Pine Tree State’s reputation as independent, he said, and he thought Collins embodied that. But he never voted for her again.
Several Mainers who regularly gather to protest the senior senator in the York County town similarly said that at some point during Collins’ decades-long career, they too voted for her. For most, their view of her shifted during Donald Trump’s first presidency and has solidified during his second. 
But Collins won in 2020 without the support of people like Burgess. Last time Collins was up for reelection, her Democratic opponent Sara Gideon, then the Speaker of the Maine House, focused her campaign on whether Collins had “changed” since she was first elected to the Senate in 1996.
”She tried to make the election about Sen. Collins,” said state Sen. Rick Bennett, a moderate Republican representing Oxford, “and it didn’t work.” 
The November 2026 midterm election, when Collins will be up for re-election, will be something of a referendum on Trump, Bennett said. However, he added that it also matters who Collins’ opponent is. A year and a half out from Election Day, some have already started to make themselves known.
Collins told Maine Morning Star she intends to run for reelection in 2026 and highlighted her record of delivering for Maine, primarily financially, as why she feels she remains the best person to represent the state. 
That focus of hers has previously helped unify a winning coalition of supporters. However, with the increasing demands for loyalty to Trump, slim Republican majorities in Congress and Collins’ race seen as an opportunity for Democrats to gain seats in the Senate, legal scholars, her critics on both sides of the aisle and polling signal the tightrope she has been walking is thinning. 
Known opponents 
Collins will face at least two primary challengers: Carmen Calabrese of Kennebunkport and Daniel Smeriglio of Frenchville have filed to run as Republicans. Calabrese, who moved to Maine five years ago from Florida, is a driver for Walmart and former small business owner. Smeriglio runs the rightwing Voice of the People USA radio and activist group. 
An independent has also entered the race: Phillip Rench of Waterboro, who sits on the board for the Maine Space Corporation and owns Ossipee Hill Farm and Observatory. He was a former senior engineer at Elon Musk’s SpaceX, though he said he has no association with Musk or the company now aside from stocks he was awarded as an employee. 
Two Democrats are also vying for Maine’s U.S. Senate seat so far. 
Jordan Wood of Bristol, originally from Lewiston, spent about a decade working in politics in Washington, D.C., including as chief of staff to former Democratic U.S. Rep. Katie Porter of California.
Natasha Alcala of Madawaska is currently a fashion designer who moved to Maine from California a little over four years ago. She has degrees in international relations and criminal justice and is a U.S. Navy veteran. Alcala previously filed to run against U.S. Sen. Angus King in 2024 but withdrew before the primary. 
A focus on money, in many respects 
Last election cycle, Collins’ pitch to Mainers focused on her ability to secure federal funding for the state through her then-expected ascent to chair one of the chamber’s most powerful committees, a position she now holds and emphasized when asked why she believes she’s still best poised to represent Maine.   
Susan Collins has reached a pinnacle of authority. How will she use it?

“By climbing that ladder in the last three years I have been able to secure more than a billion dollars for hundreds of projects in communities across our state,” Collins said, “That would not have happened without the seniority that I have.”
Collins highlighted earmarks she’s secured for investments throughout each of Maine’s 16 counties as well as legislation that will impact Mainers more broadly, specifically co-authoring the Social Security Fairness Act, which was signed into law under former President Joe Biden earlier this year and restored full benefits for millions of public sector workers.
Calabrese acknowledged that Collins’ role as top appropriator is a strength. “You can’t argue with that,” he said, “but I look at it as well, I thank you for bringing it, but you’re also spending my money. It’s my tax dollars.” 
And Calabrese thinks those tax dollars would go farther if Collins sided with Trump more often. 
“If you agree more with some of the stances that he has, maybe you’ll do better,” Calabrese said. 
Rench said he doesn’t think Collins’ continued pitch that she is best equipped to deliver financially for the state is a valid point. 
“What we need to do as a state is become less dependent on federal dollars,” he said. 
Rench said he would do this by building a stronger economic foundation for Maine families, including by addressing what he sees as “brain drain” in the state by overhauling the school system to have both college and trade school tracks. As someone who left the state after college to pursue opportunities in the space industry and then returned, he said he understands why young people leave and wants to change it. 
He is also proposing reinventing industries, such as creating a federal reserve of dimensional lumber, growing Maine’s food production and processing capabilities to serve the country and positioning Maine as a leader in the space industry.
Wood previously helped lead End Citizens United, a political action committee working to reverse the 2010 Supreme Court decision Citizens United v. Federal Election Campaign Act, which deregulated restrictions on independent political spending by corporations and unions.
Some of his top priorities will be anti-corruption reform and getting big money out of politics. He said he plans to lead by example with his own campaign by not taking any money from corporate PACs or lobbyists. He is also committed to not becoming a lobbyist after serving in office, refuses to engage in selling individual stocks and will prohibit his family members and those of his staff from lobbying his office for issues. 
In light of Trump slashing federal funding, Alcala said she would propose Maine partner with other states that have large gross domestic products, such as California, to ensure federal funding inconsistency doesn’t prevent people from having their basic needs met, such as by accessing low-income food assistance or making higher education free. 
“With our combined GDP, we can definitely make it so that we can help those that need the extra funding,” Alcala said. 
Smeriglio did not respond to interview requests.
Accessibility 
Constituents who have reached out to Collins — including Cape Elizabeth resident Jerry Kaufman, an independent who said he emails Collins nearly every day, and Cokie Giles, a registered nurse at Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor who regularly attends federal lobby days — argue they don’t feel heard. 
A common critique these two Mainers and others have is that Collins hasn’t hosted a town hall in at least 25 years.
Collins deferred to her press secretary Blake Kernen when asked about constituent requests for town halls. 
“She prefers smaller group meetings or Zooms, rather than holding town halls where very few people get to speak, and the level of civility is often not that high,” the spokesperson said. “These forums were also difficult for people who were more reserved or less comfortable speaking in public.”

Kernan also said Collins individually meets with thousands of Mainers every year in her office and during events across the state.
These frustrations about accessibility are not unique to the Republican senator. Mainers have started to hold town halls to air their concerns, whether their current members of Congress agree to attend or not. In Maine, Democratic U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree is an outlier, as she held in-person town halls in early April, her first since 2017.
In public events so far, some of Collins’ opponents have deliberately focused on personal appeals to voters to set themselves apart. 
Wood has held two town halls since he launched his campaign over a month ago. He said he will hold a town hall in each of Maine’s 16 counties during the race and, if elected, once a quarter. Wood also plans, if elected, to make his calendar public every month so his constituents can see who he is spending time with, he said.  
Rench opened up his observatory this spring to meet constituents and intends to travel around the state with his mobile telescope to continue one-on-one discussions. 
Alcala said she plans to start a YouTube channel to offer a more candid perspective into herself and her views for voters. 
Calabrese is starting with speaking at county Republican meetings and trying to engage with people at events such as upcoming county fairs.
Lessons learned from elections past
Some of those challenging Collins are actively trying not to make the mistakes they think Gideon made last election cycle. 
Rench made a list of criticisms he heard about Gideon, down to her wearing clothing from Patagonia, an L.L. Bean rival. But the one that is guiding him most is focusing on what he could bring to the Senate, not what he thinks Collins lacks.
“I don’t think people want to hear critiques of Collins,” Rench said. “They know who she is.”
In Rench’s view, neither of the major parties adequately represent the working class, which is why he chose to run as an independent. In particular, he said, “I still think the Democratic Party is stuck in grief.”
Nationally, Senate Democrats have previewed their campaign messaging, already targeting Collins in particular. 
The campaign arm of Senate Democrats began running digital ads in April against Collins and Republican U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina that highlight the Trump administration’s plans to cut phone services for Social Security, though the agency has not followed through on that plan. In response to this, Collins highlighted her work passing the Social Security Fairness Act. 
Wood, who is running as a Democrat, is bringing lessons learned from the presidential election, particularly his party’s estrangement with working-class and young voters, into how he’s shaping his campaign. 
“It’s our responsibility as candidates and as a political party to prove to that voter that we are the party that they should see as the side fighting for them,” Wood said. “I will spend as much time as I can in these communities, telling them about my vision for the future and the policies that I’ll champion to make their lives better.” 
The average age of Congress has been a concern raised in elections past. 
Collins is 72 years old and will be running for her sixth term as senator. Wood, Wrench and Alcala emphasized that they want to offer a younger perspective to Congress than Collins.
Calabrese is more so focused on the length of time Collins has held office. He said he’d only serve up to two terms if elected. 
“I think it’s time for some people — I mean we’re not Middle America but Middle America-thinking people — who understand what’s going on boots on the ground to get involved,” he said.

Can Collins continue to tow the line? 
Both parties have grown more ideologically cohesive creating a political environment that’s less hospitable for lawmakers who straddle the center — now a rarity in Congress. 
Collins became a more reliable vote for her party during Trump’s last presidency compared to her track record before. In 2017, 87% of her votes were party-line. This was a shift, as Congressional Quarterly found between 1997 and 2016 that she voted with her party on party-line votes only 59% of the time. 
But last year, she bucked her party the most out of all senators. An analysis from Roll Call found Collins sided with Republicans 47.8% of the time in 2024, although largely because of her votes in favor of President Joe Biden’s nominees. Her level of bipartisanship fluctuates depending on the measure, but she remains a rarity in the Trump era, neither endorsing the president nor fully turning her back on him. 
“I don’t want to say she’s on the outside of her own party, but to a certain extent she is,” said Mark Brewer, chair of the political science department at the University of Maine. 
Fewer people are running, and succeeding, with bipartisan campaigns. However, the success of Collins, the only senator from her party representing a state Trump lost in 2024, and Democratic U.S. Rep. Jared Golden in the second district — which also went for Trump — exemplifies that Maine is still holding onto that tradition, Brewer said. Bennett’s career as a prominent bipartisan voice is another example, Brewer added. 
Those running against Collins have taken more pointed stances, both for and against Trump. 
Wood said he spent the January 6 attack barricaded in Porter’s office, after which he co-founded democracyFIRST, a pro-democracy organization dedicated to combating growing threats to the free and fair elections.
“I think [Collins] had ample opportunity to be courageous to stand up to Donald Trump and her own party and she has failed to do so,” Wood said. 
Calling Trump a “wanna-be dictator, authoritarian that is trying to centralize all power and authority in himself,” he said if Democrats are able to secure a Senate majority in the 2026 election that will provide a better opportunity to oppose the president during the remaining two years of his term.
As Trump slashes federal spending, Collins’ promise to deliver for Maine is tested

Alcala is also pitching herself as a candidate who will stand up to Trump. “We’re in a coup d’etat by Trump and Elon Musk,” she said. “The fact that Trump is taking money away from Mainers, whether they’re Republican, liberal, what have you, the fact that he’s doing that means that we can’t rely on the current government that we have.” 
On the other hand, Calabrese said if elected he would help codify many of Trump’s executive orders into law. He commended Trump’s approach to immigration policy. “All this illegal immigration that’s one thing that I totally agree with him on,” he said. 
He also supports Trump’s push to make the U.S. a global leader in Artificial Intelligence and the cuts made by his Department of Government Efficacy. 
Calabrese said, “the President is not a king,” noting that he’d try to tow the line between helping the president follow through with his plans while still respecting the balance of power. 
However, Calabrese said, “If he needs to take his executive orders to the Supreme Court, well that’s the checks and balances.”
When it comes to the Supreme Court, Rench was also motivated to run because of Collins’ pivotal vote that helped seat Justice Brett Kavanaugh. 
“I have a nine year old daughter and after Sen. Collins, in my opinion, enabled the reversal of Roe vs. Wade,” Rench said, “I no longer trust her with my daughter’s future.”
Collins voted for Kavanaugh after she said he gave her private assurances he wasn’t a threat to the landmark abortion ruling that he later voted to overturn. 
Early surveys show the senator with much lower favorability than ever before. 
A poll from Morning Consult found that since last quarter, Collins’ net approval declined by 12 percentage points — more than that of any other senator. According to the poll, 51% of Maine voters disapprove of Collins, down from 47% at the end of last year.










A big part of Collins’ problem is that when it comes to Trump her approach is just antagonizing everyone.


– Public Policy Polling


Another poll commissioned by a top Democratic super PAC shows Collins is being pinched on both sides. 
“A big part of Collins’ problem is that when it comes to Trump her approach is just antagonizing everyone,” the pollster wrote in a memo. 
The survey of 569 registered Maine voters showed 81% of voters who supported Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris think the senator votes with Trump too often and 73% of Trump voters think she doesn’t vote with Trump often enough. Only 10% think she’s striking the right balance.
But on Monday, Pan Atlantic Research released its latest independent Omnibus Poll capturing the opinions of 840 likely voters and found close to an even split between those who find Collins favorable or unfavorable, similar to its polling in September. 
“A year and a half out from Election Day, it’s far too early to poll right now,” Kernan, Collins’ spokesperson, said. 
Pollsters have gotten Collins wrong before. The day before the election in 2020, Maine Senate polls showed Collins’ Democratic opponent Gideon ahead by six points. Collins went on to win by almost 9%. 
Some speculate she appealed to undecided voters in the end and that pollsters underestimated that Mainers would split tickets. 
Wood noted that Collins voted against Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett right before the 2020 election.  
“It was a reminder that she has a tendency to be independent sometimes and there was a hope that she could be a catalyst in some way for a post-Trump Republican Party, that was the Republican Party they grew up with,” Wood said of voters. “That did not come to fruition. I think that voters now have a much clearer understanding of the threat in front of us.”
But beyond this race, pollsters across the country failed in 2020, as well as in 2016, to accurately capture the zeitgeist, particularly for working class voters in rural areas.
When it comes to Collins’ continued independent, deliver-for-Maine pitch, Brewer said, “I think it’s going to be harder for her to do that, to run that kind of campaign. It doesn’t mean that she can’t pull it off.”

Utah is among several Western states seeking to reduce federal land ownership. (Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Public outcry was swift and forceful after a U.S. House committee last month hastily approved an amendment directing the federal government to sell off more than half a million acres of public land.
A few days later, lawmakers advanced the larger bill — a sweeping list of President Donald Trump’s priorities — but stripped the federal lands provision.
Yet leaders on both sides of the issue say the battle over selling off federal lands is likely just heating up.
Some conservatives in Western states have complained for decades that the feds control too much of the land within their borders. They see a long-awaited opportunity in a Trump administration that’s sympathetic to their cause. Public lands advocates are bracing for more attempts to turn land over to states, industry groups and developers.
“The threat level is red alert,” said Randi Spivak, public lands policy director with the Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental nonprofit. “Some of these states have been champing at the bit for decades to privatize. They’re certainly not going to let this opportunity pass without an aggressive effort.”
 The ‘balance sheet’

In Western states, where most federally owned lands are located, some leaders view these lands as a treasured inheritance — places reserved for all Americans and critical for wildlife, tourism and outdoor recreation. Others feel that too much of the land in their states is controlled by officials in Washington, D.C., leaving it off-limits for development and curtailing its economic value.













Some of these states have been champing at the bit for decades to privatize. They're certainly not going to let this opportunity pass without an aggressive effort.

Trump officials and allies have embraced the latter view. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum has repeatedly called federal lands America’s “balance sheet,” describing them as untapped assets worth trillions of dollars. He has launched an effort to identify federal lands suitable for housing development.
Other proposals have centered around using land sales to pay for tax breaks or to finance Trump’s proposed government-run fund that could invest in stocks or real estate.
For some state leaders, the newfound interest at the federal level to turn public lands into cash — along with Trump’s cuts to land management agency staff — aligns with a long-standing movement to reduce federal ownership.
“I look at it as an opportunity to say, ‘Hey, turn it over to the state,’” said Utah House Speaker Mike Schultz, a Republican.
Utah leaders have made the most forceful push to challenge federal land ownership. The state filed a legal challenge last year seeking to take control of more than 18 million acres of “unappropriated” lands — parcels held by the federal government without a specific designation such as a national park or monument. That effort hit a roadblock earlier this year when the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the case.
But with Trump in the White House, state leaders may pivot from challenging the feds in court to seeking their cooperation.
“We would love if the federal government just turned it over to us and said, ‘Here, manage these lands,’” Schultz said. “That’s an option as well. Those are discussions that are happening. Everything is on the table.”
Schultz declined to say which federal officials have been involved in discussions about transferring lands to the state.
Some lawmakers in Wyoming backed a state resolution this year — which ultimately failed — calling on Congress to hand over all federal lands except for Yellowstone National Park. Idaho lawmakers passed a measure calling on the feds to turn over a wildlife refuge to the state. And Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo, a Republican, has called for a “systematic release” of federal land in the state.
But public lands also have many supporters in Western states, including some prominent Republican members of Congress, such as Reps. Mike Simpson of Idaho and Ryan Zinke of Montana. Zinke was Interior secretary for two years during the first Trump administration.
John Leshy, who served as solicitor for the U.S. Department of the Interior during the Clinton administration, said proposals to dispose of federal lands tend to be stymied by fierce public backlash.
“Federal lands are really popular,” he said. “It’s political poison [to sell off public land]. It’s a different West now. Public attitudes have changed.”
Leshy also noted that livestock ranchers especially benefit from discounted lease rates offered by the federal government.
 Housing arguments

The most recent clash over the future of federal lands was the amendment sponsored by a pair of congressional Republicans last month. The measure would have directed the Bureau of Land Management to sell more than 500,000 acres of land in Nevada and Utah. Local governments would have been able to buy the land at market value, with no restrictions on how they used it.
Backers said the sale would bring in revenue to cover Trump’s proposed tax cuts, while allowing local governments to build much-needed housing on the parcels. Utah GOP Sen. Mike Lee said he will try to revive the measure as the Senate considers the bill this month, E&E News reported.
In Nevada, where 85% of land is owned by the federal government, some leaders say their communities are hemmed in by a checkerboard of public lands that constrain development. The city of Fernley, which is growing rapidly, would have acquired 12,000 acres under the proposal.
“We need housing,” said Benjamin Marchant, Fernley’s city manager. “The city can’t plan roads and water lines, sewer lines and gas lines, when you have federal land between two parcels that want to develop. This will bring a practical and helpful consolidation of all these lands into one developable area.”
Nevada leaders have long worked on proposals to transfer some federal lands to local governments and allow for increased growth. But some lawmakers say the latest push bypassed that collaborative process — and failed to include safeguards that the money raised from the sale of the lands would be reinvested into conserving public lands elsewhere.
“It was a complete betrayal of everything we’ve worked on in this state,” said Assemblymember Howard Watts, a Democrat. “This amendment is trying to sell off half a million acres of Nevada’s public lands in order to pay for tax cuts for billionaires. This is not going to address our housing problem. These lands are positioned to be sold off for other forms of development and extraction.”
Similar debates are happening in Utah. In southwestern Utah’s Washington County, local officials say the disposal of federally controlled land could help alleviate the region’s housing crisis and increasingly strained infrastructure.
The county is experiencing rapid population growth — in 2022, St. George, the county seat, was the fastest-growing metro area in America. County and city leaders hoped the amendment would have helped them manage the growth. The measure would have disposed of roughly 11,500 acres of federally controlled land in Utah, selling it at market value to local governments.
The proposal received pushback from all sides, including environmentalists, hunting and fishing groups, House Democrats and even conservatives.
“[The amendment] is consistent with how U.S. Department of the Interior Secretary Burgum thinks about federal public lands, as simply assets on a ledger to be sold off,” said Steve Bloch, legal director for the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, an environmental nonprofit. ” … It’s just antithetical to how Westerners think about the federal public lands that make up so much of our landscape.”
Washington County Commissioner Adam Snow, a Republican, said a lot of the opposition was misguided. The county would have acquired almost half of the land earmarked for disposal, and Snow said much of that would have been used to widen existing roads and construct new ones that are bordered by Bureau of Land Management property.
“These were not pristine wilderness lands. Some of the environmental groups tried to make it sound like we’re selling off Zion National Park, and that’s not even close to true,” Snow said. “If we can just not have to deal with the federal government every time we want to chip seal a road or improve an intersection, that would be really nice. Because we have to ask ‘Mother, may I?’ for everything out here.”
Local leaders say federal parcels could help ease housing pressures as well. Snow said transferring parcels to the city or county is one of the only ways to stop the area from becoming wildly expensive.
“We’re running out of room real quick,” he said. “ … There is still private land to develop, but they’re going to charge an absolute premium.”
The amendment that was stripped from the House bill was widely criticized for not having any restrictions on what could be done with the land.
“There was no language whatsoever that would require Washington County or St. George to do anything with these lands. They could lease them for development. They could sell them outright,” said Bloch.
 The costs of management

In Utah, lawmakers have created a state Department of Land Management — essentially a placeholder agency that would be funded and staffed only if their effort to assume control of large swaths of federal land succeeds. Schultz, the House speaker, said the state is committed to keeping the lands in the public domain, reopening roads and campgrounds closed by the feds.
“We’d just take over the job from the federal government,” he said. “It is something that the state absolutely would do, and we’d do it more efficiently, more effectively and we’d have better outcomes.”
Schultz said the state could bring in the revenues needed to manage the land by raising lease prices for oil and gas operations on parcels currently managed for drilling.
But some public lands advocates say that’s not realistic. The federal Bureau of Land Management employed more than 950 people in the state as of 2024, and feds also assume the expensive task of wildfire management on their lands.
“If you look at the history of what Utah has done with their lands, they’ve sold more than half of them,” said Devin O’Dea, Western policy and conservation manager with Backcountry Hunters & Anglers. “We’re certainly of the perspective that states could not handle the economic costs of managing these lands. Their hand would be forced; they would have to sell these lands in order to deal with those costs.”
John Robison, Idaho Conservation League public lands and wildlife director, said Simpson — the Idaho congressman — and the state’s two senators have all won praise from constituents for their work on public lands compromises.
“Savvy Idaho politicians know that public lands are popular,” he said.
But other state leaders insist their governments are better equipped to manage the lands. Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador, a Republican, was among the officials who signed an amicus brief in support of Utah’s lawsuit against the feds.
“We live here, we work here, and we are far better stewards of our forests and resources than federal bureaucrats in Washington,” Labrador said in a statement. “ … If Idaho owned this land, we could lease it for timber, grazing, and mining — just like the federal government does — but reinvest that revenue right here in Idaho.”

If you know anyone who works in the service industry, you should be very familiar with the problem of hour volatility. When work hours aren’t set, worker schedules can vary greatly from week to week and from month to month. This can make a steady stream of income difficult to achieve for service workers. It can also affect eligibility for public benefits.
The Ohio Department of Medicaid is currently working with the federal government to implement work requirements for Ohio’s “Medicaid expansion” population–the 760,000 Ohio residents who receive health insurance through the Kasich Administration-era expansion of Medicaid. These work requirements would apply to households at 138% of the federal poverty level and below.
Low-income households tend to be headed by people who work in the service industry. My colleague Michael Hartnett estimates that cooks and waiters are the second- and fifth-most common jobs among people in the bottom 20% of income in Ohio.
A new analysis by Brookings Institution researchers looks at how the volatility of hours for service workers will impact eligibility for benefits like Medicaid and SNAP.
One of the things they look at is the mental model that undergirds the current work requirement system. In 1976, only 26% of low-income employees worked in the service sector. By 2024, that number had risen to 38%. This means that 50 years ago, the contours of an unsteady sector had less of an impact on month-to-month hours than it does today.
These researchers used data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation to estimate that 64% of service workers worked less than 80 hours in at least one month in 2022. A third (34%) of workers who work an average of 80 hours a month had at least one month that year that they worked less than 80 hours. That means that a monthly work requirement of 80 hours would have disqualified a third of service workers at some point during 2022 from benefits like Medicaid or SNAP.
The researchers also find these volatile work hours are largely outside of the control of the workers. According to their analysis, three-quarters of service workers with irregular schedules say their schedules are at the request of their employers, not their own. This is also a high rate among non-service workers, where over 3 in 5 low-income workers with irregular schedules are conforming to employer requirements.
So what does this mean? It means tens of thousands of low-income workers in Ohio could lose their health insurance because of work hour volatility out of their control.
The labor market has changed a lot over the past fifty years, especially for low-income workers.
This has led to less certainty about hours, which makes thresholds like monthly hours not as effective for gauging whether people are participating in the labor force. There are a lot of reasons to be worried about work requirements. The fact that working people will lose health insurance because lack of control over work hours is just another one to add to the list.

And if you still believe the administration, they’re going to make those cuts without anyone losing benefits. As White House official Russell Vought put in last week, “This bill will preserve and protect the programs, the social safety net, but it will make it much more common sense. No one will lose coverage as a result.”
If your BS detector isn’t ringing by now, you need to take it in for repair.
Confronted with the absurdity of claiming that you can cut $800 billion without canceling health care coverage, Trump officials retreat to their fallback position. Yes, they admit, they’ll be cutting benefits, but only for those who don’t deserve it. 
“Medicaid does not belong to people who are here illegally, and it does not belong to capable and able-bodied men who refuse to work,” another White House official told Politico. “So no one is getting cut.”
Once again, though, your BS detector ought to be blaring. Under existing federal law, undocumented immigrants are already barred from getting Medicaid. They’re promising to cut benefits to people who are already not getting those benefits. So no savings there.
And the truth is, most of the able-bodied men who are too lazy to work are also too lazy to worry about jumping through the hoops needed to get Medicaid health-care coverage. Such men do exist, no doubt, but in numbers far too small to generate $800 billion in savings.
To get savings on that scale, you have to look elsewhere. And the truth is that millions of lower-income Americans, many of them working people, would be stripped of their health insurance if the bill becomes law. In Georgia alone, the projections are that as many as 200,000 people would lose coverage. And because Medicaid plays a larger health care role in rural communities, where the population is older and private sector jobs less likely to offer health insurance, the impact would be greater in those areas, putting additional financial strain on rural hospitals and health-care providers already struggling to stay open. 
(If Congress also refuses to extend subsidies for the Affordable Care Act later this year, as seems likely, the total number of Georgians who lose health insurance could top 700,000.)
And no, the money saved by such measures would not be used to reduce the nation’s deficit. It would instead be used to finance tax cuts, the overwhelming majority of which would benefit the wealthy.
A big chunk of the projected savings, an estimated $280 billion, would come from instituting work requirements for Medicaid recipients. The model for that nationwide requirement is supposedly the Pathways program instituted here in Georgia in 2020 by Gov. Brian Kemp.
By most measures, however, that program has proved a massive disappointment. According to the original projections by the Kemp administration, some 25,000 low-wage Georgians should have been enrolled in Medicaid through the program in its first year of operation.  
The actual number was 4,300.
By the end of its second year of operation, which comes next month, total enrollment was projected to be almost 50,000. As of April 25, it was 7,400, according to reporting by ProPublica and The Current. The monthly reporting requirements, record-keeping and bureaucratic red tape proved so discouraging that many Georgia applicants gave up in frustration, choosing instead to take the risk that they would not need coverage.
If it seems odd that such a program would be embraced as a model by the GOP, it might be a matter of perspective. It might be that your idea of a failure is somebody else’s idea of a success, because the two of you have different goals in mind. 
In this case, if your goal is to provide at least a bare-bones health insurance plan to lower-income Americans, then Georgia’s Pathways program has failed. However, if your goal is to discourage and obstruct as many Americans as possible from participating in that coverage, because you want to generate $800 billion in savings so the rich can get more tax cuts, then it starts to look a whole lot better.
Those yachts aren’t going to buy themselves.

But at least for now, bears need not worry. 
As this year’s General Assembly session drew to a close Wednesday, state lawmakers broke a years-long stalemate to give final approval to legislation allowing Sunday hunting. Meanwhile, a separate bill that would have allowed for a bear hunt fell victim to a late amendment and a dwindling clock.
Hunters have fought unsuccessfully for decades to overturn the state’s ban on Sunday hunting, which they have described as the last of Connecticut’s historic “blue laws.” In 2015, lawmakers partially repealed the ban for bow hunters.
Critics, however, argue that Sundays are a day of recreation by many non-hunters who would be disturbed — or potentially put in harms way — if hunters were allowed to shoot on Sundays.
As a compromise, lawmakers agreed to limit Sunday hunting to private property and prohibit any hunting within 40 yards of a blue-blazed or federally-designated hiking trail. The bill also prohibits the hunting of migratory birds on Sundays.
The resulting legislation, Senate Bill 7231, passed both chambers over the opposition of several Democrats. Gov. Ned Lamont said he plans to sign the bill into law. 
“It’s always seemed a little odd and unjust to us that we wouldn’t be able to use our own property for this purpose,” said Julie Cammarata, a lobbyist for Friends of Connecticut Sportsmen. “So obviously, they’re thrilled. They’re thrilled.”
Around the same time that the Senate took up the Sunday hunting bill Wednesday, House lawmakers moved to amend another bill, S.B. 1523, which was originally written to allow the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection to establish a bear hunting season to manage Connecticut’s growing population of black bears.
Those hunting provisions were stripped from the bill in committee, only to be added back in on the Senate floor last month. In the House, members voted to change the bill again, this time directing DEEP to assess the state’s existing bear population and come up with management plan that includes non-lethal methods for reducing conflicts with humans. 
In addition, the plan will include “proposals for how a regulated bear hunt could be implemented.” Any future decision on a hunt would have to come back before lawmakers. 
“It is my belief that that’s not the right step for us right now,” said state Rep. John-Michael Parker, D-Madison, the co-chair of the Environment Committee who introduced the amendment.
“This is a challenge we’re facing, we’ve seen it again across farmers and livestock, and even in our front and back yards,” he added. “So we need to take some really proactive steps and what we’re asking the agency to do is to come back to us with their best ideas of what that might look like.” 
Bear hunt opponents, however, saw the bill as simply clearing the way to target bears in the future. Both Gov. Ned Lamont and DEEP officials, they noted, have already signaled their support for a lottery-based hunt.
“We can try to sugarcoat it by calling it a bear hunt,” said state Rep. Mike Demicco, D-Farmington. “It will be a bear execution.”
Hunting bears is allowed in New York, Massachusetts and New Jersey. It is not allowed in Rhode Island, which has a smaller population of bears.
While both hunting bills drew some amount of bipartisan support, they were of particular interest to many Republican lawmakers representing more rural districts. For that reason, the bills were viewed as potential trading chips by Democrats as the clock neared midnight on Wednesday, the final day of the legislative session.
Republicans generally gain leverage through their ability to filibuster legislation in the final days of the session, grinding work to a halt and stymying controversial bills. Democrats, however, can offer to run certain bills in exchange for Republicans agreeing to limit their debates.
That’s what happened in the case of the Sunday hunting bill, which was taken up immediately following climate-related legislation, H.B. 5004, which had been a priority for House Democrats.
“If 5004 ran, Sunday hunting would run,” said Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield. “I was hoping a potential bear hunt would be part of a deal, but there wasn’t enough support in the House.”
Even without a bear hunt, S.B. 1523 contained other provisions clarifying the circumstances in which farmers may kill a bear that is damaging their crops or livestock. Harding, who represents many farmers in Litchfield County, said he was holding out hope to that language passed early Wednesday afternoon. 
But the House’s amendment forced the bill to go back before the upper chamber with just a few hours to spare Wednesday and dozens of bills left on the agenda.

Tony Evers and Republican lawmakers broke down on Wednesday. Evers delivers his 2025 state budget address. (Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)Republican lawmakers are planning to move forward on writing the two-year state budget without input from across the aisle after negotiations with Gov. Tony Evers broke down on Wednesday. 
Senate and Assembly leaders and Evers each released statements on Wednesday in the early evening saying that while negotiations have been in good faith, they are ending for now after meetings late on Tuesday evening and on Wednesday morning. Evers said Republicans were walking away from the talks after being unwilling to compromise, while Republicans said Evers’ requests weren’t reasonable.
“Both sides of these negotiations worked to find compromise and do what is best for the state of Wisconsin,” Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu (R-Oostburg) and Joint Finance Committee co-chair Sen. Howard Marklein (R-Spring Green) said in a statement. “However, we have reached a point where Governor Evers’ spending priorities have extended beyond what taxpayers can afford.” 
Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) and Rep. Mark Born (R-Beaver Dam) left the possibility of future negotiations open in a separate statement.
“Assembly Republicans remain open to discussions with Governor Evers in hopes of finding areas of agreement, however after meeting until late last night and again this morning, it appears the two sides remain far apart,” the lawmakers said. 
Vos and Born said JFC will continue “using our long-established practices to craft a state budget that contains meaningful tax relief and responsible spending levels with the goal of finishing on time.” 
In previous sessions this has meant that the Republican committee throws out all of Evers’ proposals, writes the budget itself, passes it with minimal Democratic support and sends the bill to Evers — who has often signed it with many (sometimes controversial) partial vetoes. 
LeMahieu and Marklein noted that the Republican-led committee has created budgets in the last three legislative sessions that Evers has signed and they are “confident” lawmakers will pass a “responsible budget” this session that Evers will sign.
Lawmakers have less than a month before the state’s June 30 budget deadline. If a new budget isn’t approved and signed into law by then, the state will continue to operate under the current budget. 
Evers said in a statement that he is disappointed Republicans are deciding to write the budget without Democratic support.
“The concept of compromise is simple — everyone gets something they want, and no one gets everything they want,” Evers said. He added that he told lawmakers that he would support their half of priorities, including their top tax cut proposals, even though they were similar to ones he previously vetoed, but he wanted agreements from them as well.
“Unfortunately, Republicans couldn’t agree to support the top priorities in my half of the deal, which included meaningful investments for K-12 schools, to continue Child Care Counts to help lower the cost of child care for working families and to prevent further campus closures and layoffs at our UW System,” Evers said.  
“We’ve spent months trying to have real, productive conversations with Republican lawmakers in hopes of finding compromise and passing a state budget that everyone could support — and that, most importantly, delivers for the people of Wisconsin. I am admittedly disappointed that Republican lawmakers aren’t willing to reach consensus and common ground and have decided to move forward without bipartisan support instead.”
Democratic leaders said that Republicans are refusing to make investments in the areas that Wisconsinites want. 
Assembly Minority Leader Greta Neubauer (D-Racine) and Senate Minority Leader Dianne Hesselbein (D-Middleton) said in a joint statement that it’s disappointing Republicans are walking away from negotiations. 
“The people of Wisconsin have a reasonable expectation that their elected leaders will work together to produce a state budget that prioritizes what matters most: lowering costs for families and investing in public education,” the lawmakers said. “This decision creates yet more uncertainty in a difficult time. Democrats will continue to stand up for all Wisconsinites and work to move Wisconsin forward through the budget process.”
Democrats on the budget committee accused Republicans of giving in to the “extremist wing of their party” by walking away from the negotiations and not committing to “fully funding our public schools, preventing the closure of child care centers, or meeting the healthcare needs of Wisconsinites.”

If signed into law, HB 5002 would require towns across the state, but especially in Fairfield County, to increase their housing supply in order to mitigate the cost-of-living crisis that has been pushing residents into poverty or to other states. 
The bill would shift many planning prerogatives long held by municipalities to the state government.
The proposed bill has received pushback from members of both parties. Critics argue that local planning decisions should remain in the hands of local officials; they fear the outcomes of developer-friendly incentives without resident input, and Soviet-style directives from callous Hartford lawmakers. I empathize with these concerns, but it must be stated bluntly: the local governments of Fairfield County are the authors of their current misfortune. 
HB 5002 was written because planning decisions have remained in the hands of local officials for decades, and these officials have failed to let housing supply grow in order to keep up with demand. Sentimental attachment to lot and unit size minimums, parking mandates, and fastidious micromanagement of developers’ plans has led to endless delays and sprawling development that consumes nearly all remaining green space. Moratoriums on multifamily units have exacerbated demand for missing-middle housing among seniors and young families. The multifamily structures that have been built are often squeezed in on the margins, on former industrial sites behind freeways. 
None of this should be taken to mean that I wholly disapprove of the leadership in many of these communities. I have closely followed the work of several planning and zoning commissioners in the region, and I greatly admire their efforts to accommodate two diametrically opposed interest groups: the state government that has pressured them to permit the housing stock that is desperately needed, and the restive, often explosive local opinion that greets development with hostility. Unfortunately, the center can no longer hold.
HB 5002 is a partisan bill, and the Democrats enjoy control of the state senate and the governorship. The bill will likely become state law. Municipal leaders in Fairfield County must accept this political fact and embrace a paradigm shift in community planning. For decades, many of these towns have tried to meet housing obligations while maintaining existing character, often by hiding development from view or slow-walking projects to avoid backlash. This will no longer be sufficient. 
Fairfield County residents would do to see that car-centric suburban planning norms are anachronistic; the postwar ideal of a two story ranch on a pesticide-soaked lawn is no longer the universal American Dream. Instead of clinging to this outdated totem of social status, residents should embrace a new kind of lifestyle, one in which the divide between work, home, and recreation is less distinguished.
Change may be scary, but imagine the following scenarios: What if instead of driving an hour to your job in bumper-to-bumper traffic, you could walk downstairs and across the street? What if instead of laboriously coordinating with other parents to pick up and drop off your teenagers at the movie theater, your kid could simply take a bus? What if instead of being shunted off to a dark, understaffed nursing home, your aging relatives could rent an apartment down the road from you, situated above a coffee shop they frequent? 
This can be the vision of a new Connecticut, one that embraces change and shapes it to benefit existing residents and newcomers alike. The Nutmeg State can reject endless traffic and embrace multimodal transport, reject sprawl and embrace connectivity, reject reaction and embrace the future. To do so, it must reform zoning laws and rethink what truly makes the Land of Steady Habits such a pleasant place to live. It must allow more mixed-use development, relax parking mandates and height restrictions, and allow builders to build what the market demands and where it demands it. 
Monroe State Rep. Tony Scott spoke out against HB 5002, saying the mandated unit goals for his town were “comical.” With some resourcefulness, however, Monroe and towns like it can rise to the challenge of the seemingly absurd development goals. The Maybrook Line, a freight rail corridor running through Danbury, Monroe, and other towns, could be reactivated for passenger service. 
Rep. Scott should push for transit-oriented development along this route: new housing clustered around newly constructed train stations rather than sprawling across parks and open land. In this way, towns can reduce traffic, preserve green space, boost tax revenue, and still meet their share of the state’s housing needs.
This hypothetical illustrates how local leaders can accept the provisions of HB 5002 and make them work for their constituents in innovative, forward-thinking ways. If communities can break free from the ideological blinders that shackle them to outmoded planning norms, they can chart the way to solutions that benefit everybody. 
The way I see it, the local governments of Fairfield County, and Connecticut at large, have two paths before them. On the one hand, they can accept that some things must change, get creative, and work to ensure that those changes emphasize connection and sustainability. On the other hand, they can thrash vainly against the tide of history, and succeed only in sinking beneath its waves.

Joe Courtney,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/05/collective-bargaining-is-rebuilding-americas-defense-industrial-base/,Congress recognized that the 2025 wages for shipbuilding trades were failing to match the hiring and retention demand for the Navy’s growing fleet size.,"As the dust settles following the hard-fought, months-long negotiations between Electric Boat and the Marine Draftsmen Association Local 571, both sides deserve tremendous credit for reaching a record-setting agreement and finding a fair path forward for the next five years. 
Reaching the “sweet spot” of this historic contract for the members of MDA Local 571 required a lot of intense advocacy and dialogue between management and labor, as well as the roughly 2,500 members of this unique workforce that designs the most advanced, complex nuclear-powered submarines in the world.

A contract that boosts general wages by more than 30% over the course of the contract, while retaining superior health and retirement benefits, sends a strong signal that this workforce is respected and valued. The five-year term of the contract also highlights the workload of the designers will be enduring in the coming years, given the strong demand for submarines by the U.S. Navy and Congress.
A notable turning point in the contract negotiations came on April 30, just weeks before the agreement was finalized. That day, new funding approved by Congress in December 2024 was released to Electric Boat, specifically designated for wage improvement for the submarine industrial workforce. 
The impact of this funding surge transformed management’s offer of a 21.4% raise to the final 30% general wage increase agreement (over the course of the contract). The hourly wage improvement offer saw a significant boost, with a much larger increase in the first year and steady raises in the years that follow —well above what was initially proposed. 
Simultaneous with this upgrade, the Electric Boat Metal Trades Council and Carpenters Union 2023 labor contracts were reopened, and the machinists, boilermakers, electricians, and painters also received a comparable boost in hourly rates. It is unprecedented for Congress to single out one shipbuilding production enterprise in the entire Department of Defense for such a boost in salary. There was no “wage improvement” funding for aviation, munitions, space technology, or missiles in the December spending bill or any other spending bill in recent memory.
This extraordinary Congressional anomaly is a recognition that the existing 2025 labor wage rates for shipbuilding trades were failing to match the hiring and retention demand for the Navy’s growing fleet size —particularly the submarine fleet. 
Although Electric Boat has brought on record levels of new hires over the last three years and maintained a significantly higher retention rate compared to other shipyards, the “churning” of new workers hindered faster production goals for both Virginia and Columbia class submarines. It did not take much analysis by Congress, the Navy, or industry to recognize that wages —especially for entry-level trades— were no longer competitive with those in retail, hospitality, and transportation, to name a few. Compared to the Cold War era from the 1970s to 1990s —when Electric Boat’s workforce was at its peak—the pay gap between shipbuilding trades was significantly wider than other sectors, which helped drive greater workforce stability and higher employment levels in the shipyard back then.
The successful agreement reached last month is a clear example of how collective bargaining can effectively address one of the most pressing challenges in our national economy: rebuilding America’s manufacturing industrial base. Realigning wage rates is a significant step forward to achieve our goal. 
More work needs to be done, including sustaining job training programs like the Manufacturing Pipeline Initiative and Career and Technical Education. These programs should operate not only in technical high schools, but also in traditional comprehensive high schools, where their presence is steadily expanding across eastern Connecticut with each new school year. Such efforts benefit not just Electric Boat, but other supply chain and non-defense manufacturers. 
That is how to build a strong Navy and how to build a strong middle-class economy that’s here to stay.

Jan. 3, 2024. (Photo: Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)Lawmakers are divided on what to do with a proposal to modify the law born out of a 2021 referendum question requiring the Maine Legislature to approve any new high-impact transmission lines.
Although legislators who worked on the campaign saw it as an effort to clarify the law, LD 810 fell shy of passage in the House of Representatives on Tuesday with lawmakers voting 72-75 before ultimately killing the bill under the hammer. However, the Senate passed the bill 18-16 on Wednesday.
It is now up to the House to determine if it will hold its ground or join the Senate in supporting the bill. 
With papers shuffling between chambers this week, Maine Morning Star has compiled a slightly more pared down roundup for Wednesday, forgoing the list of all bills voted on and focusing on the biggest items of debates as well as legislation and issues that we’ve followed all session.
Here’s an overview of what happened Wednesday.  
Both chambers
The Maine House of Representatives and Senate have now backed LD 1668, which would change the voting requirements to extend the data of adjournment for the Legislature. Currently, a two-thirds vote in each chamber is needed to do so. The bill would change it to only an affirmative vote of a simple majority in both chambers. After the Senate voted 20-14 in favor of the bill on Monday, the House narrowly voted 72-71 in favor on Wednesday. 
Both chambers also passed a bill that would expand summer school programming, LD 1624, with the Senate approving it without a roll call after it passed the House with a 75-71 vote on Tuesday.
The Senate also followed the action taken by the House earlier this week to reject LD 1982, a late-session bill that wanted to change how perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, also known as PFAS, are defined in state law. (Read more on that proposal here.) 
After the House backed it, the Senate approved LD 1248, a bill proposing to loosen the restrictions on restraint and seclusion in schools. (Read more about restraint and seclusion here.) 
Both chambers have also now passed LD 437, which would develop a pilot program to place child care facilities in a few school districts statewide. 
Legislation (LD 10) that would add political affiliation as a protected class to the Maine Human Rights Act. The House voted against it on Wednesday, after the Senate did on Tuesday. (Read more about this bill here.) 
Non-concurrent matters
The chambers can’t agree on LD 1960, which would exempt electronic smoking devices or other tobacco products containing ingestible hemp from the tax imposed on tobacco products. The House voted against the bill on Wednesday after the Senate voted for it on Tuesday. 
The chambers also still can’t agree on a bill submitted by the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife (LD 402), which would move the Natural Areas Program from the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry to the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, among other technical tweaks. Earlier this week, the House passed the bill with one amendment, while the Senate passed it with another. On Wednesday, the House and Senate insisted on their positions, essentially killing the bill.  
On Wednesday, the House also insisted, 81-61, on its vote against LD 544, aimed to create parity in the taxation of medicine by exempting sales of cannabis for medical use. This position is counter to the committee recommendation and Senate vote in favor of passage. With the Senate insisting on its position Wednesday, this bill is also essentially dead.
With a narrow 72-71 vote, the House did change its position on LD 588. The bill seeks to grant agricultural workers the right to engage in concerted activity. After initially voting against its passage, the House on Wednesday receded and concurred with the Senate, which passed it. The bill now heads back to the Senate. 
Senate action
Though the Housing and Economic Development Committee was evenly split, the Senate passed a proposed pilot project that would allow 30 small businesses from the farming, fishing and logging industries to set aside up to $250,000 of revenue, sheltered from income tax, to use for capital expenses in the future. 
Senate Minority Leader Trey Stewart (R-Aroostook) said he introduced this bill again this session because it could provide flexibility for the most critical components of Maine’s economy: its heritage industries. LD 195 includes a sunset date of 2029. 
Sen. Jeff Timberlake (R-Androscoggin),whose family has been farming in Maine since 1803, encouraged his colleagues to let the state try this out because it could help counter the year-to-year financial swings farms experience. 
The Senate voted 17-16 to reject a bill (LD 1535) that would require the Public Utilities Commission to gather a group of municipal, police and fire officials to discuss the high electricity usage related to illegal cannabis grows in the state. While Sen. Craig Hickman (D-Kennebec) agreed the state should look into that issue, he said the Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee is carrying over legislation into the next session that could provide a more comprehensive approach, including this sort of study. 
House action
The House passed a bill, LD 957, that would require Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander history to be included in the next review of content standards and performance indicators. (Read more about this bill here.) 
The House passed and enacted LD 1664, a proposal to amend the Dirigo Business Incentives program, which offers eligible businesses the opportunity to greatly reduce state taxes for up to five years. While the bill initially sought to repeal the program, the amended version passed would only change some program criteria.
LD 613, a bill supported by the Maine Medical Association that allows terminally ill patients to waive the current 17-day waiting period for access to life-ending medication, also the House 74-64 Wednesday. Several members shared stories about their loved ones’ end-of-life care. However, Rep. Kathy Irene Javner (R- Chester) argued the bill “removes the very pause that gives patients, families and physicians, the opportunity to reflect, to seek counsel to consider alternative palliative options.” 
After a lot of discussion, lawmakers voted 72-70 to pass LD 1036, which would prohibit landlords from refusing to rent to tenants solely because they rely on programs such as General Assistance or housing vouchers. 
Some lawmakers objected to the restrictions the bill would put on landlords, but others, including bill co-sponsor Rep. Cheryl Golek (D-Harpswell) said many residents relying on General Assistance are rejected from renting because of stigma, which the bill aims to address. (Read more about the proposal here).
“We as a state can only create fair housing once we take the steps to remove the discrimination within the housing opportunities,” Golek said. “Protection from source-of-income discrimination, protection is one significant way we can apply and protect this to people.”
The House also passed an amended version of LD 396 that would establish a grant program to encourage schools to adopt start times at 8:30 a.m. or later. 
A heavily amended version of LD 1787, passed the House. The bill initially sought to allow candidates for district attorney, sheriff and county commissioner to participate in the Maine Clean Election Act, but the version now being considered was amended to increase the contribution limits for gubernatorial seed money donations. (Read more about other proposals related to changing Maine’s clean elections here.) 
The House also passed an amended version of LD 1726, which seeks to improve planning for the future of the energy grid, with a 75-69 vote.
Legislation (LD 1900) to grant authority to certain Wabanaki Nations to develop tribal power districts and recognizes the authority for child support enforcement passed the HOuse 75-67.Finally, fter heated discussions about the effectiveness of masks in schools during which Rep. John Eder (R-Waterboro) asked Speaker Ryan Fecteau if he would like to apologize for mandating masks, the House voted 73-69 to reject a proposal (LD 1461) to prohibit school boards from instituting future mask mandates.

(Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — From economic development to tax-increment financing, the streetcar, immigration arrests and staffing, Omaha Mayor-elect John Ewing Jr. on Wednesday talked more about how he plans to lead Nebraska’s largest city.
Ewing spoke to reporters at his first news conference since defeating three-term mayor, Jean Stothert. He moves into his office Monday.
As he departs his elected post as Douglas County treasurer, Ewing said his chief deputy for 4.5 years will serve as interim head until, as directed by law, the Douglas County Board names a replacement for the remaining 18 months of his county term.

That deputy, Jane Alexander, who was at the event, said she is not interested in the position permanently, and Ewing lauded her “steady hand” and partnership. He said he was proud of his team’s reorganization of the office for efficiency, customer service and improved accessibility through technology.
Several current and former officeholders have privately discussed the possibility of pursuing Ewing’s former job.
 Continuity

Turning to staffing as mayor, Ewing said he wants continuity. As he starts his four-year term, he said he would retain all of Stothert’s department heads and senior staff except for her deputy chief in charge of communications, who has announced her retirement.
Hired to replace her was Erin Grace, a former World-Herald columnist who most recently led communications for the National Counterterrorism, Innovation, Technology and Education Center based at the University of Nebraska at Omaha.
As reported earlier by the Nebraska Examiner, Tom Warren will stay on as chief of staff. Ewing said the two have been friends since about 6 years old, and both served on the Omaha Police Department.
He said current city managers are capable, and he didn’t want to see an exodus from City Hall. He said he wanted to promote stability.
“What I’ve found in transitions is if you create fear, you lose the best people, because they have opportunities to go places,” Ewing said.
The mayor-elect made two promotions from within city government to focus on what he said was the No. 1 issue he spoke about while campaigning: “intentional economic development” — which he described as a “focused and inclusive strategy to grow our economy and uplift every part of our city.”

“Economic development to me looks like inclusion,” said Ewing. “It looks like expanding the urban core plan to North and South Omaha. It looks like creating job opportunities … It looks like having opportunities for people to be able to live, work and play in their neighborhoods.”
Since making history as the city’s first Black elected mayor and drawing national attention for upsetting a longtime Republican mayor in the city at the heart of the “blue dot,” Ewing said he has been contacted by businesses who are interested in relocating to Omaha. He wants to nurture those leads and said he values diversity. 
 TIF, streetcar, CWS

Among other topics touched upon by Ewing:
TIF: This public incentive, created by state law, became a divisive topic in the mayoral race. Ewing said one of the criticisms he had was that Omaha officials sometimes approved TIF financing for projects in areas that he does not consider blighted, one of the prerequisites. 
“So I am going to be looking at using TIF more strategically,” Ewing said.
He said he has a meeting planned with state lawmakers representing Omaha to talk about other incentives and ways to spur economic growth so that the city has a broader array of tools beyond TIF.
City streets: “We are going to develop a plan. We are going to tell you what that plan is and then we will be accountable for that plan.”
Streetcar: Ewing said he has recently learned more positive aspects of the modern streetcar project that was championed by the Stothert administration. The controversial initiative , a project with $389 million in city costs to be covered by TIF proceeds, became a contentious issue as well during the mayoral election.

Said Ewing: “My goal is to see how we can make it as successful as possible.”
College World Series: “My goal is to help lay the foundation so that Omaha can keep the College World Series for the next 75 years.” This is the 75th anniversary of the CWS in Omaha, he noted.
 ‘Have more decorum’

Immigration arrests: Ewing was asked about a video circulating on social media and reported by KETV, which showed a west Omaha restaurant server writhing on the ground and being handcuffed and taken out by immigration agents in tactical gear.
Ewing said someone sent him a text message Saturday about the arrest and he was still gathering facts. But he told reporters that his plan is to make Omaha a place all residents can feel welcome and safe.
He said the city would be reaching out to federal officials to see if there could be “at least some coordination” and awareness rather than a social media frenzy. 
“That’s not the way we want to do law enforcement in Omaha, Nebraska,” he said.
Omaha Police Chief Todd Schmaderer, offering his input, said it is “pretty customary” that federal immigration agents do not inform OPD of individual arrests. He said local police likely would be notified of large-scale activities and might become involved if an undocumented person is wanted on a criminal warrant and considered dangerous.
”There’s no way to keep us apprised of individual agents out there doing one-on-one situations like you heard at the eating place,” said Schmaderer, who was next to Ewing during the news conference. 
Ewing added: “We certainly would like them to do things in a way that doesn’t have the people of our community feel as if they are in jeopardy. So that is something we will share, because the person that texted me had a great deal of fear when they saw weapons being drawn. So we will have that conversation.”
The mayor elect later told the Examiner: ”However you do it, you’ve got to have more decorum.”
According to the KETV report, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security said special agents were looking for a “Guatemalan national with a final order of removal.” The agents saw someone matching the description and followed him to the Early Bird restaurant.
DHS said the man is a brother of the original target and closely resembled him. Federal officials contended that the man resisted arrest, and that allegations that he was “wrongfully taken” by the agents were false.
The restaurant on social media said, “We had no involvement or knowledge of this incident prior to living it alongside our guests and staff.”
Treasurer job: He said that during his 18-year tenure, the office added online services to register vehicles and an investment committee that, according to his website, generated millions of dollars for the county.
“As Douglas County Treasurer, I inherited a strong senior staff, and together we transformed that office. Nearly all those individuals are still serving today, and I am proud of what we accomplished. I bring the same mindset into this new role — investing in people, building strong teams, and delivering results.”

They divided the documents into sections and marshaled their staff lawyers to be ready with lawsuits.
So when Russell Vought and the Office of Management and Budget froze the distribution of certain federal funds — as outlined in Project 2025 — Ellison and other the Democratic AGs were ready.
They sued over the funding freeze the next day.
“They were not hiding the ball,” Ellison said in a wide-ranging interview with States Newsroom in Minneapolis Wednesday.
Ellison and his colleagues have engaged in more than two dozen lawsuits against Trump administration actions in the first five months of the president’s second term. The AGs have sued over cuts to federal agencies, tariffs, DOGE’s access to government data, attempts to end birthright citizenship, and more.
They’ve also toured blue states to tout their accomplishments and listen to voters’ concerns.
The stakes are high, Ellison said: the fate of multi-racial democracy.
Ellison, who served for a dozen years in Congress representing Minnesota’s Minneapolis-based 5th District, said the states are a sovereign bulwark against federal power grabs.
The Democratic attorneys general are not only fighting a Republican-controlled executive branch, but also a conservative majority on the U.S Supreme Court. In Ellison’s view, recent decisions by the Roberts court — particularly in 303 Creative v. Elenis, in which the court ruled that a business owner could not be obligated to serve a gay couple — signify that the country is moving towards legal segregation.
“We are a whisper away from Jim Crow,” Ellison said.
Still, Ellison was upbeat, celebrating the AGs string of victories and predicting that even conservative Supreme Court justices will resist the Trump administration’s attack on the rule of law and the institution of the court itself.
The Democratic AGs may benefit from a weakened Department of Justice under Trump, Ellison said. The agency that defends the federal government in court is hemorrhaging longtime staff attorneys, through both firings and resignations.
Ellison emphasized that many of the policies enacted by Trump in his first months in office would be legal if they were passed by Congress. Instead, the president is running the country through “edict” and “proclamation,” Ellison said.
“Our democracy is not perfect,” Ellison said, “but you will absolutely miss it when it’s gone, and Trump has given you a glimpse of that.”

(Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota tribal leaders highlighted uncertainty in federal funding, frustrations with the state Legislature and future economic development projects Wednesday during the state’s seventh annual Government-to-Government Conference.
The annual event brings leaders of the five tribal nations that share geography with North Dakota together with state officials to share updates, network and discuss common problems facing their communities. 
“We’re strong, strong people — and we’re getting back to that mindset of pridefulness,” Jamie Azure, tribal chair for the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa, said during his address. Azure said development projects in the pipeline for Turtle Mountain involve a retail center, movie theater, bowling alley and more.
The conference was started by former Gov. Doug Burgum during his first term in office. Burgum is credited with improving relations between the tribes and the state government, which were at a low point when he took office in 2016.
Gov. Kelly Armstrong, who succeeded Burgum in December, called continuing the conference a “no brainer.”
“We need the collaboration of our tribal partners if we want North Dakota as a state to truly succeed,” Armstrong said.
Like Turtle Mountain, officials from the Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate celebrated several new business opportunities coming to the Lake Traverse Reservation. Economic development is not about money, said Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate Tribal Secretary Curtis Bissonette.

“It’s about freedom, dignity and the ability to care for one another across generations,” he said. “We are not waiting on permission to act.”
Tribal leaders on Wednesday each expressed a degree of anxiety about federal programs. Native tribes receive services from the U.S. government in areas as wide-ranging as law enforcement, healthcare and land management. Native officials are worried about the impact of President Donald Trump’s sweeping cuts to federal spending. 
Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation Chairman Mark Fox said that if the federal government wants to stop funding tribes, it needs to help them maintain a “financial infrastructure” that allows them to  “to survive and thrive economically.”  
“If you take that away, then you’re going to cause dependency to exist for the next 100 to 1,000 years,” he said. 
During her address, Standing Rock Chairwoman Janet Alkire shared some of her tribe’s continuing efforts to collaborate with the federal government on land, energy and infrastructure issues.
She said after several years of negotiating with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Standing Rock last year entered into a co-stewardship agreement for Dakota Prairie National Grasslands within the boundaries of the reservation, for example. 
“These milestones may seem small, but it gives our people the opportunity to participate and have a voice, when once our voice was taken,” Alkire said.
She said she is also serving on a tribal advisory committee for the U.S. Department of the Interior under Burgum’s leadership.
Standing Rock leaders also provided updates on a wind farm project to improve energy infrastructure in southern North Dakota. They hope to finance it in part from a loan from the U.S. Department of Energy, though they said federal staff cuts threaten the program. Alkire said she has asked Burgum if the program can be rehoused under the Department of the Interior.
North Dakota tribal leaders see Burgum as an ally in Interior, energy role

Tribal leaders also had much to say about the state government.
Azure during his address played two video clips from this year’s legislative session of state lawmakers questioning the integrity of Turtle Mountain’s plans to build a casino and resort in Grand Forks. 
One was of Sen. Diane Larson, R-Bismarck, who during one floor session said the source of the tribe’s financing was murky and might come from cartels. (Larson apologized for her remarks later that floor session.) 
Azure also played a clip of Rep. Lawrence Klemin, R-Bismarck, who dismissed the project and compared it to a Chinese company’s failed plans to build a corn milling plant near the Air Force base in Grand Forks. Klemin said he no longer trusts economic development projects associated with Grand Forks. He later told The Forum of Fargo-Moorhead his comments weren’t directed to the tribe.
Azure said the comments were insulting to the tribe and called on the statehouse to do better.
“At the end of the day the mindset has to change, because we can’t go back here every two years and show videos like this,” he said.
Spirit Lake Nation Chairperson Lonna Jackson-Street urged the state to reinstate the motor vehicle excise tax exemption for tribal members living off reservation. Only tribal members who live on reservations receive the tax exemption under a law change adopted by the state Legislature in 2023.
Jackson-Street said a large portion of Spirit Lake members live outside the Spirit Lake Reservation due in part to the federal government’s illegal taking of tribal land under the Dawes Act of 1887, and now must pay thousands of dollars more in taxes on vehicle purchases.
She also said the tribe has continued to take a hit because of North Dakota’s burgeoning electronic pull tab industry, which has taken business away from the Spirit Lake Casino.
“We’re trying to establish new businesses within our community to supplement what our casino lost because of e-tabs,” she said.
During the North Dakota legislative session, Native lawmakers supported a bill that would have required the Legislature to consult tribes on policies that would affect their communities. Proponents of the bill, which failed in the Senate, noted that the statehouse passed laws that allowed for the proliferation of gambling without speaking with North Dakota tribes that rely on casino revenue.
“For the future, as a tribal leader and whoever may step into these shoes, it’s important you know that our government works with tribes on consultation,” Jackson-Street told the audience on Wednesday.

Armstrong in his speech Wednesday applauded the state Legislature for passing House Bill 1199, which requires the state to create a task force dedicated to reducing the number of missing or murdered Indigenous people in the state. 
Armstrong said while he was in Congress he worked on Savanna’s Act, which seeks to improve the federal response to the same issue. Armstrong said he thinks the Savanna’s Act is “good legislation” but that he thinks House Bill 1199 will be more impactful.
“That’s a perfect example of how you don’t solve those problems in Washington, D.C.,” he said. “This is solved on Main Street across rural North Dakota.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Alaska’s state school board has postponed consideration of a rules change that could limit the amount of money that cities and boroughs are allowed to give their neighborhood school districts.
The board voted unanimously on Wednesday to open a 30-day public comment period on the rules change rather than to enact it immediately on an emergency basis, as the Alaska Department of Education and Early Development had proposed.
“I never want this board to (have) its integrity compromised by rash decisions,” said board chair James Fields. “Our intent is to just try to uphold the law and do what’s best for kids. And so I think giving it time (for) public comment is definitely what’s best for kids.”
Currently, state law limits the amount of money that municipalities may give to local schools. The department proposed adjusting the definition of the limit so that services provided by municipalities to the school district, such as parking lot plowing or the use of pools and libraries, also must be considered local contributions.
Cities and boroughs already at or near the contribution cap, such as Anchorage and Juneau, would be required to reduce their local funding in response.
The vote followed almost two hours of impassioned and unanimous public testimony against the idea.
Jason Weber, superintendent of Valdez City Schools, said adopting the state’s proposal “would lead to an immediate reduction in the funding for student meals at a time when many states are expanding access to student meals.”
“Alaska should not be taking food off of kids’ plates,” he said.
Weber wasn’t alone: School administrators, parents and elected officials testified against the change on Wednesday morning, urging the board to reject the proposal.
“The magnitude of this emergency regulation passing could result in tens of millions of fewer dollars for students across the state,” said Jharrett Bryantt, superintendent of the Anchorage School District, as he testified against the proposed change.
Bryantt said he and other officials did not receive adequate public notice about the proposed emergency regulation, something required by law.
“It is my counsel’s belief that this use of emergency regulations is unlawful at worst and unethical at best,” he said, referring to the advice of his attorney.
“We need a thorough, transparent process immediately, if there’s any hope of restoring trust, it is my duty to pursue legal action against the state to challenge this immediately, if this were to pass,” Bryantt said. 
Regulations similar to the one up for a vote Wednesday have been discussed by the state education department since late last year, but the timing of this particular proposal came as a surprise to many across the state.
Sen. Bill Wielechowski, D-Anchorage, noted that when education commissioner Deena Bishop testified in the Alaska Legislature in mid-May, she did not say that the department was considering an emergency regulation.
“This will have a catastrophic impact on my constituents and people all across the state, students and parents alike. What this is is a pretext. It is, to be blunt, a ruse to undermine public education in the state of Alaska,” Wielechowski said on Wednesday.
Alaska is unique among U.S. states in that it substitutes federal “impact aid” — given to states to compensate for untaxable federal land — for some state public-school funding. All other states spend the federal money on top of their usual support.
To keep Alaska’s practice from running afoul of the U.S. Department of Education, the state must pass a pair of accounting tests intended to limit the financial gap between the state’s richest school districts and its poorest ones – called a federal equity test.
Alaska recently failed both tests, but rather than reduce the gap by increasing the amount of funding that goes to schools, the state proposed the opposite — limiting local governments’ ability to contribute. 
Sen. Jesse Kiehl, D-Juneau, advised the school board to wait for the state to appeal the feds’ finding of a failed test. A prior failure was reversed on appeal.
School districts operate on a fiscal year that ends June 30, and the proposed change would have been retroactive to the current fiscal year, even though most school districts have already finalized their budgets.
Budget officials, testifying Wednesday, said that a last-minute change could result in cuts to programs and services. Department of Education officials, speaking during a school board work session on Tuesday, said the timing was necessary to reduce the chances that the state will fail the accounting tests in 2027, when the current year’s audited financial statements will be examined.
The board could pass the department’s proposed regulations after the end of the 30-day public comment period, or those comments could lead to revisions that would themselves be subject to new public comment. The board could also vote down the proposal or not take it up at all.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/250417-Deena-Bishop-copy-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-04 21:04:26.282383

Federal courts struck down several versions of the travel ban until the Supreme Court upheld it in 2018. Former president Joe Biden repealed the travel ban when he came into office in 2021.Wednesday’s proclamation allows for some exceptions, including visas that were issued to people from those countries before Wednesday, those who have been granted asylum by the U.S. or have a refugee status and lawful permanent residents.The president’s proclamation cited national security concerns, but gave little detail on the reasoning that led to selecting the countries.“Publicly disclosing additional details on which I relied in making these determinations, however, would cause serious damage to the national security of the United States, and many such details are classified,” according to the proclamation.The Trump administration has moved to end temporary legal status such as humanitarian protections for nationals that hail from some of the countries on the ban list: Afghanistan, Cuba, Haiti and Venezuela.

At right is Rep. Cameron Cooper, R-Romance. (Screenshot/Arkansas Legislature)Arkansas lawmakers reviewed two rules Wednesday in response to a new law aimed at improving the state’s maternal health care landscape for low-income pregnant women.
The Joint Public Health, Welfare and Labor Committee spent nearly an hour discussing Arkansas’ new policy of presumptive Medicaid eligibility for pregnant women, part of the Healthy Moms, Healthy Babies Act that will go into effect in August.
Presumptive eligibility assumes 60 days of Medicaid eligibility and shortens the process of applying for coverage. The policy was among several recommendations to improve the state’s maternal health care landscape that a task force convened by Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders issued in September 2024.
More than half of births in Arkansas are covered by Medicaid, the federal-state health insurance system for low-income Americans. A federal budget bill moving through Congress would make deep cuts to Medicaid spending, reducing the program by $625 billion over 10 years.
U.S. House Republicans push through massive tax and spending bill slashing Medicaid

Elizabeth Pitman, director of the Division of Medical Services for Arkansas Medicaid, said she anticipates the proposed cuts will affect the state’s Medicaid expansion population but not pregnant women on Medicaid.
Arkansas has among the nation’s highest maternal mortality and infant mortality rates. Rep. Jack Ladyman, R-Jonesboro, said he found this frustrating and considered presumptive Medicaid eligibility “a very good cornerstone” for improving these statistics.
Ladyman and Rep. Lee Johnson, R-Greenwood, asked Pitman and other Department of Human Services officials how they plan to ensure that pregnant Arkansans statewide have the information and resources they need to opt into presumptive Medicaid eligibility if applicable.
“I want to support this rule, but I also want to be realistic in what we expect the outcome of this rule to be,” said Johnson, an emergency medicine physician and the joint committee’s House chair. “If we pass this eligibility category and nobody’s applying for it any more often than they’re currently applying for Medicaid, then it’s not moving the needle.”
Pitman said DHS can address Johnson’s concerns about access to information in its focus groups with pregnant Arkansans. She also said the agency will work with community health workers, doulas and other local health care providers and community organizations to ensure the option of presumptive Medicaid eligibility is as widely known as possible.

Committee outlines recommendations, actions taken to improve maternal health in Arkansas


DHS learned during the three-year public health emergency of the COVID-19 pandemic that spreading information about public health resources via social media, digital billboards and doctor’s offices successfully reaches the agency’s target audience, state Medicaid Director Janet Mann said.
In January, Arkansas received a 10-year, $17 million federal grant aimed at improving maternal health outcomes for Medicaid recipients. Applying for the grant was among the maternal health task force’s recommendations last year.
The grant includes payments to healthcare providers as incentives for improved data-sharing on maternal health outcomes, Pitman said.
In response to more questions from Johnson, Pitman said DHS does not have data on whether pregnant Arkansans’ first interactions with prenatal health care occur in primary care providers’ offices or emergency rooms.
Arkansas remains the only state that has taken no action to adopt the federal option of extending postpartum Medicaid coverage from 60 days to 12 months after birth, according to KFF. The maternal health task force did not recommend this policy, and a bill to create it failed in a Senate committee in April after Pitman and Mann expressed DHS’ opposition to it.
Arkansas Senate committee rejects 12-month postpartum Medicaid coverage

The other rule the joint committee reviewed Wednesday was the “unbundling” of billing rates for labor and delivery, a policy also put forth by the Healthy Moms, Healthy Babies Act.
The federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services authorized a 70% increase in Arkansas’ maximum reimbursement rate for obstetrical care “to include prenatal, delivery and postpartum care,” according to the rule. All of these services will be billed separately in all cases, Pitman said.
CMS’ approval of such a stark increase was “very unusual,” but Arkansas’ shortage of maternal health care providers in rural areas, closure of seven labor and delivery units since 2019 and high maternal and infant mortality rates led the agency to grant DHS’ request without question, Pitman said.
Higher reimbursement rates should “improve Medicaid’s data collection on utilization of prenatal and postpartum services,” the rule states.
“We’re really hopeful that this will give us better data and insight into what is happening in the prenatal care space: when women are going [to the doctor], if it’s the first, second or third trimester, who are they seeing and what are their diagnoses,” Pitman said.

(Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)A second company hoping to extract lithium in South Arkansas applied for a lithium royalty just days after officials approved the state’s first royalty rate. 
ExxonMobil’s Saltwerx submitted an application Friday for a lithium royalty identical to the one approved last Wednesday for the joint venture between Canada-based Standard Lithium and Equinor, a Norwegian energy company. 
The structure of its proposed royalty and the proposed 2.5% royalty rate is identical to what the Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission approved last week, and would apply to Saltwerx’s Pine Unit where it hopes to extract lithium from brine.
Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission approves first lithium royalty rate

In its filing, Exxon’s Saltwerx cited the decision by the commission as a “consistent, fair, and equitable precedent.”
According to the AOGC’s website, a special commission hearing is scheduled for noon June 23 in Magnolia and its regular monthly meeting is June 24 in El Dorado.
Exxon, via its subsidiary, was also a party to the 2024 royalty proposal that was unanimously rejected by AOGC commissioners, as was Standard Lithium. The commission ruled during a two-day hearing in November that a royalty could only be applied to existing brine units that the AOGC had approved — something Exxon did not yet have — after attempts by applicants to have a royalty applied to both current and future brine units. 
Like the Standard Lithium-Equinor venture, Exxon received an approved unit called the Pine Unit earlier this year, resolving that issue. 
However, unlike the Standard Lithium-Equinor venture, which last week had to show both that their project could “profitably extract” and was “fair and equitable,” Exxon already has a determination from the commission that its project can “profitably extract.” It’s one of a number of requirements under state royalties law. Exxon received that determination at the AOGC’s April hearing.



Info to know:

The Arkansas Brine Conservation Act requires royalties to be paid to mineral rights owners, and says profitable extraction must be determined to occur or have the potential to occur before a royalty is set and paid.
Royalties on substances extracted from brine other than bromine must be “fair and equitable,” in accordance with the ABCA.
A royalty is determined on a “unit-by-unit” basis, meaning that a company has to get approval for its royalty payment for an individual brine unit, which is a specific geographic area approved by the commission for the extraction of brine, rather than for the company as a whole or a geographic area like a county.			




ExxonMobil did not make someone from Saltwerx available to discuss the application, but company spokesperson Margot Armentor wrote in an emailed statement that Exxon was “encouraged” by last week’s decision and believes maintaining the “established precedent” set by that decision is important.
“The goal is a clear, consistent, globally competitive royalty structure, which will be essential for the state’s emerging lithium industry,” the company’s statement reads. “Getting this right benefits everyone – a thriving lithium industry would benefit mineral owners, the state’s economy, the surrounding region, local communities and bring new jobs to Southwest Arkansas.”

But some who work in the field worry it could ultimately impact residents.,"The Pennsylvania Capitol on Monday, March 6, 2023. (Capital-Star file photo)On Tuesday, the Pennsylvania state Senate advanced a bill that would enhance sentences for certain drug crimes committed within 1,000 feet of a recovery home. The bill passed out of the Senate Judiciary Committee and had a first reading before the full Senate. 
The bill’s sponsor, Sen. Wayne Langerholc (R-Clearfield), said it’s intended to deter drug dealers who target people in recovery. But some who work in the field worry it could ultimately impact people seeking treatment, and that increased incarceration has proven ineffective in stemming drug use.
“My initial thought is it could make things worse for the person who’s already struggling and trying to recover,” said Brady Maxton, who owns a treatment center and manages several recovery homes in Lemoyne. “I get the side of, I don’t want people selling drugs to the people at my recovery houses, but I worry. Is it going to help people get more treatment?”
Maxton has been around addiction and recovery his entire life. When he was seven, his parents, one of whom was an addict, opened the New Insights treatment center in Lemoyne. They opened their first recovery home roughly a decade later to provide a space for patients who may otherwise struggle to find stable housing. It’s a business that Maxton now runs.
“As much as I am very much about law and order, and recognize we have laws for a reason, I also grew up around this,” he said. “Just because somebody gets charged or gets a penalty and has to sit in jail for a period of time, that doesn’t mean they’ve had treatment. They just sat in jail, and got out, and can reoffend. It was just a pause in their substance use.”
Langerholc, however, said the law was designed to penalize drug dealers, not patients. He said the specific charges that would have enhanced sentences were based on the kinds of crimes he saw drug dealers charged with when he was an assistant district attorney in Cambria County. 
“We would see individuals trying to prey on people going through recovery. It’s absolutely tragic,” he told the Capital-Star. “There’s a big distinction between people who are dealing with addiction and people who are trafficking large amounts of controlled substances in our neighborhoods and communities and, specifically, near our recovery house.”
But Maxton said, at least at his facilities, that isn’t common.
“If the people in the recovery house are going after a drug, typically they’re talking to a coworker or bringing it in that way,” Maxton said. “In most cases when we talk to the people who get caught with this stuff, there’s a lot of shame to it.”
Anyone caught with drugs would almost certainly be evicted, he said, though he’d like to see them placed in another form of treatment, and not necessarily jail.
“To me, it gives the chance to get them in recovery again,” he said. “Yes, they should have some type of consequence, but I don’t think an enhanced consequence specifically for them would be good.”
Sarah Kawasaki, the chief of addiction medicine at Penn State Health and the head of an outpatient opioid treatment center where many patients live in recovery homes, worries that police will not always be able to tell who’s buying or selling.
“I don’t know how the police in real time are supposed to determine who’s living in the halfway house and who’s not, or who’s dealing and who’s buying,” Kawasaki said. “People are making mistakes all the time and the wrong people get put in jail.”
Moreover, she says that increased incarceration has been tried as a method to deal with drug users and dealers alike in the United States, and it’s failed to meaningfully stem drug use or overdose rates. Plus, at the end of the day, she doesn’t believe that anyone should make rules intended to keep recovery homes safer without consulting with professionals.
“I’m not sure that it’s the government’s place to decide what these programs need to help with their safety,” she said. “And I’m not sure that it’s gonna actually make the people living there and trying to do well less safe, versus getting them reincarcerated more easily.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/IMG_9969-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-04 20:06:11.008917

After creating a complicated web of residential property tax exemptions, lawmakers are now weighing whether to eliminate property taxes entirely. 
The post Wyoming Legislature to consider abolishing property taxes through constitutional amendment appeared first on WyoFile .","As Wyoming lawmakers sought to provide homeowners with property tax relief in the past few years, new laws created a complicated web of exemptions, leaving some taxpayers confused and frustrated. 
“Taxpayers often struggle to determine which exemptions they qualify for, when and how to apply and which forms are required,” Crook County Assessor Dan Thomas told a legislative committee Wednesday. 
“As a result, we see misapplications, missed deadlines and a rising frustration, both from taxpayers and from the county offices working hard to assist them,” he told the Joint Revenue Committee at its meeting in Gillette, where he represented the Wyoming County Assessors’ Association. 
“While each of these measures provides meaningful tax relief, taken together, they have introduced a significant level of confusion for taxpayers,” said Thomas, who asked for better communication in future decision-making. 
No committee members objected to Thomas’ characterization of the Legislature’s work product. In fact, several agreed. 
The committee’s solution to the property tax confusion the Legislature created? Abolish property taxes entirely. 
“We need to shift to a new system,” Casper Republican Sen. Bob Ide said before bringing a motion to draft a bill repealing most of Article 15 of the Wyoming Constitution. 
If passed by the Legislature and approved by voters, the proposal would eliminate all property taxes — residential, commercial, industrial and personal — which brought in $2 billion in revenue in the 2024 tax year. That’s more than any other tax stream in Wyoming. 
The committee voted 11-3 in support of the motion. Rep. Liz Storer, D-Jackson, and Sens. Cale Case, R-Lander, and Stephan Pappas, R-Cheyenne, were the three opposing votes. 
“A sales tax is the only way we’re going to muck out all of this layered minutia of property taxes,” Ide said. 
But such a sweeping change is how lawmakers got themselves in a pickle to begin with, Case told the committee.

“We’ve got complicated things on the books that we created — the people in this room created — and we’re mad about that. And that’s what happens when you throw bills out there, and vote on bills, and get the public behind them and then get them out and passed without really thinking of the ramifications,” Case said. “We need to study the topic first before we throw a resolution out to eliminate property taxes from the constitution.”
The committee also voted to modify two property tax exemptions already on the books, including repealing a sunset date for one and eliminating an owner-occupied requirement for another. 
Property taxes do not fund state government. Instead, they pay for local services like county fire departments, K-12 education and transportation, senior centers, hospitals, water and sewer, community colleges, law enforcement, libraries and the construction or maintenance of roads and sidewalks. 
As a result of recent property tax cuts, many local governments across the state are now facing revenue shortfalls. 
“We’re struggling right now with what services we can maintain, or where we’re going to have to start cutting,” Weston County Commissioner Ed Wagoner told the committee, pointing to a $220,000 revenue loss this year. 
Such a dip may be inconsequential to wealthier counties like Campbell, he said, but not Weston. 
“Every county is different,” he said. 
That type of unequal footing is reason enough to look at another system, Rep. Bob Wharff, R-Evanston, said. 
“I’m leaning towards this. I think it’s a novel idea, and I think it’s something we need to look at, because I don’t know how we take something that’s already unequal,” Wharff said. 
Relying more heavily on sales and use tax, Case said, won’t change the fact that there is simply an unequal distribution of where commerce occurs across the state. 
“You would still have a distributional problem with a consumption tax,” he said. “Take Niobrara County, for example, and say, ‘All right, people, your county is going to be funded by consumption, and it’s the consumption that occurs in the county. There’s nothing there. There’s very little exchange.” 
Storer also cautioned lawmakers that if the state shifts to sales and use, it would require quite a hike to make up the difference. 
“We’re only collecting about $1.4 billion in sales and use tax currently,” Storer said. “So if you just do some quick math there, that means we’d at least probably be doubling our sales tax.” 
Chairman Rep. Tony Locke, R-Casper, said he was uncertain where he stood on eliminating property taxes, but was interested in how it could ease the limitations of reforming property taxes within the confines of the state’s constitution. 
“We constantly see this, ‘it’s unconstitutional, it’s constitutional’ when we try to make a change. So from that perspective, I want to see what this looks like,” Locke said. 
The committee’s next meeting is Aug. 21 in Casper.

(Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)A federal judge in Denver on Wednesday issued an order blocking the Trump administration from carrying out the immediate deportation of the family of the man accused of attacking more than a dozen people in Boulder on Sunday with incendiary devices.
The suspect in the attack, 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman, is an Egyptian citizen and Colorado Springs resident who authorities say was living in the U.S. unlawfully. He faces charges including 16 counts of attempted murder and a federal hate crime. Soliman allegedly told police that he targeted a demonstration on Boulder’s Pearl Street Mall held by Run For Their Lives, which organizes events calling for the immediate release of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, because he wanted to “kill all Zionist people.”
Boulder County District Attorney Michael Dougherty’s office said the number of victims in the attack had risen to 15 people ranging in age from 25 to 88, along with one dog. No new information was released Wednesday about multiple victims who were hospitalized as a result of the attack, some with severe burns.

The Department of Homeland Security on Tuesday announced that it had detained Soliman’s wife and five children and was “processing (them) for removal proceedings from the U.S.” DHS Secretary Kristi Noem also said in a statement that the department was “investigating to what extent his family knew about this heinous attack.”
Soliman told investigators that “no one knew about his plans and he never talked to his wife or family about it,” according to an arrest warrant. Federal law enforcement agents executed a search warrant at Soliman’s residence Sunday night, and his family members were described by FBI officials as cooperative.
In a temporary restraining order issued Wednesday afternoon, U.S. District Court Judge Gordon P. Gallagher blocked the Trump administration from removing Soliman’s wife, Hayam El Gamal, or his five children “from the District of Colorado or the United States.” He set a hearing in the case, which was filed as a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, for June 13.
“The Court finds that deportation without process could work irreparable harm and an order must issue without notice due to the urgency this situation presents,” Gallagher wrote.
DHS officials have said that Soliman entered the country in August 2022 on a tourist visa that expired in February 2023, and filed an asylum claim in September 2022. The department’s statement Tuesday identified his family members as Egyptian citizens but did not contain specific information about their immigration statuses.
The Colorado Immigrant Rights Coalition in a Tuesday statement called the Boulder attack a “heinous act of antisemitism” but accused some of exploiting the tragedy to push an anti-immigrant agenda.
“Even as people mourn, some have chosen to weaponize the alleged immigration status of the attacker to stoke fear and division,” the coalition’s statement said. “Let us be clear: immigration status is not a cause of violence. Hate is. When we focus on whether someone is undocumented rather than the root causes of this attack — antisemitism, xenophobia, and bigotry — we risk fueling the same cycles of hate that lead to these tragedies in the first place.”
Colorado Gov. Jared Polis gathered with faith and community leaders near the scene of the attack on Pearl Street Wednesday to “stand against hate.”
“Violence in any form has no place in Colorado, and we know that to move forward we must join together in our common humanity to ensure peace in our communities, take care of one another, and emerge stronger,” Polis said. “My heart is with those impacted by this devastating event, and we are continuing to actively work with local and state law enforcement to protect our communities and keep people safe.”

Free.,Federal appeals court upholds order blocking Education Department closure,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/federal-appeals-court-upholds-order-blocking-education-department-closure,,"WASHINGTON — A federal appeals court late Wednesday upheld a lower court’s order requiring the U.S. Education Department to reinstate more than 1,300 fired employees and blocking an executive order to dismantle the department and a directive to transfer some services to other federal agencies.The ruling from a three-judge panel in the United States Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit marks a setback for President Donald Trump’s education policy agenda that includes transferring the federal student loan portfolio and special education services out of the Education Department on the way to closing the department entirely.The panel kept in place a preliminary injunction issued by a district court in Massachusetts requiring the administration to reverse course at least while a case  challenging its education policies is ongoing.“What is at stake in this case, the District Court found, was whether a nearly half-century-old cabinet department would be permitted to carry out its statutorily assigned functions or prevented from doing so by a mass termination of employees aimed at implementing the effective closure of that department,” 1st Circuit Chief Judge David J. Barron wrote in the panel’s opinion.“Given the extensive findings made by the District Court and the absence of any contrary evidence having been submitted by the appellants, we conclude that the appellants' stay motion does not warrant our interfering with the ordinary course of appellate adjudication in the face of what the record indicates would be the apparent consequences of our doing so,” Barron wrote.The Trump administration had immediately challenged an order in May from U.S. District Judge Myong J.

Free.,Judge orders Trump to facilitate due process for migrants removed under wartime law,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/judge-orders-trump-facilitate-due-process-migrants-removed-under-wartime-law,,"WASHINGTON — A federal judge in the District of Columbia on Wednesday ordered the Trump administration to allow Venezuelan men removed under an 18th-century wartime law and sent to a notorious prison in El Salvador to have their cases heard in court, though he conceded the logistics of the order would be challenging to sort out.In a 69-page order, Judge James Boasberg partially granted an injunction to require 137 Venezuelans be given due process. He ruled that they had no chance to challenge their removal under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, or the accusation that they are members of the Tren de Aragua gang.The Trump administration will have until June 11 to put forth a plan for the men removed under the wartime law and sent to the mega-prison known as Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT, to be afforded their due process rights.“The Government has violated the CECOT Class’s vested right to due process, an infringement that risks inflicting irreparable harm for which the public interest requires a remedy,” Boasberg said. “The question — simply asked but not so simply answered — thus becomes what relief they must obtain for that violation.”Boasberg said that the Trump administration “plainly deprived these individuals of their right to seek habeas relief before their summary removal from the United States — a right that need not itself be vindicated through a habeas petition.”He said that even if President Donald Trump lawfully invoked the Alien Enemies Act and if those subject to the proclamation are members of the Tren de Aragua gang, they must be given a chance to contest the charges.“This is the critical point —there is simply no way to know for sure, as the CECOT Plaintiffs never had any opportunity to challenge the Government’s say-so.”“Defendants instead spirited away planeloads of people before any such challenge could be made,” Boasberg continued. “And now, significant evidence has come to light indicating that many of those currently entombed in CECOT have no connection to the gang and thus languish in a foreign prison on flimsy, even frivolous, accusations.”Order doesn’t require returnThe American Civil Liberties Union, which brought the case, sought to require the Venezuelans be brought back to the U.S. from El Salvador to challenge their removals. But Boasberg rejected that argument.Boasberg determined that even though there is a financial agreement between the U.S. and El Salvador to detain the men, they are in the custody of the Salvadoran government.“While it is a close question, the current record does not support Plaintiffs’ assertion that they are in the constructive custody of the United States,” Boasberg said.“Even crediting the public statements characterizing the arrangement as outsourcing the U.S. prison system and acknowledging the President’s unofficial assertion of his power to request a release, such comments cannot overcome a sworn declaration from a knowledgeable government official attesting that the CECOT Class’s ongoing detention is a question of Salvadoran law.”Department of Justice attorneys have used the same reasoning in a separate case to resist the return of the wrongful deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, despite a U.S. Supreme Court order to ""facilitate"" the Maryland man’s return to the U.S.ACLU will be allowed to have input to determine how due process can be afforded to the men at CECOT, Boasberg wrote.Wednesday's order is the latest in a months-long dispute between the Trump administration and Boasberg after three planes landed in El Salvador and roughly 300 men were sent to CECOT in mid-March, despite the judge’s temporary restraining order against using the Alien Enemies Act.Boasberg found probable cause to hold Trump officials in contempt for violating his temporary restraining order that ordered the deportation planes carrying men removed under the Alien Enemies Act to be returned to the U.S. over concerns they did not receive due process.",,,,2025-06-04 20:06:11.008917

NorthWestern Energy electric customers will pay another $17.07 a month on average on their electric bills compared to their current payments with a rate increase the utility instated without regulatory approval.
The increase is legal, but it’s also the first time the monopoly has taken advantage of a statute that allows it to impose a new rate after an application has been pending, said Public Service Commission President Brad Molnar.
“We’re not allowed to stop it,” Molnar said this week.
The Public Service Commission regulates monopoly utilities, and in July 2024, NorthWestern Energy filed an application with the agency requesting rate increases. A hearing will start on Monday, June 9.
However, Molnar said a statute adopted nearly 50 years ago gives NorthWestern Energy the right to increase rates on its own after nine months have passed since applying for an increase, and a spokesperson for the utility said it has been transparent that it would move forward with the option if necessary.
The monopoly utility announced the 16.87% rate increase, an equivalent of $205 a year, in advance of the hearing this month on its upcoming rate case.
NorthWestern Energy blamed its decision on stalled action by the Public Service Commission, but Molnar said the utility set up an impossible schedule from the start, including rolling five separate issues into one application, and it should stop pointing fingers.
The Montana Free Press first reported the self-determined increase.
NorthWestern spokesperson Jo Dee Black said this week the higher rates are temporary until the PSC sets rates. In the meantime, she said NorthWestern needs to “shore up finances.”
“In this case, it’s better for customers, we believe, if the rate increases are gradual,” Black said.
Before it adopted its own increase, NorthWestern Energy had requested the PSC approve a smaller, interim increase, as part of a partial settlement. However, NorthWestern said it would move ahead with its original request if the PSC didn’t respond by May 1.
“As a result of the Commission’s failure to timely grant the unopposed motion, NorthWestern’s as-filed electric rates become effective as a matter of law on May 23, 2025,” the utility wrote in a memo.
Black said the PSC took 14 months to make a decision in two recent cases, and the national average is around nine months. She said the “prolonged” review is creating “significant financial challenges” for NorthWestern.
Molnar, though, said the utility needed multiple attempts to even file an application that met minimum standards, it hasn’t answered questions in a timely fashion, and it included multiple issues in one case.
He said that approach means more work for a small staff, more intervenors, and more questions.
“They are playing the victim,” Molnar said. “They are casting aspersions. They are being derogatory towards my staff.”
The Public Service Commission oversees monopoly utilities in Montana and is charged with ensuring just rates for consumers and a fair return for private companies.
Molnar said the rates are in place until the PSC makes a final ruling on the case after the upcoming hearing — which Black said may not be until the fall.
If the PSC finds that NorthWestern is taking too much money from customers, Molnar said it has to pay back the amount deemed an overage plus 10%, and he questioned why NorthWestern would take that risk if it was in such dire straits.
Black said it wasn’t an easy decision, but the financial health and “strain on cash flow” tipped the balance.
Molnar also questioned how the PSC could take action on the smaller interim rate NorthWestern had submitted since the facts in the case remain in dispute.
“It is time for them to grow up and quit playing the victim and actually take responsibility for their actions,” Molnar said.
Although Molnar had strong words for NorthWestern — and offered to debate their spokesperson and CEO Brian Bird on talk radio — he also said decisions about their case would be made based on the facts, not on emotion.
He also said his job is different than NorthWestern Energy’s.
“They have one legal obligation,” Molnar said. “And they have only one party to serve that, by law, is their investors. They owe nothing to the ratepayers. … The Public Service Commission is elected to represent the people of Montana, to represent all ratepayers, and to represent the utility, and to treat all fairly and without bias.”
The rate case is scheduled to be heard June 9 to 20, although Molnar said this week the time period could be extended based on witness availability.
However, Molnar said the increase will hit lower- to middle-income earners hard, such as people living in an older mobile home without modern insulation.
He said people who are all-electric going into the cooling season will see much higher increases than $20 or so a month.
“This will be crushing to many low-income people, many of whom are simply elderly, that are being handed their butts every day in property tax increases, in utilities, insurance for their houses, insurance for their cars. You name it,” Molnar said. “This is a very, very bad time to be a poor person, and this will make it worse.”
Black, though, said the PSC is hurting NorthWestern Energy by not approving the rate increases it needs. At the end of 2024, she said, the PSC lowered electric rates by 7.45% instead of temporarily increasing them 1.89% as the utility had requested in its original application.
“That interim rate decrease has put NorthWestern Energy’s financial health at risk,” Black said in an email.
In NorthWestern Energy’s most recent earnings call at the end of April, its leaders reported “a solid first quarter,” a “very, very attractive” dividend yield, and significant growth potential in the future.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/GettyImages-1248907535-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-04 20:06:11.008917

A controversial proposal to mine gravel at the base of Casper Mountain would use a county road, raising community concerns. State land commissioners will consider the matter Thursday.
The post Amid gravel pit fight, Natrona County looks to limit heavy truck traffic in neighborhoods appeared first on WyoFile .","Natrona County commissioners advanced this week a new county-wide policy aimed at regulating heavy truck traffic on designated residential roads, including Coates Road, which would provide access to a contested gravel pit on Casper Mountain.
Gregg Werger, a Coates Road resident and vocal opponent of Prism Logistics’ attempt to build a nearby gravel pit, reminded commissioners there will be a State Board of Land Commissioners meeting Thursday to consider Prism’s lease renewal applications.
At Tuesday’s meeting in Casper, Werger told commissioners that it would be beneficial to inform the state board that Natrona County no longer permits extractive mining in the residential zone where seven of the eight leases sit.
The county has done just that, sending a letter dated May 27 to the Wyoming Office of State Lands and Investments ahead of Thursday’s meeting. The letter also touches on concerns about impacts to county-maintained roads.
“While Natrona County has a long history of supporting economic development in our County, we Commissioners have deep and serious concerns about the impacts of gravel extraction at this specific location on the health, safety and welfare of Natrona County citizens and damage to property owned by Natrona County, including a public gravel road along which hundreds of residents and recreationalists travel weekly,” the letter states.
In addition to the letter, Casper residents are heading to Cheyenne.
“We have quite a contingent going over there this week,” Werger said.
Later in the meeting, during commissioner comments, Chairman Dave North also said he would be in Cheyenne for the state land board meeting.
“I believe there’s a lot of things that need to be said in front of the board,” North said.
The county’s letter points out that the state did not notify the county before granting the mine exploration leases in 2023 on several school trust sections adjacent to a rural housing area just west of Casper. The State Board of Land Commissioners, which made the decision, is made up of the governor, secretary of state, treasurer, auditor and superintendent of public instruction. The leases have since spawned two lawsuits.
Discussing safety on Coates Road, also mapped as County Road 503, Natrona County Road and Bridge Superintendent Mike Haigler said it’s 2.6 miles long with a speed limit of 35 mph. In the last one to two years, around $787,000 was spent on improvements, with contributions from the county, city and residents. A quarter-mile paved section within the Casper city limits was finished in 2021, funded by local property owners.
Haigler identified some safety issues on Coates Road, which is otherwise in good condition for homes. Issues include the need for yearly magnesium treatments to reduce dust, flying rocks from vehicles, and traffic coming from side roads that do not have stop signs.
During winter, strong winds and drifting snow can make the road slippery, especially near Highway 220, requiring a lot of plowing and sanding.
A school bus turnaround in the city requires the bus to make a full turn on the road.
The space for traffic at the CY Avenue stop sign is limited, with less than 160 feet, which could block driveways. Haigler also said the view toward Robertson Road is not very good.
The 24-foot-wide road is meant for residential traffic, with the paved part designed for vehicles weighing up to 16,000 pounds, but not for heavy loads over time. The gravel part has 6 inches of gravel, commissioners were told.
Coates Road is a dead-end road, requiring vehicles to turn on private property or off-road at the south end.
The area has seen free-range cattle in Section 16, and is used by people for recreational activities like riding horses, bicycles and jogging.
City of Casper Chief Operating Officer Tom Brauer said the city hasn’t taken a “hard position” regarding heavy truck traffic on Coates Road, opting instead to state facts. Commissioner Jim Milne encouraged the city to take a stance, saying the city is “trying to straddle a fence and let the county deal with it.”
North spoke about the county board’s responsibility to keep county roads safe for residents. He said the new policy on heavy vehicle traffic will apply to all county roads, not just Coates Road, to protect county assets and follow zoning rules about which industries and traffic are allowed. The County Attorney’s Office could manage permits for specific traffic requests.
The county commissioners approved Tuesday a resolution that will now undergo a 45-day public comment period. Milne suggested changes to make it clear that the elected commissioners, rather than just the Road and Bridge Department, will make final decisions on road restrictions or special permits. He also proposed adding an addendum to allow for changing the list of roads as necessary. While the resolution will be published in its current form at first, the suggestions will be considered for the final version.
During the public comment portion of the meeting, Coates Road resident Walter Merschat asked for clarification on the review process after the 45-day period. Commissioners assured him the resolution would be brought back for their vote, and all written comments would be considered before adoption.

Dan McKee to join the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority’s board of directors. (Courtesy photo)A Senate panel will give first vetting Thursday to a nominee who could bring racial diversity to the state’s quasi-public bus agency. 
Gov. Dan McKee on May 28 announced his nomination of Bernard Georges to serve on the Rhode Island Public Transportation Authority’s (RIPTA) board of directors, citing his professional experience and community ties leading New Bridges for Haitian Success, Inc, a nonprofit that assists Haitian immigrants. 
Not mentioned in McKee’s statement, but crucial to transit advocates and participants, is the diversity Georges’ would bring to the nine-member board.
“The board is now mostly, if not entirely, white men,” RI Transit Riders Co-Chair Amy Glidden said in an interview Wednesday.
Georges declined to comment on his nomination when reached by phone Wednesday.
If approved by the full Senate chamber, Georges would replace former state Sen. Robert Kells, a Providence Democrat who has served on RIPTA’s board of directors since 2019. Kells’ term expired April 1, 2025 — along with four other members, according to the Rhode Island Secretary of State’s website.
His nomination will be considered by the Committee on Housing & Municipal Government Thursday afternoon. Board members typically serve a three-year term, but Georges’ term would expire April 2027. McKee’s office acknowledged an inquiry on the reason for the shorter term but did not send a response as of Wednesday evening.
Glidden commended the governor for bringing diversity to the board, which she said has been lacking since the term of Marcy Reyes, who is Puerto Rican, ended April 2024. Heather Schey, who is white, remains the only woman on the board.
Nearly 60% of RIPTA riders identified as people of color, according to a 2021 survey of 3,565 bus users.
State law calls for “diverse membership,” but does not address racial or gender diversity outright. 
Even more important to Glidden than race was board representation of transit riders. State law mandates the board include at least one regular fixed-route rider and one person with a disability. Schey is a user of RIPTA’s paratransit service, while James Leach is a regular fixed-route rider.
Glidden also would have liked for the governor to give riders a say before making his nomination.
“There’s been no public input,” she said.
Georges immigrated to Rhode Island in 2000 at age 16 from Haiti, joining his father, who had already fled the island nation years earlier during the dictatorship of Jean-Claude “Baby Doc’’ Duvalier. 
He graduated from Central High School in Providence in 2004 and received an associate’s degree in law enforcement at the Community College of Rhode Island, along with a bachelor’s degree in criminal justice and a master’s degree in public administration from Roger Williams University.
In 2013, Georges founded New Bridges for Haitian Success, which supports immigrants through job training, case management, counseling, and obtaining health care. He also worked for the Rhode Island Department of Children, Youth & Families as a residential counselor, according to the governor’s office.
“Bernard is a dedicated community leader who has spent his career helping others find pathways to a successful future,” McKee said in a statement.
RIPTA CEO Chirstopher Durand welcomed Georges’ addition to the board.
“His commitment to equity, experience supporting underserved communities, and proven ability to build bridges between people and resources make him an excellent addition,” Durand said in a statement.
Georges’ nomination comes as RIPTA faces an estimated $32.6 million shortfall heading into the fiscal year beginning July 1. McKee did not offer any state funds for the cash-strapped bus agency in his recommended budget, citing a not-yet-completed study into RIPTA’s operations.
RIPTA’s efficiency study is a third of the way there

An efficiency study was required by Gov. Dan McKee and the General Assembly as a condition in last year’s state budget to plug the agency’s deficit. The report was initially due March 1.
As of May 30, Canadian-headquartered engineering consulting firm WSP is two-thirds finished with the overdue assessment, publishing a 20-page draft report on RIPTA’s transit operations. The initial report found that routes with limited connections to dense neighborhoods tend to have lower ridership due to their lower demand.
Legislators have proposed their own measures to close RIPTA’s deficit. That includes legislation that would put a $100 million transit bond on the 2026 ballot and upping the agency’s share of the gas tax.
Sen. Meghan Kallman, a Pawtucket Democrat who sits on the eight-member Senate Committee on Housing & Municipal Government, proposed adding a new tax on Uber and Lyft rides to fund mass transit.
“The board deserves to manage an agency that is properly funded,” Kallman said.

(Photo courtesy of the Thurston County Sheriff's Office)An investigation into a two-year-long string of military equipment theft from Joint Base Lewis-McChord, near Tacoma, turned up Nazi memorabilia, white supremacist literature and a cache of weapons in the suspects’ home in Lacey, according to charges filed in federal court Wednesday. 
Federal prosecutors charged Charles Fields and Levi Frakes with robbery, assault and theft of government property for allegedly stealing helmets, body armor and communications equipment from the Pierce County military base late Sunday. Both men “previously served” in the military, according to the complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Tacoma. 
Just after 8 p.m. Sunday, the duo scanned their identification documents as they entered the base in a Toyota 4Runner, according to the charges. 
About an hour later, someone on the base entered a U.S. Army Ranger operations facility to find two masked men, later identified as Fields and Frakes, court papers say. Investigators believe the men used bolt cutters to get inside. 
The men later unmasked themselves before attacking the person with a hammer, federal prosecutors allege. The alleged victim was able to get control of the hammer, but surrendered when one of the suspects pulled out a knife. During the fight, one of the intruders dropped a hat with “FIELDS” handwritten on the inside. 
The pair reportedly then fled the Ranger compound with around $14,000 in government property. The man who was attacked was hit in the head with the hammer and was bruised and bloodied, according to court documents. He was taken to Madigan Army Medical Center.
Surveillance video shows the two men leaving with rucksacks, two of which they dropped while fleeing, according to the complaint. 
Army criminal investigators obtained a search warrant for a home in Lacey that both men used as an address. Late Monday night, they found 35 weapons, including rifles, pistols and a machine gun, along with silencers, prosecutors allege. 
Agents also reported seizing military property like night vision devices, flashbangs, smoke grenades and body armor. 
“Some of the military items agents recovered are unlawful to possess without unique permission from the (Department of Defense) and some of the items are so restricted that active duty military members are not permitted to have or store them in their personal residences,” special agent Christopher Raguse wrote in the complaint.
Each bedroom featured Nazi and white supremacist memorabilia, murals and literature, according to court papers. 
A photo included in the charging papers shows side-by-side flags in one room emblazoned with a Nazi swastika and SS Bolts referring to the Schutzstaffel police unit in Nazi Germany. Since World War II, neo-Nazis have adopted the symbol, according to the Anti-Defamation League.
“The suspects identified in this case were actively involved in Nazi White Nationalist efforts,” Thurston County Sheriff Derek Sanders wrote in a Facebook post announcing the arrests.  
One of the two men agreed to speak with investigators. The complaint doesn’t identify whether this was Fields or Frakes. The suspect acknowledged stealing military property from the Ranger compound to sell or trade for about two years, according to the charges.
It’s unclear if the men had any other plans with the stolen arsenal.
Law enforcement booked both men into the Thurston County Jail on separate state criminal allegations. A judge there set bail at $500,000 each. They remained in Thurston County custody Wednesday, said a spokesperson from the U.S. Attorney’s Office in western Washington. 
It’s unclear when they will be transferred to federal custody for their first appearance on the charges filed in Tacoma on Wednesday.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_3456-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-04 19:10:10.297051

WILMINGTON — Delaware artist Jennifer Hintz Eggers brings an intimate and visually rich exploration of motherhood, nature, and spirituality to the Delaware Division of the Arts’ Mezzanine Gallery with her solo exhibition.
Named “Seeds of Life,” The show opens Friday, June 6, with a public reception from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m., and will remain on view through July 25.
The exhibition features a series of collages and oil paintings that draw from Eggers’ personal experiences of early motherhood.
Her work fuses sacred geometry, branching organic lines, and floral forms inspired by the human body—what she calls “mammary flowers”—to reflect themes of growth, interconnectedness, and resilience.
Each piece is a “meditation” which involves layering translucent oil paints over intricate grids and interlocking circles.

Alana DiMario of Narragansett and Rep. Michelle McGaw of Portsmouth are sponsoring not-quite-identical bills that would increase how much ADHD medication patients can receive at once. (Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Availability of tightly regulated ADHD medications could improve under a pair of bills that continue to move through the Rhode Island General Assembly following a Senate floor vote Tuesday night.
Bill S795 by Sen. Alana DiMario, a Narragansett Democrat, passed 36-0 and now joins the amended version of bill H5866 by Portsmouth Democratic Rep. Michelle McGaw, which passed the House 70-0 on April 22. Now each bill awaits a committee hearing in the opposite chamber. Both bills would allow for non-opioid Schedule II stimulants like Adderall, Ritalin, and Vyvanse, which are commonly used as ADHD treatments, to be prescribed and dispensed in larger amounts for doctor and patient convenience. 
Sen. Pam Lauria, a Barrington Democrat and nurse practitioner, stood to commend DiMario’s legislation on the Senate floor, calling it “an incredibly important bill, particularly as we are talking about the administrative burdens on primary care providers.”
“These are chronic medications that these people take every day, but every month, because of the very real safeguards for these medications, the extra time that it takes for primary care providers or psychiatrists… to do this work is cumbersome,” Lauria said.
The “cumbersome” refill schedule is exactly what DiMario’s legislation wants to fix. Under current federal rules, providers can write three separate 30-day prescriptions for a total 90-day supply. Some states have adopted revised rules that allow patients to pick up all 90 days’ worth at once, as Massachusetts did in 2024. 
In the Ocean State, however, patients still have to return to the pharmacy monthly and pick up the prescriptions one by one. Patients also have to contact their doctor to send in the second and third month’s prescriptions, piling onto providers’ workloads. 
Alas, there’s one important difference between the bills: DiMario’s version allows for patients to fill all 90 days at once, while McGaw’s amended version caps fills at 60 days.
DiMario said in a phone interview Wednesday that she believes the House and Senate will eventually agree on a version of the legislation as the state’s legislative session winds down in the following weeks.
“We really believe that 90 days provides the most meaningful kind of time burden relief for patients and providers,” DiMario said. “My position is that I’m strongly advocating for the 90 days, but I do believe that an agreement will be reached.”
Greg Paré, a Senate spokesperson, did not immediately have scheduling details for the bills Wednesday, and noted that the bills’ different time frames “will have to be addressed.”
McGaw agreed in a phone call Wednesday evening, saying that with the Senate’s OK of a 90-day supply, the legislation is “still sort of in limbo” until she can meet with the House committee chair and the senate’s policy team.
McGaw originally proposed a 90-day supply but reduced it to 60 days after feedback from some prescribers. She thinks a single version of the bill will eventually emerge after more conversations, acknowledging that edits to not-quite-identical legislation in both chambers is not uncommon as the legislative session nears its end.  
“I would be happy with either version, whether we decide on 60 or 90 days,” McGaw said. “In either case, it helps to reduce some of the administrative burdens for our physicians, and also helps parents or patients for whom it’s a challenge to go to the doctor every month and get a new prescription.” 
On the Senate floor, DiMario said the bill builds on successful legislation last year that authorized electronic transfers of ADHD prescriptions, pending state adoption of new federal standards. 
Both last year’s and this year’s ADHD drug bills are designed to alleviate headaches for patients and providers alike amid pill shortages ongoing since 2022, attributed to a number of factors, including a sharp increase in adult diagnoses. The Drug Enforcement Administration previously faced scrutiny for limiting production quotas of Schedule II drugs, but it increased some of those quotas in 2024.
An October 2024 edition of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report relayed that there were an estimated 15.5 million U.S. adults with an ADHD diagnosis in 2023; about half were diagnosed as adults. Roughly one-third of these adults take stimulant drugs for their condition, and shortages affected 71.5% of this population’s access to their medications.  
A 2025 article in the American Journal of Managed Care noted that stimulant prescriptions have almost doubled in the past 10 years. 
“There is only so much pharmaceutical companies can do when demand severely outweighs supply,” the authors wrote.

Phaneuf and Ginny Monk,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/04/ct-bond-package-local-aid-housing/,"The borrowing plan would finance aid for cities and towns, homelessness prevention and security at places of worship, among other areas.","The General Assembly overwhelmingly approved a $9.7 billion bond package Wednesday to finance school construction, transportation upgrades and other capital projects for the next two fiscal years.
The borrowing plan, which passed 35-1 in the Senate and 144-4 in the House, would expand non-education aid for cities and towns, increase affordable housing and combat homelessness, bolster security at places of worship and support construction and renovation of child care facilities.
It recommends new capital investments in higher education — including $5 million to advance the planned renovation of Gampel Pavilion at the University of Connecticut — and a new $60 million program to help K-12 school districts fund small-scale renovation projects.
Lawmakers negotiated the package with Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration, and the governor is expected to sign the measure.
“Today’s package continues to reduce the strains on cities and towns,” said Rep. Patricia Miller, D-Stamford, co-chairwoman of the Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee’s bonding subcommittee, who called the measure “thoughtful and strategic.”
“These are funds that are so impactful for our communities and make such a positive difference,” said Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield.
Legislators authorized $4.5 billion in borrowing next fiscal year and $5.1 billion in 2026-27. That action doesn’t guarantee financing for any program, and some authorizations won’t progress further than Wednesday’s votes. The State Bond Commission, a 10-member panel that includes Gov. Ned Lamont, other Executive Branch officials and legislators, also must grant approval before the state borrows any funds by selling bonds to Wall Street investors.
Boosting non-education aid for cities and towns
Connecticut traditionally dedicates most of its borrowing to finance municipal school construction, transportation infrastructure work and clean water projects. Almost half of the entire bond package — more than 60%, about $2.8 billion in each of the next two years — would be dedicated to these three areas.
Rather than borrowing, the state pays cash through its budget to fund most operating aid to cities and towns. Aid to schools — the single-largest expense municipalities face — captures the bulk of those funds.
But the two-year bond package seeks to boost non-education aid in several areas.
The Town Aid Road program, which pays for road repaving, other related maintenance and winter snow removal, would grow from $60 million to $80 million per year.
A second generic grant for projects and other expenses would climb from $91 million annually to $150 million.
Other financing for municipal aid included in the package includes:

$242 million over the next two years for the Community Investment Fund, which supports economic development initiatives and other projects in low-income cities and towns;


$14 million over the biennium to support economically distressed municipalities;


$10 million over two years to support school districts in large cities that appear before the state’s Municipal Finance Advisory Commission, which works to assist communities in poor fiscal condition;


And $15 million in the next fiscal year to support communities impacted by a catastrophic event.

But the head of Connecticut Conference of Municipalities said Wednesday that despite some “bright spots,” overall state aid to communities is disappointing.
“Once again, Connecticut’s cities and towns have been left behind by a state budget that fails to meet the moment,” Executive Director Joe DeLong wrote in a statement, adding that most increases in education and general government grants — whether included in the new state budget or the bond package — dedicate most additional dollars only to the poorest communities.
“That leaves most of Connecticut’s towns and cities scrambling to fill growing budget gaps with fewer resources, all while being handed new responsibilities,” DeLong said, adding that it happened while analysts projected a $2.4 billion budget surplus for this fiscal year and while the state enjoys a record-setting $4.1 billion emergency reserve.
CCM says communities lose more than $400 million annually because Connecticut’s statutory education grants — including general aid, special education and funds for charter and magnet schools — haven’t kept pace with inflation for years.
Education advocates praised a new item in the bond package authorizing $30 million in borrowing in each of the new two fiscal years to help local school districts with small-scale repairs and renovations.

The District Repair and Improvement Project, nicknamed DRIP, “is a practical-yet-transformative solution that will help school districts across the state have access to resources to ensure students and educators can learn and work in safe, healthy and up-to-date environments,” the School and State Finance Project wrote in a statement.
Fran Rabinowitz, executive director of the Connecticut Association of Public School Superintendents, said the new program would make a major difference.
“I can think of so many times you needed a new window or smaller improvements in schools and there was just no place to go for [funding] other than our own capital budget,” said Rabinowitz, a former superintendent in Bridgeport and Hamden.
A strong focus on housing, combating homelessness
Lawmakers recommended slightly more than $1 billion in financing over the coming biennium to build more housing, increase homeownership and get people who are experiencing homelessness into housing.
In recent years, the governor and legislators have called for more investments in housing as rental costs have risen, which Lamont often says hinders Connecticut’s economic growth.
The package authorizes $200 million annually for “flexible housing,” which refers to affordable units typically built in mixed-income developments. It’s often meant to increase housing for the hourly-wage workforce such as those in the service industry or bus drivers.
It also approves $50 million annually for middle housing, which is typically lighter-density multifamily units. It can mean anything from duplexes and triplexes to cottage clusters and townhouses. 
Another $60 million over the biennium would be dedicated to the Time to Own program, which offers downpayment and closing cost assistance to first-time homebuyers. The program has opened and closed a handful of times since its creation in June 2022. In October, the state’s bond commission reopened the program with $40 million.
Lamont often touts the program, which helps people of color who were historically and systemically shut out of the home buying market for decades, purchase houses and build wealth. Through the program, first-time homebuyers get an average of about $30,000 toward a down payment.

Lawmakers earmarked $6 million in annual financing for rapid rehousing, which aims to quickly move people experiencing homelessness back into housing. People facing mental health, substance abuse or employment issues often find it easier to address these challenges when housed.
That principle has been the focus of the federal housing policy for years, beginning with former President Barack Obama’s administration.
Connecticut’s investment comes as the state has seen three years of increases in homelessness after years of declines. The latest count showed that there are nearly 6,000 people experiencing homelessness across the state.
State officials have intensified housing construction efforts in recent years, ordering major investments in these areas in 2023.
The General Assembly earlier this week enacted the most expansive housing legislation in recent history. That measure prioritizes municipalities for state infrastructure grants if they change zoning to facilitate multifamily housing construction.
Protecting places of worship and other initiatives
The bond package also includes $10 million in financing in each of the next two years for grants to synagogues, mosques, churches, other places of worship and to other nonprofits to enhance security.
Connecticut launched this assistance program three years ago, and Sen. Derek Slap said, “the need has not been satisfied.”
A West Hartford Democrat, Slap said he recently has driven past several synagogues in his town, and “every single one of them, there is an armed guard outside.”
Slap added that “Nobody should be afraid to pray and nobody should be afraid to worship at a place that is holy and special to them. And that is just a basic tenet of living in a society.”
The bill also includes $50 million in fiscal year 2026 to build a new Whiting Forensic Hospital, the state’s inpatient care setting for people with acute mental health needs who have been involved in crimes. Advocates for years have said conditions in the hospital are poor.
Other items in the biennial budget package include:

$25 million in each of the next two fiscal years to assist homeowners in eastern Connecticut struggling with crumbling house foundations;


$11.5 million in each of the next two years to support construction of early childhood education and child care facilities.


$68 million next fiscal year and $5 million in 2026-27 for capital improvements in the Connecticut State Colleges and Universities system.


$36 million next fiscal year and $48 million in 2026-27 for capital improvements for the University of Connecticut. The second-year financing includes an additional $5 million in planned renovations to Gampel Pavilion and the field house on the main campus in Storrs.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025_0604_SR_SessionLastDay_088-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-04 19:10:10.297051

(Photo from Inciweb)With one fire blowing up over the weekend and an expected worse-than-average wildfire season across Montana, Gov. Greg Gianforte touted the efforts of the state Department of Natural Resources and Conservation, saying they’ve been able to keep 95% of wildfire starts to 10 acres or less since 2021. 
During an annual state fire briefing on Monday, he also recognized the “proactive preparation, coordination and teamwork” he said was needed to keep people safe. The state has seen an early start to its fire season.
Department of Natural Resources and Conservation Director Amanda Kaster said her agency is “more prepared than ever” and thanked the legislature for the passage of wildfire bills during the session.
“The state of Montana and DNRC is prepared for the 2025 fire season, not only through our fire protection program, but through the work we do to reduce wildfire risk across Montana’s landscapes,” Kaster said.
The briefing also included a long-term weather forecast from Northern Rockies Coordination Center meteorologist Dan Borsum who said computer projections are calling for a dry and hot summer. He also said some weather patterns are similar to high fire danger years in the past – like 2000, 2002, 2006, 2017 and 2021.
There’s worry about drought impacting large portions of Montana and melted-out snowpack that places higher elevations at increased risk for fire, all of which could stretch resources.
“The multi-year deficits of moisture are starting to hurt us, the overall warm and dry summer forecast, and the fact that we may have fire on the landscape when the wind season approaches in September, because we didn’t get that monsoon infusion,” Borsum said during the briefing. “That has me very concerned that this fire season could be significant.”
According to WildfireRisk.org, Montana has a higher risk of wildfires than 74% of states in the U.S. Additionally, Wildfire Risk reports more than half of all homes in Montana are at high risk of “direct exposure,” which the organization defines as homes that “may be ignited by adjacent vegetation, flying embers, or nearby structures.”
A report in Government Technology this week also put Ravalli County among the highest risk for wildfire of any county in America. It said 99% of homes in the county are at “high risk of wildfire exposure.”
Fire experts say building homes out of nonflammable materials and designing them in ways that downgrade fire risk are critical to saving property. Additionally, land management practices like controlled burns, logging thinning operations and homeowners clearing brush from structures can prevent damage and make firefighters’ jobs a little easier.
Officials with the Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Forest Service and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, among other land management agencies, spoke at the briefing. Several agencies shared difficulties in hiring firefighting staff for the season, but highlighted their fuels and forest management programs aimed at limiting fuels for wildfires.
The Forest Service said they conducted hazardous fuels reduction work on 200,000 acres of Montana forest in 2024, the BLM conducted approximately 38,000 acres of prescribed burns last year, the Forest Service while Fish and Wildlife Service said they burned around 11,000 — an outsized number given the agency’s small land presence in the state.
Some fire scientists have said prescribed burns are ineffective because of their relatively small scale.
While fire prevention was part of the discussion, so was fighting fire — something being talked about at the national level, too. In Washington, D.C. this week, U.S. Sen. Tim Sheehy, R-Montana, helped push a bipartisan wildfire bill through Congress. 
The Aerial Firefighting Enhancement Act passed through both chambers and is headed to President Donald Trump’s desk. The bill reauthorizes the sale of both airplanes and parts from the Department of Defense for aerial firefighting efforts.
Sheehy founded a company that provides aerial firefighting services. 
“Eliminating bureaucratic obstacles to fight wildfires more quickly and aggressively is America First common sense, and I appreciate my colleagues in the House and Senate for their support,” Sheehy said in a press release. “I look forward to seeing this bipartisan bill cross the finish line so we can better support the brave first responders on the front lines fighting wildfires across the country.”
Banana Lake update
As of Wednesday, the Banana Lake fire near Plains was listed at 929 acres and 15% containment.
Nick Holloway with the Western Montana All Hazards Incident Management Team and spokesperson for efforts on the fire said that four structures had been protected. He also added crews were in the process of mop-up operations, though the situation has been complex.
Crews had to deal with seven spot fires on Tuesday, which Holloway said had been a “huge concern,” though firefighters had contained those blazes.
Additionally, the edge of the fire is a mix of burned and unburned materials, a situation they call a “dirty burn.” It means there’s more potential for spotting, which is the process in which sparks and embers get carried by the wind into unburned fuel.
“There could be a spark in one of those unburned pockets, and it’s close to the edge,” Holloway said. “And so during the mop-up efforts, they’re going through that, gridding the area to look for residual sources of heat and extinguish them. But it takes a lot longer when you have that dirty burn than when you have a nice, clean edge.”
Holloway said the Banana Fire represents a relatively early start to Montana’s fire season, and cautioned that the state could be in for a long year.
“Predictive Services has told us it’s going to be dry and warm, more so than normal,” Holloway said. “So that’s going to be problematic for this fire season.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/WildlandFireTruck-1024x951.jpeg,,,2025-06-04 19:10:10.297051

The commission on Wednesday announced that it issued the complaint against Troy’s 52-4 District Court Judge Kristen Hartig, citing a refusal to provide a report of a personal psychological evaluation when the commission investigated allegations of misconduct and found that mental health was an issue.
Hartig was also alleged to have given false statements to the commission, mistreated or abused court employees and others, and had obstructed the administration of her court. The complaint goes on to accuse Hartig of the improper dismissal of criminal cases.
The commission said the next step is to give Hartig a chance to respond while the commission’s Disciplinary Counsel petitions the Michigan Supreme Court to appoint a special master, who will preside over a public hearing on the matter.
Hartig issued a statement on the situation through her spokesperson, Daniel Cherrin, who said the judge respected the role of the Michigan Judicial Tenure Commission and was committed to fully participating in the process.
“After years of inquiry, the commission has produced a complaint based on disputed claims and a flawed process. Judge Hartig has waited patiently for the opportunity to address these allegations directly and looks forward to doing so,” Cherrin said. “The public deserves confidence in both the judiciary and its oversight. That confidence depends on transparency grounded in fact, not fiction. Judge Hartig has served the public and the bench for more than a decade with integrity, transparency, and a commitment to justice. The commission is expected to do the same.”
Meanwhile, 52nd District Court Chief Judge Travis Reeds in a statement said that Harting was being removed from her entire docket while the complaint process plays out.
Reeds had already removed Harting from hearing her felony docket, relegating her in May to hearing only civil, landlord/tenant and small claims cases. The felony cases in the jurisdiction, which covers Troy and Clawson, were to be heard by Judge Maureen McGinnis.
“The Michigan Judicial Tenure Commission plays a key role in maintaining the integrity of our courts. While due process is vital, accountability helps preserve public trust in the judiciary,” Reeds said. “Based on the limited information available to me at the time, I removed Judge Hartig from the most serious cases within the authority I had as chief judge. Now that a formal complaint has been filed, further action may be appropriate. I believe temporarily removing her from her full docket would be in the best interest of the court and the communities we serve.”

And organizer Sam Bliss, wrote an op-ed stating that Food Not Cops makes downtown safer.After hours of deliberation, the City Council last week voted to direct the mayor to relocate the free lunch distribution program by July 14.Burlington resident Alex Olsen, 44, wasn’t hungry but came to meet his friends during Food Not Cops’ lunch hour in the Marketplace Garage in downtown Burlington on Wednesday, June 4. Photo by Auditi Guha/VTDiggerAs the debate continued in a City Council meeting Monday, Mulvaney-Stanak interrupted it and signed a resolution allocating $10,000 to support relocation of the effort “to a more accessible and better-resourced location.” That’s a significant increase from the $2,000 previously offered in the fiscal year 2025 budget.Signing the resolution after two weeks of divisiveness and contention on the issue “was the best path to move us forward,” she said at a press conference Tuesday.Mulvaney-Stanak said “mutual aid and food security is a critical need in our community. It has really grown in the last several years, and we as a community — I think everyone said this — value this.”The funding allocated was news to some of those who came to lunch Wednesday.Some said they use the wall of the garage off Cherry Street because there is no cleaner, safer place available, and because it allows for some privacy and protection from inclement weather. One volunteer wondered if a tent could be put up and a carpet put down for food distribution in the yard of the Ronald McDonald House across the street that provides shelter and food to families whose children are being treated at the hospital.The money could support a community partner willing to host the food distribution or support Food Not Cops with items related to the relocation, Joe Magee, the mayor’s spokesperson, wrote in an email Wednesday.“We are continuing to engage with members of the group, as well as community partners who have expressed a willingness to support efforts to find a suitable alternative location,” Magee wrote. “To my knowledge, the food distribution has not stopped, and it would be our hope to have the transition to a new location be as seamless as possible given the many folks in our community who rely on the consistency of the food distribution.”READ MORE
After multiple conversations with members of Food Not Cops in recent weeks, Mulvaney-Stanak said at Tuesday’s press conference that there are broad opinions about what should happen next.The main takeaway, she said, is that it is “incredibly important” for Burlington to have an easy-to-find, central location for a service that is “filling a real need.”“Having food is not only a basic need being met but it de-escalates a lot of the high-risk issues that people can face when they don’t have that particular need met,” she said.As city officials discuss the program’s fate, the volunteer-run effort continues to cook food nightly and distribute food daily from 1 to 2 p.m. from the red brick wall bordering the garage. They are welcoming residents who want to contribute time, supplies or money via their social media accounts on Instagram and Facebook, volunteers said.Food Not Cops volunteers cleaned up after serving lunch from 1-2 p.m. in the Marketplace Garage in downtown Burlington on Wednesday, June 4. Photo by Auditi Guha/VTDiggerVolunteers Wednesday served hot dogs, burgers, corn on the cob, apple sauce and roasted veggies, along with condiments, soda and water. They also distributed supplies like cleaning wipes, toothpaste, ibuprofen, bandages, lip balm, combs and playing cards, packed into plastic milk crates.The foil trays containing the burgers and hotdogs were emptied within 20 minutes, feeding about 30 people, volunteers estimated.But many of those served, like Alex Olsen, 44, came for the conversation and the camaraderie, rather than the food. He said he was unhoused for eight years, so he “completely respects” and loves “everything” about the Food Not Cops effort. He said he usually helps clean up after the meal.“The people here are my friends,” Olsen said. “Any time I come here, it’s open arms, no one judges me, and if I eat I eat, if I don’t, I don’t.”Olsen was one of the participants who attended the recent City Council meeting discussing the food service and spoke in favor of the program. “I feel it’s a staple in town and I don’t think there is any reason whatever for them to move,” he said Wednesday.Burlington resident and clinical social worker Gina Frattone-Johnson has been volunteering to serve food at the garage for a few years. She said she’s seen a few fights and arguments there, but nothing that couldn’t be “disengaged rather quickly.”“It’s an opportunity to engage in communal action.

She said she found him a shirt, while another volunteer found him a jacket and told him he could have a tent and sleeping bag, too, because his belongings were stolen.“There aren’t many places people can go to eat, sleep and get community resources and maybe referrals,” Frattone-Johnson said.As she helped pack up the crates and wheel the dolly to a van, Frattone-Johnson stopped to chat with a law enforcement officer parked in his black SUV nearby.A woman with a walker stopped to ask if they had any money to spare, saying her son was sick and she needed bus fare to get to Rutland. Comiskey greeted her but said she didn’t have any money and asked the woman if she’d like some cold water.“A lot of people are asking for money today,” Comiskey said later. “You can kind of gauge what’s going on here by what people are asking for.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Burlington mayor allocates $10K to support, relocate local Food Not Cops free lunch downtown.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/food-not-cops-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-04 19:10:10.297051

Beverly Gossage of Eudora, center, and Rep. Kristey Williams of Augusta, right, agreed Kansas ought to increase pressure on parents to encourage their children to repeat a grade level if confronted with fundamental academic deficiencies. Other members of the Kansas Legislature's school finance task force pushed back, saying repeating a grade carried unintended consequences for students. (Kansas Reflector screen capture of Kansas Legislature's YouTube channel)TOPEKA — Rep. Kristey Williams and Sen. Beverly Gossage landed on the same page Wednesday in terms of altering the state’s public education system to encourage students to address academic deficiencies by retaking a grade.
“Are we doing these children a favor by just moving them through the grades?” said Gossage, a Eudora Republican serving on the Kansas Legislature’s school finance task force. “We need to take a look at that at each grade level.”
Williams, an Augusta Republican on the task force, said Kansas ought to direct third-graders to summer school programs if those children weren’t academically prepared to enter fourth grade.
In Kansas, however, students couldn’t be compelled to attend summer school. The state’s public schools could mandate a student repeat a grade, Williams said.
“We’re going to have to be a little bit stronger and not just give in on the first whim, the first cry,” Williams said.
Task force member Jim Porter, who serves on the Kansas State Board of Education and couldn’t read when he left third-grade, urged the task force to be wary of unintended consequences tied to holding students back.
“I think the research indicates … that holding kids back one year increases the probability of dropping out. Holding a kid back two years almost guarantees that they will be a dropout,” Porter said.
Task force chairwoman Renee Erickson, a Wichita Republican in the Kansas Senate, said students who couldn’t read by third grade were likely to face significant scholarly and behavioral challenges during the remainder of their school years.
“Those are students, in my experience, that become behavior problems in the classroom,” Erickson said. “They’d rather be a behavior problem than look stupid in front of their peers.”
The task force scheduled a series of meetings this summer and fall with the goal of developing by January a blueprint for reforming how the Legislature allocated state tax dollars to K-12 public school districts.
The current education finance system has been found by the Kansas Supreme Court to comply with the state Constitution, but many lawmakers bristle at the cost of public schools and the ability of the state to suitably educate students.
Rep. Susan Estes, a Wichita Republican whose spouse is U.S. Rep. Ron Estes, said the objective should be a formula that guaranteed accountability for spending and improved educational opportunities for students. She said her key priorities were to enhance teacher salaries and concentrate on K-3 student learning.
“It really does come down to being able to redirect money,” she said. “We are trying to put together a 1,000-piece puzzle.”
Democrat Sen. Pat Pettey, a Kansas City, Kansas, member of the task force, said Kansas ought to expand its commitment to preparing 3- and 4-year-old children for public school. She said 90% of brain development occurred before age 5, but Kansas assisted only 47% of families with pre-K programs.
Kansas provided support to at-risk preschoolers for a half-day program despite working parents’ need for a full day of care, said task force member Melissa Rooker, executive director of the Kansas Children’s Cabinet and Trust Fund.
“I would love to see us move from basically grant funding preschool offerings in Kansas to something more stable,” she said.
Rep. Nikki McDonald, an Olathe Democrat on the task force, said lawmakers should resist the temptation to micromanage school districts under the oversight of locally elected school boards and the elected state Board of Education.
The key measure of the state’s finance formula should be whether students sufficiently broadened their ability to process information, said Rep. Scott Hill, a task force member and Abilene Republican.
He said reading ability was a leading determinant of whether people were successful people were in life.
“Change for the sake of change is worse than no change,” he said. “Sometimes I think we want to not provide for the garden, but mow the weeds.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Gossage-and-Williams-task-force.png,,,2025-06-04 19:10:10.297051

(Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)Nearly four months after Gov. Kelly Ayotte pitched a state budget to lawmakers with optimistic revenue projections and few cuts, the two-year spending proposal has seesawed dramatically.
The House, citing more dour economic predictions, pushed through $643 million in state spending cuts to Ayotte’s proposal, drawing her criticism. The Senate produced revenue projections that moved closer to Ayotte’s vision, but not all the way, further frustrating Ayotte.
On Thursday, the 24-member Senate will vote on its final proposal, setting up what will likely be a contentious stretch of negotiations with the House in the next two weeks before the budget bills, House Bill 1 and House Bill 2, must make their way to Ayotte’s desk. The Senate’s budget would spend $15.9 billion in state and federal funds over the next two years, compared to $15.5 billion in the House’s budget and $16 billion in Ayotte’s proposal.
The Senate’s budget proposal, finalized by the Senate Finance Committee on Tuesday, does not cut as deeply as the House’s proposal from April 10. But there are still reductions, and Senate Democrats are likely to oppose the final measure.
“Our job as legislators is to lower the cost of living for our constituents, improve access to health care and safe communities, strengthen kids’ and grandkids’ educational opportunities, create our thriving Main Street communities, and so unfortunately, this budget just doesn’t address those priorities,” said Sen. Rebecca Perkins Kwoka, the Senate minority leader and a Portsmouth Democrat, ahead of the Finance Committee vote Tuesday. 
Senate President Sharon Carson praised the final budget, stressing that it came amid a difficult economic reality for the state. 
“What I think a lot of people forget was, over the last two bienniums, we had a lot of money, and most of it was an infusion of cash from the federal government,” she said at the same committee meeting. “We spent that money, and we were very smart about how we spent that money, but it was gone.”
“… I look at this budget as a readjustment from having all that federal money to now we’re focused on what we have: How much money do we have? I think it keeps us on a path to prosperity.” 
Here’s what’s in the final package to be voted on by the full Senate Thursday. 
Senate partially restores funding to House cuts, makes reductions in other areas
In general, the Senate budget overturns many of the more drastic cuts made by the House in April, according to an analysis Wednesday by the New Hampshire Fiscal Policy Institute. 
The Senate budget would restore a number of agencies and boards that were eliminated by the House — including the Office of the Child Advocate, the Housing Appeals Board, the Commission for Human Rights, and the State Commission on Aging — albeit with some modifications and staffing cuts for each entity. 
The Senate’s plan would also roll back the House’s deep cuts to the Department of Corrections. While the House had proposed 190 cuts to positions, the Senate winnowed that down to 60, with many of the proposed positions currently unfilled. 
The Senate’s proposal would increase the amount allotted to the settlement fund for the Youth Development Center lawsuits. The state is currently facing multiple lawsuits from people who allege they were abused by staff members at that center. The Senate budget would include $20 million in the first year and would plan for the state to raise $80 million by selling the Sununu Youth Services Center building in Manchester, all of which would be set aside to pay out any settlements.
But the Senate’s budget would make some deeper cuts compared to the House budget, such as a reduction in special education funding to public schools. The Senate budget would also impose $32 million in “back of the budget” cuts — undefined funding reductions that would require the Ayotte administration to find positions or programs to meet the cuts. 
Cuts to Medicaid providers reversed, but Medicaid premiums remain
In one of the biggest changes, the Senate reversed course on a controversial piece of the House’s budget: the 3% across-the-board rate cuts to Medicaid providers. The Senate bill includes $52.5 million in funding that the House had taken out and restores the funding.
The Senate budget also restores funding to developmental services and community mental health programs the House had cut. 
The Senate bill does keep in place Ayotte’s proposal to include premiums for beneficiaries of the Medicaid expansion program – known as the Granite Advantage Health Care Program. But where Ayotte proposed premiums determined by a percentage of recipients’ income, the Senate bill would make those premiums set amounts: $60 per month for a household of one increasing up to $100 for a household of four.
Democrats have objected to those premiums, calling them an “income tax.” And they have opposed the repeal of the Prescription Drug Affordability Board in the Senate’s budget. 
Housing advocates disappointed with funding levels
Affordable housing advocates and Democrats have raised objections to the lack of funding for affordable housing efforts in the final budget. 
In a press release Wednesday, Housing Action New Hampshire said the Senate’s budget “falls short in addressing our state’s housing shortage,” and noted that it did not include a proposal to double funding to the state’s Affordable Housing Fund and the Community Development Finance Authority Tax Credit. Democrats had proposed doubling both efforts from $5 million to $10 million a year. The Senate budget also adds no new funding to the Housing Champion Program, designed to give grants to towns that update their zoning codes to encourage development, though the Senate bills would extend the expiration date of the existing Housing Champion Program funds.
Senate Republicans argued deregulation, not funding, is most important to housing construction in the state. “I think we’re at a place where we recognize that the role of the state is to facilitate housing construction, maybe not to pay for it,” said Sen. Dan Innis, a Bradford Republican. 
And Sen. Tim Lang, a Sanbornton Republican, pointed to the $11.55 million allocation from the Drinking Water and Groundwater Trust Fund toward local water infrastructure projections as an example of the state supporting housing development needs of communities.
 Renewable energy fund near depleted

The House’s budget had fully depleted the state’s Renewable Energy Fund, which is designed to provide grants to support clean energy projects in the state. The Senate’s budget would keep $2 million in the fund. Democrats raised concerns that that isn’t enough to make a meaningful difference. 
Higher education cuts reversed
The Senate’s budget rolls back a $50 million cut to the University System of New Hampshire included in the House budget. The final Senate budget would allocate $85 million per fiscal year to the university system, which is $67.5 million higher than the House’s numbers over two years, according to NHFPI. 
But Innis, a professor of marketing and hospitality management at the University of New Hampshire, said he wished that funding was higher, even as he praised the budget overall.
“We’re funding higher education in New Hampshire at half the rate we were 20 years ago. That’s embarrassing,” he said Tuesday. “It just is.”
Anti-diversity, equity, and inclusion language moves ahead
The Senate has preserved language added by the House that seeks to prevent any efforts at the state or local governmental levels to pursue “diversity, equity, and inclusion” policies.
The language reads: “No public entity shall implement, promote, or otherwise engage in any DEI-related initiatives, programs, training, or policies. No state funds shall be expended for DEI-related activities, including but not limited to implicit bias training, DEI assessments, critical race theory, or race-based hiring, promotion, or contracting preferences.”
The move aligns with efforts by the Trump administration to withhold federal funding to public school districts that maintain such programs. 
Perkins Kwoka denounced the language, and predicted it would invite a lawsuit should it be passed in the budget. Last year, a federal court struck down a 2021 state law that prohibited advocacy on certain topics related to race and gender, after teachers unions sued arguing it was unconstitutionally vague; the state has appealed that ruling to the First Circuit Court of Appeals.
“It certainly harms our business environment to sort of be behind the curve on embracing an America that is truly inclusive,” Perkins Kwoka said.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_3911-Full-Senate-1024x736.jpg,,,2025-06-04 19:10:10.297051

Kevin Stitt said Wednesday he had apologized to a state senator after making disparaging remarks about him and his wife last week. 
Stitt also defended his choice for interim commissioner of the state mental health department, despite his lack of experience in mental health. 
Stitt drew the ire of lawmakers Thursday as they worked late into the night and into the early hours of Friday morning to overturn over 40 of his vetoes. 
He posted a video Thursday afternoon calling on voters to closely watch how lawmakers vote on veto overrides and said the bills he had vetoed were bad for Oklahoma. 
Later in the evening as lawmakers prepared a measure to fire mental health Commissioner Allie Friesen, the governor, who had appointed and ardently supported Friesen throughout the agency’s financial disarray, put out a statement that drew a senator’s wife into the mix.

Sen. Paul Rosino, R-Oklahoma City, and Rep. Josh West, R-Grove, were the authors of the measure to fire Friesen. It said the Legislature had “lost confidence” in her ability to lead the state agency. 
Stitt called Friesen’s firing a “politically motivated witch hunt” and questioned if Rosino and West had something to gain by firing her. 
“Josh West and Paul Rosino need to first answer what they stand to gain from Allie Friesen being removed,” he said in his Thursday statement. “What are they trying to keep covered up? What conflicts of interest are they trying to hide? Is Senator Rosino trying to help his wife avoid responsibility for her role in the finance department there? Oklahomans deserve answers.”
Rosino, who chairs the Senate Health and Human Services Committee and co-chairs a select committee investigating the Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services’ finances, said Thursday his wife works as a “low level, part-time” employee at the agency. 
Stitt’s statement, compounded with his video calling on Oklahomans to vote out lawmakers who voted to overturn his vetoes, led to dozens of lawmakers publicly calling Stitt out Thursday night.

House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, said Friday morning the video Stitt had posted frustrated lawmakers and disrupted “good faith” negotiations between the Legislature and the Governor’s Office.
He also said it was “beneath the dignity of his office” to attack a senator’s wife. 
Senate President Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton, R-Tuttle, said Friday he was disappointed by the governor’s comments. 
“You know, we all say things sometimes that we wish we could take back. But this wasn’t something that was said out of context,” Paxton said Friday. “It was something written down and approved that was put out. And in my nine years here, I’ve seen lots of things where there’s lots of criticism of members. I’ve never seen something like that on a member’s spouse.”
When discussing the measure to fire Friesen in the Senate, senators were unified in speaking against Stitt’s comments – all but one of the senators who rose to debate the measure spoke against the statement. The Senate voted 43-1 to fire Friesen and the House voted 81-5. 
But Wednesday afternoon, Stitt apologized and said “it was my fault” for letting emotions run high. 
“I do regret that. I called and apologized to him and his wife,” Stitt said. “I let the emotions get the better of me and I should not have done that. … I’m just trying to point out any kind of conflict. We have to make sure that, you know, if you’re in the pharmaceutical business, you shouldn’t be running pharmaceutical bills. If you’re in this industry, you shouldn’t be running this bill.”
Rosino could not be reached for comment, but a Senate spokesperson confirmed he and his wife had accepted Stitt’s apology. 
The Republican governor also defended Rear Admiral Gregory Slavonic as his choice to temporarily fill Friesen’s position as head of the mental health department. 
Slavonic has a long history working in government and previously ran the Oklahoma Department of Veteran Affairs, but has no experience in mental health. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX“He’s not a mental health expert, he’s more of a business person,” Stitt said Wednesday. “He’s somebody that I think can do the job.”
The agency needed supplemental funding from the Legislature for this budget year and has been embroiled in investigations and audits following reports of financial disarray, including being unable to make payroll. 
Stitt took a victory lap as he celebrated successes from the legislative session. 
He said Oklahoma is now on the path to eliminating the income tax after the Legislature passed a .25% income tax cut, with further cuts when revenue reaches specified levels. 
Stitt also applauded legislation he said eliminated various fines, fees and court costs for people recently released from incarceration, a priority he mentioned during his State of the State address at the beginning of session. 
Expanding apprenticeship and internship programs in Oklahoma was another victory Stitt brought up Wednesday. 
“This was an amazing session,” he said. “I thought it was one of my best sessions we’ve ever had in seven years.”

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Despite an ongoing trade war and low profitability the past two years, pork industry leaders and producers at the World Pork Expo in Des Moines said Wednesday they are optimistic about the year. 
Lee Schulz, chief economist for Ever.Ag, said 2025 could be the “quickest turnaround in pork producer profitability ever” — but, he clarified, that statistic says more about “how bad the situation was” the past two years than it does about 2025. 
High input costs and decreased demand in 2023 caused what Schulz said was “the worst year in pork producer profitability to date.” That was followed by 2024, which Schulz called a “break-even year” which, while better than 2023, didn’t alleviate producers’ financial stress. 
Schulz’s modeling for 2025 profitability, based on USDA statistics, predict $15 per head profitability increases for producers and a return to break even, when accounting for 2020 and 2023 losses, by August. 
Schulz said despite continued challenges facing the industry such as increased input costs, labor, and processing and slaughtering costs, pork producers are more efficient each year. 
He said trends of increasing litter rates and carcass weight in the industry mean that even with a historically low-breeding herd in December, pork producers “are going to produce the most pork per breeding animal ever.” 
“The efficiency, the productivity of this industry, is tremendous, and that trend is continuing to increase over time — even through challenges like we’ve seen in 2020, and 2023,” Schulz said. 
Shulz also said the new sausage production facility slated to be built in Perry by JBS “speaks to the health of the industry.”
Not afraid of the tariffs
According to National Pork Producers Council,  the export market makes up more then 25% of U.S. pork production, and 55% of exported U.S. produced pork variety meats exports go to China.
In April, China posted reciprocal tariffs on U.S. goods, which equated to a total tariff of 172% on U.S. pork entering the country. The two countries agreed to a 90-day reduction on the tariffs May 12, which resulted in a 57% tariff on U.S. pork imported to China, according to National Hog Farmer.
Joseph Kerns, a long term agricultural operations consultant now with AgRubicon, said pork producers should “be selfish” and take advantage of the current market volatility caused by tariffs and other factors. 
Small business owners urge Iowa’s congressional leaders to end the ‘chaotic’ tariffs

“You can either hyperventilate or you can do something,” Kerns said.
He advises producers to remove themselves from the risk profile by using futures and options contracts to lock in a price while it’s high. 
“It’s a marketing tool that every producer has at their avail and it is way cheaper than what it should be, in my opinion, and that’s to our advantage,” Kerns said. 
The World Pork Expo brought more than 10,000 pork-industry producers and professionals from around the world to the Iowa State Fairgrounds. 
Representatives from the Chinese livestock equipment company Kunlong International said around 40% of their clients are based in the U.S. and they usually add more to the profile at the expo. 
Lily Li of Kunlong International said the tariffs, as of yet, have not caused any changes in the company’s relationship with American customers. Li said the company hopes to “keep stable” from last year and maybe expand “a little” to other countries. 
Doug Gruver, an Iowa pork producer from the Sully area, said he did not feel any added pressure at the expo because of the tariffs, but said he felt more optimistic about the upcoming year than he has the past couple of years. 
“With the future prices the way they are, yes,” Gruver said. “But we’ll see what Q4 brings.” 
Kerns said the past couple of years the expo has seen evidence of hard times, adding that producers had seemed “depressed” with the situation. 
“This year, we’re going to make money, and you’re going to see more optimism,” he said of the 2025 expo.

(Tom Ross/Quentin Burdick Job Corps Center)Less than a week after receiving word that Job Corps centers across the country will pause operations by the end of June, students, faculty and administrative staff in Minot have already begun packing up for the inevitable move off campus.
On May 29, the U.S. Department of Labor announced the Quentin Burdick Job Corps Center in Minot, along with nearly 100 other contractor-operated Job Corps centers nationwide, will pause operations by June 30 because of operational deficits, low graduation rates and a high number of incident reports involving students.
“I was just saying goodbye to a gentleman today who was offered a job as a welder and before he came to Job Corps, probably 15-16 months ago, he had no idea what welding was,” Tom Ross, workforce development officer for the Burdick Job Corps Center, said Wednesday.
The Job Corps program has about 25,000 enrolled students nationwide between ages 16-24, many from low-income families. Ross said the Burdick Job Corps Center graduates 25 to 40 students every year and employs outreach staff who serve Fargo, Bismarck and Grand Forks.
Students take courses to get their GEDs and learn skills and certifications in the electrical, plumbing and construction trades, among others.
Ross said two other students recently went through the welding program and are living in Mississippi, welding ships for the U.S. Navy.
“For all of the bad news that’s out there, I can match it with a good news story of students who are just rocking it,” he said. “What I have seen every day since I’ve been here is a group of professionals that are focused on the success of students.”
It does not make sense to beat the “we need workforce” drum over and over again, and then close one of the leading workforce development sites in North Dakota, Ross said.
“To me, those two pieces of the puzzle will never fit together,” he said. 
Senators object to Trump push to ax Education Department programs for low-income students

In a statement from Sen. John Hoeven’s office, the Republican said he has always supported the mission of the Job Corps program and the Burdick Job Corps Center, but recent statistics have shown performance levels are not where Americans expect them to be. He added more data is needed to determine what reforms and changes are necessary.
North Dakota Republican Sen. Kevin Cramer also raised concerns about the program costs.
“While I’m a big fan of Job Corps centers, the average cost per student each year is over $80,000 while only graduating 38%,” Cramer said in a text message. “We can’t ignore the broader fiscal reality and the need to set priorities. We have a $37 trillion debt and it’s headed for $50 trillion.”
The Job Corps program operated at a $140 million deficit in 2024 and the deficit was expected to increase to $213 million in 2025, according to Labor Department data. 
“Job Corps was created to help young adults build a pathway to a better life through education, training, and community,” said U.S. Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer, in a statement. “However, a startling number of serious incident reports and our in-depth fiscal analysis reveal the program is no longer achieving the intended outcomes that students deserve.”
Examples of incidents are drug use, violence, or an accident requiring a trip to the hospital.

Chavez-DeRemer said the department will be evaluating the long-term possibilities of the program and is committed to assisting students as they transition back into their communities.
The National Job Corps Association, a professional trade association comprised of business, labor, volunteer, advocacy, academic and community organizations, filed a lawsuit Tuesday seeking a temporary restraining order against the Department of Labor in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York to prevent the nationwide closures.
“Closing Job Corps campuses would not only jeopardize the lives and futures of tens of thousands of students currently in training, but it would also eliminate a workforce pipeline that many industries depend on, needlessly weakening our labor market and economy,” said Marty Walsh, former labor secretary under President Joe Biden, in a statement from the association.
Addie Nelson worked as an administrative assistant at the Burdick Job Corps Center for nearly 30 years. She said the program has always helped students find their futures and she worries there won’t be another place like the Job Corps program to help them along their career paths.
“It’s so rewarding to see them succeed when they didn’t think they were anybody,” Nelson said. “When they come and they think they are not worth anything and they start achieving these small little goals that they’ve set themselves. … They see results and I think that’s what hurts me the most is that I’ve seen so many kids come and see what a world of difference Burdick (Job Corps Center) did for them. It just gave them hope.”
She added that she had planned to retire in August to enjoy some early-morning cups of coffee on her front porch, but the pausing of the program sped up her timetable.
Ross said there are about 20 Job Corps centers across the country run by the Department of Labor that are not closing.
He said he’s hopeful the pause announced by the department will only be a pause and the skills-training program will restart in some form in the future.
“The Job Corps program is not a perfect program, but … show me a federal program that is perfect,” he said.

The […]","Residents at Clearence and Labadie Avenues assess the damage to their home after the May 16 tornado rolled through the Ville neighborhood of north St. Louis. (Wiley Price/ St. Louis American)When a tornado struck Joplin on May 22, 2011, killing 161 people and causing about $2 billion in damage, President Barack Obama issued a major disaster declaration the next day.
That action immediately made help available through the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, for people to pay for temporary housing and begin repairs. The declaration also made state and local governments, as well as some not-for-profit aid agencies, eligible for reimbursement of 75% of the cost of recovery and rebuilding.
By the time the books were closed, FEMA had distributed $37.1 million to individuals for recovery needs and provided $161.6 million for public recovery and rebuilding costs.
In St. Louis, a May 16 tornado cut a 22-mile path across the region, damaging or destroying 16,000 structures and killing five people. Damage is estimated at $1.6 billion, making it the biggest weather disaster for Missouri since the Joplin tornado.
Gov. Mike Kehoe made a formal request on May 26 for President Donald Trump to extend similar help. Nine days later, that request is still pending as Trump waits for the results of a formal assessment of damages.
It is part of a pattern in Trump’s second term of longer waits and, oftentimes, denials of state requests for disaster declarations. 
Kehoe on April 2 requested a declaration for help following severe storms and flooding in southeast Missouri. Trump issued the declaration May 21, 49 days later. A May 1 request, for storms and flooding from March 30 to April 8, was also approved May 21.
Another disaster declaration request from Missouri, submitted May 19, is also awaiting action by the president.
Both of the approved requests took longer than all but six of the 20 federal disaster requests submitted by Missouri governors from the start of 2010 through the end of 2024. The average wait during that period, from a governor’s request to a presidential declaration, was 16 days.
St. Louis area state lawmakers, called to Jefferson City for a special session, said the delay is adding to the hardship thousands face, with some people camping outside destroyed homes because they have no money for shelter.
“Some people are staying in homes that are completely unsafe to stay in after the storm has wiped out their entire neighborhood,” state Sen. Brian Williams, a Democrat from University City, said in an interview with The Independent. “It’s saddening, it’s disheartening, and I’m not interested in any conversation outside of ensuring that storm victims are taken care of.”
A federal disaster declaration can make help available for individuals and public needs, or it can be limited to assisting with public recovery costs. 
Nationally, over the last four years, FEMA has provided more than $12 billion to individuals and $133 billion to state and local governments, tribal nations, territories and some nonprofits to help in recovery efforts, Stateline reported in February.
When individual assistance is provided, victims can receive up to $770 for immediate emergency needs, plus up to $43,600 to assist with home repair costs and $43,600 for other recovery costs.
A federal disaster declaration also provides emergency SNAP and unemployment benefits.
The main purpose of the special session is to consider legislation offering tax incentives for the Kansas City Chiefs and Royals to remain in Missouri. 
The bill providing stadium aid also includes a tax credit of up to $5,000 for payments against an insurance deductible in a disaster area. A spending bill requested by Kehoe includes $25 million, to be spent by the Missouri Housing Development Commission to assist in repairs.
But with 37 Missouri counties covered by disaster requests submitted this year, lawmakers from both St. Louis and rural areas say the money is inadequate.
State Sen. Jason Bean, a Republican from Holcomb, said the $25 million is “a drop in the bucket” for disaster needs. Bean represents 10 southeast Missouri counties that include the three with the highest poverty rates in the state.
Eight of the 10 counties in Bean’s district were included in Trump’s disaster declaration for storms and flooding on March 14 and 15. All 10 were included in the disaster declaration for the March 31 to April 8 storms and flooding.
The delay in receiving help is frustrating, Bean said during a hearing on the spending bill.
“We need to realize that people have been living in shelters,” Bean said. “They’ve been living in other homes for some time. So once again, the speed of our response, I think, is something we’ve just got to address.”
Massive, obvious disasters like Joplin no longer get quick responses from FEMA. Since taking office, Trump has tried to push more costs to state and local agencies, even suggesting that FEMA be abolished. 
Now, every disaster must go through the formal assessment process to determine if it meets the standards for federal assistance. 
FEMA uses cost per capita to gauge whether local and state governments can handle recovery themselves, or if they’ll need federal help. Those thresholds currently stand at $4.72 per capita for counties and $1.89 per capita for states.
But just meeting those thresholds isn’t enough. Trump can accept or deny applications at his discretion.
“After a thorough assessment, FEMA will approve a disaster declaration request if the assessment shows the event’s damage exceeds the state, local governments, and voluntary organizations’ capacity to respond,” a FEMA spokesperson wrote in an email to The Independent. “Just like all declaration requests, this decision is based on policy, not politics.”
During testimony on the special session legislation, Casey Milburg, policy director for St. Louis Mayor Cara Spencer, said Kehoe and the state’s congressional delegation have all been pushing for action on the disaster request.
“There’s certainly a tremendous amount of uncertainty in our minds,” she said. “We are certainly hopeful.”
The congressional delegation push began the day after Kehoe requested aid for tornado response.
“Missourians are still recovering from the recent tornado, and our communities are in desperate need of federal assistance,” U.S. Rep. Ann Wagner, a Republican from St. Louis County, said in a news release May 27, the day after Kehoe made his request.
Wagner, five of Missouri’s eight U.S. House members and both U.S. Senators signed a letter to Trump on May 27 urging swift action.
“These resources are essential to stabilizing affected communities and safeguarding public health and safety,” the letter stated. “Given the scale of devastation and the urgent need for federal assistance, we respectfully request swift approval of Missouri’s disaster declaration. We appreciate your attention to this matter and stand ready to support efforts to ensure resources reach those who need them most.” 
During a hearing on the special session legislation, state Sen. Barbara Washington, a Democrat from Kansas City, asked budget director Dan Haug whether FEMA would approve the request to help St. Louis.
“Have we received notice that FEMA is going to help?” she said. “Because there are other states that have been denied assistance from FEMA, and so have we received any guarantee that we’re actually going to receive funding from FEMA to help?”
Haug said no assurances have been received.
“I think the governor’s office, in communication with our federal officials, feel confident in the result,” Haug said.
Williams, however, said the state shouldn’t count on it.
“I am not optimistic,” he said, “that FEMA is going to step in and do anything.”

(Photo via U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement)The Judiciary Committee pushed off deciding on whether to ban local law enforcement agreements with federal immigration authorities until next year. But the majority of its members voted against a conflicting proposal that would make it illegal to restrict compliance with immigration enforcement.
These decisions were made on Wednesday as members ran back and forth between the committee room and their respective chambers amid a busy session day. 
The committee decided to carry over into next year LD 1259, which would explicitly prohibit state and local law enforcement agencies from entering into contracts with federal immigration enforcement authorities. 
On the other hand, a motion to pass LD 1656, which would prevent local agencies from adopting any policies that restrict them from assisting in the enforcement of federal immigration law, failed 4-8, with two members absent. This bill is sponsored by Rep. Michael Soboleski of Phillips and co-sponsored by nine other Republicans.
However, the committee has yet to decide on LD 1971, which would place restrictions on enforcement activities absent formal agreements with federal authorities. 
The committee did discuss an amendment to clarify what would and would not be permitted under the bill as a means to address pushback from police groups. Auburn Police Chief Jason Moen, who is president of the Maine Chiefs of Police Association, raised concerns about the bill hindering federal task forces that are not primarily for immigration enforcement but sometimes touch on some immigration issues, such as drug enforcement partnerships. 
Moen said the proposed changes assuage those concerns “to some extent.” Another work session on LD 1971 is scheduled for Monday.
Immigration enforcement hearing highlights lack of protocol for local, federal collaboration

Rep. Ambureen Rana (D-Bangor), who sponsored LD 1259, requested that the bill be carried over to next year, telling her colleagues Wednesday that she believes it is necessary but would benefit from more time to allow for greater community engagement and to study its implications before lawmakers vote. 
Participation in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s 287(g) program has grown across the country after President Donald Trump revived it to bolster ICE’s capacity by deputizing local police officers to detain immigrants, an authority otherwise generally reserved to federal authorities. The program was discontinued in 2012 due to the discovery of discriminatory practices such as racial profiling.
Wells Police Department is the only Maine agency that has opted to join. However, Wells paused its agreement to see if the Legislature votes to ban such contracts. 
“Some law enforcement officials expressed concerns about the bill’s unintended impacts, which I take seriously,” Rana told Maine Morning Star after the vote. 
Noting that six states have laws or policies that prohibit participation, Rana said, “Additional time in our legislative process allows us to study the impacts in those states while individual communities continue to advocate for municipalities that stand for the safety of all residents.” 
Wells residents have been voicing both support and opposition to their local police force contracting with ICE at Select Board meetings. Those calling for the police force to terminate the contract have collected more than 350 signatures. 
Monmouth Winthrop Police Department, a combination of departments that serve central Maine communities, also initially submitted an application to join the program but withdrew it after community pushback, with their Police Chief Paul Ferland citing the division it caused in the community as the main reason. 
“Carrying the bill over keeps it alive while we continue to build support across the state,” Rana said.

The patient came to the state to visit family on May 26 and 27, the Utah Department of Health and Human Services said in a news release issued Wednesday. During the visit, the individual visited other unvaccinated people, was out in the community and may have infected others. 
“While the risk to the general population continues to be low, we want to make the public aware of the increased risk of measles in this region and the increasing number of cases in surrounding states,” the department said.

The potential exposure comes amid measles outbreaks in states across the U.S.
This year the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has confirmed 1,088 measles cases nationwide in 33 states. About 96% of them were unvaccinated or had an unknown vaccination status. There were 11 cases in Colorado and 81 in New Mexico, according to an NBC News tracker. As of Wednesday, there aren’t any confirmed cases in Utah.
Measles outbreak hasn’t hit Utah yet, but health officials are bracing for when it does

About 88.8% of Utah kindergarteners were reported to be vaccinated against measles, mumps and rubella in the 2023-2024 school year, lagging behind the national average of 92.7%. 
While there was a small bump in the state’s immunization registry for a couple of weeks, there’s still been a drop in the percentage of Utah children that received at least one dose of the MMR vaccine at 24 months old — from 94.5% of those born in 2019 to 89.8% of children born in 2021, according to state data.
That’s on pace with regional MMR vaccination rate trends, including in Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming, Rich Lakin, immunization program manager at the Utah Department of Health and Human Services, told Utah News Dispatch last week. The percentage in those states have decreased from 98.3% for children born in 2019 to 86.4% for those born in 2021. 
The country has seen a pattern of declining immunization rates as skepticism around science and public health was exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic.
After the death of two children in Texas, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — who has expressed skepticism regarding vaccine safety and efficacy — endorsed the MMR vaccine, saying it is the most effective way to prevent the spread of the disease. However, he has also promoted unproven remedies for preventing and treating measles, sowing confusion.
Experts and research widely accept that the vaccine is safe and saves lives.



Let us know what you think...


 


While it has been difficult to encourage people to vaccinate their children, Lankin said health officials will continue to try to ensure Utahns get accurate information. 
“That’s what our continued message is — that vaccinations have been one of the greatest public health achievements we have seen, and we want to continue to keep people safe through vaccinations,” Lakin said last week.
The state still has limited details on who was exposed, but it is working on providing information and protection to those it can identify, according to the Wednesday release. 
In the meantime, the department advised anyone with measles-like symptoms to remain at home and away from others for at least four days after the start of the rash to avoid further spread. 
Those with symptoms — which include high fever, cough, runny nose and red, watery eyes, in addition to the characteristic rash — should contact medical facilities before visiting to confirm whether they can protect other patients from infections.

(Courtesy of Maine Paid Family Leave campaign)Following the Senate earlier this week, the House on Wednesday passed LD 894, which proposes a series of amendments to the state’s paid family and medical leave program to create certain enforcement mechanisms and penalties, as well as clarify intermittent leave. 
But the vote was not without significant debate. 
Senate President Mattie Daughtry (D-Cumberland) introduced the bill on behalf of the Labor Department to make specific refinements to the policy that were noticed during the rulemaking process. 
However, during the House floor debate, Rep. Michael Soboleski (R-Phillips) called it “legislation that threatens the very foundation of Maine’s economic landscape.”
But underscoring the human rather than economic impacts, Rep. Valli Geiger (D-Rockland) said, “We are not just a series of businesses. We are not just a series of workers.”
She went on to say that “we thrive when there is a blend of work and life, and all of us age, all of us fall into illness, many of us have children, and when we do, it is part of our culture and a decent society to give us time to recover, to allow us to take care of our elderly, our frail, our beloved ones.” 
Though it isn’t expected to be available until May 2026, the paid family and medical leave program will allow eligible public and private sector workers to take up to 12 weeks of paid leave for reasons such as illness, to care for a loved one or the birth of a new child. 
Others supportive of the overall program argued that LD 894 does not do enough to ensure it will be effective. “While LD 894 focuses on infrastructure, it leaves behind the operational reforms that matter most to the people on the ground,” said Rep. Tiffany Roberts (D-South Berwick). 
Rep. Nathan Carlow (R-Buxton) attempted two floor amendments to the bill, which both failed. 
One amendment sought to require an employee to be employed with an employer for a minimum of 120 days before being eligible for paid leave. Rep. Amy Roeder (D-Bangor) said the Department of Labor is opposed to any change that would delay the implementation of the program. Rep. Charles Skold (D-Portland) argued the amendment would prevent people from taking leave when they need it. A motion to indefinitely postpone the amendment narrowly prevailed, 72-70.  
Carlow then presented another floor amendment that would allow workers and businesses who have contributed to the state fund but choose to adopt a qualifying private plan before the start of 2026 to be eligible for a refund from the Department of Labor. A motion to indefinitely postpone also narrowly prevailed 71-70.  
The Senate had its own, albeit smaller, debate on paid family and medical leave Wednesday. Despite urging from Sen. Dick Bradstreet (R-Kennebec) to back LD 1712, which hopes to strike a better balance between employee and employer interests by modifying how much an employer is required to contribute, when an employee needs to apply for the benefit and how much is paid out. 
He described it as “a reasonable compromise and a responsible compromise,” the upper chamber voted against it 20-14. The House rejected the bill earlier this week, so it is now effectively killed.
That bill joined a series of other proposals to modify or repeal the program that were also rejected earlier this week, including LD 406, LD 1273, LD 1333, LD 952 and LD 1307.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Under settlement agreements reached earlier this year and announced by New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez on Wednesday, two insulin manufacturers have committed to make the diabetes treatment cheaper for New Mexicans.
“These are huge wins for New Mexicans who have struggled with the outrageous cost of insulin,” Torrez said in a statement. “These agreements will help people stop rationing medication, avoid financial hardship, and focus on staying healthy. We are holding drug manufacturers accountable and making access to life-saving treatment more equitable.” 
New Mexico Department of Justice spokesperson Lauren Rodriguez told Source NM that the agreements provide insured patients who might have a high deductible or copay the option to pay cash instead of using their insurance, and to pay no more than $35 for a monthly supply of insulin, Rodriguez said.
The New Mexico state law enacted in 2020 that caps insulin costs at $25 remains in full force and is not preempted or replaced by the new settlements, Rodriguez said.
Instead, the agreements are “additive protections mainly aimed at helping cash-paying and uninsured patients, while deferring to state law when it offers better pricing,” she said.
As many as 207,600 adults in New Mexico, or approximately 11% of the state’s adult population, have diabetes, according to the American Diabetes Association.
Without the caps, patients in other states could pay $150 per month or more, especially if they require multiple variations of the drug, Stateline reports.
More states are doing what they can to cap insulin costs

High out-of-pocket costs have historically forced many patients to choose between buying insulin and meeting other basic needs, NMDOJ said in a news release. The settlements result from the agency’s independent investigations into insulin pricing practices, NMDOJ said.
The state’s agreement with Sanofi-Aventis U.S. LLC, signed on April 18, requires the company to maintain its Insulins ValYou Savings Program, which allows patients who pay out-of-pocket to receive a month’s supply for $35.
The Sanofi settlement also requires it to maintain its Patient Connection Program, which allows uninsured patients who aren’t eligible for Medicaid and whose annual household income is at or below 400% of the federal poverty line to receive insulin for free.
Under the settlement, Sanofi must also provide patients live phone and translation support in Spanish, Hmong, Somali and Mandarin Chinese; and participating pharmacies will receive training to help patients enroll in affordability programs.
The settlement with Novo Nordisk Inc., signed on May 19, requires the company to maintain its MyInsulinRX Program, which offers diabetes patients the option to pay $35 or less for a monthly prescription. Under the agreement, Novo Nordisk must also continue its Patient Assistance Program, which offers insulin for free.
The settlement also requires Novo Nordisk to notify pharmacies about available discounts at the point of sale, help patients enroll on the spot and offer live phone and website chat support in Spanish.

Sarah Huckabee Sanders discusses an outdoor education pilot program during a press conference on June 4, 2025 in Little Rock. (Screenshot from livestream)The governor announced on Wednesday the creation of a new outdoor education pilot program that will accept up to 30 Arkansas school districts that apply to participate.
A partnership between the Arkansas Department of Education and the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission, the program will help equip students for a career in outdoor recreation, according to a press release from the governor’s office. 
During Wednesday’s announcement at AGFC’s Witt Stephens Jr. Central Arkansas Nature Center in Little Rock, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said if the pilot is successful, the program could be expanded to schools across the state and provide a model for the entire country. Getting kids outdoors will help improve their education, health and quality of life, Sanders said.
“Starting today, districts across our state can apply to be one of 30 schools to offer outdoor education built around the standards taught in core and elective content areas, experiences in outdoor learning engagement and projects that empower students to think critically and solve problems about the world around them,” she said. 
Doug Schoenrock, who was named AGFC’s 20th director in April, said the “truly unique” pilot program will bring the outdoors into the classroom and vice versa.
“And most importantly, this program will bring outdoors to the hearts and minds of our students, and build a connection with the Natural State, which we as Arkansans hold so dear,” Schoenrock said. 
The new initiative combines several of the governor’s priorities, including education, workforce development and outdoor recreation. The pilot program responds to a recommendation made by the Natural State Initiative Advisory Council in its 2023 report to expand outdoor recreation programs to schools. 
Sanders launched the Natural State Initiative in an effort to expand Arkansas’ outdoor economy, and its advisory council is chaired by her husband, Bryan. 
Tourism is the state’s second largest industry behind agriculture. In the most recent year for which data is available, Arkansas welcomed more than 50 million visitors who spent nearly $10 billion, much of which went to outdoor recreation, according to the press release. 
Applications for the outdoor education pilot program are available on AGFC’s website.

,DC,2025-06-04 22:07:28+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"U.S. House Democrats grill Education Secretary McMahon on proposed cuts, anti-diversity measures",Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-democrats-grill-education-secretary-mcmahon-proposed-cuts-anti-diversity-measures,,"WASHINGTON — Education Secretary Linda McMahon took heat from Democrats on the U.S. House Committee on Education and Workforce on Wednesday over the Trump administration’s initiatives to dramatically overhaul the federal role in education and eliminate the Education Department.Lawmakers took aim at President Donald Trump’s fiscal 2026 budget request — which includes $12 billion in spending cuts — as well as efforts to dismantle the agency and threats to yank funds for schools that use race-conscious practices across aspects of student life.A department summary said the cut “reflects an agency that is responsibly winding down.”Chair Tim Walberg, a Michigan Republican, praised McMahon’s efforts.“We believe in reducing bureaucracy, trusting our educators, trusting our state and local leaders and trusting the innovators who are pushing against the barriers thrown up by the bureaucracy,” he said. “And above all, we trust our parents — this is our vision, and thankfully, we finally have an administration in place that shares this vision.”But Rep. Bobby Scott, ranking member of the panel, blasted the department’s priorities, including the budget proposal, which he said “would make it more difficult for students to enroll in and afford a college education by proposing reductions in funding to need-based grants such as Pell and work study.”“At the end of the day, it is the students of this nation who will suffer under this budget proposal,” the Virginia Democrat said. “Students from low-income families and students with disabilities, English learners, international students and students of color will face more hurdles accessing equal educational opportunity.”The budget calls for eliminating key programs administered by the Education Department for disadvantaged and low-income students, including Federal TRIO Programs and the Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs, or GEAR UP.The budget request also proposes a $60 million increase to expand the number of charter schools in the country and lowering nearly $1,700 from the maximum amount a student can receive annually through the Pell Grant — a government subsidy that helps low-income students pay for college.A federal judge in Massachusetts in May dealt the administration a major setback to its education agenda, ordering the agency to reinstate the more than 1,300 employees gutted during a reduction in force effort, blocking the department from carrying out Trump’s order to close the department and barring the department from transferring the student loan portfolio and special education services to other federal agencies while the case challenging those policies is ongoing.A federal appeals court on Wednesday upheld the trial judge’s order. DEI lesson plansDemocrats on Wednesday took aim at the administration’s efforts against diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, programs. The administration had sought to bar schools from using DEI practices across aspects of student life to continue to receive federal funding, an effort that multiple federal judges have blocked.Rep. Summer Lee of Pennsylvania said the Trump administration “has undoubtedly revived the culture of racism we haven’t seen since the Jim Crow era,” adding that “they’ve made it clear that open attacks on Black and brown and other marginalized communities is not just tolerated, but it’s encouraged.”Asked by Lee whether a lesson plan on the Tulsa race massacre would be considered “illegal DEI,” McMahon replied: “I’d have to get back to you on that.”Lee then asked McMahon whether she knew what the Tulsa race massacre was, to which the secretary said: “I’d like to look into it more and get back to you on it.”McMahon was similarly noncommittal on a question about assigning school desegregation icon Ruby Bridges’ autobiography.State flexibilityThe budget proposal also calls for consolidating 18 grant programs for K-12 education and replacing them with a single formula grant program, which the administration says will give states spending flexibility.Democrats at Wednesday’s hearing blasted the administration’s push to return education “back to the states,” noting that some states have poor records on education.Rep. Yassamin Ansari said the education system is “absolutely failing” many students in the United States. The main cause of that, the Arizona Democrat said, was that many states have “woefully underfunded” their public education systems and not, as the administration has claimed, due to “too much” federal oversight or DEI policies.When asked by Ansari what risk McMahon weighed for public schools and universities if federal education funding is gutted or devolved to the states, the secretary said “federal education wouldn’t necessarily be gutted” and that “there would be more money to go to the states without the bureaucracy of the Department of Education.”Ansari rejected that claim, noting that some states, including hers, have an “abysmal track record of managing education.” She pointed to Arizona’s low rankings on public education, teacher salaries, test scores and the highest student-to-teacher ratio in the country.",,,,2025-06-04 18:11:20.722946

(Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)LEAVENWORTH — A Kansas district court barred CoreCivic Wednesday from reopening its shuttered prison until the company goes through Leavenworth’s development process to receive a special use permit. 
Judge John Bryant, Leavenworth County District Court, was unconvinced by arguments from CoreCivic attorneys that the company was grandfathered into the city’s zoning codes and did not need a special use permit to hold U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainees. 
He ruled in favor of the city of Leavenworth, which had asked for a temporary restraining order to stop the reopening of CoreCivic’s prison, the Midwest Regional Reception Center. 
After nearly two hours of arguments in front of a courtroom packed with Leavenworth city officials and community activists, Bryant made an immediate ruling. He said his decision was not affected by CoreCivic’s history in the community, which has been openly criticized by former employees, inmates and residents, and in submitted court documents. 
The request for a restraining order was a procedural issue, he said. 
“The posture of this case is a little bit different in that the city has acted here because CoreCivic has stated its intent to ignore or not give any effect to the March ‘25 administrative decision,” Bryant said, referring to the city’s requirement that CoreCivic get a special use permit before reopening. 
Bryant said that if CoreCivic disagreed, company attorneys could have gone through the Kansas judicial review process to argue zoning decisions. Such a move needed to be made within 30 days, he said, and CoreCivic did not take that action. 
 
What’s next?
“We are reviewing the court’s decision and considering next steps,” said CoreCivic spokesman Steve Owen in response to emailed questions. “We maintain the position that our facility, which we’ve operated for almost 30 years, does not require a special use permit to care for detainees in partnership with ICE. We look forward to presenting our arguments to the court.”
He did not answer questions about whether the company is housing any ICE detainees in Leavenworth or what is happening at the facility, which had a parking lot full of cars on Wednesday.
Leavenworth city manager Scott Peterson was pleased with the court’s decision. Although CoreCivic could continue litigation on the issue, he said the company was welcome o go through the city’s planning and zoning process to get a special use permit. 
Joseph Hatley, attorney for Leavenworth, said the next step today would be writing the temporary restraining order and then circulating it to all parties. 
“If we have a disagreement about it, the judge can resolve the disagreement, but essentially it will say they cannot house detainees without a special use permit,” he said. 
 
Three months
The typical special use permit process in Leavenworth takes about three months, Peterson said, in part to allow time to set up public hearings to allow Leavenworth area residents to have input. 
In its motion to the court asking for the temporary restraining order, the city’s attorneys laid out significant issues they had when CoreCivic previously operated a prison in Leavenworth. The national private prison company operated the Leavenworth Detention Center from 1986 to 2021, when CoreCivic’s federal contract was not renewed. 
The city opened its petition with quotes from a 2021 court transcript. U.S. District Court Judge Julie Robinson called CoreCivic’s Leavenworth prison a “hell hole.” 
“All that’s going on there and causing trauma to everybody – guards are being traumatized. Guards have been almost killed. Detainees are being traumatized with assaults and batteries, and not long ago a detainee was killed. So I’m well aware of the situation at CoreCivic and very troubled by it as well,” Robinson said at the time.

In the petition, the city also noted the Leavenworth Police Department had issues with CoreCivic in the final years before the prison closed, citing roadblocks when investigating violent crimes within the facility, lack of planning for major crises such as riots or hostage situations and difficulty getting access. 
The city’s special use permitting process would allow the city to set guidelines that would address those situations, Peterson said.
“Cities generally have broad abilities to impose additional requirements on a special use permit, so long as they are applicable to the use that we’re discussing,” he said. “Obviously, property owners are protected in some regards in that we can’t make outlandish requirements.”
If CoreCivic would disagree with city requirements, Peterson added, they could then access the judicial review process to argue those points. 
CoreCivic had initially applied for a special use permit in March but withdrew that application. Peterson said the process had begun and CoreCivic and city officials were meeting. 
“I would note that with internal conversations the city was having with CoreCivic, we were in agreement with the things the city was going to propose in terms of protecting the city services moving forward,” he said. 
In the hearing, CoreCivic attorney Taylor Hausmann said the company withdrew from those proceedings because the city did not schedule a hearing within a 60-day period, as required. 
“It became clear to CoreCivic that there was not a cooperative relationship happening there, and thus CoreCivic fell back on its position that it was not required to have it (the special use permit), and that this was not going to work, to move together cooperatively.”
City officials are adamant that the city is not stalling the prison’s reopening.
“From the perspective of the city, this was never about stopping something from happening,” said David Waters, an attorney for the city. “This is about following the city’s rules and regulations and going through those processes, giving everybody the same fair hearing that we afford all special use permits.”
 
Community concerns
Esmie Tseng, spokeswoman for the American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas, attended the hearing. She was pleased the judge heard the city’s concerns but is worried about what will happen in the future. 
“I think that’s the core of the case,” she said. “There is a lot of distrust. And CoreCivic definitely hammered very hard on past conduct should not be an indicator of future conduct, but I don’t think we have to rely on past conduct. 
We have cases across the country of CoreCivic’s current conduct that sort of speak to concerns about local distress, about their business practices, about shortcuts,” Tseng said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/city-officials-attorneys-1024x703.jpg,,,2025-06-04 18:11:20.722946

Josh Shapiro announced his administration has filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) over its cancellation of millions of dollars in federal funding to farmers who supply food banks throughout the state. (Commonwealth Media Services)PHILADELPHIA — Gov. Josh Shapiro announced his administration has filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) over its cancellation of millions of dollars in federal funding to farmers who supply food banks throughout the state.
“I’m tired of waiting for someone to stand up for our farmers and our food banks. That task falls to us,” Shapiro said Wednesday in Philadelphia. “The USDA and the Trump administration ignored our farmers, and they ignored folks who are hungry here in Pennsylvania.”
Shapiro said his administration filed a lawsuit Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Harrisburg asking a judge to reverse the USDA’s decision to cancel its contract with the commonwealth.
The program, known as the Local Food Assistance Cooperative Agreement Program (LFPA), was established by President Joe Biden’s administration in response to concerns over the coronavirus pandemic in 2021. In December, Biden’s administration renewed the contract with Pennsylvania for three years and $13 million. In March, the Trump administration announced that the program was ending.
“This lawsuit calls on the USDA to simply honor its commitment to our farmers, to honor its commitment to folks who are hungry and to simply follow the contract that they signed,” Shapiro said
In Pennsylvania, LFPA provides funding that supports 189 farms and 14 food banks. Shapiro said it represented between 10% and 15% of the annual market share for many of the farmers participating in the program.
The back-and-forth between Shapiro and the Trump administration over the matter has spanned multiple months. In March, Shapiro held a press conference at a food bank in Harrisburg sounding an alarm on the program’s cancellation. He said his administration appealed to get the money and wrote a letter to Trump’s administration in late March.
In April, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins made a trip to multiple central Pennsylvania farms where she claimed the money for food banks was, in fact, available. She said Shapiro and other officials either didn’t “have their facts right,” or were playing political “games.”
Shapiro disputed the claim at the time and re-upped his criticism of Rollins’ explanation Wednesday in Philadelphia.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The LFPA initiative works as a reimbursement program, Shapiro said, so the state doesn’t get the money until after it pays farmers and provides receipts.
A USDA spokesperson told the Capital-Star that they “do not comment on pending litigation,” and directed inquiries to the U.S. Department of Justice.
George Maysik, executive director of Share Food Program in Philadelphia, said the food bank serves more than 500,000 people per month in the greater Philadelphia area and demand has risen over 120% in the last three years.
“The LFPA program was designed to provide some level of relief for the 14 food banks like us across the commonwealth who are serving that rising need,” Maysik said.
He addressed Trump directly, criticizing his administration’s decision to cancel the program.
“You had a deal with food banks serving 67 counties trying to alleviate poverty,” Maysik said. “And above all, Mr. President, you had a deal with the American people and you broke your word.”
“The art of the deal,” he scoffed.
Julie McCabe, executive director of Pennypack Farm & Education Center, explained her 13 acre vegetable farm in Montgomery County participated in the LFPA program to provide products to local food banks.
“Our produce giving program has grown tremendously,” McCabe said. “From just over 8,000 pounds donated in 2017 to more than 26,000 pounds given in 2024.”
While Shapiro said his administration has increased investments to connect farmers with hungry people, he said the state doesn’t have the money to backfill the federal cuts, if the lawsuit is unsuccessful. 
Still, Shapiro said he has reasons to be optimistic that he would succeed.
“I’ve got a pretty good track record when I take Donald Trump to court,” said Shapiro, who served as the state’s attorney general during Trump’s first term. “We’re going to win this, and we’re going to get our money back for the good people of Pennsylvania.”

(Human World for Animals)A taxidermied giraffe head, cut from its body at the shoulders, was found on sale for $6,000 in a Luzerne County store. It is just one of hundreds of endangered animal parts being sold across the state uncovered through an investigation by a global nonprofit animal rights organization.  
State Rep. Leanne Krueger (D-Delaware) says Pennsylvania has a responsibility to fight illicit sales that fuel poaching of at-risk animals abroad. Her legislation, House Bill 994, would ban the sale of covered endangered animal parts within the state. 
“Iconic species of animals continue to face the threat of extinction due to the demand for their parts,” Krueger wrote in a memo seeking support for the bill. “While many of these species reside in countries or oceans thousands of miles away, we have a duty to ensure that the residents of our great Commonwealth are not supporting the poaching and trafficking that threaten these at-risk species of animals.”
Lawmakers gathered with Humane World for Animals representatives Wednesday to rally support for the legislation. 
Gabe Witgil, wildlife trafficking program director at Humane World for Animals, said states must close legal loopholes that allow illicit animal parts markets to thrive.
“Iconic species across the planet continue to face the threat of extinction due to demand for their body parts,” he said. “Each year, 10,000 to 15,000 elephants are killed in Africa to supply the global demand for their ivory.”
The group’s investigation team visited 31 Pennsylvania antique and vintage stores over a three week period in March and searched 31 online auctions between January and April, uncovering 383 pieces of ivory with a total retail value of $38,000. Bracelets, necklaces, figurines and even silverware were among the found ivory products taken from elephants, hippos, warthogs, walruses, mammoths and whales. 
“What we found was a gruesome amount of evidence that accelerates the call to action,” said Whitney Teamus, the organization’s senior director of investigations. “The number of ivory items identified exceeds what we’ve seen in our previous investigations over the last several years, including in Connecticut and Florida.” 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Of the stores and auctions investigated, 59% had endangered wildlife products for sale. 
A key problem, the investigators said, was a lack of documentation for many ivory products being sold, which makes it difficult to determine if the parts were illegally imported. Many ivory items were found to be mislabeled as bone or mammoth ivory, which is currently legal to sell. 
“The labeling of ivory was also disturbingly unreliable, with some vendors uncertain of the material they were selling, while others appeared to be intentionally mislabeling items,” Teamus said. “This is a misleading sales tactic we and others have witnessed in other investigations to obscure the trade of these items.”
Teamus told the Capital-Star that the number of endangered animal parts they found is likely miniscule compared to the total amount being sold in the state. 
“There’s tons more out there. Ivory is in your backyard, for sure,” she said. “You think elephants are thousands of miles away. You don’t think of them as being in your backyard.” 
What would H.B. 994 do if passed?  
The legislation would make the sale of ivory and other endangered animal parts illegal while expanding the list of protected animals that aren’t covered under the federal Endangered Species Act, such as giraffes. 
While federal law prohibits the importation of endangered species parts and the sale of these parts between states, it does not ban the sale within states. Pennsylvania law currently allows endangered animal parts to be sold only with a permit. 
Animals covered by the the bill are the baleen whale, bonobo, cheetah, chimpanzee, dolphin, elephant, giraffe, gorilla, hippopotamus, jaguar, leopard, lion, mammoth, mastodon, orangutan, panda, pangolin, polar bear, ray, rhinoceros, sea turtle, shark, tiger and walrus. 
If passed, civil penalties would be imposed upon violators based on the value of the illegal animal product. Thirteen states and Washington D.C. have passed similar legislation. 
The bill passed the House Judiciary Committee by a 25-1 vote on Monday and now awaits consideration on the House floor. 
“We expect the bill to be on the floor soon, and we’ll work hard to maintain the bipartisan vote that we earned in committee this week,” Krueger said. “I’m hopeful that we’re going to be able to send this bill to the Senate very soon, and am hopeful that our colleagues there will see the value of ending the demand for trafficked animal parts in Pennsylvania.”

(Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate) The Joint Public Health, Welfare and Labor Committee on Wednesday reviewed amendments to Arkansas’ surface water quality standards rule, which is part of the state’s enforcement of the federal Clean Water Act.
As part of the Clean Water Act, the state is required to review — and if necessary, revise — the standards every three years.
The rule, currently called Rule 2, was pulled from last month’s committee agenda to give lawmakers more time to review the changes, which include the addition of five new health-based water quality standards for benzene, methylbenzene, xylene, toluene and phenol. 
The rule also amends existing criteria for ammonia and cadmium, which haven’t been updated in decades, to bring them in line with revisions made by the Environmental Protection Agency within the last 15 years.
Rule 2 standards apply to surface waters — such as rivers, creeks, lakes and wetlands — not to drinking water, which is governed by a separate federal law, the Safe Drinking Water Act. While the Division of Environmental Quality oversees Arkansas’ enforcement of the CWA, the Arkansas Department of Health enforces the SDWA in the state.
“It’s not a blanket effluent limit,” DEQ Director Bailey Taylor told committee members. The standards are for the “ambient” water quality, and permit limits for facilities like wastewater treatment plants and industrial plants that discharge waste into surface waters are backcalculated from the standards, she said.
Under the revised rule, the “primary contact season,” the period during which people are most likely to be recreating in the water by swimming, fishing or boating, would be extended by two months so it would now fall from April to October. 
Pressed by Greenwood Republican Rep. Lee Johnson for an explanation for the change, Taylor said standards during the primary contact season are tighter for some measures than outside of it to account for greater human contact with the water. Taylor singled out bacteria standards as one example. She said the change was made to account for water recreation that’s been happening in April and October.
Johnson said it was “interesting” that the division was moving to make the change now, and asked if DEQ believed Arkansans were swimming more in 2025 than they were in 2020 or in the 1980s.
“I just wonder why we’re deciding now to change the recreational season when it’s been in effect for a long time,” Johnson said.
Taylor said the division was trying to account for recreation that was happening outside of the traditional May to September season. Johnson countered by asking if DEQ had collected any data showing that more people were engaging in water recreation during the extended months. Taylor said the decision was based on “anecdotal stakeholder engagement.” 
The rule will next be considered by the Arkansas Legislative Council’s Administrative Rules Subcommittee.

Ashley Moody next year is ripping into the state party, accusing it of unfairly excluding her from the party’s upcoming annual fundraiser while at the same time opening the door to another potential Senate candidate.
The Florida Democratic Party strongly disputes the assertion made by Tamika Lyles that the party is violating its bylaws as well as “the basic principles of democracy.”
Here’s what we know: Lyles filed to run for the U.S. Senate on April 1. Josh Weil is a Democrat who raised a large amount of money in his unsuccessful bid to beat Republican Randy Fine in the special congressional election in District 6 in April. He too, is expected to announce his candidacy in the 2026 Senate race later this month.
The Lyles’ campaign raised objections when it learned that Weil would be given an opportunity to speak at the party’s Leadership Blue Weekend event, which includes a gala, being held at the Hard Rock in Hollywood June 20-22, believing it to be a slight since Weil has yet to announce his candidacy. 
Lyles’ campaign on Tuesday issued a lengthy statement expressing its anger.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
But FDP officials say Lyles isn’t telling the whole story, and that the party isn’t supporting anybody in next year’s Senate primary. 
The FDP says that Weil is only getting an opportunity to speak at Leadership Blue Weekend because he paid $50,000 to become a “title sponsor” for the event. It’s the highest price point among the four different sponsorships that attendees can donate (the three other sponsorships range between $5,000 to $25,000.)
The $50,000 donation comes with perks, including four reception tickets, two seats at the head table for the event and a “speaking opportunity,” as listed in an FDP document.
The event is the biggest fundraiser of the year for the Democratic Party, with individual tickets going for $300.
Lyles said that she was informed by an FDP official that she too, could get a speaking slot similar to Weil’s if she would pay the $50,000 required to become a title sponsor. 
Unequal treatment and exclusion?
The Lyles campaign claims the party’s decision to not initially reach out to her highlights “a serious issue of unequal treatment and exclusion,” adding that “it is an act of discrimination, one that mirrors the ongoing marginalization of women, particularly Black women and grassroots candidates nationwide.” Lyles is Black.
The FDP says that’s not what happened here.
“Title sponsorships for our annual Leadership Blue Weekend are available to all candidates, and no title sponsorship opportunities have been ‘extended’ to any candidates,” said FDP spokesperson Matt Dailey. 
“However, as the information on how to sign up for a title sponsorship has been publicly available on our website for months, some candidates have reached out to us to sponsor the event. “
Lyles is a U.S. Air Force veteran based in Osceola County who is making her third run for public office. She briefly entered the Democratic primary for Senate in 2018 before withdrawing. In 2020 she finished third in a five-person Democratic primary for a Central Florida House seat.
“This is what voter suppression looks like inside the party,” she said in a written statement to the Florida Phoenix. “I have served this country in uniform, earned multiple degrees, led legal and advocacy efforts for over a decade, and built a campaign powered by people, not political insiders. Yet it still isn’t enough to be treated fairly or be given the same access as a man who hasn’t even entered the race.”
FDP officials say that the only people speaking at the Leadership Blue Gala on Saturday night, June 21, the signature event of the weekend, will be New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, Chair Nikki Fried and sitting members of Congress. Weil will be given a speaking slot at some other time during the weekend event, which includes lots of panel discussions.
This isn’t the first time that there’s been an issue in regard to who gets to speak among Senate Democratic candidates at the Leadership Blue Weekend. At last year’s event held in Orlando, the eventual nominee, Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, did speak during the evening event.
Her main opponent in the primary election last August, Black tech entrepreneur Stanley Campbell, said he was only invited to speak during a morning session in front of a much smaller group of people (an FDP official tells the Phoenix that they “believed” that both of those candidates paid to get the chance to address party members at last year’s event).
When asked if it wasn’t a bad look that only candidates who could offer to pay $50,000 could get a speaking slot sometime during the weekend, the FDP’s Matt Dailey said that raising money for the party is what the event is essentially all about.
“Above all, Leadership Blue is a fundraising event – our largest and most important of the year,” he said. “The practice of offering a spot in the weekend schedule to incentivize title sponsorship is a long-time and well-advertised practice of the party.”

Sarah Trone Garriott, running for Iowa’s 3rd Congressional District, held a roundtable discussion Wednesday on congressional Republicans’ plan to cut Medicaid and the potential impact on health care in Iowa.
Trone Garriott is one of the Democratic candidates aiming for the seat currently held by U.S. Rep. Zach Nunn, a Republican. Nunn, alongside Iowa’s other Republican representatives in the U.S. House, voted in favor of the budget reconciliation bill that analysts say would reduce federal spending for the program by $625 billion over the next decade.
The West Des Moines Democrat said she wanted to hold a town hall on the proposal because of the “dismissive statements” Iowa’s congressional delegation has made when talking about the impact of the Medicaid cuts — specifically referencing U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst’s town hall statement that “we all are going to die” after an attendee yelled that people will die because of the cuts.
Trone Garriott also criticized Nunn and other members of Iowa’s House delegation for not hosting public events on the issue.
“We have seen our congressmen not hold open town halls and not have conversations to hear these hard stories, and we need to be listening so we can do a better job for the people of our state,” she said.
The changes to Medicaid include work requirements with several exemptions, including for people with disabilities and complex medical conditions, minors and seniors as well as pregnant people and parents of dependent children.
Republicans have argued the proposed changes will not impact Medicaid coverage for people in need, such as those with disabilities, and will instead target waste, fraud and abuse in the Medicaid system. At an event last week, Nunn said public assistance programs like Medicaid, as well as Medicare and SNAP, help Americans, but “have to be used in a way to help Americans with a hand up, not a handout,” the Des Moines Register reported.
But Trone Garriott said she believed the work requirements will add new burdens on people with real health care needs, without necessarily addressing the actual problems in the system.
“They’re indiscriminate cuts,” Trone Garriott told reporters. “It’s not about addressing any kind of fraud — which is more an issue from providers and billing, so that’s not addressing that concern. And it’s already very stringent, very challenging to get on Medicaid. There’s a lot of people who should be on it who are not being served. So it’s actually the opposite problem we have … more people could be eligible, but the process is so challenging that they can’t get on and stay on Medicaid.”
Iowans at the roundtable event said the proposed Medicaid changes will make it more difficult for people with covered medical conditions to get the care they need.
Paula Connolly, the parent of an adult child with a rare disability, said that while she and her husband were raising their child as an infant, Medicaid — and later Medicare — were the only ways for her family to access the medicine and other specific items, such as specialized formula, needed for their son. Adding new barriers to Medicaid will not only make it harder for families like hers to access the support they need, Connolly said, but will also have a greater impact by decreasing the number of providers willing to provide services and health care through Medicaid.
She gave an example of Medicaid coverage for a wheelchair repair — an already months-long process that could stretch out longer if cuts to the program are made.
“If the person who fixes the wheelchair doesn’t get adequately compensated to run the business, then he can’t fix a wheelchair,” Connolly said. “Or if the part for the wheelchair takes a year to get, well, then you essentially don’t have that wheelchair. And that means as a family — because disability does not only impact the child, it impacts the family — that means we sit at home and we don’t get out. We’re not doing healthy things to destress with caregiving, we’re not going to church.”
Health care professionals echoed these concerns, saying the Medicaid cuts could put health care providers across the state either out of business or in a situation where they cannot treat all patients in need.
Ed Friedmann, a physician’s assistant who is the sole health care provider at the Redfield Rural Health Clinic, said Medicaid and health care coverage through the Affordable Care Act have helped keep the clinic in Redfield, a rural town in Dallas County, in business. Not having insurance does not stop hospitals and clinics from giving patients’ medical treatment, he said — but not having payment and reimbursement through public health programs for individuals who would otherwise be uninsured could lead to more rural health care providers shutting down.
“If Medicaid patients lose their insurance, there’ll be less income for the clinic, and less likely for the clinic to be able to continue going in a town like Redfield and towns throughout the United States,” Friedmann said.
Trone Garriott said having more uninsured people in the system will mean “health care providers have to shift costs when they can’t cover costs, which means raising costs on everyone.” If elected, she said she would support raising Medicaid reimbursement rates, tying them to economic indicators, as a way to help Iowa health care providers stay open.
“It’s already a narrow margin, as providers are trying to continue to serve Medicaid patients, and there are a lot of areas where they’re just not able to make that work,” Trone Garriott said. “So we’re seeing labor and delivery units close. We’re seeing dental care providers just unable to take Medicaid patients. We’re seeing more and more folks with Medicaid not being able to access care or waiting a long time to get it.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/tronegarriott6.4.25-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-04 18:11:20.722946

(Photo Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)In an early blow to groups attempting to get amendments on the ballot for the 2026 election, a federal judge declined on Wednesday to temporarily block most of the new restrictions on citizen-led initiatives.
Chief U.S. District Judge Mark Walker’s ruling allows Florida to proceed with enforcing most of HB 1205, one of Gov. Ron DeSantis’ top priorities for this year’s legislative session, while litigation brought by some of the groups sponsoring initiatives on the ballot on May 4 moves forward.
In the meantime, the state can enforce provisions requiring sponsors to turn in completed petitions within 10 days after the voter signs the form, enact stepped-up fines for providing pre-filled petitions, and collect fines and impose criminal penalties for filling out missing information and copying information from petitions. Sponsors, such as Florida Decides Healthcare and Smart & Safe Florida, claimed that HB 1205 would make it nearly impossible to get amendment initiatives on the ballot.
In court hearing, attorneys debate palatability of new restrictions on citizens’ initiatives

“Here, aside from demonstrating they have suffered an injury in fact, Plaintiffs’ record only goes so far to show that the process of gathering signed petitions has become more expensive and less efficient, not that these post-petition-gathering regulations have severely burdened Plaintiffs from speaking such that the challenged regulations must survive heightened scrutiny to pass constitutional muster,” Walker wrote in his order.
However, Walker agreed to temporarily halt a provision for one of the plaintiffs of the law that expanded the definition of racketeering to cover irregularities and fraud regarding the petition collection process, writing that the statute was unconstitutionally vague and allowed for arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. The block only applies to Jordan Simmons, a project director of the campaign to expand Medicaid.
“Mr. Simmons faces irreparable injury because the law forces him to choose between curtailing his First Amendment rights to engage in core political speech via petition circulation or risk arrest and prosecution for a felony charge that could result in up to thirty years in prison,” Walker wrote.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Where are the petition-gathering operations?
Florida Decides Healthcare framed Walker’s order as a win in a press release despite his denial of most of their claims.
“While the Court did not grant every part of our motion for preliminary relief, this is far from the final word,” wrote its Executive Director Mitch Emerson. “This ruling was an early, extraordinary step in the legal process—and we are optimistic about what comes next, both for the remaining parts of HB 1205 that we’re challenging and for the future of citizen-led democracy in Florida.”
In a message to the group’s coalition partners after Walker issued the order, Ana-Christina Acosta, the organizing director, wrote that petition collection operations will continue regardless of what happens with the litigation.
So far, Florida Decides Healthcare has gathered 18,867 valid signatures and Smart & Safe Florida has gathered 379,345 valid signatures, enough to trigger the Florida Supreme Court’s review of the amendment summary that could appear on the ballot, according to the Florida Division of Elections.
Sponsors of citizen-led initiatives need to get approval from the Florida Supreme Court on the clarity of the amendment summary, gather 880,062 valid signatures from at least half of the state’s 28 congressional districts to appear on the ballot, and get at least 60% approval to pass.
Law followed failed amendments
While the majority of voters approved recreational marijuana and abortion-rights amendments, both failed to cross the 60% threshold after Gov. Ron DeSantis deployed state resources to campaign against the proposed measures.
Lawmakers passed HB 1205 this year, citing a need to eradicate fraud in the petition-gathering process in light of a January report published by the state’s Office of Election Crimes and Security claiming that more than 100 representatives of the group attempting enshrine abortion access in the Florida Constitution last year committed crimes related to gathering petitions. Floridians Protecting Freedom denied the claims in the report but ultimately dropped its challenge to the fine the state imposed.
Only Florida residents could gather petitions
Come July 1, the state will also require people collecting signatures and petitions to register with the Secretary of State. Under HB 1205, people convicted of felonies who haven’t had their voting rights restored, non-U.S. citizens, and non-Florida residents can’t collect signatures or petitions.
Plaintiffs filed a second motion asking Walker to temporarily block those provisions, with Smart & Safe Florida stating that it would face a fine of $23.7 million because 474 of its trained petition circulators aren’t Florida residents.

(Photo via Sen. Susan Collins/ Facebook)Editor’s Note: This story is part of a series about U.S. Sen. Susan Collins’ role during the second Trump presidency. 
As Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins approaches three decades in Congress, the self-described moderate’s balancing act has meant she’s angered both the left and right. However, even Mainers otherwise critical of Collins commend her ability to secure federal funding for Maine.
“I think her big goal has been what it always has been and that’s delivering economically for the state,” said Jim Melcher, a professor of political science at University of Maine Farmington. “I think [that] really interests her a lot more than being an ideological vote, honestly, for anybody.”
Though, the bounds of that unifier are now being tested by the Trump administration.
Since President Donald Trump threatened to withhold federal funding unless Maine complies with his executive order banning transgender girls from playing girls’ sports, the state has been the subject of several probes and funding cuts that have been widely interpreted as retaliatory.
Some Mainers say these terminations underscore why Maine needs Collins, one of Congress’ most senior members and top appropriators. Others argue the executive’s actions reveal a crack in Collins’ power.
When asked whether she believes she can still ensure Maine receives both the funding it’s owed and continued appropriations for new initiatives, Collins did not hesitate to say, “I do.”
 Her record

Both Republican leaders of the Maine Legislature, Sen. Trey Stewart of Aroostook County and Rep. Billy Bob Faulkingham of Winter Harbor, said, without a doubt, that Collins should not face a primary challenger. Why? Federal funding.
“I think it’s absolutely insane to vote out Susan Collins, who brings so much money into the state of Maine,” Faulkingham said.
In fiscal year 2022, Congress reinstated earmarks, formally referred to as Congressionally Directed Spending in the Senate, where individual members have the ability to request funds for specific projects in their home states. Collins has secured more than $1 billion for Maine using this method since.
Collins secured more than $200 million for 105 projects in fiscal year 2022, more than $308 million for 108 projects in fiscal year 2023, and more than $577 million for 231 projects in fiscal year 2024. Her 2024 total was the most secured by any senator that year.
Throughout the years, these have gone toward initiatives related to infrastructure, medical services and affordable housing, among others.
The University of Maine System received $125.45 million from Congressionally Directed Spending secured by Collins between fiscal year 2022 and 2024, according to Chief External and Governmental Affairs Officer Samantha Warren, who called the funding “transformational.”
Though, Warren added, these earmarks don’t reflect all of the funding that Collins has helped funnel to the system, both since the earmark process was restored and before, noting Collins’ longtime championing of investments for Maine’s public universities including through need-based federal Pell grants and TRIO programs.
Another key funding source outside the earmark process is defense spending, which Collins has helped secure for Maine-based contractors such as Bath Iron Works and Portsmouth Naval Shipyard.
“Do you think we’re going to be building ships at Bath Iron Works if we have a freshman legislator in the Senate? No, I don’t think so,” Faulkingham said.

When asked whether the General Dynamics-owned contractor has any concerns about Collins being able to continue to deliver in light of other congressionally appropriated funds being rescinded, David Hench, communications principal for BIW, pointed to her track record.
“Senator Collins’ leadership as a member and now chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee has been invaluable in not only providing resources for our national defense, but in helping to address the transportation, housing and childcare needs of our state and workforce,” Hench said.
When asked the same, Kate Dufour, director of advocacy and communications for the Maine Municipal Association, a nonprofit state municipal league, described a similar working relationship between its members and the senator.
“Collins is a strong proponent of municipal government and has done much during her career to ensure that Maine has access to federal revenues, which reduce the burdens placed on the property taxpayers,” Dufour said.
Several other major benefactors of Collins’ earmarks declined to comment on her performance as a top appropriator, including Jackson Laboratory and Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, or did not respond to requests for comment, including Maine Medical Center.
When asked about her record of delivering for the state, Collins also pointed to her ability to work with both parties to advance legislation that aids many Mainers, and Americans more broadly. For example, she pointed to her co-authoring of the Social Security Fairness Act, signed into law earlier this year under former President Joe Biden, which she said she spent more than two decades working toward. The Act restored full benefits for millions of public sector workers.
 A breakdown

The funding process has been upended during Trump’s second term, challenging Collins’ otherwise steadily growing appropriations power.
The continuing resolution from GOP leadership this winter cut earmarks for community projects. Collins had secured nearly $361 million in earmarks this year before they were removed from the resolution, which she said she ultimately supported to avoid a government shutdown.
While it appears earmarks will return in bills this year to fund projects for fiscal year 2026, Mark Brewer, chair of the political science at the University of Maine, said he doesn’t think anyone can actually say whether that will consistently be the case moving forward.
“Really, a lot of the things that we thought for years and years that had been norms for how things are done in Washington are not at the moment,” Brewer said.
How the White House implemented that stopgap bill demonstrated another breakdown of normal procedure, defying precedent in vetoing certain emergency spending allocations made by Congress. Collins warned the Trump administration in a letter then that the move could strain its working relationship with the Appropriations Committee.
State Sen. Rick Bennett of Oxford, a moderate Republican who has crossed paths with Collins when she previously held state-level positions and on campaign trails, said the senior senator has long focused on being institutionally responsible, an objective he also shares.
On the state level, Bennett has argued the Legislature has ceded too much power to the governor and on the national level that Congress has ceded too much to the president. Calling Congress “barely functional on a good day,” Bennett said of Collins, “I think it’s difficult for her to find a normal process that is inclusive in this chaos.”
When asked whether Collins is charting the most effective path amid that chaos, Bennett said, “I think we’re going to find out. I don’t have any advice for her. I think you’d have to be sitting in her seat in order to see what avenues she has.”
Collins has touted her behind-the-scenes conversations with officials as the most effective means to restore funding so far. Maine has been subject to both the Trump administration’s across-the-board slashes as well as targeted terminations.
For example, in late February, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration notified the University of Maine that it was immediately discontinuing funding for the $4.5 million Maine Sea Grant, which has helped finance statewide research, strengthen coastal communities and support thousands of jobs over more than five decades.
While one of 34 grants across coastal and Great Lakes states throughout the country, Maine’s grant was the only one terminated.
The funding cut came about a week after Trump threatened to withhold federal funding unless Maine complied with his executive order banning transgender girls from playing girls’ sports. Since then, the state has been the subject of several probes and funding cuts.
On March 4, independent U.S. Sen. Angus King and Democratic U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree of Maine sent a letter to Vice Admiral Nancy Hann demanding she immediately reverse the decision. But when Hann announced on March 5 that the grant would be renegotiated, she credited conversations with Collins and her staff. The University of Maine also credited the renegotiation decision to Collins.
“We are deeply appreciative of Senator Collins’ leadership and relentless advocacy on behalf of Maine Sea Grant and the hard-working Mainers it has long served,” UMaine President Joan Ferrini-Mundy said in a statement.

 Values versus funding 

Collins lost Saco resident Sandy Katz’s support on issues of principle, and while not enough to gain her vote, Katz said, “The funding is the one thing she does well.”
Values and funding, however, are becoming increasingly entwined, as exemplified by Trump’s attempt to force compliance with his executive order through cuts.
On principle, Collins is against transgender athletes playing in women’s sports, but when it comes to funding, she criticized the president’s attempts to rescind federal dollars for Maine schools.
Trying to find her balance between the two has also been challenged with her votes on Trump’s Cabinet picks. She voted for the vast majority of nominees, confirming 20 and voting against two: Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation Kash Patel.
Regarding Hegseth, Collins said, “I think his difficulty in managing the department effectively has shown that my judgment was correct on that.” Since his confirmation, Hegseth has been involved in a spate of security scandals over his use of the open-source, encrypted messaging app Signal.
Regarding Patel, Collins said, “I felt particularly at this time, but at any time, we need an apolitical FBI director and I did not think that Kash Patel was based on his writings.” Patel has authored children’s books and been involved with projects that promote pro-Trump conspiracy theories.
Concerning the Cabinet picks Collins supported, one confirmation in particular stuck out to political scientist and writer Amy Fried: Director of the U.S. Office of Management and Budget Russell Vought.
Vought, an architect of Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation’s blueprint to overhaul the federal government, has said he doesn’t believe Congress has the final say on federal spending.
When asked whether he would comply with the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, which clarifies that presidents don’t have the legal authority to ignore Congress on federal spending, Vought responded, “No, I don’t believe it’s constitutional. The president ran on that view. That’s his view, and I agree.”
Collins told Maine Morning Star she gives deference to presidential Cabinet picks regardless of party.
“Despite my disagreements with [Vought], which are pretty profound when it comes to the Impoundment Act, he is clearly well qualified for the position,” Collins said. “He previously served as both deputy director of OMB and as director of OMB. So when I’m evaluating Cabinet nominees, I, in general, base my decision on whether or not the person is qualified for the job, not on whether I agree with all of their positions.”
Fried argued Collins’ vote for Vought undermines her own power.
“Her big claim was ‘I will be able to help the state of Maine because someday I’m going to be chair of the Appropriations Committee,’” Fried said. “Well, if the Appropriations Committee isn’t deciding what money goes where, then that just renders that whole thing null and void.”

“The state of Oklahoma cannot fund that operation of our own accord,” Tim Gatz, Oklahoma Department of Transportation executive director, told his governing board Monday.
Gatz previously said the rail line would close as early as this month if Texas failed to fund it. 
He was not available for comment Tuesday and Wednesday.
Gov. Kevin Stitt said he was disappointed Texas did not provide the funds.
“We’re not going to pick up their end of that,” Stitt said Wednesday. “And so we’re not sure exactly what’s going to happen with that connection.”
The Heartland Flyer, an Amtrak route between Oklahoma City and Fort Worth, is a jointly funded partnership between Texas and Oklahoma City. Oklahoma’s portion for 2025 was $4.5 million.
The Texas Department of Transportation’s budget for fiscal year 2025 included $2.81 million for the Heartland Flyer, said Laura Butterbrodt, a spokeswoman. She referred additional questions to Texas lawmakers.
Oklahoma lawmakers last month passed Senate Concurrent Resolution 10 urging Texas legislators to continue funding the service.
The service was reestablished in 1999 after ending in 1979. 
“The Oklahoma State Legislature acknowledges the importance of the continued existence of passenger rail in Oklahoma, and understands that once removed, it would be extraordinarily challenging to restore this service and continue to provide an additional option for Oklahomans,” the SRJ said.
Nearly 82,000 rode it last year.
Officials were considering expanding it into Kansas allowing travelers to connect to other major routes.
“Kansas recently provided dedicated funding and authority for KDOT (Kansas Department of Transportation) to support passenger rail for the Heartland Flyer extension,” said Philip Harris, a spokesman. “If the project were to stall in the study phase, evaluating the future use of those funds could be needed.”
If the project continues, its targeted operational date is 2029, he said.
Amtrak did not respond to a request for comment.

,California,2025-06-04 21:32:58+00:00,CalMatters,Were cuts in rooftop solar payments legal? California Supreme Court hears arguments,Malena Carollo,,,,,https://calmatters.org/economy/2025/06/solar-net-metering-at-state-supreme-court/,"Environmental groups want to revive higher payments to panel owners. But the subsidies were unfair to non-solar ratepayers, regulators say.","In summary
Environmental groups want to revive higher payments to panel owners. But the subsidies were unfair to non-solar ratepayers, regulators say.


The California Supreme Court heard arguments today in a case that could be pivotal to the spread of rooftop solar panels in California.
Environmental and consumer advocacy groups are seeking to reverse a 2022 decision by state regulators to slash by around 75% the rates paid to compensate customers with solar installations for the excess energy they generate. The move, intended to shield non-solar customers from unfair cost burdens, sent solar hookups plummeting.
Three environmental groups bringing the case — the Center for Biological Diversity, The Protect our Communities Foundation, and the Environmental Working Group — argue that the California Public Utilities Commission didn’t properly consider benefits to customers and disadvantaged communities when it changed the program. The commission argued the policy strikes a balance between affordability for all customers and encouraging renewable energy choices.
The court’s decision is expected within about a month.
At the hearing, a representative of the three groups, Malinda Dickenson, said the commission “excludes reliability and resiliency benefits” in its decision, including  “millions of customer generation facilities providing power on hot summer days and preventing blackouts.”  
The compensation program, known as “net energy metering,” was meant to incentivize renewable energy in the state by offsetting the significant cost to install solar panels onto the roofs of homes. Under the program, solar customers served by the state’s three large investor-owned utilities — Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern California Edison, and San Diego Gas & Electric — sell back energy they do not use, saving the utility from having to purchase that power elsewhere.   
At issue is how much these customers are paid for this excess energy. Prior versions of the program – “NEM 1.0” and “NEM 2.0” – allowed customers to receive the retail rate for the excess energy, which is the price the electric companies charge other customers when they go on to sell it. The current program, “NEM 3.0,” instead gives customers the “avoided cost,” which is how much the utility saved by not buying that energy somewhere else. 
The program was changed after utilities argued to regulators that it created a “cost shift,” causing customers without solar to pay an unfair share of maintenance costs for the electrical system. The utility commission’s decision to change the program currently only applies to customers who installed solar panels after mid-April 2023; customers who were connected under the two prior iterations will continue to receive the retail rate for the length of their 20-year contract. 
The change caused an uproar from the rooftop solar industry, ratepayers, and renewable energy groups. The groups bringing the lawsuit initially asked the utility commission to rehear the issue and were denied. A state appeals court then sided with the utilities commission, before the groups brought the case to the high court.
During court arguments, the environmental groups played down the concept of shifting costs, calling it a “red herring.” 
But the utility commission argued that the cost shift is real. And while the state statute enabling the net metering program requires a cost-benefit analysis, a specific methodology to do so isn’t laid out.
State data showed 82% fewer solar customers requesting connections in 2023 than the year prior.
“The commission made a factual finding in its proceedings that the former [net metering] system was unsustainable because of the burden that it was placing on customers without solar,” said attorney Mica Moore, who represented the utilities commission. “It’s hard to see what the commission could have done to address that issue if it had been required to compensate homeowners for every quantifiable benefit for solar.”
The current program has had a meaningful effect on the state’s rooftop solar sector. Industry groups anticipated about 17,000 job losses the first year. State data showed 82% fewer solar customers requesting connections in 2023 than the year prior. And recent industry reports show new rooftop solar installations have gone down by as much as 45% since April 2023. 
The decline in solar panel installations may make it harder for the state to achieve its mandated goal of using 100% carbon-free energy by 2045; solar is expected to account for more than half of that. 
In the background is another potential sea change for the program. The California Assembly this week passed a bill seeking to change existing contracts for solar customers in a way that would reduce the number of customers receiving old, higher rates for their surplus solar power. Under the current program, when customers install solar panels and participate in net metering, they are guaranteed the rate they sign up under (the so-called “avoided cost rate”) for about 20 years. Should the solar user sell their home, the new owner would continue to receive the rate the previous homeowner signed up for.
If passed in its current form, the bill would stop this, preventing anyone who buys a home that’s already part of the net metering program from keeping an older rate. This is meant to help control costs, according to the text of the bill, but advocates say the move will harm ratepayers.
“If lawmakers are serious about controlling energy costs, they should address the real problem: runaway utility spending,” Brad Heavner, executive director of the California Solar & Storage Association, said in a statement. “Instead they seem more interested in protecting utility profits and blaming solar users.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/072822_SolarPanels_LV_CM_024.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-04 18:11:20.722946

They sued over the funding freeze the next day.
“They were not hiding the ball,” Ellison said in a wide-ranging interview with States Newsroom in Minneapolis Wednesday.
Ellison and his colleagues have engaged in more than two dozen lawsuits against Trump administration actions in the first five months of the president’s second term. The AGs have sued over cuts to federal agencies, tariffs, DOGE’s access to government data, attempts to end birthright citizenship, and more.
They’ve also toured blue states to tout their accomplishments and listen to voters’ concerns.
The stakes are high, Ellison said: the fate of multi-racial democracy.
Ellison, who served for a dozen years in Congress representing Minnesota’s Minneapolis-based 5th District, said the states are a sovereign bulwark against federal power grabs.
The Democratic attorneys general are not only fighting a Republican-controlled executive branch, but also a conservative majority on the U.S Supreme Court. In Ellison’s view, recent decisions by the Roberts court — particularly in 303 Creative v. Elenis, in which the court ruled that a business owner could not be obligated to serve a gay couple — signify that the country is moving towards legal segregation.
“We are a whisper away from Jim Crow,” Ellison said.
Still, Ellison was upbeat, celebrating the AGs string of victories and predicting that even conservative Supreme Court justices will resist the Trump administration’s attack on the rule of law and the institution of the court itself.
The Democratic AGs may benefit from a weakened Department of Justice under Trump, Ellison said. The agency that defends the federal government in court is hemorrhaging longtime staff attorneys, through both firings and resignations.
Ellison emphasized that many of the policies enacted by Trump in his first months in office would be legal if they were passed by Congress. Instead, the president is running the country through “edict” and “proclamation,” Ellison said.
“Our democracy is not perfect,” Ellison said, “but you will absolutely miss it when it’s gone, and Trump has given you a glimpse of that.”

(Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)Epic Charter Schools, one of Oklahoma’s largest school districts, announced mass layoffs Tuesday, resulting in 357 job losses.


In a move the district called in a statement, “significant streamlining measures,” Epic has not renewed contracts for 83 teachers and 274 administrators for the next school year. That accounts for about 6% of teachers and more than one-third of administrators.
It will also close its in-person learning centers in Tulsa and Oklahoma City and discontinue breakfast and lunch services.
Epic Superintendent Bart Banfield said in a statement the school was committed to “supporting those impacted with compassion and transparency.”
“We are grateful to every member of the Epic team for the passion and care they bring to our community,” Banfield said. “This transition is about preserving and strengthening our ability to serve students for years to come.”
In an email obtained by StateImpact, staff were told by Epic they would lose access to Epic systems and facilities “shortly,” and benefits, including healthcare, which will terminate at the end of the month. Staff are also required to return all Epic property before June 9.
In another staff email obtained by StateImpact, Epic said it would discontinue its Chinese and Latin course offerings and outsource and charge students $275 for German and French courses unless they have completed German I or French I during the previous school year.
Epic also announced in the email students will no longer have access to one free concurrent college course. Going forward, students must purchase all courses through the Learning Fund, which is a $1,000 allocation Epic provides for each student.
English language arts (ELA) and math are also affected. Epic’s ELA+ will be discontinued, and Math+ will only be offered to students in grades 6-12 rather than 3-12. The courses provide live, virtual instruction to students two to three times a week.
AP courses will also now be outsourced, and students’ Learning Fund will be charged $100 for “specialty” courses.
The move follows cuts in October of nearly 150 Epic employees. At the time, Epic said it had overestimated the number of students who would enroll by about 4,000.

Phil Murphy have capped out their matching primary funds, receiving $5.5 million each.","Four of the candidates hoping to succeed a term-limited Gov.

With less than a week left before the June 10 gubernatorial primaries, the New Jersey Election Law Enforcement Commission has disbursed nearly $37.5 million in public matching dollars to eight of the 11 candidates, the agency said Wednesday.


Four of those hoping to succeed Gov. Phil Murphy — Democrats Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop, Rep. Josh Gottheimer, and Rep. Mikie Sherrill, plus Republican former Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli — have capped out their matching primary funds, receiving $5.5 million each.


Democrats Newark Mayor Ras Baraka and ex-state Sen. Steve Sweeney and Republicans Sen. Jon Bramnick and former radio host Bill Spadea have not raised enough to receive the maximum amount of matching primary funds, according to the election law commission.


Of those four, Sweeney has received the most public dollars, just under $5.3 million. Baraka’s matching funds total $4.2 million. Bramnick, the only sitting legislator in the race, has received about $3.2 million from the program, while Spadea has gotten roughly $2.8 million.


The gubernatorial public finance program offers candidates who meet fundraising and spending thresholds matching public dollars at a rate of 2-to-1 for every dollar candidates raise. In exchange, gubernatorial hopefuls agree to participate in debates hosted by the election law commission and observe spending limits.


This year, candidates who participate in the program can spend no more than $8.7 million on primaries and up to $18.5 million for the general election.
The amount of matching funds already disbursed this year exceeds all primary spending in 2017, New Jersey’s last gubernatorial election with no incumbent seeking reelection.
Then, all candidates across major and minor parties spent just under $34.5 million. Most of that spending came from Murphy, who did not participate in the public financing program during the 2017 primary and spent $22 million, including more than $16 million he loaned to his campaign.


Murphy, who participated in the gubernatorial fund match in 2017’s general election and through the entire 2021 cycle, is barred from seeking a third consecutive term.


Three candidates did not qualify for matching funds. Teachers union president Sean Spiller was the only Democrat who did not raise and spend the $580,000 needed to qualify by the March 24 deadline. Spiller’s candidacy is getting a major boost from an independent expenditure group with ties to his union that has spent $37.5 million so far urging voters to support Spiller in the primary.


On the Republican side, former Englewood Cliffs Mayor Mario Kranjac and contractor Justin Barbera did not qualify for matching funds.

(Photo by Jake Goldstein-Street/Washington State Standard)SEATTLE — Federal appeals court judges in Seattle on Wednesday questioned a Trump administration lawyer and Washington’s solicitor general over the president’s executive order restricting birthright citizenship.
The three-judge panel in the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals appeared more open to the Trump administration’s arguments than a federal judge in Seattle who in January called the order “blatantly unconstitutional.” 
Perhaps the most pointed question came after a lengthy back-and-forth over what the writers of the 14th Amendment meant when they enshrined birthright citizenship into the U.S. Constitution. 
Hawkins asked Department of Justice attorney Eric McArthur, who clerked for conservative U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, what the late Justice Antonin Scalia would think of his arguments. Scalia, an ardent originalist, anchored the Supreme Court’s conservative wing alongside Thomas.
“He was widely critical of looking at congressional history and statements of senators opposing or supporting a particular thing, and famously said ‘just the words,’” said Hawkins, a Clinton appointee. 
McArthur said he thought Scalia would have been “very open to looking at all of the historic evidence.”
After McCarthur’s arguments, Hawkins told the Justice Department attorney he did a “terrific job.”
Trump’s executive action, signed on the first day of his second term, aims to end birthright citizenship for babies born to a mother and father who are not U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents. Since the aftermath of the Civil War, the country has automatically given citizenship to babies born on U.S. soil, no matter their immigration status.
Wednesday was the first time the merits of Trump’s order have come before a federal appeals court.
The arguments from Washington’s solicitor general, the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project and McArthur come a few weeks after the U.S. Supreme Court took up Washington’s case on birthright citizenship and others. 
The justices focused on whether preliminary injunctions, like the one from Judge John Coughenor in Seattle at the center of Wednesday’s hearing, should affect only the parties involved in a particular case or can be applied nationwide. The Trump administration contends such orders are judicial overreach.
The Supreme Court’s ruling-to-come could have implications far beyond the birthright citizenship case, potentially staunching the flow of temporary nationwide blocks that state attorneys general are relying on to stop what they see as the president’s unlawful actions.
In their May 15 hearing, the justices appeared wary of allowing different rules by state.
On Wednesday, state Solicitor General Noah Purcell called Trump’s executive order on birthright citizenship “unconstitutional and unAmerican.” 
“President Trump seeks to turn citizenship into a political football, denying that precious right to hundreds of thousands of babies born in this country simply because their parents are here to work, to study or to escape persecution or violence,” said Purcell, who argued successfully against the president’s travel ban in court in 2017.
As is customary, the 9th Circuit judges didn’t rule from the bench Wednesday. They’ll issue a written ruling in the coming weeks or months. Both sides told the judges it may be prudent to first wait for the Supreme Court to weigh in on the nationwide injunction question.
Former President Bill Clinton, a Democrat, appointed two of the three judges who oversaw Wednesday’s hearing. The other is a Trump appointee from the president’s first term.
Several other cases are currently awaiting similar appellate hearings after lower courts awarded preliminary injunctions. The Supreme Court will likely have the final say on the merits of Trump’s order.
Speaking to reporters after the Wednesday morning hearing, Washington Attorney General Nick Brown said “the judges had a lot of pointed and difficult questions for both sides to grapple with.” 
Still, he said he is “really confident moving forward that this court, and ultimately the Supreme Court, will rule in the states’ favors.”
Longstanding precedent
The 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution codified birthright citizenship in 1868.
The amendment begins: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.”
Trump’s order, initially set to take effect Feb. 19, focused on the “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” phrase.
“The Fourteenth Amendment has never been interpreted to extend citizenship universally to everyone born within the United States,” Trump’s executive order reads. “The Fourteenth Amendment has always excluded from birthright citizenship persons who were born in the United States but not ‘subject to the jurisdiction thereof.’”
Legal precedent, including an 1898 U.S. Supreme Court ruling, has long upheld birthright citizenship. That case dealt with a man born in San Francisco to Chinese parents named Wong King Ark. The justices ruled he was a U.S. citizen.
The two sides interpret this case differently. Much of Wednesday’s arguments centered the Wong Kim Ark decision.
McArthur noted the Supreme Court ruled “every citizen or subject of another country, while domiciled here, is within the allegiance and the protection, and consequently subject to the jurisdiction, of the United States.” He focuses on the word “domiciled,” arguing those here temporarily or without legal status don’t fall under that umbrella.
Matt Adams, legal director of the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, countered by reading further from the Supreme Court decision. 
“His allegiance to the United States is direct and immediate, and, although but local and temporary, continuing only so long as he remains within our territory,” the justices continued in their Wong Kim Ark ruling, arguing that he is “as much a citizen as the natural-born child of a citizen.”
Washington’s case against Trump’s birthright citizenship order, filed alongside Oregon, Arizona and Illinois, led to the second Trump administration’s first judicial rebuke. 
The Reagan-appointed judge, Coughenour, later agreed to indefinitely block Trump’s order while the case played out in court. Trump’s Department of Justice appealed, leading to Wednesday’s hearing.
Two pregnant noncitizen women joined the states’ litigation, fearful their children could be born stateless. One has since given birth to a baby born a U.S. citizen because of court action, said Matt Adams, legal director of the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project.
In 2022, about 153,000 babies across the country were born to two parents without legal immigration status, including 4,000 in Washington, according to the plaintiffs. The states have said they stand to lose federal funding through programs like Medicaid that otherwise could help these children if they were citizens.
Purcell told the judges that implementing the Trump administration’s vision would be difficult, leaving hospitals to ask about immigration status and how long parents plan to remain in the United States.
“Doesn’t that just show the injunction is premature?” asked Judge Patrick Bumatay, a Trump appointee. “We don’t know how unworkable it is because they were not given a chance to implement it.”

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)A South Dakota bond authority has backed a plan to issue up to $1 billion in bonds — the largest financing package in the authority’s history — for Sanford Health to support its recent merger with Marshfield Clinic Health System of Wisconsin.
The South Dakota Health and Educational Facilities Authority voted unanimously Wednesday to authorize the bond package, allowing Sanford to refinance existing debt, pay for previously completed projects, and complete construction at hospitals and clinics in South Dakota, North Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Wyoming.
The authority is governed by a seven-member board appointed by the governor. The state created the authority in 1972 to issue tax-exempt bonds that help nonprofit hospitals and public universities borrow money at lower cost. Investors buy the bonds and earn interest as the borrower pays back the debt. The aim is to give South Dakota residents greater access to education and health care.
The tax-exempt status means those investors don’t have to pay taxes on the interest their bonds earn. That makes the bonds more attractive, in this instance helping Sanford borrow the money at a lower interest rate than they’d get from a bank.
Many of Sanford’s bond-funded projects are outside South Dakota, but the board is allowed to approve multi-state financing if part of the funding is used in-state, explained Dustin Christopherson. He is the assistant director of the authority and responded to South Dakota Searchlight’s questions via email.
Christopherson said the bond approval does not involve public tax dollars, and the state has no financial responsibility for repaying the debt. The authority does not lend the state’s credit to borrowers. Instead, it acts as a conduit, allowing Sanford to access the lower, tax-exempt interest rates.
Sanford officials plan to return to the board later with a request for up to $2.1 billion in longer-term financing that would replace the initial bonds and potentially cover more projects.

The ruling reversed a lower court’s decision, with justices reasoning that towns and cities in Vermont can regulate both cannabis cultivation and farming practices by enforcing local zoning laws.

Struthers’ ducks and his cannabis growing operation have been the subject of controversy in his neighborhood. Photo by Charlotte Oliver/Community News ServiceFor years Jason Struthers has made a living growing vegetables, raising ducks and cultivating cannabis in his Essex Junction backyard, but not without controversy. Neighbors argued first to the city, then later in court, that his half-acre farm has no place in their residential neighborhood — and the Vermont Supreme Court recently ruled in agreement. The May 30 ruling reversed a lower court’s decision, with justices reasoning that towns and cities in Vermont can regulate both cannabis cultivation and farming practices by enforcing local zoning laws. It’s the latest development in a long controversy over state versus local authority, and a win for Stephen and Sharon Wille Padnos, who live next door to Struthers and have advocated against Struthers’ farm. “I will say we had a good weekend,” said Stephen Wille Padnos. He and his wife are celebrating the hard fought win and hoping the next legal processes aren’t drawn out, he said. Meanwhile, Struthers is “absolutely gobsmacked” and confused, he said. The attitude expressed in the ruling disrupts a tradition of supporting agriculture in Vermont, Struthers said. And he’s talking to his lawyers about ways to fight the decision every way he can, he said. Struthers has a state license to grow cannabis on his property and is recognized by the Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets as a farm for his duck-raising and vegetable farming. But neighbors take issue with the smell of his plants and the sound of his ducks in their suburban neighborhood. The Wille Padnoses reason that he shouldn’t be able to run a farm or cultivate cannabis on their quiet cul-de-sac because they live within the city’s residential zone and within 500 feet of Essex High School property. In turn, Struthers argues that he’s exempt from the city’s regulations because he’s protected by state agriculture and cannabis laws. Some of Struthers’ ducks mingle in his Essex Junction backyard in fall 2023. File photo by Charlotte Oliver/Community News ServiceLegally, his farming practices and cannabis cultivation are two separate matters. But Struthers uses manure from his ducks to fertilize his cannabis plants. He sees any regulation of his ducks as de-facto regulation of his cultivation, he said. And many have tried to make sense of the legal ambiguities. Back in September 2023, the Essex Junction Developmental Review Board ruled that Struthers’ duck raising violated local zoning laws, while stating the city had little power to regulate or zone his cannabis cultivation. The decision raised frustration from both sides. Struthers appealed, arguing the city was out of line by trying to regulate his farming, according to court documents. The Wille Padnoses also appealed, but for the opposite reason. They argued the city wasn’t doing enough to regulate Struthers’ cannabis. READ MORE
At the next level of appeal, Thomas Walsh, a judge in the Environmental Division of Vermont Superior Court, ruled in Struthers’ favor on both matters in August. He said the regulation of farming and cultivation was out of the city’s hands. Then, last week the state Supreme Court reversed the judgment of the environmental court. In their ruling, justices wrote that the “landowner’s cannabis-cultivation operation is not exempt from all municipal regulation simply because he is a licensed outdoor cannabis cultivator.” In the same ruling, justices also said state law “does not prohibit all municipal regulation of farming.” Next, the case will be passed back down to the lower court, and Walsh can rule on the case again — this time bearing in mind the interpretation of the Supreme Court. After the ruling, city officials will decide what action they could take. “We will be carefully considering next steps to ensure we are consistent with this decision; this will likely include coordination with other regulatory authorities,” Regina Mahony, the city manager of Essex Junction, said in an email to VTDigger. Read the story on VTDigger here:  State Supreme Court rules against Essex Junction cannabis and ducks farmer.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Jason-Struthers-EJ-1024x681.png,,,2025-06-04 18:11:20.722946

Jim Pillen’s signature Wednesday was the final hurdle to legally requiring that all student-athletes competing in public K-12 or college sports this fall must do so on the team that matches their sex at birth.
Pillen’s approval of Legislative Bill 89, the “Stand With Women Act” from State Sen. Kathleen Kauth of the Millard area, allows it to take effect Sept. 3. That’s three months after the Legislature adjourned Monday.

Jim Pillen presents a ceremoniously signed “Stand With Women Act,” which requires student-athletes wishing to play in competitive sports in Nebraska to play on teams matching their sex at birth, to Riley Gaines, a former University of Kentucky swimmer, that is based on a model policy pushed by an organization connected to Gaines. June 4, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Kauth, who joined Pillen for the bill signing, said schools and colleges have been anticipating the legislation. She hopes it won’t take that long for them to comply.
“The work is not done. We’re going to continue,” Kauth said at the Wednesday signing ceremony.
Kauth confirmed that she would try again in the 2026 legislative session to set similar sex-based legal restrictions on school bathrooms and locker rooms, which LB 89 originally sought.
State Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston, one of the 33 Republicans to support LB 89, did so only after those provisions were taken out. 
He had said he did not want to be part of the “Nebraska State Potty Patrol.” Riepe previously said LB 89 took care of locker rooms indirectly and that he was against turning the Legislature into a “vehicle for fear, overreach and culture war crusades.”
“LB 89, as amended, respects that line,” Riepe said during the bill’s May 14 debate. “It focuses on competition, not surveillance. It protects sports, not panic.”
Kauth said she would continue working with Riepe on future legislation.
‘Fair playing ground’
Pillen, a defensive back for the Cornhuskers from 1975 to 1978, said sports are “Life 101,” helping someone learn to get up after getting knocked down, “dust ourselves off and keep going harder the next day.” Pillen said he remembers life before the landmark federal Title IX protections passed in 1972 and embraced women’s sports. He said LB 89 is a “fair playing ground.”

As he told the Nebraska Examiner in April, Pillen said Wednesday that he’s confident bathrooms will be addressed “in the meantime” before Kauth tries again in 2026.
“I have confidence that most of the young boys and men in Nebraska know right and wrong, and they’ll take care of whoever tries to go in the locker room or restroom [they’re not supposed to], because it is silly that we should be having these conversations,” Pillen said.
Asked by reporters what he meant, Pillen said it was “common sense” that men and boys don’t go into female restrooms or locker rooms. He declined to explain what he envisioned but said he was not suggesting violence.
“Never had a thought of promoting violence to any human being ever,” Pillen told reporters.
  State Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha speaks on the floor of the Legislature. May 19, 2023. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner).
State Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha, who led opposition to LB 89, said last week that such a position is calling for “outright physical violence” against transgender youth.
“If I said in the news that I’m going to ‘take care of’ the governor for doing something I don’t like, what do you think would happen? Would I get a visit?” Hunt posted on X, formerly Twitter.
Hunt during debate said the law signaled a willingness to “prioritize political theater over actual governance, that we are willing to criminalize difference, that we will twist Title IX, which was meant to expand opportunity for everybody, into a tool of exclusion.”
New law requirements
Under the “Stand With Women Act,” “sex” will be defined in state law as whether someone “naturally has, had, will or would have, but for a congenital anomaly or intentional or unintentional disruption, the reproductive system that at some point produces, transports and utilizes” either eggs (female, woman or girl) or sperm (male, man or boy) for fertilization.
Public school competitive sports would be restricted to students’ sex at birth, for males or females only, unless the sport is coed/mixed. Exceptions will be made for sports with no female equivalent team, such as football.

Private schools would need to adopt a similar policy if student-athletes compete against public institutions.
A student-athlete would need to verify sex at birth with a doctor’s note before participating in single-sex sports. Kauth said she envisions such verification coming during a student’s physical exam, while opponents such as Hunt say it normalizes questioning someone’s appearance.
All 245 public school districts in the state, as well as community colleges, state colleges and the University of Nebraska, would need to adopt a policy complying with the new law. Enforcement of the new law would be left up to each school district. Pillen said there would be consequences if schools choose not to comply.
Following other states
Riley Gaines, a former University of Kentucky swimmer who pushed for similar laws in many states, joined the bill signing and thanked Pillen for his stewardship and Kauth for being relentless. Kauth first proposed the bill in 2023, when Pillen took office.
In August 2023, Gaines spoke to Nebraskans and urged support for Kauth’s legislation, calling it “spiritual warfare.”

Just three days after Gaines’ speech, Pillen signed a “Woman’s Bill of Rights” administratively defining “male” and “female” for state agencies. The executive order remains in effect until a law addressing private female spaces, such as the original LB 89, is passed.
“I don’t think there’s, truthfully, a more worthy cause than to be here in Lincoln today with you guys, watching as Nebraska becomes the 28th state to protect women’s sports,” Gaines said. “Congratulations to Nebraskans across the state, to women across the state.”
‘Trying to defend reality’
Also speaking Wednesday was former high school student-athlete Payton McNabb of North Carolina. She said she planned to play collegiately until a severe injury in her senior year, when a volleyball spiked by an opposing player who was trans hit McNabb’s face.

Gaines, in her previous Nebraska visit, spoke about the need for locker room protections after she saw male genitalia in a women’s locker room. McNabb said she was accused of sexual harassment by a man in a college women’s bathroom but was cleared of wrongdoing in January.
“Unfortunately, I’ve experienced this gender ideology push in more than one way, and it’s just not fair,” McNabb said. “No other girl should ever go through that.”
Local college athletes Jordy Bahl (Huskers softball) and Rebekah Allick (Huskers volleyball) also joined the signing. They were present when Kauth introduced the bill in January, which they said wasn’t about politics.
“We’re trying to defend reality, which is such a crazy fight that we have to fight, and though the opposition may not see it now, I think somewhere deep in their soul, they know,” Allick said, adding that later on, opponents will see the legislation was “in their best interest.”

A lead Nebraska opponent, executive director Abbi Swatsworth of the nonprofit OutNebraska, said she was disappointed Wednesday by the LB 89 signing. Swatsworth noted it comes as many families are celebrating Pride and “grappling with the reality of this harmful legislation.”
“Despite this harmful legislation, we stand together stronger this Pride. To the youth and their families who are struggling: We are with you. We will continue fighting this fight because you belong — yesterday, today and always,” Swatsworth said in a statement. “Trans people are brilliant, beautiful and resilient, and they belong here in our state.”
OutNebraska also shared support hotline numbers for the Trevor Project (1-866-488-7386), National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (988) and Trans Lifeline (877-565-8860).

Dan McKee has tapped two out-of-state political staffers to work for his 2026 reelection campaign. (Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)Fresh off new, unfavorable polling numbers on his job performance, Gov. Dan McKee has tapped out-of-state talent to aid in his 2026 reelection campaign, including a former staffer to New York Gov. Kathy Hochul.
Rob Silverstein, who most recently served as Hochul’s policy director, and before that, as her deputy campaign manager, will now manage McKee’s 2026 campaign. Neil Spencer will serve as his campaign finance director, following eight years with the Florida House Democratic Campaign Committee.
“I’m excited to have a strong team of talented operatives to run my re-election campaign,” McKee said in a statement. “Nobody will outwork us on the trail, and Rob and Neil embody that ethos. With their experiences on highly competitive races and excellent track records of success in state campaigns, I am confident that we are well-positioned to continue delivering results for Rhode Island for years to come.”
The sitting governor is the only candidate to confirm their intent to run in the 2026 gubernatorial race, with a two-minute spot released on March 3. His 2022 Democratic primary rival, Helena Buonanno Foulkes, appears to be readying for a comeback challenge against McKee, having already begun growing her campaign war chest.
Other rumored, but unconfirmed candidates include House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi and 2022 Republican gubernatorial candidate Ashley Kalus, who bought a home in Providence this year, WPRI-TV 12 reported. 
McKee’s new campaign hires were announced Monday, four days after a University of New Hampshire poll in which McKee scored a 19% approval rating among a survey of 653 Rhode Island residents. The dismal view of his job performance was accompanied by weak support for his reelection bid; just 11% of those surveyed thought the four-year incumbent deserved to win the 2026 race, compared with 74% who thought he did not deserve to win re-election.
Even among his own party, fewer than one in five survey respondents supported McKee’s reelection campaign, according to the UNH poll. Meanwhile, 39% of Democrats surveyed expressed support for Foulkes to run, while 32% backed former Gov. Gina Raimondo, who left during her second term as governor to become U.S. Commerce Secretary. 
Since leaving the federal administration in January, Raimondo has joined the Council on Foreign Relations in D.C. as a distinguished fellow and co-chair of a task force on economic security. She also expressed interest in a 2028 presidential run during an interview with David Axelrod in Chicago in April. 
Silverstein declined to comment on the UNH poll results in a brief interview Wednesday, referring to the governor’s previous comments to other news outlets in which he shrugged off the survey as an “outlying poll.”
A New York native, Silverstein has nearly a decade of political experience in campaigns in local, state and federal races across the country. He earned high marks from Hochul for his work on her campaign and in elected office over the past four years.
“Rob Silverstein has been a key member of our team, bringing sharp political instincts, tireless commitment, and a deep understanding of what it takes to win tough races,” Hochul said in a statement. “Rob has been instrumental in building a stronger Democratic Party in New York and played a critical role in our success flipping key House seats last year. Governor McKee is gaining a skilled and strategic leader, and I’m proud to call Rob a trusted former member of my team.”
Like McKee, Hochul was thrust into the top state leadership role from lieutenant governor in 2021. Her ascension to the governor seat was prompted by the unexpected resignation of Andrew Cuomo.
Silverstein has a bachelor’s degree from Georgetown University and a master’s degree in public administration from Columbia University.
Spencer comes to Rhode Island from his native Florida, where he attended Florida State University for his bachelor’s degree and a master’s in the university’s Applied American Politics and Policy program. During his eight years working for Florida House Democrats, he set multiple fundraising records, including $5 million raised in 2022 and more than $9 million raised in 2024.
“The institutional knowledge Neil built up with the Florida House Democratic Campaign Committee allowed us to build momentum and set new fundraising records cycle after cycle, and Neil’s strategic vision and dedication have made him one of the most successful finance directors in Florida legislative politics,” Florida House Democratic Leader Fentrice Driskell said in a statement.

André Carson speaks at a rally on Oct. 26, 2024, in Indianapolis. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)A Wednesday letter from Democrat U.S. Rep. André Carson to the federal Department of Homeland Security seeks answers about the possible use of Camp Atterbury in Indiana as an immigration detention facility.
The letter follows recent Indiana Capital Chronicle reporting that federal officials may be eyeing the southern Indiana base as a temporary site for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainees. The federally owned facility is licensed to and operated by the Indiana National Guard.
A DHS spokesperson last week declined to confirm any plans but acknowledged the agency is exploring “flexible options” to respond to capacity issues in its nationwide detention network.
In his letter to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, Carson said the prospect raises “serious questions” and flagged concerns about legal rights, humane treatment and national security. 
Feds could eye Indiana’s Camp Atterbury as potential site for ICE detainees amid capacity strain

“Camp Atterbury has historically served as a training base for the Indiana National Guard and has been a vital part of our state’s military infrastructure,” wrote Carson, who represents portions of Marion County. “The prospect of repurposing it for migrant detention raises significant issues that warrant thorough examination, including the negative impact this will have on our national security and military readiness.”
Carson’s letter comes as ICE detention has surged in recent months, approaching 50,000 people nationwide — far above the 41,500 beds funded by Congress — according to the latest federal numbers. 
That strain has reportedly prompted DHS to review underused military and federal facilities across the country, including Camp Atterbury, but no official decisions have been announced.
Carson, a senior member of the House Intelligence Committee, said he’s especially troubled by reports of due process violations at other ICE detention sites.
“As a senior Member of the House Intel Committee, I am always thinking about keeping our state and our country safe,” Carson said in a statement. “Not only does the prospect of using Camp Atterbury raise concerns that our military readiness will be reduced, it also is deeply concerning given numerous reports that detainees across the United States have been denied legal due process.”
Camp Atterbury has previously been used to house Afghan evacuees and Ukrainian refugees, but not immigration detainees held under enforcement authority.
Carson asked DHS to respond to seven specific questions about the potential use of Camp Atterbury by June 13, including what laws and funding would govern its use of the national guard site, and how military operations might be affected.
DHS had not responded publicly to the letter as of Wednesday evening.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-04 20:58:58+00:00,CT Mirror,"After years of frustrations, climate advocates give tepid praise to CT lawmakers",John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/04/ct-climate-change-bills/,"Though tepid, this year’s reviews were an improvement over advocates’ criticisms following the demise of similar efforts in past years.","For the last two years, environmental advocates in Connecticut have made no secret about their frustrations with lawmakers in Hartford over a lack of major progress on climate legislation.
So the passage of two priority bills over the final weeks of this year’s legislative session — one promising to set Connecticut on a path to reaching net-zero emissions by 2050, the other contemplating how to deal with the unavoidable aspects of climate change — was welcomed by advocates with a sigh of relief.
“Compared to recent sessions, it’s actual legislation that has passed,” said Christopher Phelps, the executive director of Environment Connecticut. “So that is forward progress.”
Christine Palm, a former state representative — and teacher — who championed many environmental bills during her tenure, graded her former colleagues C+ in their action on climate change this session. Since retiring from politics last year, Palm has founded The Active Voice, which is dedicated to training young environmental activists.
“We could do a whole lot better, way better, but it’s better than nothing,” Palm said Wednesday. “There were years when they did nothing…  I think what the history is, we do great bills about plants, animals, preservation of land, but addressing climate change, the big umbrella of climate change, very little has been done.”
While lukewarm, the reviews from advocates at the end of this year’s legislative session were an improvement over the criticisms heaped upon Democrats following the demise of past efforts to adopt stricter timelines for reducing carbon emissions, roll out electric vehicles or join with other states to purchase offshore wind power.
Several advocates specifically directed praise toward the new House chair of the Environment Committee, state Rep. John-Michael Parker, D-Madison, who took the lead in drafting several priority bills with his co-chair, state Sen. Rick Lopes, D-New Britain. 
“I think it speaks to the ability of our committee to stay true to our priorities and also work with Republicans and the senate,” Parker said. “We put some good plans in place, and everyone stuck to their word and followed through. I feel good about it.”
Net-Zero Emissions
The final victory for advocates came with just a few hours to spare before Wednesday’s  midnight deadline to pass legislation. At around 2 p.m., the Senate voted to pass House Bill 5004, the net-zero emissions legislation that also included a hodgepodge of incentives for solar canopies, energy-efficient heating and cooling systems, green jobs and sustainability-focused businesses.
The bill was a priority of House Democrats, who passed it out of the lower chamber on May 1 — only to watch in linger in the Senate for weeks. 
For supporters, the wait was reminiscent of what happened last year when a similar bill, led by Palm, stalled and ultimately died in the Senate on the final day of the legislative session. 
“It’s just really concerning, that the most pressing environmental issue that we face is, for the third year in a row, kind of at this level of uncertainty,” Sierra Club Connecticut Executive Director Samantha Dynowski said as she waited for senators to take up the bill Tuesday evening. 
Opponents had dubbed last year’s effort the “Green Monster.” But a series of compromises, and agreements to study the most controversial components and their effects on businesses, largely blunted criticism of the bill this year.
“Is it achievable? I question all of it, but in the end of the day, that’s not something that we would spend our time opposing,” said Chris Herb, the president of the Connecticut Energy Marketers Association.

Lopes called the bill “aspirational” due to its lack of any enforcement mechanisms for lowering emissions. 
“They are goals, they are not mandates,” Lopes said. “They are setting the tone and direction for the industry in the state of Connecticut, of where we want to be, where we want to go, and hopefully we hit them. If we don’t hit them, there are not penalties.”
Still, Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, raised concerns that the bill could open to door for the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection to impose regulations on the private sector if the state struggles to reach its net-zero target.
“I think these goals are important, and I think we should have these goals,” Harding said. “Where I get concerned is ambiguity in legislation. As a lawyer, lawyers make a living on ambiguity.”
One Republican, state Sen. Tony Hwang, R-Fairfield, broke with his party to vote in favor of the bill, calling it a “smaller and more incremental” compromise compared to last year’s effort. 
The Senate’s vote sent H.B. 5004 to Gov. Ned Lamont, who said he intends to sign it.
“Connecticut is proud to be a climate leader and this legislation helps keep our state on track to improve our air quality and meet our climate goals,” Lamont said in a statement. “Notably, it increases the tools available in our state that will attract business growth in the clean energy sector and the associated jobs that they support.”
Resiliency, and Pesticides
While the Senate waited to take action on H.B. 5004, House lawmakers gave final approval to a wide-ranging climate resiliency bill last week that also included provisions cracking down on the use of certain pesticides that can harm wildlife. 
The legislation, Senate Bill 9, was the upper chamber’s preeminent environmental measure for the 2025 legislative session. The majority of the bill, nearly 50 pages, focused on preparing for the impacts of climate change with updates to the state’s water plan, requiring towns to consider sea level rise when making zoning changes and mandating flood risk disclosures for home buyers and renters, among other provisions.
But it was two provisions near the end, restricting the use of rat poisons and a group of insecticides known as “neonicotinoids,” that attracted the most debate. 
In the Senate, those restrictions were eased somewhat to appease the concerns of the pest control industry, which sought to continue the use of covered pesticides by licensed professionals. As a result, a number of Republicans crossed the aisle to support the bill.

“I didn’t find any real big objection,” said state Rep. Pat Callahan, R-New Fairfield, the ranking member of the Environment Committee, during the House debate last month. 
But some Democrats in the House raised their own objections, arguing that restricting the use of rat poisons would make it costlier for homeowners to deal with infestations, especially if they are forced to hire licensed professionals. 
“If it’s that bad, no one should be using it,” said state Rep. Juan Candelaria, D-New Haven. 
Ultimately, the legislation passed the House by a relatively lopsided 115 to 33 vote. As of Wednesday, it was awaiting Gov. Ned Lamont’s signature.
Charles Rothenberger, a climate and energy attorney for Save the Sound, noted that S.B. 9 gained the support of more than two dozen Republicans in the House despite many having voted against previous climate-related measures.
“These initiatives should be bipartisan, because the impacts affect everybody, equally, across the political spectrum,” Rothenberger said. “So hopefully — maybe naively, but hopefully — what we saw last night, can provide a foundation for more cooperation on both sides of the aisle to address real solutions.”
With the passage of both bills through the House and Senate chambers on Wednesday afternoon, action began to flow in quick succession on a number of other measures dealing with agriculture, Sunday hunting and the management of Connecticut’s growing population of black bears.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025_0604_SR_SessionLastDay_049-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-04 17:10:49.354044

Steve Frisbie (R-Battle Creek) testifies before the House Energy Committee on June 3, 2025. | ScreenshotLocal control and energy choice issues were once again up for discussion in the Michigan Legislature this week as a Republican representative made his case on a proposal centered around natural gas-powered appliances.
The legislation came from Rep. Steve Frisbie (R-Battle Creek), who testified Tuesday before the House Energy Committee.
Frisbie’s House Bill 4486, he said, inspired by attempts to ban natural gas connections and appliances in new homes, pointing to a 2023 proposal in Ann Arbor urging city leaders to ban gas service in new housing builds with limited exceptions.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXIn response, House Bill 4486 would prevent municipalities from adopting or enforcing ordinances, policies or resolutions that ban the use of natural gas in their locality, or block the installation of natural gas infrastructure, voiding any ordinance that violates this law.
“This legislation is a reflection of personal freedoms,” Frisbie said. “Who are we to tell a family how they can keep their families warm following an ice storm.” 
However, old arguments stemming from Republican’s opposition to legislative Democrat’s 2023 energy law changes quickly bubbled to the surface, as Rep. Julie Brixie (D-Meridian Township) asked Frisbie whether he believed in local control.
More than a year and a half ago, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer put her pen to legislation aimed at expanding clean energy in Michigan, with one set of bills granting the state’s energy regulator the authority to approve permits for large-scale renewable energy and battery storage projects, which was previously exclusive to local governments.
Republicans viewed the change as an incursion, ripping zoning control away from Michigan communities to force wind and solar on localities who had opposed those resources.
Earlier this year, members of the Republican-led House voted on party lines to repeal the change, with Senate Republicans unveiling their own effort to eliminate the law in late May. However, neither proposal is likely to make it through the Democratic-led Senate.
While multiple Democratic members of the House Energy Committee pressed Frisbie on how his bill would impact infrastructure and interact with farmland preservation ordinances, Frisbie said the policy “has nothing to do with gas infrastructure.”
“It has to do with appliances and a choice of being able to use gas versus electric as a user,” Frisbie said. “It has nothing to do with infrastructure.”
Courtney Brady, the Midwest deputy director for Evergreen Action, which advocates for Climate Action in several states, called the scope and the motivation of the bill confusing, telling Michigan Advance “the fact that the bill is so open ended is concerning.”
Although there are incentives in the state to help Michiganders upgrade to energy-efficient electrical appliances, Brady said Michigan localities aren’t looking to ban natural gas, calling the bill a “false solution in search of a problem.”
“These are messaging attempts,” she said. “They’re distractions.”
Prior to the introduction of Frisbie’s legislation, Sen. Joe Bellino (R-Monroe) introduced a nearly identical policy in the Democratic-led Senate, Senate Bill 275.

(Photo credit: Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)Louisiana lawmakers overwhelmingly approved a set of dramatic changes to state ethics laws Wednesday that will make it much more difficult to charge elected officials and public employees with misconduct. 

House Bill 674 alters the process the state ethics board used to bring charges against Gov. Jeff Landry two years ago that are still pending.
Landry’s charges won’t be affected by the legislation, but he pushed for the bill and is expected to let it pass into law. The governor’s personal attorney, Stephen Gelé, helped craft the language contained in it.
Beyond making it harder to bring ethics charges, the legislation also loosens limits on elected officials’ and state employees’ state travel, weakens restrictions on government contracts with public servants and their families, and reduces requirements for elected officials and political candidates’ disclosure of financial interests.
The bill’s sponsor, Rep. Beau Beaullieu, R-New Iberia, said it is a reaction to the ethics board’s overzealous enforcement that has frustrated officials in both parties. The anger toward the board was reflected in lawmakers’ overwhelming support of the bill. 

The Louisiana Senate and House voted 34-2 and 92-1, respectively, for the ethics overhaul this week. 
Yet ethics board members expressed concerns about the bill during its May meeting. Its top staff member, Ethics Administrator David Bordelon, described it as “skewing” the ethics investigation process in favor of the person accused of wrongdoing. 
The state’s preeminent government watchdog group, the Public Affairs Research Council of Louisiana (PAR), also vociferously opposed the legislation.

“This is designed to make sure we don’t have ethics investigations,” PAR President Steven Procopio told lawmakers at a hearing last week.

(Ormat press photo)Three proposed geothermal projects in Nevada will be among the first fast-tracked under the Trump administration’s new streamlined environmental review process, the U.S. Department of the Interior announced last week.
Under the new process hailed by Interior Secretary Doug Burhum in April, environmental assessments for small-scale projects will be limited to just 14 days — a sharp contrast to the typical year or more. Full environmental impact statements for more complex projects, which usually take up to 2 years, will now be finalized in just 28 days.
During his first month in office President Donald Trump proclaimed an “energy emergency” as grounds for fast-tracking lengthy environmental reviews and permitting processes for energy projects deemed critical to national security.
Conservation groups have blasted what they see as a circumvention of bedrock environmental laws on the basis of Trump decreeing an “emergency.”
But Burgum, in a statement, said  “by cutting red tape and advancing President Trump’s American Energy Dominance agenda, we’re fast-tracking reliable energy projects while strengthening national security and supporting American workers.”
Environmental assessments for the three Nevada projects — all proposed by Ormat Nevada — will be completed within a 14 day timeframe, according to Interior’s May 29 statement.
Feds green-light uranium mine in Utah, first project approved under Trump’s energy declaration

Those projects include the Diamond Flat Geothermal Project near Fallon; the McGinness Hills Geothermal Optimization Project in Lander County; and the Pinto Geothermal Project along the Oregon-Nevada border.
Geothermal is one the few renewable energy sources the Trump administration is promoting as part of its “American Energy Dominance” plan.
U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright, the CEO of the oilfield services firm Liberty Energy, has called for expanding geothermal energy, citing its potential to enhance energy security and stabilize electricity prices.
During a House Appropriations Committee hearing last month, Wright told Nevada Rep. Susie Lee he is “bullish on the future of geothermal.”
“Permitting and a sober government is necessary to make that happen,” Wright said.
Under Wright’s leadership, Liberty Energy also invested millions in geothermal energy startup Fervo Energy. In 2023, Fervo Energy launched a geothermal pilot plant in Nevada in partnership with Google to power data centers.
Nevada generates is second only to California in geothermal electricity generation, , according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Nevada produces about 26% of total geothermal energy in the nation, and has the potential to grow.
Last month, the U.S. Geological Survey released a report that said geothermal energy in the Great Basin — which covers most of Nevada — could produce electricity equivalent to 10% of the current U.S. power supply.
Geothermal currently accounts for less than 1% of U.S. electricity generation, according to the EIA.
In the last five years, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has put up more than 700,000 acres of land in Nevada to lease for geothermal.
In a press release, USGS said commercial-scale geothermal development will largely depend on the “successful application of evolving and emerging technologies.”
Geothermal and sage grouse
Conservation groups argued the announcement is the latest effort by the Trump administration to target the National Environmental Policy Act, a bedrock environmental law that requires the federal government to conduct an indepth environmental review before moving forward with infrastructure projects.
“We support geothermal energy as a part of our clean energy mix, but like any projects on public lands these developments could cause environmental impacts,” said Patrick Donnelly, Great Basin director at the Center for Biological Diversity in a statement. “Projects like these need full and complete environmental reviews to ensure they don’t unduly harm endangered species or public lands resources.”
While geothermal is a more environmentally sound alternative to traditional power sources like coal and natural gas, there are still environmental risks that require careful review.
A recent study published in the journal Biological Conservation found that the presence of geothermal plants “adversely affected” greater sage-grouse populations within sagebrush ecosystems. The study found that the presence of geothermal infrastructure near sage-grouse breeding grounds decreased nest survival.
The study specifically reviewed the impact of Nevada’s McGinness Hills Geothermal Development, the largest geothermal complex in Nevada and the fourth largest in the United States.
The first McGinness Hills geothermal plant was established in July, 2012 and has been producing renewable power since.
Throughout its construction and expansion, the McGinness Hills Geothermal Development has attracted pushback due to its impact on sage-grouse.
In 2017, the Nevada Department of Wildlife wrote a letter to the BLM after the agency documented the downward trend of seven of eleven breeding sites near the McGinness Hills Geothermal Development.
In the letter the agency accused Ormat of failing to monitor and mitigate the impact of the power plant on sage-grouse habitat, as required under the project approval.
If the McGinness Hills Geothermal Optimization Project is approved under the new streamlined environmental review process, it would expand three geothermal power plants by adding new wells, heat exchangers, cooling fans, and a 15 megawatt solar photovoltaic field.
Other Ormat geothermal energy projects have faced controversy and pushback in Nevada.
In 2023, a planned geothermal project by Ormat was sent back to square one after federal land managers decided to reexamine the project’s approval following the listing of a small rare toad living in adjacent springs as endangered.
Another planned Ormat geothermal project near Gerlach, Nevada was thrown out by the Washoe County Board of County Commissioners in 2023 after locals fiercely opposed the project.

Ellison and his colleagues have engaged in more than two dozen lawsuits against Trump administration actions in the first five months of the president’s second term. The AGs, including Colorado’s Phil Weiser, have sued over cuts to federal agencies, tariffs, DOGE’s access to government data, attempts to end birthright citizenship, and more.
Here are the legal actions Colorado has taken against Trump administration

They’ve also toured blue states to tout their accomplishments and listen to voters’ concerns.
The stakes are high, Ellison said: the fate of multi-racial democracy.
Ellison, who served for a dozen years in Congress representing Minnesota’s Minneapolis-based 5th District, said the states are a sovereign bulwark against federal power grabs.
The Democratic attorneys general are not only fighting a Republican-controlled executive branch, but also a conservative majority on the U.S Supreme Court. In Ellison’s view, recent decisions by the Roberts court — particularly in 303 Creative v. Elenis, in which the court ruled that a Colorado business owner could not be obligated to serve a gay couple — signify that the country is moving towards legal segregation.
“We are a whisper away from Jim Crow,” Ellison said. He called the 303 Creative decision “Jim Crow for gay people.”
Still, Ellison was upbeat, celebrating the AGs string of victories and predicting that even conservative Supreme Court justices will resist the Trump administration’s attack on the rule of law and the institution of the court itself.
The Democratic AGs may benefit from a weakened Department of Justice under Trump, Ellison said. The agency that defends the federal government in court is hemorrhaging longtime staff attorneys, through both firings and resignations.
Ellison emphasized that many of the policies enacted by Trump in his first months in office would be legal if they were passed by Congress. Instead, the president is running the country through “edict” and “proclamation,” Ellison said.
“Our democracy is not perfect,” Ellison said, “but you will absolutely miss it when it’s gone, and Trump has given you a glimpse of that.”

(Photo by Dave Cummings/New Hampshire Bulletin)The New Hampshire Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that the House district maps created by the Republican-controlled state Legislature in 2020 are not illegal, despite allegations made by the cities of Dover and Rochester and a number of residents from throughout New Hampshire.
In 2022, Dover, Rochester, and 10 residents filed a lawsuit against the State of New Hampshire and Secretary of State David Scanlan alleging that the state’s maps violated the New Hampshire Constitution. They argued that the constitution requires Dover Ward 4, Rochester Ward 5, New Ipswich, Wilton, Hooksett, Lee, Barrington, and several other towns to have their own state House districts because their populations are large enough to warrant them. The maps currently in use do not give those wards and towns their own districts. They also alleged the map’s population configuration deviates more than 10%, which is a violation of the 14th Amendment’s one-person-one-vote requirement. They ask the court to forbid the state from using the maps and to ostensibly fix them. They provided a map they deemed to be more legal.
In 2024, a trial court in Strafford County ruled against Dover and Rochester, agreeing with the state and Scanlan that creating maps where every city, town, or ward with the necessary population had their own districts would be impossible to accomplish. It also ruled previous case law determined that presumptive violations of the one-person-one-vote requirement may be justified by efforts to make districts compact, respect municipal boundaries, preserve the cores of prior districts, and avoid contests between incumbent representatives. Citing a previous court decision, the court declared that “a legislatively enacted redistricting plan ‘is not unconstitutional simply because some ‘resourceful mind’ has come up with a better one.’”
Dover, Rochester, and the rest of the plaintiffs promptly appealed the ruling and the state Supreme Court considered the case. On Wednesday, the Supreme Court ruled that because they did not sufficiently show that the Legislature had “no rational or legitimate basis” to enact the map, they denied the appeal.
“We are pleased that the New Hampshire Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the state’s redistricting plan for the State House of Representatives,” Attorney General John Formella, who represented the state, said in a statement Wednesday. “Today’s decision reaffirms the Court’s prior precedent recognizing the Legislature’s broad discretion in the area of redistricting and recognizes that the Legislature must balance complex constitutional requirements when determining the most appropriate map. We are delighted that the Supreme Court affirmed the lower court’s finding that the Legislature acted within its constitutional authority, and I thank our litigation and appeals teams for their excellent work in achieving this important outcome.”
Jennifer Perez, Dover’s deputy city attorney wrote in an email to the Bulletin, “We are disappointed in the result but respect the Court’s determination.” Officials from Rochester did not immediately respond to the Bulletin’s requests for comment.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Supreme-Court1-1024x646.jpeg,,,2025-06-04 17:10:49.354044

New Mexico State Police officers responded to the Northeastern New Mexico Correctional Facility in Clayton at 2 a.m. on May 14, according to a spokesperson for the agency.
A spokesperson for the New Mexico Corrections Department confirmed that a person incarcerated at the prison died that morning; a State Police spokesperson identified the deceased as Eduardo Merino.
Corrections Department spokesperson Brittany Roembach told Source NM in an email that NENMCF Warden John Beaird informed Merino’s family about his death at 3:11 a.m. on May 14. Roembach said the department is investigating the death.
Source NM has filed a public records request with the Office of the Medical Investigator for any reports on Merino’s death.
Merino’s cause of death remains unknown. According to his obituary, he died “unexpectedly.” The Atrisco High School graduate and father of one was 31 years old.
Through a lawyer, Merino’s fiance Nicole Yazzie on May 16 filed a petition in Second Judicial District Court in Albuquerque, asking the court to appoint her as the representative of his estate “for the purpose of investigating and potentially prosecuting a wrongful-death suit.”
The court assigned the case to Judge Nancy Franchini. There have been no developments in the case since then, court records show.
A voicemail and an email seeking comment from the lawyer representing Yazzie, Carter Harrison, were not returned as of Wednesday.

The day-to-day functions of municipal government often don’t involve partisan policy decisions. But local elections can gauge voters’ moods before congressional midterms next year and the 2027 statewide election for governor. 
The election results as of Wednesday afternoon are not official because local election workers will still process mail-in absentee votes for five business days after the election and process affidavit ballots.
The unofficial and incomplete results of some Mississippi mayoral races on Tuesday:
Gulfport 
In one of the most hotly contested municipal elections this year, Republican Hugh Keating defeated Democrat Sonya Williams Barnes. 
Keating, an attorney, led Barnes, a former state representative, by roughly 1,110 votes in a race that saw relatively high turnout, according to the Sun Herald. The election drew several prominent national figures to the coastal town, such as U.S. Sen. Tim Scott and former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams. 
Toward the end of the campaign, the two campaigns accused the other of skirting election laws. Republicans alleged that a group close to the Barnes campaign was offering meal vouchers to people who voted by absentee ballot, but Barnes denied any affiliation with the organization. 
Democrats then cried foul when Rick Carter, a managing partner of Island View Casino, distributed a letter to his employees encouraging them to vote for Keating. 
For years, Democratic candidates have attempted to make inroads to break up the GOP’s hold on the Gulf Coast. Polling leading up to the election showed the two candidates were close 
Despite Barnes’ loss, Cheikh Taylor, chairman of the state Democratic Party, praised the former legislator for proving Democrats can be competitive in south Mississippi. 
Jackson 
Longtime state Sen. John Horhn easily won the election to lead Mississippi’s capital city by defeating the Republican nominee and several independent candidates. 
Horhn’s general election victory was widely expected after he defeated incumbent Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba in the Democratic primary in April. The primary has historically decided who will go on to win the general election. 
Vicksburg 
George Flaggs Jr., a former state legislator who’s served as Vicksburg’s mayor for more than a decade, appears to have been defeated by Democrat Willis Thompson.  
Flaggs, an independent, trailed his Democratic opponent by 61 votes, according to the Vicksburg Post. 
Vicksburg City Clerk Deborah Kaiser-Nickson told the Vicksburg Post that results will remain unofficial until 111 affidavits are counted, along with any mail-in votes. 
Brookhaven 
Incumbent Brookhaven Mayor Joe Cox, a Republican, appears to have lost a close race to Democratic challenger Larry Jointer in Tuesday’s election, with Jointer claiming victory by a margin of 37 votes, according to the Daily Leader. 
Jointer would be the city’s first Black mayor. 
Greenwood 
Incumbent Independent Mayor Carolyn McAdams lost to Democrat Kenderick Cox, who garnered around 53 percent of the vote, according to the Greenwood Commonwealth. 
Clarksdale 
State Rep. Orlando Paden won the mayor’s race and will replace outgoing two-term Mayor Chuck Espy, who did not run for re-election. Paden defeated two independent candidates.
Horn Lake 
Democrat Jimmy Stokes defeated his Republican opponent, Danny Klein. The current mayor, Allen Latimer, did not run for reelection.
According to the Commercial Appeal, just one seat on the city’s Board of Aldermen is currently held by a Democrat. 
Now the Democrats flipped the script. A Democrat will take office as the new mayor, and Republicans secured just two seats on the board of aldermen. 
Meridian 
Former Mayor Percy Bland, a Democrat, will return to City Hall in Meridian after losing his re-election bid four years ago. 
Bland won back the mayor’s seat Tuesday over Independent candidate Jimmy Copeland by less than 100 votes, according to the Meridian Star.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/03125012/Voting-Tuesday-4.jpg,,,2025-06-04 17:10:49.354044

(Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Gov. Henry McMaster nixed only $10,000 of the state’s $14.7 billion state spending plan for 2025-26, marking the smallest sum a governor’s struck from the budget in over a quarter century.
“It’s a good budget,” McMaster told reporters Wednesday. “It’s one of the best. That’s why I’ve only got a handful of vetoes.”
Only one of McMaster’s 11 vetoes involved actual dollars.
The rest struck clauses directing what agencies can — or must — do with their allocations. That includes one that would have required reservations to visit a new state park and another that would have allowed the state’s poorest school districts to contract with private security in place of school-based officers employed by the local sheriff of police department.
Most of the clauses McMaster vetoed were unnecessary or duplicative, he wrote in a letter to legislators explaining his decisions.
The $10,000 he nixed would have gone toward reviewing the efficiency of certain state agencies, which McMaster wrote replicated existing programs meant to oversee agencies.
In previous years, McMaster’s budget vetoes focused primarily on so-called earmarks — spending on local projects requested by legislators rather than the agencies the money’s funneled through. But the chambers’ chief budget writers announced a moratorium this year on earmarks.
With so little removed, it’s unlikely legislators will return before the budget goes into effect July 1 to override any of the vetoes.
Instead of detailing the reasons for his few vetoes, McMaster praised legislators for including so many of his priorities in their spending plan, including raises in the minimum pay for teachers, funding an officer in every public school, another year of frozen college tuition, and workforce training programs.
All told, about 80% of McMaster’s recommendations ended up in the budget, he said.
That doesn’t mean legislators copied his recommended amounts. For example, he proposed a $3,000 boost in teachers’ minimum pay. The Legislature approved half that.
But the Republican governor has certainly had greater success with his budget recommendations than his predecessors, largely because McMaster meets with GOP leaders as his proposal’s being created.
McMaster said lawmakers in the meetings remain open-minded and communicative.
“It works,” McMaster said. “Works every time.”
Earmarks
Legislative budget writers emphasized repeatedly that this year’s budget includes no funding for pet projects in legislators’ districts.
To be sure of that, McMaster plans to issue an executive order requiring state agencies that receive vaguely worded directions on how to spend money to seek specifics before doling it out, he said.
For years, legislators hid earmarks in vaguely worded chunks of the budget. They would then direct state agencies to send the money where legislators wanted it. Three years ago, at McMaster’s request, legislators began disclosing where the money was going, including paperwork justifying the spending.
“The danger is just the secrecy,” McMaster said of earmarks. “It’s the taxpayers’ money, and the taxpayers need to be able to know where it’s going, why it’s going, who’s going to spend it, how much is going to be spent.”
If any agencies this year or in future budgets receive special instructions on how to spend money outside the norm, they must get a written request from a legislator verifying the recipient exists and is in good standing, what the money is for, why the money is needed, other funding for the project and whether the state has funded the same or similar projects in the past, McMaster wrote.
“As I have stated before, without sufficient context, description, justification and other relevant information regarding the project and how the recipient intends to spend the funds, the public cannot evaluate an appropriation’s merit,” McMaster wrote. “Clearly, no matter how meritorious an appropriation may be, the public has a right to know exactly how their money is being spent.”
Pine Island
Visitors to a new state park set to open this year won’t have to make reservations after McMaster vetoed that rule from the state budget this year.
When a new state park on Lexington County’s Pine Island opens this fall, a clause included in legislators’ budget proposal would have required visitors schedule appointments.
Neighbors who live near the 27-acre park-to-be have raised concerns about increased traffic on roads built when the island was still limited to Dominion Energy workers and their families. The state Department of Parks, Recreation and Tourism has assured neighbors it will work with local law enforcement to control traffic.
Legislators don’t yet know that traffic will be enough of an issue to require dedicated appointments, McMaster wrote in his veto letter.
“In addition, this proviso may be interpreted as an effort to limit access to the lakefront amenities available for recreation at our state’s newest park,” the letter continued.
Some other state parks offer reservations for guaranteed parking spots during busy times, such as over the summer, on weekends or during holidays. Jones Gap State Park, for instance, requires online reservations for guaranteed entry during mornings on weekends and holidays, and Huntington Beach State Park offers online reservations between May and September.
Legislative pay raises
One controversial provision that McMaster allowed to remain was a pay increase for legislators.
Under a clause included in the budget, a monthly stipend meant to pay for costs incurred within a legislator’s district will go from $1,000 to $2,500. Because legislators aren’t required to report how the money is spent, that amounts to an $18,000 annual raise for each legislator.
Legislators also receive a $10,400 annual salary and a daily stipend of $240 meant to cover the cost of food and lodging while the Legislature’s in session.
With recent inflation, the $1,000 per month, put in place in 1995, was no longer enough to support the cost of traveling around the district and helping constituents, supporters of the raise said.
“I’m relying on the good faith of our Legislature,” McMaster said. “They say it’s going up that much. They are the ones that are trying to pay those expenses.”
Sen. Wes Climer, R-Rock Hill, threatened to sue if McMaster didn’t veto the measure. Dick Harpootlian, a former senator and Columbia attorney, offered his legal services in that case, and Columbia attorney John Crangle said in a letter urging McMaster to veto the law that he
“If there’s a legal challenge, then so be it,” McMaster said. “We’ll see if it works out.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_2753-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-06-04 17:10:49.354044

And I often note what a tragic descent it represents in America for us to have gotten to a point where his son, in order to make a project which is rather politically sensitive, had to leave the country that he fled to — the supposedly freer America — to go back to modern day Germany. Why? Because the protections for journalists and truth seekers like myself, documentary makers and others who want the world to know what is happening to us all and what matters to us all, life here is protected for such people in a way that is no longer true in America. It’s a sad irony.David Goodman Let’s go into the subject of your film. Who is Julian Assange?Eugene Jarecki Julian Assange is a tall Australian albino-haired man, characterized on Saturday Night Live as Dr. Evil, because he was a computer visionary who at the dawn of the Internet age in the early 2000s saw something that no one else had seen. And out of that vision that he had he built something called WikiLeaks. WikiLeaks was a simple idea. Prior to WikiLeaks, people who wanted to tell the world what their organization was doing, a so-called whistleblower, had to take great risks to tell the world what their organization might have been doing, whether they were a polluter or a corrupt government, corrupting elections, or dirty little secrets about war and killing. What Julian Assange discovered was that the digital age, which was going to give enormous new powers to governments and corporations, also had a certain promise for individuals. All WikiLeaks was was an encrypted dropbox that would allow a whistleblower to tell the world the thing they needed to know and not have to risk life and limb for it. This quickly led to the most significant leak of military and diplomatic documents in US history, which came because of single Army private, Chelsea Manning, who came into possession of a vast amount of secret material which revealed war crimes committed by America. That immediately made Julian Assange and WikiLeaks public enemy number one for America for having given the whistleblower that protective space in which to release that material.David Goodman Your film includes some of what Chelsea Manning released. What did it show?Eugene Jarecki What Chelsea Manning shared with WikiLeaks and what WikiLeaks then released to the world came to be known as the Collateral Murder video. It showed US helicopters firing on Iraqi civilians and journalists. Two journalists from Reuters were killed when helicopters fired on a group of men chatting on a sidewalk in Baghdad. That extraordinary act of killing and brutality was suddenly on every television screen in the world, and it happened because a whistleblower shared it with an organization. It was at that moment that an international campaign run by the United States to destroy WikiLeaks and the person of Julian Assange began.David Goodman When did you meet Julian Assange?Eugene Jarecki It was about 10 days ago that Julian Assange suddenly joined us at the Cannes Film Festival, a free man walking the red carpet in Cannes having emerged triumphant over the US government despite their 15 year campaign to destroy him. And the story of how Julian Assange got free and won his battle against the US government in one of the most definitive episodes for the defense of press freedom in history is part of what we tell in the film. It’s also a story that everyone needs to know, because it’s true that fights for press freedom, fights for the human rights that we all hold dear, can be won. We live at a time where most fights look unwinnable, partly because those in power are in the business of scaring us. They’re in the business of showing us these dreadful ICE videos where the effectively SS that Trump has turned ICE into is grabbing people in broad daylight off the street, off of aircraft, out of their places of work, places of worship, places of education, and scaring us all into silence. The story of Julian Assange, who warned us that we were headed for that world and they then tried to destroy him, is a story of how what Margaret Mead said is true: “Never doubt that a small group of people properly organized can change the world. Indeed, it’s the only thing that ever has.”Well Julian Assange and his team of young dreamer bandits, pirates working at WikiLeaks and wanting the public to know the truth, they won. The only charge left to which Mr. Assange had to plead guilty was journalism. The charge that Julian Assange had to admit he was guilty of was the act of doing something protected by the First Amendment. It shines an incredibly dark light on the way the US Espionage Act is being used to damage the US Constitution and to do things to people that the Constitution was created to protect them from having done to them.David Goodman Tell us the meaning of the title, “The Six Billion Dollar Man.” And by the way, I really love the takeoff on “The Six Million Dollar Man,” a TV series that I loved in the 1970s.Eugene Jarecki Me too. The movie is called “The Six Billion Dollar Man” because $6 billion is what the United States spent to bribe the country of Ecuador to torture Julian Assange. The goal was to make Ecuador, which had been giving Assange asylum, stop doing so, and make his life so miserable inside the embassy by shattering his human rights, safety and care inside the embassy that he would leave of his own volition so that US and British officials could apprehend him and put him on trial. For the richest country in the world to get one man, the bounty was $6 billion. And we and we have the receipts.David Goodman In 2016 Democrats accused Assange of aiding Donald Trump by being the conduit for Hillary Clinton’s hacked emails, which many people believe was part of a Russian operation. Democrats have vilified him. How do you respond to that?Eugene Jarecki I looked very closely at this because it troubled me as well, and I wanted to get at the heart of it. We found no evidence at all that links WikiLeaks with any kind of Russian operation. The only place we found that link is in the mouths of people in the Democratic Party, constantly saying it over and over again to explain away why they had lost an election. And what we did see was what WikiLeaks did release: evidence of what the Democratic National Committee was doing to destroy the candidacy of Bernie Sanders, who was ahead of Hillary Clinton in the polls. The stripping of democratic rights away from the supporters of Bernie Sanders is what WikiLeaks revealed, full stop. This was a very convenient smear campaign.David Goodman No link to Russia.Eugene Jarecki We found no evidence of any link. And by the way, no news organization has. Everybody in the world tried to find evidence that would link WikiLeaks to Russia, and none has come. Our movie also reveals is that though the US government for years said that WikiLeaks had “blood on its hands” for having released military and diplomatic documents that Chelsea Manning had provided to WikiLeaks, the US government conceded that no single person on the planet was found by them to have been hurt in any way in connection with any WikiLeaks release.David Goodman Why is this movie important now?Eugene Jarecki We’re living at a time with fascism on the rise all over the world, a crackdown on truth telling by those in power who do not find the truth convenient. They want to destroy the world all around us for profit and have us not know what’s happening. And Mr. Assange was the sort of canary in the coal mine of all this. These are people who don’t believe in democracy. And by these are people, I mean successive administrations of US policy makers. What they fear most is an informed public. Because what they’re doing behind the scenes, the dirty little business of how politics and corporate power intersect at the expense of all of us, they don’t want us to know. And so when someone comes along who threatens to expose that as Julian Assange, we see the clampdown. We saw it against Mr. Assange. We saw it in the killing of the journalists in the video that Mr. Assange released. We saw it throughout the diplomatic cables, in the manipulation of affairs of state all over the world, America doing business with dictatorships, America propping up human rights-abusing regimes. We saw so much crime and then we saw the US try to shoot the messenger. The fact that they failed and that he’s still walking is really a burnt stick in their eye.We now have to understand that the game is on, because they are ratcheting up that use of force against all of us even higher than in the days of Mr. Assange. They’re cracking down on journalists in a way that he was just the precedent for. But his victory tells us that it can be fought by small groups of people working together to not allow these kind of trespasses to happen. When you see people on the street crowding around the people who are being abducted, kidnapped, illegally taken by the SS that Mr. Trump has created known as ICE, you’re watching community effort at work. It might not work the first time or the second time, but it grows. And before long, they are at war with the people themselves, and that’s ultimately a winning game for the people. The people win when they organize against the abuse of few.David Goodman You have made films about Ronald Reagan, Henry Kissinger, exploring why we fight, Elvis Presley, and now Julian Assange. What is the through line that connects your work?Eugene Jarecki I’m a true believer in what they told me America was about. It’s the most it’s the most important social experiment in the last half millennium. My parents fled persecution in Europe to come to that promise in America. When I grew up to see that promise violated successively and the way that industrial capitalism has hijacked the American dream, it became the cause of my life to protect democracy from capitalism. I think Julian Assange was a glimmer of hope for whistleblowers and for all of us in the public who have the right to know what’s happening in our world, and the clamp down on him has exploded to be a clamp down on all information available to the public and on all truth seeking. And as such, he has more to say to our time than anyone I can imagine. That truth is that democratic glimmer that I care about and that I was taught to care about as a child, and I’ll fight for that glimmer till I’m dead.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont Conversation: Award-winning filmmaker Eugene Jarecki on Julian Assange, WikiLeaks and the global crackdown on truth.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Eugene-Jarecki-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-04 17:10:49.354044

(Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)When President Donald Trump’s performance in the polls in 2024 signaled a possible re-election, Keith Ellison and fellow Democratic attorneys general read Project 2025 and started getting ready, especially when Trump hired the key author of the planning document after his election.
They divided the documents into sections and marshaled their staff lawyers to be ready with lawsuits.
So when Russell Vought and the Office of Management and Budget and froze the distribution of certain federal funds — as outlined in Project 2025 — Ellison and other the Democratic AGs were ready.
They sued over the funding freeze the next day.
“They were not hiding the ball,” Ellison said in a wide-ranging interview with States Newsroom in Minneapolis Wednesday.
Ellison and his colleagues have engaged in more than two dozen lawsuits against Trump administration actions in the first five months of the president’s second term. The AGs have sued over cuts to federal agencies, tariffs, DOGE’s access to government data, attempts to end birthright citizenship, and more.

They’ve also toured blue states to tout their accomplishments and listen to voters’ concerns.
The stakes are high, Ellison said: the fate of multi-racial democracy.
Ellison, who served for a dozen years in Congress representing Minnesota’s Minneapolis-based 5th District, said the states are a sovereign bulwark against federal power grabs.
The Democratic attorneys general are not only fighting a Republican-controlled executive branch, but also a conservative majority on the U.S Supreme Court. In Ellison’s view, recent decisions by the Roberts court — particularly in 303 Creative v. Elenis, in which the court ruled that a business owner could not be obligated to serve a gay couple — signify that the country is moving towards legal segregation.
“We are a whisper away from Jim Crow,” Ellison said.
Still, Ellison was upbeat, celebrating the AGs string of victories and predicting that even conservative Supreme Court justices will resist the Trump administration’s attack on the rule of law and the institution of the court itself.
The Democratic AGs may benefit from a weakened Department of Justice under Trump, Ellison said. The agency that defends the federal government in court is hemorrhaging longtime staff attorneys, through both firings and resignations.
Ellison emphasized that many of the policies enacted by Trump in his first months in office would be legal if they were passed by Congress. Instead, the president is running the country through “edict” and “proclamation,” Ellison said.
“Our democracy is not perfect,” Ellison said, “but you will absolutely miss it when it’s gone, and Trump has given you a glimpse of that.”

Andy Beshear has signed an executive order to establish an advisory committee to explore support for universal pre-kindergarten programs in Kentucky. 
Beshear, a Democrat, has long supported implementing universal pre-K statewide. He again called on Republicans in the state legislature supermajority to fund such initiatives in his State of the Commonwealth Address earlier this year. However, top Republicans said their caucuses don’t have a consensus on the matter. 
The executive order creates the Team Kentucky Pre-K for All Advisory Committee with 28 members representing experience in business, workforce development and education. Jamie Link, the secretary of the Kentucky Education and Labor Cabinet is the chair of the committee. Other members include Education Commissioner Robbie Fletcher, Council on Postsecondary Education President Aaron Thompson and former state lawmakers, both Democratic and Republican.
Beshear announced the “Pre-K for All” initiative with local leaders in Louisville Wednesday. The city launched a five-year plan for universal pre-K last year. The governor emphasized a need to offer all Kentucky 4-year-olds pre-K programs to increase kindergarten readiness.
““We are here, not as Democrats or Republicans, not as part of the right or the left,” Beshear said in a statement. “Instead, we are here as parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles, educators and business leaders. We are here because we want the best for our Kentucky kids, the best for our Kentucky parents and caregivers, and we want to build and maintain the best workforce in America.”
The Kentucky Center for Statistics says that 53.8% of Kentucky children are not prepared for kindergarten on the first day of school. 
Beshear also said that 18 states, including Alabama, Colorado, Florida, Georgia and West Virginia, offer pre-K access to 4-year-olds — further underscoring that he views the issue as nonpartisan. 
The advisory committee will hold public meetings throughout Kentucky and create a report on feedback heard by Oct. 15. That’s a few weeks ahead of the beginning of the 2026 legislative session, which is when lawmakers will begin debating the next two-year state budget.

Gov. JB Pritzker will have hundreds of bills to review after lawmakers concluded their spring session, including measures protecting press freedoms and baby food, as well as creating a state public defender’s office.

Lawmakers voted along party lines Saturday to pass House Bill 3363, which would create the “Office of State Public Defender” that would primarily be responsible for providing public defender offices around the state with more resources.

It also reforms how public defenders would be appointed by requiring a local nominating committee to appoint or remove public defenders, which is designed to give the public defenders more independence from the judiciary.

“Every Illinoisan deserves a strong defense, no matter their income,” bill sponsor Sen. Robert Peters, D-Chicago, said in a statement. “Instating this new system would ensure real help reaches people who have been left behind in conversations about criminal justice reform for far too long.”

Public defender offices throughout the state have been starved for resources, with some defense attorneys at public defender offices handling hundreds of cases at a time. Supporters of the legislation say the main goal of the office, at least initially, will be to provide more comprehensive state resources to public defender offices, which now are typically subject to the limitations of county budgets.

Limited data shows all Illinois counties need more public defenders. According to an analysis of county public defender budgets compiled by Northwestern University, no Illinois counties have “sufficient” staffing in public defender offices.

State lawmakers appropriated $10 million for county public defense services in the FY26 budget and have appropriated as much each year since 2023. If signed by the governor, Peters’ legislation won’t fully take effect until 2027.

Safer baby food

Lawmakers in both chambers unanimously passed Senate Bill 73, which bans the sale and distribution of baby food in Illinois that contains levels of toxic elements – including arsenic, cadmium, lead or mercury – that surpasses the limits set by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The bill now only needs a signature from the governor to become law.

Under SB73, any manufacturer selling baby food in Illinois would be required to test a sample of their product monthly to ensure the levels of toxic elements contained in the product fall in line with the limits set by the FDA. The bill also gives the Illinois Department of Public Health the right to request and review manufacturers’ testing results and requires manufacturers to publish the levels of each toxic element in each of their products on the manufacturer’s website.

Manufacturers who sell products in Illinois would also have to print a QR code on the label of any baby food that contains toxic elements that are limited by the FDA. The QR would be required to direct consumers to the product’s testing information and FDA guidelines on “the health effects of the toxic element on children.”

The bill comes after a study published in 2019 by Healthy Babies Bright Futures, which found that 95% of 168 baby foods tested for toxic elements contained one or more contaminants. One in four of the baby foods tested in the study contained all four elements, with arsenic being found in 73% of the baby foods tested and lead in 94% of the products.

The study gained public traction after its publication, resulting in the creation and implementation of “Closer to Zero” – an FDA initiative that aims to reduce the percentage of toxic metals found in baby food to zero.

If signed by the governor, the bill will take effect on Jan. 1, 2026.

Press protections

Pritzker will also consider a measure to bolster news media protections against lawsuits.

Senate Bill 1181 explicitly adds news media as an entity protected under the state’s Citizen Participation Act, which prohibits “strategic lawsuits against public participation,” or SLAPPs. It passed the House 75-38 and the Senate 47-10.

It was spurred by a recent state Supreme Court ruling that allowed a defamation suit filed by a former government employee against the Chicago Sun-Times to progress.

The Supreme Court’s ruling in that case differentiated “investigative” reporting from the paper’s coverage of a state inspector general’s investigation into the Illinois Property Tax Appeals Board’s executive director.

Lawyers from the Chicago Sun-Times sought to use the Citizen Protection Act to dismiss the executive director’s 2021 lawsuit against the paper, which contended it mischaracterized the inspector general’s investigation.

But the Supreme Court declined, ruling the paper’s coverage lacked any intent to elicit action or a solution from the government – which was needed to apply SLAPP protections – because the coverage was not investigative in nature.

“We are simply holding that the (Citizen Participation) Act specifically protects government participation and does not encompass all media reports on matters of public concern,” Justice David K. Overstreet wrote in the opinion.

SB 1181 directly addresses that sentiment. The bill states, “The press opining, reporting, or investigating matters of public concern is participating and communicating with the government,” meaning organizations doing so would be protected under the law if the bill is signed. It would apply to actions taken after Jan. 1, 2026.

The measure also provides that all legal proceedings in a case would be paused while a party’s Citizen Participation Act lawsuit motion progresses in court.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison condemned Tuesday’s militarized federal law enforcement action in Minneapolis, saying “it seemed like the point was to inflict terror and fear into the community.”
Dozens of armed federal agents from multiple agencies, including Immigration and Customs Enforcement, raided a Minneapolis taco restaurant Tuesday in what ICE said was a “groundbreaking operation” involving drug smuggling and human trafficking.
The raid was Minnesota’s first under President Donald Trump’s Homeland Security Task Force, which he established via executive order on the first day of his second term, according to a statement from ICE.
The operation inflamed tensions with residents in the Midtown neighborhood, which includes many Latino residents and which was rocked by protests and riots following the police murder of George Floyd in 2020.
“If they want to inflict fear, and they wanted to discourage cooperation, they achieved both those goals yesterday,” Ellison said Wednesday in an interview with States Newsroom.
Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said the raid was not related to immigration enforcement, but “a criminal search warrant for drugs and money laundering.”
But information was sparse on the scene. Hundreds of immigrant rights activists and neighbors surrounded the restaurant, yelling at officers and attempting to block their armored vehicles. Many officers wore face coverings and camouflage fatigues, and some refused to identify which agency they were with.
Officers used chemical irritants and piercing sirens to disperse the crowd. No one was arrested during the raid, Frey said Tuesday.
Ellison said he was not informed of the raid before it happened, and that the raid was “way over the top in terms of resource allocation.”

Ellison’s remarks add to a chorus of condemnation among local officials who are concerned about the fate of immigrants in Minnesota. 
Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty released a statement Wednesday morning saying across the country, “ICE is being deployed to terrorize people.”
“My singular focus is on the safety of the people who live here, and I want to be clear that ICE showing up alongside local law enforcement causes grievous and irreparable harm,” Moriarty said. 
DFL State Sen. Omar Fateh, who is running against Frey for Minneapolis mayor, said on social media that Minneapolis is a “‘sanctuary’ in name only.” 
“There is no circumstance in which MPD should cooperate with ICE,” Fateh wrote. “By labeling it in an investigation of ‘criminal activity,’ ICE visited fear into the heart of an immigrant neighborhood — and our communities were shaken.”
After Trump’s re-election, Frey promised that Minneapolis police would not assist with civil immigration enforcement. 
“The Minneapolis Police Department’s only role was assisting with crowd control and keeping the community safe as a large number of residents and bystanders had gathered at the scene,” Frey said Tuesday. “They have not been involved in anything related to immigration enforcement.”
Ellison said Wednesday that the state government also is not obligated to help federal agents locate and arrest immigrants.
Asked how the raid’s execution will impact his working relationship with federal agencies, Ellison said “it’s not that great now.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/NN250603_0749-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-06-04 17:10:49.354044

(Photo by Karolina Wojtasik/HBO)From “The Gilded Age” to “Hocus Pocus 2,” Rhode Island has played a starring role in a growing number of TV shows, movies, commercials and theater productions.
So many, in fact, that the state unintentionally approved more tax credits to production companies for local spending than available state funding for the incentive program. 
The unexpected $3.2 million shortfall, which dates back to credits from productions completed in 2022, was recently revealed in a May 28 memo from Gov. Dan McKee to state lawmakers. McKee suggested dipping into state coffers in the upcoming fiscal 2026 budget to cover the retroactive overrun.
Not a welcome proposal as the Rhode Island General Assembly grapples with a projected $185 million deficit heading into the new fiscal year alongside potentially devastating federal funding cuts to major programs like Medicaid. But lawmakers may not have much choice — the 2005 law that created the motion picture tax credit program offers a three-year window for eligible productions to redeem approved credits, which are based on state taxes paid on workers’ wages and local goods and services. 
This is the final year for companies to redeem credits they were awarded in 2022 — the year of the inadvertent overspend.
“The production companies followed the rules,” Brian Daniels, director of the Rhode Island Office of Management and Budget, told lawmakers during a presentation to the Senate Committee on Finance Tuesday night. “They didn’t do anything wrong. There’s not a lot of discretion here.”
The film incentive program is a perennial hot potato on Smith Hill; proponents insist that offering tax credits for up to 30% of local production costs boosts Rhode Island’s economy, creating jobs and incentivizing people to visit (and spend more money) to see the places where their favorite shows and films were created. Naysayers question whether the unquantifiable “indirect spend” from the program is actually enough to offset the initial upfront investment, also noting that more than half of jobs go to non-Rhode Island residents, as documented in multiple reports by the Rhode Island Office of Revenue Analysis.
The revenue office in a July 2024 report reiterated its prior conclusions that the state loses money on the program, with 9 cents in net general revenues for every dollar spent on tax credits from 2019-2021, and $3.19 in total economic output. The findings suggest the program is less beneficial than a 2021 study commissioned by the Greater Newport Chamber of Commerce, which touted a “multiplier effect” in which $1 invested in tax credits for locally filmed productions yielded $5.44 in economic activity for the state.
Yet even Feinberg, the program’s most stalwart defender, admits there are some problems with timing and accuracy of initial production cost projections. 
Feinberg helps market the Ocean State to production companies, relying on the tax credit program as a key incentive. He also gives first vetting to tax credit applications, sending an initial determination based on eligibility and projected local spending to the Rhode Island Division of Taxation. Lawmakers determine a maximum amount in each state budget plan for the program based on the preliminary estimates and introductory conversations— many of which never turn into actual productions eligible for state funding.
But it is only after taping finishes and a thorough audit by state tax officials that credits are awarded — often years after the initial estimates upon which state budget calculations are made.
Usually, the mismatch is not a problem. Costs, and therefore credit amounts, are almost always lower than initially estimated.
Until now, when final audits show the state gave out $33.2 million in tax credits to eight productions that wrapped in 2022 — exceeding the $30 million funding cap for that year.

Blame it on COVID
In 2022, pent-up post-COVID demand converged with a rush to finish filming in anticipation of writers’ and actors’ union strikes that happened in 2023 to create what Steven Feinberg, executive director for the Rhode Island Film and Television office, called the “perfect storm.” 
“This was an anomaly,” Feinberg said, speaking to lawmakers Tuesday. “I’ve been doing this for 20 years, and this has never happened.” 
Feinberg also noted the earlier-than-expected completion of an “Emmy-award winning,” show, referring to the second season of HBO’s “The Gilded Age.”
The hit TV series concluded filming its second season in Newport in October 2022, receiving $7.5 million in state tax credits based on more than $28.4 million in local production costs, according to program information submitted to state budget analysts at the May Revenue and Caseload Estimating Conference.
A third season of “The Gilded Age” was taped in Newport in late 2024. Final production costs have not been submitted, but initial estimates predict a nearly $27 million spend, with a corresponding $8 million in tax credits.










This was an anomaly. I’ve been doing this for 20 years, and this has never happened.

Of the $40 million set aside in 2023 for tax credits, $31 million remains, Daniels said. McKee’s proposed $14 billion fiscal 2026 budget would authorize up to $20 million more for the program in 2026.
Still, both Daniels and Feinberg acknowledged the need to address timing and accuracy of program awards. Feinberg said his office is working with the state taxation division to keep officials in the loop on potential changes to initial project estimates, while also considering how to tweak state regulations to better align budgets and awards.
Feinberg did not immediately respond to requests for more information Wednesday.
Senate Finance Chairman Lou DiPalma pointed out that if the overspend was uncovered after the legislative session ended on June 30, the consequences could have been worse.
“What would you do if we’re not here?” DiPalma said during the hearing. “Do you wait till January?”
He continued, “We’re fortunate it hasn’t manifested itself yet, but what we can do, we should do. What did we learn? We don’t want this to happen again.”
DiPalma’s concern over reporting discrepancies did not preclude him from a more lighthearted request of Feinberg.
“I still want to meet Danny DeVito,” DiPalma said. “When can that happen?”
House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi and Senate President Valarie Lawson both remained noncommittal on the proposed funding adjustment in separate statements Wednesday. The additional money will be considered as part of budget deliberations, which are expected to be hammered out in the next few weeks ahead.

They divided the documents into sections and marshaled their staff lawyers to be ready with lawsuits.   
So when Russell Vought and the Office of Management and Budget and froze the distribution of certain federal funds — as outlined in Project 2025 — Ellison and other the Democratic AGs were ready. 
They sued over the funding freeze the next day. 
“They were not hiding the ball,” Ellison said in a wide-ranging interview with States Newsroom in Minneapolis Wednesday. 
Ellison and his colleagues have engaged in more than two dozen lawsuits against Trump administration actions in the first five months of the president’s second term. The AGs have sued over cuts to federal agencies, tariffs, DOGE’s access to government data, attempts to end birthright citizenship, and more. 
They’ve also toured blue states to tout their accomplishments and listen to voters’ concerns.
The stakes are high, Ellison said: the fate of multi-racial democracy. 
Ellison, who served for a dozen years in Congress representing Minnesota’s Minneapolis-based 5th District, said the states are a sovereign bulwark against federal power grabs. 
The Democratic attorneys general are not only fighting a Republican-controlled executive branch, but also a conservative majority on the U.S Supreme Court. In Ellison’s view, recent decisions by the Roberts court — particularly in 303 Creative v. Elenis, in which the court ruled that a business owner could not be obligated to serve a gay couple — signify that the country is moving towards legal segregation. 
“We are a whisper away from Jim Crow,” Ellison said.
Still, Ellison was upbeat, celebrating the AGs string of victories and predicting that even conservative Supreme Court justices will resist the Trump administration’s attack on the rule of law and the institution of the court itself. 
The Democratic AGs may benefit from a weakened Department of Justice under Trump, Ellison said. The agency that defends the federal government in court is hemorrhaging longtime staff attorneys, through both firings and resignations.
Ellison emphasized that many of the policies enacted by Trump in his first months in office would be legal if they were passed by Congress. Instead, the president is running the country through “edict” and “proclamation,” Ellison said. 
“Our democracy is not perfect,” Ellison said, “but you will absolutely miss it when it’s gone, and Trump has given you a glimpse of that.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/MG_1897-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-06-04 16:04:19.701692

High construction costs, labor shortages and supply chain issues all contribute to soaring housing costs and supply shortages, Gov. Josh Stein said Tuesday. But the state’s growing popularity as a destination for transplants is also a big part of the problem, Stein said.
The governor noted that North Carolina is the third fastest growing state since the last census. The state, he said, added more people than any other except Texas and Florida. “There are just a lot of people moving here and houses aren’t being built fast enough,” Stein said.
When people move to North Carolina, Stein said, they need a place to stay and when there is a shortage of available units, newcomers, who often come with higher salaries and larger bank accounts, are willing to pay more for housing.
“And then it means everybody else is left to struggle,” he said.
Experts, advocates, elected leaders gather
Stein made his remarks during a roundtable discussion in Raleigh with more than a half-dozen housing experts and elected officials. The event was held at Milner Commons, a 156-unit public/private venture on Russ Street in Raleigh that was built to house seniors 55 and older with modest incomes.
Tuesday’s meeting was an opportunity for Stein to discuss solutions to the housing crisis with housing experts and local officials and to consider legislation and public policy initiatives to speed up the building process to boost the state’s housing supply.

“Our state is growing, and people need a safe and affordable place to live,” Stein said. “We will remain focused on identifying solutions to lower the cost of housing for North Carolinians at every stage of life and work to ensure every person has a safe place to call home.”
The housing crisis in North Carolina is real. The state faces a five-year housing inventory gap of 764,478 units (322,360 rental units and 442,118 for-sale units), according to a recent statewide report commissioned by the NC Chamber Foundation, NC REALTORS and the N.C. Homebuilders Association.
And across the country, people, particularly those with low incomes, are finding rents increasingly unaffordable. A recent report by the National Low Income Housing Coalition (NLIHC) found a national shortage of 7.1 million affordable and available rental homes for extremely low-income renter households – those with incomes at or below the poverty level or 30% of their area median income, whichever is greater. This means that there are just 35 affordable and available rental homes for every 100 extremely low-income renter households nationwide.
North Carolina was slightly better off than the nation as a whole, but only slightly. The report revealed that only 41 affordable and available rental homes are available for every 100 of the 332,199 extremely low-income households in the state.
Affordable housing developers face challenges
Even though Milner Commons is considered an affordable property, Yolanda Winstead, president and CEO of DHIC, the nonprofit that developed the senior community, said the rents are higher than DHIC would like because construction costs grew and interest rates continued to increase during the development process.

“With those things happening in real time as we’re trying to get it on the ground, we had to fill the gaps that we experienced,” Winstead said.
Raleigh City Councilman Corey Branch said affordable housing developers are facing funding challenges that require government assistance due to higher construction costs and other development obstacles.
“A lot of the costs developers are facing, people don’t see,” Branch said. “So those are the things that we see and continue to put money into … but if you raise property taxes, then you’re impacting the people you’re trying to help.”
Samuel Gunter, executive director of the NC Housing Coalition, said it is critical to focus on increasing the state’s housing supply.
“If we’re not fixing and making sure that we have enough supply, then all of the other stuff we do to subsidize and stabilize [housing] is just not going to go far,” Gunter said.

Keeping people in their homes
Scott Farmer, executive director of the NC Housing Finance Agency, said the preservation of existing homes is often overlooked in the struggle to provide safe and affordable housing. One of the agency’s most important tools is its Urgent Repair Program, which finances emergency repairs for low-income homeowners who are elderly or have disabilities and whose incomes are below 50% of the area media, Farmer said.
“We’re able to go in and do small scale repairs to keep people in their homes,” Farmer said. “Being able to open $17,000 to keep somebody in their house for an additional five years goes a long way toward saving those [state and federal] dollars because in an institutional setting, we know that’s going to cost the state and federal government a lot more money.”
Stein’s proposed state budget included $60 million to leverage federal and private resources to build more housing for low-income families, veterans, seniors and people with disabilities, he said. His proposal also includes $15 million for the Workforce Loan Program to aid in the construction and repair of affordable housing. He said he supports bipartisan proposals in the General Assembly to cut red tape and make it easier to build more homes. Budgets advanced by state lawmakers, however, have not been nearly so ambitious.

Roadblocks to speeding construction
State Sen. Julie Mayfield (D-Buncombe) said getting legislation passed to ease construction restrictions has been difficult this legislative session. Mayfield has introduced several housing-related bills including one that would allow more mixed-used developments across the state.
“We’re working on it, but we haven’t gotten anything passed yet,” Mayfield said. “It’s a little challenging … but I’m not giving up until that gavel comes down.”
Mayfield said voting to increase density in many communities across the state has proven to be a “one-way ticket to getting unelected.”
“Now, there are enlightened communities like Raleigh and Chapel Hill and Durham and Asheville where that’s not so much the case, but we have some communities who are not there.” As a fan of local government, Mayfield said she doesn’t like telling local officials what to do. But adopting state laws to increase density could give resistant communities a much-needed nudge.
“These bills are not trying to be punitive to local governments; they’re just trying to say we’re [lawmakers] going to take this problem and pull it up here, so you don’t have political risk around it anymore,” Mayfield said.
Homebuilder D.R. Bryan said local ordinances restricting density slows the development process and makes it difficult to build multi-family homes, which helps to increase the housing supply.
Another obstacle, Bryan said, is city and town employees who continue to work from home five years after the pandemic. He said the practice also slows the development process. Many builders prefer to meet face-to-face to discuss project rather than over Zoom, he said.
“The people who are reviewing our plans, we’re having to communicate through email and maybe Zoom, and you just can’t get it done,” Bryan said. “You need to sit there and either have paper plans or a computer and say, “OK, what do you mean here or there?’”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DSCN0167-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-06-04 16:04:19.701692

— Senator Jim Justice (@JimJustice_WV) June 4, 2025

The bipartisan bill aims to reintroduce whole milks and 2% milk to schools participating in the National School Lunch Program. 
The measure also has the support of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who tweeted in March that his administration is “encouraging programs to switch from low-fat dairy – which the antiquated Dietary Guidelines require them to promote — to full-fat/whole milk.” 
Current guidelines from the United States Department of Agriculture require schools to offer fat-free and low-fat milk, flavored and unflavored, to kindergarten through twelfth grade students.
Whole and reduced-fat (2%) milk were removed from school menus in 2012 under the Obama administration to limit saturated fat consumption and calorie consumption among children. 
Recent research suggests that kids who drink whole milk could be less likely to be overweight or develop obesity than children who drink reduced-fat milk.
“Milk is an important part of a balanced diet that delivers critical nutrients students need for growth and development. It makes sense for National School Lunch Program operators to have the authority to offer this healthful beverage to students during the school day,” said Sen. John Boozman, (R-AR). I’m proud to lead the committee in advancing this bipartisan solution to expand milk options and encourage increased dairy consumption while supporting America’s hardworking dairy producers,” 
The U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, which Boozman chairs, advanced the measure on Tuesday. Justice is also a member of the committee. The bill now heads to the full Senate for consideration.
The measure also authorizes parents or legal guardians, in addition to licensed physicians, to provide a written statement for their student to receive a nondairy substitute for fluid milk at school.
Nearly every West Virginia county provides free breakfast and lunch to students regardless of income due the state’s high poverty level.

Michael now works in a small-town hospital in Canada. KFF Health News and NPR granted him anonymity because of fears he might face reprisal from the Trump administration if he returns to the U.S. He said he feels some guilt that he did not stay to resist the Trump agenda but is assured in his decision to leave. Too much of America has simply grown too comfortable with violence and cruelty, he said.
“Part of being a physician is being kind to people who are in their weakest place,” Michael said. “And I feel like our country is devolving to really step on people who are weak and vulnerable.”
Michael is among a new wave of doctors who are leaving the United States to escape the Trump administration. In the months since Trump was reelected and returned to the White House, American doctors have shown skyrocketing interest in becoming licensed in Canada, where dozens more than normal have already been cleared to practice, according to Canadian licensing officials and recruiting businesses.
The Medical Council of Canada said in an email statement that the number of American doctors creating accounts on physiciansapply.ca, which is “typically the first step” to being licensed in Canada, has increased more than 750% over the past seven months compared with the same time period last year — from 71 applicants to 615. Separately, medical licensing organizations in Canada’s most populous provinces reported a rise in Americans either applying for or receiving Canadian licenses, with at least some doctors disclosing they were moving specifically because of Trump.
“The doctors that we are talking to are embarrassed to say they’re Americans,” said John Philpott, CEO of CanAm Physician Recruiting, which recruits doctors into Canada. “They state that right out of the gate: ‘I have to leave this country. It is not what it used to be.’”
Canada, which has universal publicly funded health care, has long been an option for U.S.-trained doctors seeking an alternative to the American health care system. While it was once more difficult for American doctors to practice in Canada due to discrepancies in medical education standards, Canadian provinces have relaxed some licensing regulations in recent years, and some are expediting licensing for U.S.-trained physicians.
In mere months, the Trump administration has jeopardized the economy with tariffs, ignored court orders and due process, and threatened the sovereignty of U.S. allies, including Canada. The administration has also taken steps that may unnerve doctors specifically, including appointing Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead federal health agencies, shifting money away from pandemic preparedness, discouraging gender-affirming care, demonizing fluoride, and supporting deep cuts to Medicaid.
The Trump administration did not provide any comment for this article. When asked to respond to doctors’ leaving the U.S. for Canada, White House spokesperson Kush Desai asked whether KFF Health News knew the precise number of doctors and their “citizenship status,” then provided no further comment. KFF Health News did not have or provide this information.
Philpott, who founded CanAm Physician Recruiting in the 1990s, said the cross-border movement of American and Canadian doctors has for decades ebbed and flowed in reaction to political and economic fluctuations, but that the pull toward Canada has never been as strong as now.
Philpott said CanAm had seen a 65% increase in American doctors looking for Canadian jobs from January to April, and that the company has been contacted by as many as 15 American doctors a day.
Rohini Patel, a CanAm recruiter and doctor, said some consider pay cuts to move quickly.
“They’re ready to move to Canada tomorrow,” she said. “They are not concerned about what their income is.”
The College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario, which handles licensing in Canada’s most populous province, said in a statement that it registered 116 U.S.-trained doctors in the first quarter of 2025 — an increase of at least 50% over the prior two quarters. Ontario also received license applications from about 260 U.S.-trained doctors in the first quarter of this year, the organization said.
British Columbia, another populous province, saw a surge of licensure applications from U.S.-trained doctors after Election Day, according to an email statement from the College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia. The statement also said the organization licensed 28 such doctors in the fiscal year that ended in February — triple the total of the prior year.
Quebec’s College of Physicians said applications from U.S.-trained doctors have increased, along with the number of Canadian doctors returning from America to practice within the province, but it did not provide specifics. In a statement, the organization said some applicants were trying to get permitted to practice in Canada “specifically because of the actual presidential administration.”
Michael, the physician who moved to Canada this year, said he had long been wary of what he described as escalating right-ring political rhetoric and unchecked gun violence in the United States, the latter of which he witnessed firsthand during a decade working in American emergency rooms.
Michael said he began considering the move as Trump was running for reelection in 2020. His breaking point came on Jan. 6, 2021, when a violent mob of Trump supporters besieged the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to stop the certification of the election of Joe Biden as president.
“Civil discourse was falling apart,” he said. “I had a conversation with my family about how Biden was going to be a one-term president and we were still headed in a direction of being increasingly radicalized toward the right and an acceptance of vigilantism.”
It then took about a year for Michael to become licensed in Canada, then longer for him to finalize his job and move, he said. While the licensing process was “not difficult,” he said, it did require him to obtain certified documents from his medical school and residency program.
“The process wasn’t any harder than getting your first license in the United States, which is also very bureaucratic,” Michael said. “The difference is, I think most people practicing in the U.S. have got so much administrative fatigue that they don’t want to go through that process again.”
Michael said he now receives near-daily emails or texts from American doctors who are seeking advice about moving to Canada.
This desire to leave has also been striking to Hippocratic Adventures, a small business that helps American doctors practice medicine in other countries.
The company was co-founded by Ashwini Bapat, a Yale-educated doctor who moved to Portugal in 2020 in part because she was “terrified that Trump would win again.” For years, Hippocratic Adventures catered to physicians with wanderlust, guiding them through the bureaucracy of getting licensed in foreign nations or conducting telemedicine from afar, Bapat said.
But after Trump was reelected, customers were no longer seeking grand travels across the globe, Bapat said. Now they were searching for the nearest emergency exit, she said.
“Previously it had been about adventure,” Bapat said. “But the biggest spike that we saw, for sure, hands down, was when Trump won reelection in November. And then Inauguration Day. And basically every single day since then.”
At least one Canadian province is actively marketing itself to American doctors.
Doctors Manitoba, which represents physicians in the rural province that struggles with one of Canada’s worst doctor shortages, launched a recruiting campaign after the election to capitalize on Trump and the rise of far-right politics in the U.S.
The campaign focuses on Florida and North and South Dakota and advertises “zero political interference in physician patient relationship” as a selling point.
Alison Carleton, a family medicine doctor who moved from Iowa to Manitoba in 2017, said she left to escape the daily grind of America’s for-profit health care system and because she was appalled that Trump was elected the first time.
Carleton said she now runs a small-town clinic with low stress, less paperwork, and no fear of burying her patients in medical debt.
She dropped her American citizenship last year.
“People I know have said, ‘You left just in time,’” Carleton said. “I tell people, ‘I know. When are you going to move?’”

SPRINGFIELD – Illinois lawmakers have decided to delay a ban on “swipe fees” for another year as bankers are locked in a court battle with the state over the ban.

Lawmakers passed the Interchange Fee Prohibition Act last spring as part of the legislative package that enacted the state budget. It prohibits financial institutions from charging fees on the tax and tip portions of credit and debit card transactions. The rest of the transaction, including the price of goods or services, would still be subject to the fees.

The ban was supposed to take effect on July 1, but lawmakers voted with strong bipartisan majorities Sunday morning to pass House Bill 742 to push the ban back until July 2026.

Banking groups filed a lawsuit last August challenging the law on the grounds it superseded federal banking regulations. Bankers argued the law forces banks and credit card companies to implement costly new computer systems to differentiate between the transaction, tax and tip, and contended they can’t comply with the law by July 1.

A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction in December preventing the law, once it takes effect, from applying to federally chartered banks while declining to extend the injunction to state banks and credit card companies.

In February, the judge declined to extend the injunction to credit unions, though it was extended to out-of-state banks that operate in Illinois. The case has remained unresolved in the courts since then, leading lawmakers to push back the start of the ban.

The measure pushing back the effective date still needs approval from Gov. JB Pritzker.

Banking groups supported the delay and continued their messaging campaign against the underlying legislation that passed a year ago.

“This law will cause widespread economic disruption, and mounting evidence shows that the measure overwhelmingly benefits corporate megastores while placing an undue financial burden on small businesses and smaller financial institutions that form the backbone of our local economies,” Illinois Bankers Association Executive Vice President Ben Jackson said in a statement.

The ban was a request of the Illinois Retail Merchants Association as part of a deal during budget negotiations last spring. State lawmakers capped a monthly sales tax deduction claimed by retailers at $1,000 to generate $101 million to fill a budget hole. In exchange, lawmakers passed the ban on swipe fees.

IRMA said in a statement it was disappointed lawmakers have decided to delay the ban.

“By refusing to require compliance as originally intended, legislators are again taking hundreds of millions of dollars out of the pockets of working families and Main Street businesses and giving it to big banks, credit card companies and credit card processors,” IRMA CEO Rob Karr said in a statement.

However, other business groups such as the Illinois Chamber of Commerce said lawmakers made the right decision and urged the legislature to fully repeal the law.

Come for the leaves, come for the snow, come for the lakes and rivers. Find a comfy chair, a local mash (or stomp), a good book, and breathe our fresh air. That is our brand. One fiery red/orange leaf of the sweet maple is enough to say “Vermont.” Yet, Vermont is also a hunting ground for the unscrupulous. For northern Vermont, just cast your memory on Jay Peak. For southern Vermont, a similar story was told in Dover and Wilmington with Haystack Mountain. I.M. Aiken, author of The Little Ambulance War of Winchester County, has turned her wit and deep knowledge of the system to create a fictional version of ski-area-fraudsters, along with politicians, lawyers, and business folks who get pulled along with the fantasy of getting rich by tarting up a lovely hill so that wealthy folks from away would find a home in it. They’d spend their money here. They’d hire people who need jobs. They’d restart flagging economies. One need not ask the obvious question: What could possibly go awry? In her second novel, the forthcoming Stolen Mountain, Aiken nibbles away at our assumptions, and has a bit of fun along the way. Why not? Why not use modern, everyday Vermonters to explore this sticky world? In The Little Ambulance War, Aiken create Brighid and her spouse Major Sarah Anne Musgrave (Sam)—a seasoned combat soldier and intelligence officer—of the US Army as secondary characters. In Stolen Mountain, Brighid, an EMT and captain of a small-town Vermont rescue squad, turns narrator and sleuth, leading us through an adventure. In addition to being a classic legal thriller, Stolen Mountain boasts a tender love story, which is punctuated by Sam’s absence when she deploys.After a 200-plus-year history of military service of all manor and flavors, women were only recently permitted to serve in combat positions.

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)Six of South Dakota’s 96 nursing homes are on the newest monthly federal list of the nation’s worst-rated care facilities.
Five of the facilities are eligible for a special program to improve quality of care through increased regulatory oversight, and one is already in the program.
The eligible South Dakota facilities as of the April report from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services are Avantara Norton in Sioux Falls, Riverview Healthcare Center in Flandreau, Good Samaritan Society Sioux Falls Village, Lake Andes Senior Living and Wilmot Care Center.
One facility, Dells Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in Dell Rapids, has been in the Special Focus Facility program for nearly two years. Good Samaritan Society Sioux Falls Center — separate from the society’s similarly named Sioux Falls Village — graduated in July 2023, after spending 27 months in the program.
Nursing homes are identified by the state as special-focus facilities based on their last three standard health survey inspections. Special-focus facilities must meet more stringent criteria two times in a row to be eligible for graduation. Dells Nursing and Rehabilitation Center did not pass its most recent inspection in January, so it will restart the process toward graduation. 
Because the number of special-focus facilities is capped, eligible facilities — even those that have earned CMS’ lowest ratings for quality — can’t be named a special-focus facility until other homes in the same state already in the program are terminated from Medicare and Medicaid or improve and “graduate” from the program. 
That’s a process that can take several years. As a result, there are homes in each state that are eligible for special-focus status due to ongoing quality-of-care problems, but can’t enroll in the program. It’s also why two of the five eligible South Dakota facilities have waited more than three years as candidates: Avantara Norton and Riverview Healthcare Center. 
Typically, the homes that are deemed eligible for special-focus designation have about twice the average number of violations cited by inspectors; they have more serious problems than most other nursing homes, including harm or injury to residents; and they have an established pattern of serious problems that has persisted over a long period of time.



Facility summaries
The five South Dakota homes eligible for inclusion in the Special Focus Facility program all have 1-out-of-5-star ratings from CMS. 
The federal agency penalizes and fines nursing homes for serious citations or if the facility fails to correct a citation for a long period of time. A portion of fines collected are returned to the state, which can be reinvested to support nursing home residents and improve their quality of life and care.
Following are summaries of the problems cited at each of those facilities, along with the one South Dakota facility already in the program and a facility that graduated in 2023.
Dells Nursing and Rehab Center: The 48-bed facility, operated as a for-profit corporation, has participated in the SFF program for 22 months. The home has been cited for 19 deficiencies since the start of 2024 and has been fined $67,773 in the last three years.
It was flagged for “immediate jeopardy” to its residents in February 2024 after a resident left the facility without staff knowledge for a third time in a year. The last two times, the patient was found wandering the facility parking lot. The first time, in June 2023, the resident was found a mile away. An alarm was set on the resident’s tracking device to alert staff if the resident left the facility. The home was cited for 19 deficiencies since the beginning of 2024, with about $67,800 in fines during that time.
The facility was found noncompliant for infection control in its latest state survey inspection report in March.
Avantara Norton: The 110-bed facility in Sioux Falls is owned by for-profit company Legacy Healthcare. The home has been cited for 15 deficiencies since the start of 2024 and has been fined $175,402 in the last three years. It’s been a special focus candidate for 39 months.
The home received a serious deficiency in its November 2024 report for failing to protect a resident from neglect by a certified nursing assistant. The resident was not cared for in a timely manner, possibly contributing to two skin sores. The staff member was disciplined and educated, according to the report.
The facility’s most recent inspection report in March included several citations, including a quality of life citation affecting several residents primarily due to poor call light response times and aid. In an interview, one resident told the state inspector “no one cared” at the facility, that he did not receive timely showers or help out of bed, and that staff response times to call lights vary from five minutes to three hours.
He and other residents said they would sometimes have to call the receptionist’s desk on the phone to ask her to send staff for help. Residents also said there were not enough staff to meet their needs, according to the report. Staff confirmed they occasionally experience staffing shortages. Administrators said they would require regular call light audits to review progress.
The facility’s most recent complaint inspection in April found a registered nurse was stealing controlled substances from the facility for four months. The nurse tested positive for hydrocodone and oxycodone and admitted to the accusation.
Riverview Healthcare Center: The 49-bed facility in Flandreau, owned by for-profit company EmpRes Healthcare Management, has been cited for eight deficiencies since the beginning of 2024, including an “immediate jeopardy” flag for failing to respond and report abuse allegations. It has been fined $81,568 in the last three years and been a special focus candidate for 37 months.
According to the January 2025 report, a certified nursing assistant kicked a resident in the shin twice and covered another resident’s mouth with a washcloth to quiet them. Several staff reported their suspicions but the staff member continued working and the nursing home did not conduct an investigation or follow its abuse and neglect policy. According to the facility’s correction plan, the staff member was put on administrative leave, the administration educated staff on its abuse and neglect policy, and staff interviewed residents randomly and on a weekly basis to hear concerns or look for signs of abuse and neglect.
In its most recent state recertification inspection report from February, citations included improper ulcer prevention and improper food preparation and storage. In a complaint inspection in February, the facility was cited for quality of care problems and failing to provide a safe, clean environment, among other citations. An inspector also found hazards including rusty, exposed edges of an emergency exit door, chunks of missing floor, baseboards, wallpaper and paint, and a hole in a ceiling.
Good Samaritan Society Sioux Falls Village: The 177-bed nonprofit facility in Sioux Falls has been a special-focus candidate for eight months. The home has been cited three times since the start of 2024 and fined $67,504 in the last three years. It has been a special focus candidate for nine months.
The facility was flagged for “immediate jeopardy” to resident health in its June 2024 report because a resident left the facility without staff’s knowledge twice within a few days and because another resident fell multiple times without receiving prompt assistance.
In its most recent complaint inspection report in September, the facility was investigated for alleged abuse and neglect. A staff member was “written up” for lack of care and false charting, for saying they’d checked in on residents and changed them when they hadn’t. The staff member’s charting will be audited, administration said in their correction plan, and the facility will randomly audit to ensure residents received scheduled baths, toileting and repositioning according to their care plan.
Lake Andes Senior Living: The 43-bed for-profit facility in Lake Andes is affiliated with Accura Healthcare. The home has been cited 18 times since the start of 2024 and was fined $91,601 in the last three years. It has been a special focus candidate for six months.
The home was flagged for “immediate jeopardy” to patient health in two citations in the September report, including not notifying four diabetic residents’ doctors when their blood sugar levels veered outside a normal range and failing to manage and prevent a COVID outbreak among residents. The report does not provide details on the size or results of the outbreak.
It was also cited in a September complaint inspection when a resident left the facility without supervision. The facility reviewed its policy for missing residents, ran drills among staff and audited alerting technology used by the facility.
Wilmot Care Center: The 29-bed nonprofit nursing home has been cited 17 times since the beginning of 2024 and has paid $10,377 in the last three years. The facility has been a special-focus candidate for two months.
The facility was flagged for “immediate jeopardy” to residents in its February 2024 report and its March 2025 report both for quality of life and care deficiencies. In March, an inspector found a water leak from the facility’s whirlpool tub next to an electrical box, which increased the risk of electrical shock to residents and staff. In February last year, a resident left the facility without staff’s knowledge and was retrieved by a staff member about a half-mile away. Staff left the facility’s front door unlocked and the resident cut off their tracking and alert device before leaving the facility.
Good Samaritan Society Sioux Falls Center: The 98-bed nonprofit nursing home graduated from the special-focus program in July 2023, after spending over two years on the list. It was cited for four deficiencies since the beginning of 2024 and has been fined twice for a total of $38,301 in the last three years.
The home was found noncompliant during its last state inspection report in June last year for infection prevention and control, food storage and preparation, and using expired medications.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Good-Sam-1024x814.jpg,,,2025-06-04 15:15:16.481425
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-04 19:13:39+00:00,CT Mirror,Lamont stops release of CT Dept. of Correction medical malpractice report,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/04/ct-medical-malpractice-doc-report-ned-lamont/,The report on malpractice and neglect at the Department of Correction examined 25 cases that led to lawsuits or could result in a lawsuit.,"An effort to compel Connecticut’s Department of Correction to release an independent report on some of the worst medical malpractice and neglect cases that happened in its custody was halted after Gov. Ned Lamont’s office requested a provision calling for the release be removed from legislation as the General Assembly’s 2025 session drew to a close.
The report was commissioned by the Department of Correction in 2017 for $63,000 and completed within the year by the Criminal Justice Institute Inc., according to an article in the Hartford Courant. The report examined 25 cases that resulted in lawsuits or were considered likely to result in a lawsuit. 
A provision of the bill, a broad piece of legislation put forward by the legislature’s Judiciary Committee earlier this year, called for the Department of Correction to post the entire report online within a year of the bill’s passage. It also would have required the department to send any medical documentation the report collected that may have been pertinent in a medical malpractice case to the victim’s family. 
In addition, the legislation would have required the Department of Public Health to open an investigation into each case detailed in the report, and the commissioner would have been assigned to determine whether any physicians involved in the cases be disciplined for their actions. The report was expected to identify 25 medical personnel to be investigated by the Connecticut Department of Health. 
The provision was jettisoned from the legislation during negotiations between the two legislative chambers and the governor’s office. Other portions of the Judiciary Committee’s bill were rolled into the legislature’s sprawling budget bill, which passed both chambers earlier this week.
Rob Blanchard, a spokesperson for Governor Ned Lamont’s Office, said the medical malpractice report was “commissioned by the Attorney General in preparation for litigation,” suggesting it needed to be kept confidential under attorney-client privilege. The Department of Correction also referred to attorney-client privilege in a statement to The Connecticut Mirror. 
Cara Passaro, chief of staff for the attorney general’s office, said while the office had “concerns” about making the report public, “It is not something that rose to the level of asking legislators to remove it.” 
Ken Krayeske, a civil rights attorney who has litigated multiple cases against the Department of Correction for medical malpractice, told CT Mirror in an email that Lamont’s request to keep the report confidential was “another example of Governor Lamont’s repeated failure on prison management and oversight.” 
Krayeske said in an interview that the release of the report would have represented a “victory over darkness.” 
Cases against the department
The Department of Correction has been the subject of several lawsuits over the last ten years regarding poor medical care that has led to the suffering and sometimes death of individuals in custody.
These include the case of Wayne World, whose skin cancer was repeatedly misdiagnosed by the Department of Correction, and who received a $1.3 million settlement from the state. It also includes Karon Nealy Jr., whose family received $1.65 million from the state after the 19-year-old died from lupus. Krayeske and current Correction Ombuds DeVaughn Ward were both involved in litigating the cases of World and Neely. 
Krayeske said he had been able to get access, through a federal lawsuit, to an additional 20 cases of inadequate medical care that occurred within the Department of Correction.  
One was the case of Billy Bennett, who died from cancer of the larynx in 2017. Krayeske said Bennett had begged for medical care for months. By the time he finally ended up in the emergency room, in January 2017, the cancer had reached stage four and Bennett was unable to breathe because of a tumor in his throat. He died eleven months later. 
A second was the case of Patrick, “Patsy” Camara, who complained of nosebleeds for months before finally being diagnosed with stage 4 nasopharyngeal carcinoma. By the time the cancer was discovered, a tumor located in his sinus cavity had grown to the size of a baseball and had eaten through his brain plate. He died in 2019. 
Documents reviewed by the CT Mirror show that the additional cases — individuals with cancer, neurological disorders, hepatitis C, fractures and spinal stenosis, among other things — revealed delays or denials of care, failures to pursue recommended follow-up care, inaccurate diagnoses, as well as “negligence” and “deliberate indifference” to patients’ conditions. 
The cases outlined in the report all occurred when the University of Connecticut Health Center, under UConn’s Correctional Managed Health Care, was responsible for the medical care of incarcerated people in the state. In 2016, a consultant was hired to conduct a review of the system, which had drawn a growing number of complaints about the quality of care people in custody were receiving. 
After two decades of a no-bid contract with UConn, the Department of Correction took over providing health care to incarcerated individuals beginning in July 2018.  
 Krayeske said releasing the report, even now, many years after it was conducted, “would mean that we have, as a society, the confidence to own up to bad policy.”
“It’s important, in this age of the destruction of objective reality, for us to be able to say, as a government, ‘We made a poor choice. We hurt families and we’re sorry,’” Krayeske added.
Ward said not having the report released would prevent families from being able to have closure, and to “seek justice in a meaningful way.” 
“I think it’s unfortunate for the individuals and for the families that were subjected to what has clearly been identified as horrible medical care,” he said. For the families of incarcerated people to be allowed to sue the state for what their relatives had undergone, would be “monumental,” Ward said.
As the legislative session reached its terminus, Ward said he had a reason to be hopeful because lawmakers had included sections in the budget bill granting his office greater oversight over medical care in the Department of Correction. This includes allowing the office to conduct investigations into any complaints around health care and to collect data on things like appointment wait times and access to medication and medical care. 
The bill also requires the Department of Correction to provide mental health assessments for incarcerated people when they first enter the department. 
“I hope, through all of that suffering that those individuals may have went through, we get some good policy,” said Ward.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_8955-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-04 15:15:16.481425

The shutdowns have alarmed officials and students in Vergennes, who fear the program’s end could uproot the lives of its more than a hundred students and hurt the local economy.

Photo by Henry Fernandez/VTDiggerNatalie Edwards found a sense of security at the Northlands Job Corps Center — but now that lifeline is set to close its doors along with dozens of other job centers across the country. After a childhood marked by abuse and addiction in the home, Edwards spent years trying to pull herself out of the cycle of instability. At 15, she entered rehab for substance use disorder for the first time. That same year, she was removed from the care of her mother, thrust into Missouri’s foster care system, and later tried — but then dropped out of — community college in Maine.“I just didn’t really have stability,” Edwards said. “I didn’t have the type of lifestyle around me at that time to feel safe.” It wasn’t until her aunt suggested she move to Vermont that things began to shift.“I messaged my aunt, and she told me I could move up to Vermont with her, and she suggested I come to Northlands,” she said. This is how Edwards became one of about 150 students now living on Northland’s flat, stately green campus, located just north of Vermont’s iconic Vergennes Falls.The Vergennes-based chapter of the Job Corps, a nationwide network of vocational schools, could cease to exist at the end of June, following a recent order by the U.S. Department of Labor to “pause” all ongoing operations across the country. However, the department’s order is not going unchallenged, with contractors who run Job Corps programs suing to keep the program alive.The order coincides with President Donald Trump’s “Make America Skilled Again” plan, which seeks to replace the program with a “cost-effective” alternative — a $2.6 billion grant program that emphasizes registered apprenticeships over federal programming. Since its inception in 1964, the Job Corps has been dedicated to training low-income young people ages 16 to 24 in a medley of primarily blue-collar professions like welding and urban forestry. The program provides room and board and an education to its participants for free.Natalie Edwards, a student at Northlands seeking her certified medical assistant certification. Photo by Henry Fernandez/VTDiggerAs part of the tentative ending of the program, Job Corps staff are mandated to return students safely to their “home of record.” However, Northlands Director Michael Dooley said not all Northlands students have a home to return to. “There’s about two dozen students that are unhoused. … Sadly, some of them we may actually be just taking to a homeless shelter.” Dooley said he’s scared his students — all working class young adults — are losing a lifeline. “The impact of providing a safe, stable environment on somebody who hasn’t had one is enormous,” he said. “A lot of our students are going back to pretty terrible home lives and home situations.” Flower Stop, an art installation in Vergennes designed and welded by local artist Kat Clear in collaboration with Northlands Job Corps welding students. Photo by Henry Fernandez/VTDiggerNorthlands is the top Job Corps center in job placement outcomes in the country, according to a paper copy of the rankings provided by Dooley. The Department of Labor has redirected a rankings webpage — alongside several other informational webpages — to a resource page for existing Job Corps graduates. Part of Northland’s strategy for readying students for the job market is its work-based learning programs, where students work directly for local businesses across Vermont. Several of these students work in Vergennes, and if the Job Corps program ends, Vermont’s smallest city is poised to lose one of its biggest employers.Susan Magill has lived in Vergennes for over 40 years, arriving a few months before Northlands first opened in June 1979. She serves as a career technical manager for Northlands, and says the school has brought positive change to the city.“We have students that are always out in the community doing something,” she said, noting students’ welding and tree removal work for Vergennes as examples of the harmony between the city and Northlands.Ron Redmond, Vergennes’ city manager, agreed. “It’s a very well-run organization, in my experience,” Redmond said. “I think the tough part for us is that we have students who have contributed to the downtown. There’s a welding program that we worked with, they’ve built bike racks, and an art project.” The art project is “Flower Stop,” a sculpture built around a bus stop made by artist Kat Clear in collaboration with Northlands welding students. For Redmond, one uncertainty is how Northlands’ closure is going to impact Vergennes. “There is gonna be an economic impact, we’ll have to wait and see,” he said.Dooley estimated that Northlands contributes around $2.5 million to the local economy, and said he’s worried that its closing could have a big effect. “You’ve got the money the center is spending and putting into the local economy, the program itself, plus the students and local staff that are buying gas, buying coffee, buying lunch. I don’t think anybody’s thought that through, really,” he said.Despite the economic uncertainty, the impact Northlands has had on the lives of students like Edwards is clearer. Edwards recently started working at Vergennes Grand Senior Living, and was looking forward to renting her own apartment after completing Northlands’ certified medical assistance program. “Helping people. I think that’s what draws me towards it,” she said.  At Northlands, Edwards said she’s found “a lot of stability. … It’s like a big family here. We all look out for each other.”But she said the feeling of Northlands shutting down and her aspirations being curbed is “heartbreaking. It’s absolutely horrible.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  ‘It’s absolutely horrible’: Federal shutdown of Northlands Job Corps leaves students and city reeling.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/michael-dooley-northlands-vergennes--1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-06-04 15:15:16.481425

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The American Civil Liberties Union of Iowa sent letters Wednesday to five Iowa city councils calling for a change to local statutes that classify “female impersonators” and “male impersonators” as adult entertainment, saying such measures are unconstitutional.
The letters were sent to the city councils of Carroll, Harlan, Mt. Pleasant, Polk City and Webster City. The five Iowa municipalities have restrictions on performances — typically referring to drag shows — as adult entertainment. In the letters to the city councils, ACLU Staff Attorney Shefali Aurora wrote that the prohibitions on drag performances violate the state and U.S. constitutions, as they conflict with the First Amendment by restricting a form of expression that’s protected under free speech rights.
Aurora also argued the ordinances violate constitutional equal protection rights, as the measures target the LGBTQ community on the basis of sex and gender expression.
Aurora said in a news conference Wednesday the ordinances are restricting performances that are neither obscene or sexual.
“Not all drag is obscenity,” Aurora said. “A lot of drag performances are, in fact, family friendly. Too often, drag is equated with sexualized performances. But drag is not, by definition, adult entertainment. It can simply be someone wearing clothing and accessories conventionally worn by a person of a different gender.”
Other performances that entail stories involving a person dressed in a manner that does not traditionally correspond with their gender at birth — such as movies like “Mulan” or “Mrs. Doubtfire” — could be restricted from being shown under such local ordinances.
A statewide measure to ban minors’ attendance at drag performances was discussed during the 2025 legislative session but ultimately did not advance. This proposed legislation contained similar language that defined drag as performances where the main aspect is “a performer who exhibits a gender identity that is different than the performer’s gender assigned at birth through the use of clothing, makeup, accessories, or other gender signifiers.”
The bill, which was amended, received heavy criticism not just for limiting family-friendly drag shows but potentially impacting transgender people’s ability to be in non-drag public performances and preventing local theaters from performing classic art such as Shakespeare’s “Twelfth Night,” as it contains a character that dresses as the opposite gender.
Aurora said this is not the first time the ACLU has sent letters to local governments about similar anti-drag ordinances. In the past, the organization has contacted Eagle Grove, Knoxville, Newton, Dyersville, Pella, Waukee and Grinnell — communities that agreed to amend their ordinances after receiving communications from the ACLU on the issue.
In 2021, Doña Martha’s Office in Eagle Grove had canceled a drag show after receiving a letter from the city attorney that called for the performances to cease, claiming they violated municipal code. Aurora said Eagle Grove later agreed to amend the restriction on “female impersonators” as part of the city’s definition of adult entertainment.
While the ACLU is encouraging all cities to review their ordinances and remove language related to drag performances as inherently obscene, Aurora said the latest letters were sent as many Iowa communities are celebrating Pride month, holding events that sometimes host drag performances.
“We thought it was particularly important to raise this issue again this month, with it being Pride, which is why we’re sending out the letters this week, just to bring that to the forefront,” Aurora said.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IMG_20230428_140315532-scaled-e1682722582987-1024x592.jpg,,,2025-06-04 15:15:16.481425

(Photo: Anna Liz Nichols)U.S. Department of Justice pardon attorney Ed Martin Jr. not only has plans to pardon the men convicted in planning to kidnap and kill Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, he also has a framework for granting clemency to the 2020 Republican false electors, according to a report released Wednesday.
Martin has now indicated that he is eyeing federal pardons for Republican state-level electors who allegedly helped President Donald Trump attempt to overturn the 2020 election results, according to a report from Mother Jones.
In Michigan, 15 of Trump’s 16 presidential electors were charged with state forgery and conspiracy crimes and are awaiting word from a Lansing district court judge on whether they will stand trial. One of those electors has since pleaded guilty and assisted the Michigan Department of Attorney General with its investigation and prosecution. Despite those charges coming from Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, a person familiar with Martin’s plans said that the state electors could be next for consideration.
The plan was framed as a wide-ranging effort to wipe away the memory of Trump’s attempts to overturn the election, which has included pardons for January 6 U.S. Capitol insurrectionists. The plan is also meant to elevate the department’s actions in a highly public way, showing that the federal government is working to gloss over the Trump campaign’s actions following his loss to former President Joe Biden.
“We’ll be a little bit more outward-facing in terms of talking about what’s happening,” Mother Jones reported Martin as saying at a May press conference outlining his plans. “The law can be taken up, but the starting point is to make sure that the public sees that we’re doing it.”
The 2020 Trump electors charged in the matter include former Michigan Republican Party co-chair Meshawn Maddock and former Republican National Committeewoman Kathleen Berden.
Martin said, quite candidly, in May that Barry Croft and Adam Fox, who were convicted of planning to kidnap Whitmer from her Elk Rapids vacation home along with a cadre of militia recruits, were also on the list for consideration.
Trump later acknowledged that he would take a look at Croft and Fox’s case. The Detroit News is reporting that Whitmer said she spoke with Trump this week about the idea of giving Fox and Croft pardons.

A few days later, lawmakers advanced the larger bill — a sweeping list of President Donald Trump’s priorities — but stripped the federal lands provision.
Yet leaders on both sides of the issue say the battle over selling off federal lands is likely just heating up.
Some conservatives in Western states have complained for decades that the feds control too much of the land within their borders. They see a long-awaited opportunity in a Trump administration that’s sympathetic to their cause. Public lands advocates are bracing for more attempts to turn land over to states, industry groups and developers.
“The threat level is red alert,” said Randi Spivak, public lands policy director with the Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental nonprofit. “Some of these states have been champing at the bit for decades to privatize. They’re certainly not going to let this opportunity pass without an aggressive effort.”
The ‘balance sheet’
In Western states, where most federally owned lands are located, some leaders view these lands as a treasured inheritance — places reserved for all Americans and critical for wildlife, tourism and outdoor recreation. Others feel that too much of the land in their states is controlled by officials in Washington, D.C., leaving it off-limits for development and curtailing its economic value.

Trump officials and allies have embraced the latter view. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum has repeatedly called federal lands America’s “balance sheet,” describing them as untapped assets worth trillions of dollars. He has launched an effort to identify federal lands suitable for housing development.
Other proposals have centered around using land sales to pay for tax breaks or to finance Trump’s proposed government-run fund that could invest in stocks or real estate.
For some state leaders, the newfound interest at the federal level to turn public lands into cash — along with Trump’s cuts to land management agency staff — aligns with a long-standing movement to reduce federal ownership.
“I look at it as an opportunity to say, ‘Hey, turn it over to the state,’” said Utah House Speaker Mike Schultz, a Republican.
Utah leaders have made the most forceful push to challenge federal land ownership. The state filed a legal challenge last year seeking to take control of more than 18 million acres of “unappropriated” lands — parcels held by the federal government without a specific designation such as a national park or monument. That effort hit a roadblock earlier this year when the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the case.
But with Trump in the White House, state leaders may pivot from challenging the feds in court to seeking their cooperation.
“We would love if the federal government just turned it over to us and said, ‘Here, manage these lands,’” Schultz said. “That’s an option as well. Those are discussions that are happening. Everything is on the table.”

Schultz declined to say which federal officials have been involved in discussions about transferring lands to the state.
Some lawmakers in Wyoming backed a state resolution this year — which ultimately failed — calling on Congress to hand over all federal lands except for Yellowstone National Park. Idaho lawmakers passed a measure calling on the feds to turn over a wildlife refuge to the state. And Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo, a Republican, has called for a “systematic release” of federal land in the state.
But public lands also have many supporters in Western states, including some prominent Republican members of Congress, such as Reps. Mike Simpson of Idaho and Ryan Zinke of Montana. Zinke was Interior secretary for two years during the first Trump administration.
John Leshy, who served as solicitor for the U.S. Department of the Interior during the Clinton administration, said proposals to dispose of federal lands tend to be stymied by fierce public backlash.
“Federal lands are really popular,” he said. “It’s political poison [to sell off public land]. It’s a different West now. Public attitudes have changed.”
Leshy also noted that livestock ranchers especially benefit from discounted lease rates offered by the federal government.
Housing arguments
The most recent clash over the future of federal lands was the amendment sponsored by a pair of congressional Republicans last month. The measure would have directed the Bureau of Land Management to sell more than 500,000 acres of land in Nevada and Utah. Local governments would have been able to buy the land at market value, with no restrictions on how they used it.
Backers said the sale would bring in revenue to cover Trump’s proposed tax cuts, while allowing local governments to build much-needed housing on the parcels. Utah GOP Sen. Mike Lee said he will try to revive the measure as the Senate considers the bill this month, E&E News reported.
Trump wants to log more trees. He’ll need states’ help.

In Nevada, where 85% of land is owned by the federal government, some leaders say their communities are hemmed in by a checkerboard of public lands that constrain development. The city of Fernley, which is growing rapidly, would have acquired 12,000 acres under the proposal.
“We need housing,” said Benjamin Marchant, Fernley’s city manager. “The city can’t plan roads and water lines, sewer lines and gas lines, when you have federal land between two parcels that want to develop. This will bring a practical and helpful consolidation of all these lands into one developable area.”
Nevada leaders have long worked on proposals to transfer some federal lands to local governments and allow for increased growth. But some lawmakers say the latest push bypassed that collaborative process — and failed to include safeguards that the money raised from the sale of the lands would be reinvested into conserving public lands elsewhere.
“It was a complete betrayal of everything we’ve worked on in this state,” said Assemblymember Howard Watts, a Democrat. “This amendment is trying to sell off half a million acres of Nevada’s public lands in order to pay for tax cuts for billionaires. This is not going to address our housing problem. These lands are positioned to be sold off for other forms of development and extraction.”
Similar debates are happening in Utah. In southwestern Utah’s Washington County, local officials say the disposal of federally controlled land could help alleviate the region’s housing crisis and increasingly strained infrastructure.
The county is experiencing rapid population growth — in 2022, St. George, the county seat, was the fastest-growing metro area in America. County and city leaders hoped the amendment would have helped them manage the growth. The measure would have disposed of roughly 11,500 acres of federally controlled land in Utah, selling it at market value to local governments.
The proposal received pushback from all sides, including environmentalists, hunting and fishing groups, House Democrats and even conservatives.
“[The amendment] is consistent with how U.S. Department of the Interior Secretary Burgum thinks about federal public lands, as simply assets on a ledger to be sold off,” said Steve Bloch, legal director for the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, an environmental nonprofit. ” … It’s just antithetical to how Westerners think about the federal public lands that make up so much of our landscape.”

Washington County Commissioner Adam Snow, a Republican, said a lot of the opposition was misguided. The county would have acquired almost half of the land earmarked for disposal, and Snow said much of that would have been used to widen existing roads and construct new ones that are bordered by Bureau of Land Management property.
“These were not pristine wilderness lands. Some of the environmental groups tried to make it sound like we’re selling off Zion National Park, and that’s not even close to true,” Snow said. “If we can just not have to deal with the federal government every time we want to chip seal a road or improve an intersection, that would be really nice. Because we have to ask ‘Mother, may I?’ for everything out here.”
Local leaders say federal parcels could help ease housing pressures as well. Snow said transferring parcels to the city or county is one of the only ways to stop the area from becoming wildly expensive.
“We’re running out of room real quick,” he said. “ … There is still private land to develop, but they’re going to charge an absolute premium.”
The amendment that was stripped from the House bill was widely criticized for not having any restrictions on what could be done with the land.
“There was no language whatsoever that would require Washington County or St. George to do anything with these lands. They could lease them for development. They could sell them outright,” said Bloch.
The costs of management
In Utah, lawmakers have created a state Department of Land Management — essentially a placeholder agency that would be funded and staffed only if their effort to assume control of large swaths of federal land succeeds. Schultz, the House speaker, said the state is committed to keeping the lands in the public domain, reopening roads and campgrounds closed by the feds.
Western states’ budgets, industries rely on federal lands. So does wildlife.

“We’d just take over the job from the federal government,” he said. “It is something that the state absolutely would do, and we’d do it more efficiently, more effectively and we’d have better outcomes.”
Schultz said the state could bring in the revenues needed to manage the land by raising lease prices for oil and gas operations on parcels currently managed for drilling.
But some public lands advocates say that’s not realistic. The federal Bureau of Land Management employed more than 950 people in the state as of 2024, and feds also assume the expensive task of wildfire management on their lands.
“If you look at the history of what Utah has done with their lands, they’ve sold more than half of them,” said Devin O’Dea, Western policy and conservation manager with Backcountry Hunters & Anglers. “We’re certainly of the perspective that states could not handle the economic costs of managing these lands. Their hand would be forced; they would have to sell these lands in order to deal with those costs.”
John Robison, Idaho Conservation League public lands and wildlife director, said Simpson — the Idaho congressman — and the state’s two senators have all won praise from constituents for their work on public lands compromises.
“Savvy Idaho politicians know that public lands are popular,” he said.
But other state leaders insist their governments are better equipped to manage the lands. Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador, a Republican, was among the officials who signed an amicus brief in support of Utah’s lawsuit against the feds.
“We live here, we work here, and we are far better stewards of our forests and resources than federal bureaucrats in Washington,” Labrador said in a statement. “ … If Idaho owned this land, we could lease it for timber, grazing, and mining — just like the federal government does — but reinvest that revenue right here in Idaho.”

Shelley Funke Frommeyer, R-Alexandria, discusses her resolution to establish a Make America Healthy Again Kentucky Task Force to implement the Trump administration's health policies. Feb. 27, 2025. (Kentucky Lantern photo by Sarah Ladd)During the first meeting of the Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) Kentucky Task Force, lawmakers said they want to address food deserts and food quality, childhood obesity, mental health and health care costs, among other things. 
Members and non members had a slew of ideas for what the task force should focus on — including education, diabetes, personal responsibility around health, the importance of physical fitness, agricultural partnerships, chronic illnesses, dental care, cancer and other topics. 
Co-chair Sen. Shelley Funke Frommeyer, R-Alexandria, said the task force could “chase a lot of rabbits” but should stay focused. She and co-chair Rep. Matt Lockett, R-Nicholasville, want to place emphasis on food quality and availability.
In 2023, 753,410 Kentuckians were food insecure, meaning they don’t have enough to eat and may not know where their next meal will come from. Meanwhile, the “big beautiful bill” Republicans in the U.S. House passed in May shifts to state governments some of the cost of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which provides food to low-income Americans.
The Kentucky General Assembly created the MAHA Kentucky Task Force this year as a way to implement the Trump administration’s principles in the commonwealth. 
Hot button topics like fluoridated water will come up during the interim, Funke Frommeyer said, but “I don’t think you’ll hear that in our committee.” In the 2025 session, a bill to make fluoride in water optional in Kentucky passed the House but not the Senate. 
Task force members, in addition to Funke Frommeyer and Lockett, are Sen. Cassie Chambers Armstrong, D-Louisville; Sen. Donald Douglas, R-Nicholasville; Sen. Craig Richardson, R-Hopkinsville; Sen. Phillip Wheeler, R-Pikeville; Rep. Emily Callaway, R-Louisville; Rep. Robert Duvall, R-Bowling Green; Rep. Adam Moore, D-Lexington; and Rep. Marianne Proctor, R-Union. 
Sen. Stephen Meredith, R-Leitchfield, who is not a task force member but shared his thoughts during the Wednesday meeting, said “the work that will be done here will touch every committee that we have in the legislature.” 
“We forget that we don’t live and work in a vacuum, and everybody’s going to be impacted by this, said Meredith, a retired hospital executive. “I’ve been preaching for the last year about the unsustainable growth in health care costs, particularly in the United States. If we don’t get control of this, I truly believe it’s going to cause our economy to collapse.” 
The next task force meeting is July 10 at 3 p.m.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-04 18:54:38+00:00,CT Mirror,Lamont forces legislators to keep elections watchdog independent,Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/04/ct-state-elections-enforcement-commission-seec-approval/,A bill would have subjected the appointment of the director of the CT State Elections Enforcement Commission to legislative approval.,"Facing a potential veto from Gov. Ned Lamont, the General Assembly agreed Wednesday to delete a portion of a bipartisan bill that would have ended a half century of independence by Connecticut’s elections watchdog.
Lamont objected to a portion of Senate Bill 1405 that would have subjected the appointment of an executive director of the State Elections Enforcement Commission to approval by a legislative committee, the House and Senate.
Rather than risk a veto of a bill already approved by both chambers and on its way to Lamont’s desk, legislative leaders agreed to insert language into an unrelated fiscal bill that makes the change sought by Lamont, the League of Women Voters, Common Cause and others.
“We are beyond grateful to the governor for standing up for the independence of the agency and are fully aware, but for the governor defending it, none of these proposals would have happened,” said Clare Kindall, the interim director of SEEC.
The executive director will be limited to serving two four-year terms, however, a limitation not imposed on other watchdog agencies such as the Freedom of Information Commission.
Kindall, the former solicitor general of Connecticut, said the “leadership churn” imposed by the term limits could have a chilling effect on the pool of applicants. She is among those applying for the job.
“I don’t see how that benefits anyone,” Kindall said. “That said, whatever the governor and legislature comes up with, we will live with.”
Kindall had no objections to a requirement that a nominee for director go through a hearing before one of the two committees with cognizance over elections law, the Government Administration and Elections Committee and the Government Oversight Committee.
“They could ask us to come before them any time to talk about the state of the agency,” she said.
The portions of the bill that will remain intact reduce the number of campaigns that can be audited post-election from 50% to 20% and require they be completed in one year.
Kindall, who acknowledged that the commission and General Assembly need to rebuild what has become a fraught relationship in the past decade, said she had hoped that the governor would veto SB 1405 and allow a cooling off period.
“We would prefer [it] to be vetoed and just see if we can’t get every one to calm down and see if we can’t reset the relationship,” she said.
The original bill was the product of mounting legislative grievances and frustrations with the State Elections Enforcement Commission, which enforces election laws and administers the Citizens’ Election Program, a 20-year-old reform that created a voluntary system of publicly financing campaigns for state office.
Lawmakers complained that SEEC staff was slow last year to review and approve applications for public financing grants, which require candidates to raise qualifying small-dollar donations, mostly from the communities in their legislative districts. Without presenting evidence, some Republicans claimed their applications were unfairly scrutinized.
The vast majority of legislative candidates use public financing.
Candelora said he was most concerned that public financing grants, which have become nearly universal in General Assembly races, are processed fairly and quickly.
“We are sort of requiring people to participate in the public financing process in order to run for elections,” Candelora said. “We want to make sure that everybody has equal access to that, and if the process isn’t working properly, it interferes with democracy. So I think the intentions have been good.”
The agency is overseen by five commissioners, one each appointed by the governor and the leaders of the four legislative caucuses: the House Democrats, House Republicans, Senate Democrats and Senate Republicans. The commission has sole authority to hire and fire the executive director.
The original bill was negotiated by the four caucus leaders, although House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, and House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, said demand for legislative approval of the director’s hiring was initiated by the Senate.
Senate leaders said the change keeping the executive director’s hiring independent of lawmakers was unnecessary but acceptable.
“I felt what we passed was fine,” said Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff, D-Norwalk. “I think this is a reasonable compromise. I have no problem with it.”
Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, said he would have preferred retaining the legislative approval of the director.
“I still would like to see continuous legislative approval, but as I understand it, it’s a compromise.”
The Senate approved the bill 34-1. But the House vote was 92-46, with all the “no” votes cast by Democrats — a protest to the provision the governor successfully urged them to remove.
Last week, the former executive director of the State Elections Enforcement Commission, Jeffrey Garfield, urged Lamont to either veto SB 1405 or demand the change that was being made Wednesday.
“Sadly, the commission’s independence is again under attack,” Garfield said. “We must continue to fight for the agency’s independence, its funding and its future.”
The occasion was the 50th anniversary of the creation of SEEC, one of the reforms adopted after the Watergate scandal, and the 20th anniversary of the public financing law passed after a bid-rigging scandal forced the resignation of Gov.

(Matthew Perschall for Louisiana Illuminator) After former LSU President William Tate abruptly departed campus for the same job at Rutgers University in New Jersey, political forces began jockeying to posture their preferred replacements to take the prized office. 
LSU’s faculty will expect Tate’s replacement to have an academic background, including the highest degree, a body of research and time as a faculty member. But politically-appointed university board members are mulling names without this pedigree, including those at the highest echelons of elected office in Louisiana. 
Before the LSU Board of Supervisors can take action on a replacement, two questions must be settled: Will Tate, who served as both president of the LSU System and chancellor of the Baton Rouge campus, be replaced by one person or two? And what kind of search will the board undertake?
Earlier this year, two board members confirmed to the Illuminator the possibility of splitting the president and chancellor roles is being discussed.  The two positions were combined in 2012. The uncertainty could impact the pool of candidates, as some applicants might not want to take a job that could be split in two. 
The effort to split the job is spearheaded by LSU Board Vice Chairman Lee Mallett, a Republican mega-donor from Lake Charles. He said the combined roles have not served the university well.
“We’ve tried it for over a decade, and I believe the results speak for themselves,” Mallett said in an emailed statement. “When a university is large, complex, and multifaceted, leadership must be distributed.” 
LSU Board Chairman Scott Ballard, who was a member of the board in 2012 when the merger occurred, is generally opposed to splitting the roles again. He said in an interview he might consider dividing the jobs as “there may be a reason to,” though he did not elaborate on what that reason would be. 
Ballard said the board will soon announce a search committee, which he predicted would work over the next six months or so to conduct a nationwide search for Tate’s replacement. Such a move could ease fears among some faculty who thought the board might choose and coronate a successor without their input. 
Though Tate’s successor could very well be a top administrator at an out-of-state university, there are some in-state names circulating. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Matt Lee  
Matt Lee, LSU’s vice president for agriculture and dean of its College of Agriculture, currently serves as interim president while the search plays out. An academic with an aptitude for politics, he could be seen as the compromise candidate. 
Lee got his Ph.D. from LSU before joining the faculty at Mississippi State for five years, after which he returned to LSU. In Baton Rouge, he earned the rank of full professor before making the jump to administration. 
Lee’s work as a sociologist has mostly focused on crime, and his publications have touched on Louisiana themes, including the aftermath of the BP-Deepwater Horizon oil spill and Hurricane Katrina. 
Lee previously served as interim provost before Tate ultimately hired Roy Haggerty, who is also on his way out to take the same job at Oregon State University. Though being made vice president for agriculture might have been a consolation prize, the position better serves him if his goal is to replace Tate. 
Lee has not responded to questions about whether he intends to apply for the job. 
Leading the LSU AgCenter, which has a presence in all 64 parishes — and by extension, every legislative district — means Lee has had the opportunity to form connections with lawmakers and other public officials. 
His political clout, his academic pedigree and his general affability could make him the choice who would make the most people happy. 
Wade Rousse 
Wade Rousse has served as president of McNeese State in Lake Charles for just over a year. Before taking the job, he had worked several other administrative jobs at the school since 2019. 
Rousse is the candidate favored by Mallett, who is a Lake Charles resident. 
“Dr. Rousse will stand on his own two feet,” Mallett said. “If he chooses to enter this process, I am confident in his ability to rise to the top based on merit, leadership, and qualifications.” 
In an emailed comment, Rousse did not confirm or deny his interest in the position. 
“While I am flattered that my name was mentioned as a candidate for its presidency, I remain laser-focused on building on our successes at McNeese State, where we have right-sized the university, stabilized our finances and reversed a 14-year enrollment decline,” Rousse said. 
While Rousse has a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Illinois Chicago and some experience as an adjunct professor, he does not have the typical academic background expected of the president of a major research institution. And with just one year of experience running a regional university — with very different goals than an institution that spends over $500 million annually on research —- higher education observers question whether his administrative knowledge is enough to make up for his lack of academic experience. 
Julia Letlow 
U.S. Rep. Julia Letlow, R-Start, is rumored to be the most-favored political candidate for the job. 
Letlow has represented Louisiana’s 5th Congressional district since 2021. Her district was redrawn in 2024 to include LSU, where she held her re-election victory party last year. 
Letlow has a Ph.D. in communications from South Florida University and worked in administrative jobs at the University of Louisiana at Monroe before joining Congress. A finalist for the ULM presidency in 2020, she was passed over for Ronald Berry.
In remarks to students visiting her during Washington Mardi Gras earlier this year, Letlow described applying for the job as one of the most terrifying experiences of her life. 
“It was horrible and the faculty were terrible to me,” Letlow said. “I didn’t get it, and that was so good … because it was preparing me for the next step.” 
Letlow spokesman Matt Smith declined to comment for this story. 
Like McNeese, UL-Monroe is a regional non-research university. While Letlow might have the favor of the political class, the fact she was passed over for that job raises questions for faculty as to what makes her qualified to lead a much larger, much more research-focused institution. 
That could change if the LSU board ends up splitting the two jobs. While faculty would be unlikely to back Letlow for chancellor, she wouldn’t necessarily need to win their support to be successful as the system president, which is a much more political and administrative position. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Bill Cassidy 
U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-Baton Rouge, is another rumored political pick for the job. He is currently in a fight for his political life in next year’s election after voting to convict President Donald Trump for his actions in the attempted insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021. 
Though Cassidy might find an easy out — and a much higher paycheck — leading his alma mater, he said in an interview that he’s focused on re-election. 
A two-time LSU graduate, Cassidy is a physician and was on its medical school faculty for many years before starting his political career. 
The theory of Cassidy as a potential successor is predicated on the idea that getting Cassidy out of the U.S. Senate race would be a political boon for Trump-aligned conservatives who want to replace him with a more favorable Republican. 
The desired political domino effect is not unprecedented in Louisiana higher education. Just last year, Gov. Jeff Landry threw his support behind state Supreme Court Justice Jimmy Genovese to become president of Northwestern State University. That allowed a Landry-backed candidate to run and win Genovese’s seat on the high court. 
Other rumored names 
Though they were both finalists for the job in 2021, former Lt. Gov. Jay Dardenne and current Louisiana Tech President Jim Henderson are very unlikely to enter the fray again. 
While Dardenne is a Republican, his endorsement of former democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Landry foe, and a subsequent eight years of service as Edwards’ budget chief, makes him a non-starter with the Landry-controlled LSU Board of Supervisors. If his political disadvantage wasn’t enough, Dardenne’s lack of an academic background also puts him at odds with faculty expectations. 
Dardenne is a two time LSU graduate, earning his undergraduate in mass communications and a J.D. from the Law Center. 
Though he was passed over for the job previously, Dardenne, who was previously LSU student body president and a student member on the board of supervisors, has remained ubiquitous at LSU events, always dressed in purple and gold. That is unlikely to change. 
Henderson served as president of the University of Louisiana System from 2017-23 and has been president of Louisiana Tech since then. He laughed when contacted about the possibility of him succeeding Tate and said he was happy where he is. 
Though Henderson has experience running a research institution and plenty of political allies, his candidacy would come at the same time LSU is taking back control of the fiscally embattled University of New Orleans from the University of Louisiana System. That could prompt uncomfortable questions for Henderson about his knowledge of the crisis when he led the UL System. 
And though he has a doctor of management from the University of Maryland, Henderson is not an academic and has never held a faculty job. He was also handed the Tech job under unusual circumstances, without a search committee or faculty feedback. Both factors could impact his standing in the eyes of LSU faculty.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/3-20-23_LSU_MP-12-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-04 15:15:16.481425

(Madelyn Hanes/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Hundreds of Hoosiers die each year in traffic collisions and thousands more are seriously injured. Numbers have fallen slightly but Indiana traffic safety groups are working to bring that number down even further statewide. 
According to the Indiana Criminal Justice Institute, traffic fatalities decreased to 894 in 2023 compared to 985 fatalities in 2022. Another 4,232 Hoosiers were seriously injured in traffic crashes in 2023 while 5443 were seriously injured in traffic crashes in 2022. 
Indianapolis-based nonprofit Health by Design is partnering with the Institute to expand its Indiana Road to Zero Academy, aiming to reduce serious traffic crashes and fatalities across the state. 
Solutions include tactical urbanism, which uses street murals, separators and pedestrian-only lanes to slow down traffic and accommodate bikes, wheelchairs and strollers. 
“Streets need to be rebuilt every year,” said Andrea Watts, Health by Design’s communications and policy manager. “We want to rebuild them right, but not just car orientated infrastructure — safe streets for everyone.”
Launched in 2022 with funding from the National Safety Council and Road to Zero Coalition, the academy initially offered virtual training over several weeks, spreading awareness and knowledge to various stakeholders working to improve Indiana’s roadway. Now backed by the Indiana Criminal Justice Institute Traffic Safety Improvement Program, the program is shifting gears. 
The Indiana Road to Zero Academy plans to offer two in-person regional training workshops — one in northern Indiana and one in southern Indiana — in mid- or late September. These hands-on sessions will teach the safe system approach: safe roads, safe speeds, and safe road users. It is designed for municipal staff, planners, engineers, safety advocates, and residents. 
“Northern and southern Indiana were hungry to get this rolling,” Watts said.
The expanded academy also introduces a statewide Vision Zero Working Group, building on the Indianapolis Vision Zero Ordinance adopted in August 2024. Vision Zero prioritizes eliminating traffic deaths and serious injuries through smarter road designs that ensure safe travel for pedestrians, cyclists and drivers alike.
 Health by Design will provide customized crash analysis and technical assistance to high-risk areas, partnering with data experts and EMS records to track fatal crashes and identify solutions. 
The group has also teamed up with the Indiana Department of Transportation and the Department of Health to improve community safety. One of their initiatives, the Safe Routes to School program, is open to all Indiana schools — regardless of federal funding — and encourages more students to walk or bike safely to class.
Through this program, the organization supports schools through grants such as one for bike helmets. Most recently, they supported Fort Wayne students participating in Bike-to-School Day, Watts said. 
Despite challenges from recent federal funding cuts and changes, the organization remains committed to enhancing traffic safety. Proposed federal funding cuts on green infrastructure attacks a lot of the work the nonprofit does, Watts said. Following threats to federal funding, state partnerships are becoming even more important. 
“It has impacted us and we had to get more creative,” Watts said. “There’s an attack on a lot of the work we do and it feels like a step backward or we are stuck in time.”

Garrison, who’s farmed in Pendelton since graduating from Clemson in 1980, was among the group who pushed for a 2017 law that allowed farmers in the state to grow hemp, a plant that’s the same species as marijuana but lacks the THC that gets people high.
Despite being one of the state’s hemp pioneers, he abandoned the crop after just two seasons. He didn’t even seek a permit in 2020. Garrison told the SC Daily Gazette his venture into hemp was probably the worst in his 45 years as a farmer.
It’s a risk that Garrison estimates cost him more than $100,000 in unused crops, equipment and time spent, said the 67-year-old son of the late state Sen. T. Ed Garrison, namesake of the livestock arena at Clemson. He declined to specify how much he lost.
“It was not a very good experience,” he said.
Hemp was supposed to be the next moneymaker for South Carolina farmers. And once they were able, the farmhands flocked to the opportunity.
Many suffered similar fates to Garrison.
Farmers and lawmakers described the hemp industry as an unregulated battle for survival, where supply ultimately outweighed the demand, causing many to ditch the crop altogether.
“It was like the Wild West,” Garrison recently told the SC Daily Gazette.
From 20 to 265
After the 2017 law passed, 20 farmers received a permit to grow hemp on a maximum 20 acres each in the state’s pilot program. More than 100 applicants were denied. Among the 20 were Danny Ford, Clemson’s first national championship football coach, and former state Rep. Chip Limehouse.
The pilot program created by the 2017 law allowed a doubling in 2019 to 40 permits farming 40 acres each.
But in the wake of the 2018 federal farm bill that legalized the crop nationwide, the Legislature passed another law in March 2019 that deleted the constraints and allowed the state Department of Agriculture to issue licenses to any farmer who met the legal criteria.
The agency ended up giving 161 permits for the 2019 crop. For 2020, the number rocketed to 265.
But this year, the number of farmers with permits is down to 80.

It’s unclear how many of those 80 farmers actually grow hemp. Some of the farmers go through the process to get licensed, which costs about $600 and involves a background check. But they aren’t planting hemp. They’re just keeping their options open.
Among the factors that could have affected a desire to grow the crop was the 2019 arrest of Lowcountry farmer John Trenton Pendarvis.
Law enforcement claimed his 10 acres of hemp in Harleyville were unregistered and mowed it down the same day.
Pendarvis, the first person charged with violating the state’s hemp-growing law, filed a lawsuit against the State Law Enforcement Division, including SLED Chief Mark Keel in his official capacity, Attorney General Alan Wilson and others.
The suit led to SLED being forced to pay more than $11,000 in attorney fees to Pendarvis in 2023 for its handling of the lawsuit’s discovery process. A SLED spokesperson declined the allegations at the time.
The mess could have deterred farmers who were worried about being targeted, said state Sen. Brad Hutto, Pendarvis’ lawyer.
“I think it definitely had a chilling effect,” Hutto, D-Orangeburg, told the SC Daily Gazette. “They put a farmer in jail when he was growing a legal crop.”
The case is ongoing. Hutto doesn’t expect a resolution until at least late summer.
When South Carolina first permitted farmers to grow hemp, lawmakers and farmers thought they were getting in on the next big cash crop.
Most farmers have a primary crop that they make money on. Hemp was supposed to provide a year-round option to grow for lots of different uses, including clothing, food, textiles and even paper.
Encouraging its growth was supposed to allow farmers to continue profiting at times when their main crop could not grow, said House Majority Leader Davey Hiott, who chaired the House agriculture committee when the hemp laws passed.
“It was supposed to help them make a little bit of money,” said the Pickens Republican.
A decade ago, Hiott was eager to see farmers capitalize on the industrial use of hemp, such as clothing. In 2017, Pickens County was home to 740 farms, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture,
“It started that way. It didn’t end that way,” Hiott said.

CBD Problems
In 2014, the Legislature passed a law legalizing the sale of CBD, or cannabidiol, a hemp-derived, non-psychoactive oil used for various ailments. But that state law was very limited, authorizing it only for patients diagnosed with severe epilepsy.
After the 2018 federal law broadened what was legal, farmers saw an opportunity. And the large majority of hemp growers in the state wanted in.
And that’s when problems started, farmers told the Gazette.
James Fairey, a 50-year-old from Williamston, started growing hemp in 2020, the state’s peak for permits.
Even after others bowed out of the industry, he continued to grow. After four years of losing money, he finally turned a profit on the crop in 2024. He credits a gradually growing customer base and a willingness to learn along the way for reversing his fortunes.
The biggest difference between him and most growers, he said, is he started growing hemp because he believes in the ailment-relieving health benefits of CBD. The money was secondary.
“The only currencies that matter are health and kindness, and that’s what I provide,” Fairey said.
When hemp growers first started growing, the biomass material used for CBD could be sold for up to $60 a pound, DeWitt said. A couple of years later, farmers were offered as little as $5 per pound.
“Nobody wants to grow something they can’t sell,” DeWitt said.
If the market changes, licensed farmers who are sitting on the sidelines may jump back in.
“Some of them have planted very little, but there’s no penalty for not planting it,” Dewitt said.  
Other early hemp growers included Cannalina Hemp Company, formerly known as Charleston Hemp Company.
The company started in 2018 and grew its own hemp, while operating a storefront.
In 2020, the decision was made to stop growing the crop.
“There was an oversupply of the market, and the prices collapsed,” said Lina Wu, the company’s owner.
However, there was still money to be made in selling the CBD gummies, oils, vapes, lotions, and other edibles.
The Cannalina Hemp Company’s Goose Creek retail location is open and operating. It has a loyal customer base, buys from numerous South Carolina hemp growers and prides itself on carrying quality products at an affordable price, according to its Facebook profile.
However, there are “a lot cheaper products out there, especially in gas stations,” Wu said.
When asked if the business would ever return to growing its own hemp, Wu said now is not the time.
“There’s too many growers on the market,” she said.
Kurt Brower, the co-owner of Carolina Botanicals, echoed a similar sentiment after losing about $200,000 in his venture. Though the company maintains a hemp license, it doesn’t make economic sense to grow hemp right now, he said.
Brower now focuses on processing biomass for farmers into products they can sell, as well as selling their own products.
The 27-year-old said he previously bought hemp exclusively from South Carolina farmers, but as the number of producers has dropped, he’s had to start buying from farmers in neighboring Georgia and North Carolina.
“There’s no outlet of sale on the hemp side” for farmers, he said. “It put a chokehold” on growers.
What’s Next
Hiott, the House majority leader, said hemp is no longer on his radar.
Eva Moore, a spokesperson with the state Department of Agriculture, said recruitment isn’t a problem, farmers are often intrigued by growing hemp. But a shift from CBD to growing hemp for fiber or grain would open up new economic opportunities.
Moore said she’s heard reports that processors are still sitting on hemp they bought in 2022.
“The market has not been great for farmers,” Moore said. “Whether you’re growing cotton, peaches, or hemp, you have to be able to make a living doing it.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_7899-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-06-04 15:15:16.481425

Ron DeSantis, received unanimous approval from the Florida Board of Education Wednesday to serve as the state’s next education commissioner. 
Florida’s education commissioner plays a major role shaping education policy in a state that has drawn national attention for its contentious policies on library book removals, and diversity, equity, and inclusion, as well as its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.
“If given this opportunity, you can rest assured that I will take the baton and continue to run the race,” Kamoutsas told the Board of Education Wednesday morning. 
Education commissioner to leave post, become interim president at University of West Florida

He started at the Department of Education in 2019, serving as general counsel and eventually as chief of staff, before joining the governor’s office in 2023. 
DeSantis came out in full support of Kamoutsas Tuesday, saying “Stasi Kamoutsas has delivered on important issues like parental rights, school choice, and fighting back against radical ideologies in education.”
The job opened after Education Commissioner Manny Diaz Jr. was named interim president of the University of West Florida. He will take that job in July, making Wednesday’s meeting likely his last as commissioner. 
Kamoutsas’ approval as commissioner is contingent on Diaz being named the official president of UWF after a search, board Chair Ben Gibson said.

History
“A lot of times in these situations, we are taking somewhat of a leap of faith in having a commissioner come in, … Here we have an opportunity, members, I believe, to choose someone we don’t have to guess, really, how they’re going to perform,” Gibson said. “And someone who’s been in the trenches at every level of the department, has been involved in every major education decision that the state of Florida has made over the last six years.”
During the public comment period, political figures lined up to praise Kamoutsas, including Florida International University President and former Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nuñez, New College of Florida President and former Education Commissioner Richard Corcoran, former House Speaker Jose Oliva, and Broward County College President Torey Alston.
“If I had to use one world to describe him, I’d say he’s relentless,” Oliva said, while others praised him for his work ethic and family values. 
“What’s been the gem that’s been hiding in the background is coming public,” Diaz said, attesting to Kamoutsas’ involvement in previous policies and actions by the department. 
“He understands that history because he’s been present for a good amount of it inside the department, inside the governor’s office, but he’s heard the battle stories from President Corcoran, from Speaker Oliva, from Chancellor [Ray] Rodrigues, from myself, so he understands the history and where we came from in this reform, and he’s perfectly equipped and willing to continue it,” Diaz said. 
In addition to pledging to fight for parental involvement in the education system, Kamoutsas appealed to teachers, too.
“Teachers, you have my word that I stand in support of you. Whether that’s maintaining discipline in your classrooms or working with the governor on continued pay increases, know that I have your back,” Kamoutsas said. 
The Washington Post reported in 2023 that Kamoutsas, who worked in the governor’s office, was responsible for denying a pending promotion to a Florida Department of Law Enforcement attorney who advocated for the governor’s travel records to be public. The attorney “was not on our team,” the paper reported Kamoutsas as saying.
The push to hide details of the governor’s travel records came before DeSantis ran to be the GOP nominee for U.S. president.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-04 18:21:21+00:00,CT Mirror,"CT legislators to hospitals: Trust us on taxes, again",Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/04/ct-legislators-hospital-tax-hike/,CT legislators are out of time to shrink a $375 million hospital tax hike down to $285 million but promised to before it takes effect in 2026.,"Legislators on Wednesday asked Connecticut’s hospitals, which sued the state over escalating taxes 10 years ago, to trust them with their money one more time.
House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said Wednesday that legislators, due to a lack of time, couldn’t shrink an approved $375 million hospital tax hike down to $285 million before the General Assembly’s mandatory adjournment deadline at midnight.
But the tax increase, part of a complex plan to help hospitals and the state financially, doesn’t take effect until July 2026. The speaker offered assurances that the industry wouldn’t be harmed.
“If there’s any concern in hospital land that the state is somehow going to do them wrong, I just don’t see that happening,” Ritter said. “We’re going to want to get to a fair deal for everybody.”
Connecticut has been levying a providers tax on hospitals since 2011. But for some of that history, it was a tax in name only, designed chiefly to increase federal aid.
As originally conceived, the industry would pay $350 million per year to the state, which redistributed those funds, plus more, back to hospitals. That exchange, legally, counted as public health spending and entitled Connecticut to extra Medicaid reimbursements from Washington.
Hospitals and the state came out ahead, all both sides were happy — but not for long.
As Connecticut struggled with budget deficits for much of the 2010s, it gradually took more from hospitals and returned less.
The industry, which sued the state in federal court in 2015, was losing $436 million under this modified taxing scheme by 2017.
Lamont settled the lawsuit upon taking office in January 2019, and he and lawmakers approved a plan to gradually move the tax back to its original win-win format.
But when President Donald J. Trump and Congress targeted Medicaid earlier this year for cuts worth hundreds of billions over the next decade, Connecticut officials feared the provider tax arrangement — which most states follow — might be capped, reduced or eliminated altogether.
Still, state officials hoped to boost the tax, and federal aid, one more time this year.
Lamont proposed increasing the hospital tax, which currently collects $820 million from facilities, by another $140 million. The Democratic-controlled legislature upped the ante, pitching a $375 million increase. The hope is this will trigger at least $94 million in extra federal Medicaid reimbursements.
That projection and the $375 million tax increase were built into the new $55.8 billion two-year state budget the General Assembly adopted Tuesday.
But hospital officials had warned Lamont Tuesday morning that they believe any hike beyond $285 million would surpass existing federal limits on the provider tax system. Any state increase needs approval by federal Medicaid administrators before it can be applied.
Both Ritter and Lamont’s budget spokesman, Chris Collibee, said the state still could negotiate a $285 million tax increase with federal Medicaid officials this summer, regardless of the increase listed in the adopted state budget, and simply have state legislators adjust it in statute later.
“We have assured [the Connecticut Hospital Association] that the hospitals will be treated equitably,” Collibee said.
Connecticut legislators are expected to return in special session this summer or fall to adjust the state budget to compensate for likely cuts in federal aid. And since the hospital tax increase wouldn’t begin for 13 more months, legislators could adjust the tax then, or even during the regular 2026 session, which starts in early February.
“The provider tax is very important to everybody,” Ritter added.
But House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, said Lamont and the legislature’s Democratic majority handled the hospital tax in disorganized manner.
“I am puzzled by the fact that the administration has never prioritized that [tax issue] to get it done before the budget was passed,” he said.
The hospital association wrote in a brief statement Wednesday that “Making the tax adjustment in the budget remains important to Connecticut hospitals. We are meeting with legislators and staff to discuss further.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025_0227_SR_ER_043-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-04 15:15:16.481425

(Faith Miller/Colorado Newsline)Colorado State Treasurer Dave Young on Wednesday became the fourth prominent Democrat to throw his hat in the ring for Colorado’s highly competitive 8th Congressional District.
“The residents of Colorado’s 8th District are worried about their economic future — and rightfully so,” Young said in a statement announcing his candidacy. “I’m running for Congress to stand up for working families, protect the programs they count on, and ensure our economy works for everyone, not just the wealthy few.

The 8th District is Colorado’s newest, most competitive and most diverse congressional seat. Drawn by an independent redistricting commission in 2021, it includes parts of Denver’s northern suburbs as well as more rural areas in southern Weld County. Four in 10 residents of the district are Latino.
The seat is currently held by U.S. Rep. Gabe Evans, a Fort Lupton Republican who unseated former Democratic Rep. Yadira Caraveo by a margin of fewer than 2,500 votes in the 2024 election. Despite representing one of the nation’s most evenly divided congressional districts, Evans has remained a steadfast supporter of President Donald Trump’s historically extreme anti-immigration agenda, his chaotic efforts to launch a global trade war and a sweeping GOP budget bill that would cut $625 billion from Medicaid.
Caraveo has launched a bid to win back her seat in 2026, joining a Democratic primary that also includes state Reps. Manny Rutinel of Commerce City and Shannon Bird of Westminster.
Young’s campaign announcement noted that he is the only Democratic primary candidate to hail from the district’s more conservative half in Weld County, calling him the Democrat “best positioned to win this seat back.” And it blasted Evans’ support for a package of deep cuts to Medicaid, which provides coverage to more than 1 in 4 of the 8th District’s residents.
“This is personal to me. My sister has severe developmental disabilities, and has been reliant on life sustaining support provided by Medicaid for much of her life,” Young said. “Congressman Gabe Evans and his GOP allies just voted to slash Medicaid benefits, which will impact tens of thousands of people in this district, as well as millions of others including people like my sister.”
“Colorado’s 8th Congressional District deserves a representative who shows up, listens, and delivers,” he added. “I’ve spent my life making government work better for people, and I’m ready to bring that same energy and experience to Washington.”

She wasn’t the only one getting kids out of the house, recalled Latosha Travis, a Jackson Public Schools child nutrition manager working with the district’s summer feeding program who oversaw the cafeteria at Key last year. 
“Kids gonna eat you out of house and home during the summer,” Travis said.

Starting this week through June 27, anyone under 18 years old can stop by one of 12 schools in Jackson for a free breakfast from 7 a.m. to 8:30 a.m. and lunch from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m., regardless of whether or not they attend Jackson Public Schools. Adults can buy a meal for $4. 
The district’s federally funded program, now in its 33rd year, is intended to combat the rise in hunger that occurs during the summer, an issue of particular concern in Jackson, where the childhood poverty rate is just over 40%. 
“I put a little extra on their plate from time to time, knowing this is the only meal many of them will have today,” Travis said. 
JPS anticipates serving 18,000 breakfasts and 25,000 lunches this month, said Marc Rowe, the district’s executive director of child nutrition. He noted this is a different program from the one Mississippi opted out of last year due in part to a lack of funding from the state’s welfare agency. 
“Just like anything else in the climate we live in, at any point the funding could be pulled for this,” Rowe said. 
The district doesn’t track who is eating the meals, only how many are served. Travis, who has worked in the district’s cafeterias for 16 years, said schools situated in neighborhoods are more likely to serve families during the summer. 
“It depends on the location,” Travis said. “You see a lot of them come off the street with their children and cousins, little nieces and little babies and stuff. They all come through the line.”

Many of the meals will be served to children enrolled in local daycare centers or attending JPS’s summer camps, such as one that started this week at North Jackson Elementary School near the Tougaloo community. The program is limited to June due to JPS starting its school year earlier this year at the end of July. In prior years, the district served meals through mid-July.
Around 7:45 a.m., kids walked in with sleepy faces and colorful backpacks half the size of their bodies. Teachers said good morning and asked if they were eating breakfast, which was a sausage, egg and cheese burrito with taco sauce, a Pop-Tart, and orange juice or milk. 
Diamond Harris, who had brought a group of students for breakfast from the daycare at Caiden’s Christian Academy, said she sometimes cooks for her kids, which can be a heavy lift. “So it’s definitely beneficial for us and less stressful, and we are just really grateful,” she said.
The meals are based on USDA recipes, and the district also works with a food company, Walker Quality Services, to serve children healthy meals, Rowe said. When school is out, students might have junk food as their only option, which is why research has shown that as hunger spikes in the summer, so does obesity. 
“So the meals are very attractive, appetizing,” Rowe said. 
As part of her menu planning, Travis said she tries to introduce kids to food they haven’t tried before. Each meal comes with a fruit. Today it was plums for breakfast and watermelon for lunch. 
“A lot of kids don’t really know what a plum is,” she said. 
But it can be a challenge to get children to try food they aren’t used to, Travis said. During the school year, she’s at Green Elementary School off Hanging Moss Road, but she’s managed cafeterias all over the district, including at high schools. 
“Elementary children are more easy going and sweet and they love to eat,” she said. “High school students, they are very, very picky. They like a lot of hamburgers and fries. When you put down spaghetti you have to convince them to try. They’re used to fast food.” 
She also tries to feed kids meals from different cultures, so lunch at North Jackson tomorrow will be General Tso’s chicken and rice. 
Meals are available from 7 a.m.-8:30 a.m. and 11 a.m.-1 p.m at the following JPS Summer Feeding Program schools:

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-04 17:07:29+00:00,CT Mirror,"An LTCI bill may die in the House, despite unanimous Senate vote",Jenna Carlesso,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/04/ct-long-term-care-insurance-bill-house-vote/,Sources say lawmakers planned to filibuster the bill after the insurance sector registered its dissent with a public hearing provision in it.,"Last week, senators intent on boosting transparency around long-term care insurance price hikes passed a bill that requires insurers to hold public hearings whenever they raise rates by more than 10%.
The measure, introduced as a strike-all amendment on the Senate floor Wednesday — a rewrite of another bill that also includes incentives for high performing nursing homes — cleared the chamber with unanimous support.
“Consumers need to be aware of increases over 10% and really have the ability to tell their stories, to tell the companies directly how this will affect them,” said Sen. Jan Hochadel, D-Meriden, co-chair of the Aging Committee. “Companies should also want the opportunity to explain why the rate increases are necessary. It’s making them accountable, but also transparent.”
In follow-up speeches, a Republican lawmaker and the Senate’s majority leader both expressed enthusiastic support for the proposal.
But within 24 hours, the bill appeared dead on arrival in the House.
A contingent of Republican legislators and at least one moderate Democrat planned to filibuster, according to people with knowledge of the discussions. The move apparently came after representatives for the insurance sector registered their dissent.
A lobbyist for companies selling long-term care insurance policies confirmed he reached out to House lawmakers expressing opposition to the bill.
“We don’t hold public hearings; governmental entities hold public hearings,” said Eric George, president of the Insurance Association of Connecticut, which lobbies on behalf of the carriers. “We would have concerns with any requirement that we — private insurance companies — hold public hearings.”

Lawmakers in the House who had planned to take up the bill early this week said they were frustrated with the turn of events.
“There was nothing specific on how the companies needed to do this. They could do a regional meeting. They could partner with area agencies on aging and do five public hearings a year; at each one share what’s coming up,” said Rep. Jane Garibay, D-Windsor, co-chair of the Aging Committee. “We left it wide open.”
Hochadel, a key backer of the measure in the Senate, said she was blindsided by the pushback in the House.
“I’m shocked that they waited until it got out of the Senate to say, ‘Oh no, I have some issues with it,’” she said. “We wanted to try and give something back to the policyholders, because the rates keep increasing, and some of these people are dropping their plans after paying for years and years.
“We’re having a difficult budget year, so I understand that giving a tax credit or an exemption – things like that – are difficult,” she said, referring to other policies proposed this session. “That’s why I wanted to get some small portion adopted.”
Hochadel said the public hearing requirement would enhance transparency in the rate setting process without costing a lot of money. Proposals to offer policyholders a tax credit or tax deduction would have cost tens of millions of dollars.
“It seems like a very easy ask,” she said. “If you’re going to raise a policy by more than 10%, all you have to do is hold a public forum. … I am assuming some folks on the other side of the aisle are looking to help the insurance companies.
“These folks need some help, some relief,” she said of the policyholders. “It just boggles my mind.”
Earlier this year, lobbyists for the insurance companies testified against a volley of legislation that would help consumers with long-term care coverage, from capping annual rate increases to issuing consumer notifications with warnings about price hikes.
They opposed public hearing requirements in several bills this year and in previous years.
“I don’t think it’s in the consumers’ best interest to extend the period of time it takes to get products to the market,” George told The Connecticut Mirror when asked previously about resistance to public hearings.
“You would be adding to the bureaucracy of how this process goes. You already have the department approving the rates. I don’t see how the benefit would balance out the delay.”
House Minority Leader Vincent Candelora, R-North Branford, said he was unaware of the filibuster threat.
“Generally speaking, public hearings are fine to have,” Candelora said. “The problem we’ve seen with long-term care insurance rates is, the way they’re actuarially done, they’ve continued to increase and outpace people’s ability to pay. And it’s just something the legislature and the state have never been able to get their arms around.
“I think it’s a critical issue that we do need to tackle.”
Rep. Matt Blumenthal, D-Stamford, who himself introduced legislation this year to help LTCI policyholders, questioned the opposition to public hearings.
“There are a lot of vested interests [and people] who don’t want things to change. It’s a complex industry and a powerful industry,” he said. “I don’t understand why you’d be opposed to a public hearing if you’re willing to stand behind your rate increase requests and think they’re justified.”
Nearly 100,000 people in Connecticut have long-term care insurance — coverage that, depending on the policy, supports skilled in-home care, rehabilitation therapy, assisted living, nursing home stays and respite care.
A CT Mirror investigation found the annual cost of maintaining these policies has skyrocketed for many residents due to miscalculations by insurers on how long people would live, the price of care and how many would need it. Consumers face sizable rate increases, often exceeding 50% and, for a few dozen people, as high as 174%, according to a CT Mirror analysis.
A review of rate hikes from January 2019 to October 2024 shows more than 17,000 people with long-term care policies have gotten hit with increases of 50% or more. Some of the biggest companies in the market, including Genworth Financial, Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and Transamerica Life Insurance Company, requested hikes for five years in a row beginning in 2019.
When providers seek premium increases, thousands of consumers can be affected. In 2019, for example, Genworth Financial requested a 40% rate hike on more than 9,000 Connecticut policyholders. In 2021, Transamerica requested a 20% rate increase on 8,000 policies. The Insurance Department approved both requests with no changes.
In 2022, Genworth raised rates for more than 2,000 people by an average of 97%, with increases ranging from 79% to 173%, depending on the policy. The approved amounts were a slight reduction from the company’s original request.
As consumers are squeezed, grievances filed with the Connecticut Insurance Department have mounted. The office received more than 700 complaints in the last six years about long-term care insurance, mostly rising premiums.
Solutions have been elusive. Legislators introduced more than 50 bills from 2019 to 2024, with only a small number passing and offering limited relief. They blamed budget constraints and pushback from insurers, among other problems.
Legislative efforts impacted by costs and fierce opposition
Five wide ranging bills were advanced by legislative committees this session, with lawmakers pledging urgent reform.
But substantial costs associated with some solutions and sharp opposition to others slowed progress.
Measures that would give policyholders a financial break in the form of a tax credit or tax deduction hit a wall due to sizable costs. Estimates by the state’s Office of Fiscal Analysis put the price of one tax credit at $67.2 million and a tax deduction at $20.2 million.
Despite Connecticut being on pace to close this fiscal year with the second-largest surplus in state history — a nearly $2.4 billion windfall according to Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration — officials were wary of providing tax relief in the state budget.
Given ongoing congressional efforts to make unprecedented cuts in Medicaid, lawmakers fear Connecticut stands to lose hundreds of millions of dollars annually.
Legislators also proposed 10% caps on annual rate increases, public hearings, consumer notifications warning of the risk of large premium increases, and a sweeping audit of the state’s regulation of long-term care insurance. Other measures would have tied annual rate hikes to the consumer price index, required insurers to certify that premium increases are necessary to prevent a material risk of insolvency, and barred carriers from entering into state contracts if they don’t comply with LTCI policy changes.
Many consumers and legislators testified in support of the bills, while insurers opposed them.
“If a reduction in these outrageous premiums is not legislated, policyholders will be forced to drop these policies,” Jan Kritzman, who herself has endured large rate increases, told lawmakers in February. “If they end up in a nursing home, then here comes Title 19 Medicaid. Thank you, taxpayers of the state of Connecticut.
“My husband and I have long-term health insurance policies from Transamerica. We have endured a 350% increase in our premium since 2004. This May, our annual premium combined will be more than $6,000 … this is after I pared down the policy benefits in 2021.”
“Residents, mostly seniors … are being forced to choose between buying food, paying their rent or mortgage or paying for their long-term care insurance,” Newington resident David Schwartzer said. “Solving this problem is not easy. It takes courage to write new laws that will serve the citizens of Connecticut and not the insurance industry.”
Representatives for the insurance companies warned the proposals would have “serious consequences” and undermine the financial stability of long-term care insurance policies.
“Actuarially sound rates are essential to achieving this goal, and deviating from this principle may lead to inadequate premiums, jeopardizing insurer stability and consumer protection,” George wrote in joint testimony with officials from America’s Health Insurance Plans and the American Council of Life Insurers.
Rep. Lucy Dathan, co-chair of the Government Oversight Committee, which passed a bill on the issue in March, said it was an especially tight budget year. For the last four years, Connecticut has used billions in federal American Rescue Plan Act funds to prop up an array of state initiatives. But nearly all of that money has been exhausted.
Dathan and her colleagues had proposed, among other things, an audit of the state’s long-term care partnership plan, a review of Connecticut’s policies for regulating this coverage, and an evaluation of an alternative insurance pool for policyholders. The reviews would have cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.
“I was told there was a lot of stuff that wasn’t advanced because it needed an external group to come in and do the review or study, and we didn’t have room in the budget,” she said. “There was a pretty ruthless budget focus this year and making sure we were under the spending cap, trying not to let anything new in.”
Lawmakers said they would continue to look at ways to offer relief to policyholders.
“This is an issue that requires a lot of sophistication in the industry, and I’m hopeful we’ll be able to work with the insurance department in the off session to do something substantive to help people,” Blumenthal said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025_0127_SR_BankersLife009-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-04 13:12:47.278434

Free.,Federal judge unseals some records in Abrego Garcia case,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/federal-judge-unseals-some-records-abrego-garcia-case,,"WASHINGTON — The Maryland federal judge overseeing the lawsuit concerning the wrongly deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia unsealed documents Wednesday that the Trump administration had asked to keep unavailable to the public under the so-called state secrets privilege.The order from U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis unsealed three documents that she said did not contain any privileged information. Xinis questioned the Trump administration’s broad use of the privilege during a hearing last month.The request to unseal the documents came from a coalition of news organizations, arguing First Amendment rights and the public’s right to information in a case that has become a flashpoint between the judiciary branch and the Trump administration.“The Press Movants rightly contend that, at common law, the public enjoys a presumptive right to access court records, overcome only when outweighed by competing interests,” Xinis wrote Wednesday.President Donald Trump has said Abrego Garcia, who was removed in March due to an “administrative error,” will not return to the U.S. and Department of Justice attorneys on behalf of the Trump administration have argued in court that the Maryland man is in the custody of El Salvador and the federal government has no authority to bring him back.In a separate case of another wrongly deported immigrant to El Salvador, the Department of Justice submitted a document detailing that Secretary of State Marco Rubio was personally working with the Salvadoran government to return a 20-year-old referred to in court documents as only ""Cristian,"" after another federal judge ordered his return.Discovery documentsSome of the filings that were unsealed Wednesday had been public until the Trump administration moved to seal them.One unsealed record related to an April discovery request Abrego Garcia’s attorneys made to the government seeking information about how the administration was facilitating Abrego Garcia’s return from El Salvador. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled the Trump administration must facilitate the Maryland man’s return, but stopped short of requiring it.Another document related to the Trump administration’s request for more time in discovery proceedings.“It does not disclose any potentially privileged or otherwise sensitive information for which a compelling government interest outweighs the right to access,” Xinis wrote.One document was partially redacted, because it “includes some information potentially implicated by the state secrets privilege,” Xinis wrote.The document, signed by Abrego Garcia attorney Jonathan G. Cooper, objected to the Trump administration’s attempt to pause discovery. The government had argued that complying with discovery in the lawsuit would hinder efforts to facilitate Abrego Garcia’s return.“As we explained to the government, in our meet-and-confer, we do not understand why the production of documents or interrogatory responses — none of which has occurred in the public eye — has any bearing on efforts to facilitate Mr. Abrego Garcia’s release and return,” Cooper wrote in the partially redacted document unsealed Wednesday.A fourth document, a transcript from a late April hearing, will be released but redacted until the high-profile case is settled, Xinis wrote.“Although the Court does not wholly agree with the Defendants’ overbroad characterizations of the government interests at stake, the Court does recognize that certain information touches upon Defendants’ asserted state secrets privilege as applied to Secretary of State Marco Rubio and the State Department,” she wrote about the partially redacted transcript.",,,,2025-06-04 13:12:47.278434
,California,2025-06-04 17:03:55+00:00,CalMatters,These gas appliances — one of the largest sources of LA’s smog — could be phased out,Alejandra Reyes-Velarde,,,,,https://calmatters.org/environment/2025/06/gas-appliances-smog-la-south-coast/,Air quality board will vote Friday on phasing out water heaters and furnaces powered by natural gas. These appliances emit more smog-causing gases than the region's largest industrial polluters.,"In summary
Air quality board will vote Friday on phasing out water heaters and furnaces powered by natural gas. These appliances emit more smog-causing gases than the region’s largest industrial polluters. 



New household water heaters and heating systems powered by natural gas would be phased out in the Los Angeles basin under two controversial rules that air quality regulators will vote on Friday. 
Manufacturers would sell increasing percentages of zero-emission heating appliances in the four-county Los Angeles basin — beginning with 30% in 2027 — and pay fees if they sell natural gas ones, under the draft rules.
Home appliances are among the largest sources of smog-causing gases remaining in the L.A. basin, according to the South Coast Air Quality Management District. Officials there say the measures would eliminate the second largest amount of pollutants of any rule they have enacted over the past several decades. 
Consumers won’t have to switch their appliances. However, when their natural gas water heaters, central heating systems and furnaces break down and it’s time to replace them, they can choose to buy zero-emission heat pumps powered by electricity. 
Based on the lifetime of these appliances — 25 years for heating systems and 15 years for water heaters — about 200,000 furnaces and 300,000 water heaters will be replaced annually in the region, according to the air district.
The cost of buying and installing a heat pump to replace natural gas appliances varies, depending on what people need: Replacing an entire HVAC system with a heat pump would cost consumers about the same or even less than a natural gas system, according to the South Coast district’s estimate. But installing a heat pump instead of a natural gas water heater would cost $2,000 more, and replacing just a furnace would cost $8,000 more.
Contractors and developers oppose the phaseout, saying the fees paid by manufacturers will be passed on to residents, businesses and landlords.  
“This money is not coming out of thin air,” said Brian Johsz, advocacy manager for the Los Angeles County Business Federation. “It’s a solution in search of a problem in a lot of ways. It’s just putting the financial burden on residents when we are already seeing they have such a hard time trying to make ends meet right now.” 
SoCalGas officials say the rules would limit consumer choices and raise the cost of appliances. The company also said the measures would be preempted by federal law because they effectively ban appliances covered by the Energy Policy and Conservation Act. 
“Over time, the public will be forced to pay hundreds of dollars more to replace their gas appliances,” wrote Kevin Barker, a senior manager for SoCal Gas’s energy and environmental policy, in a letter to the district. “It is not in the public interest, especially at a time when consumers are demanding affordable energy solutions, to raise upfront costs of the most affordable options.” 
But air quality officials say that consumers will save money by switching to electric heaters. Between 2027 and 2061, residents in the four-county region will collectively save an annual average of between $191 million and $250 million on utility bill costs by switching from natural gas to electricity, according to the district’s estimate.

Under the proposed rules, manufacturers have two compliance options: They can sell all zero-emission units by 2027 or they can pay a fee for each gas appliance they continue to sell. The funds will be used to offer incentives to help low-income residents and landlords buy heat pumps. 
Environmental groups say the air agency should move more quickly. The L.A. region still has the nation’s worst smog despite half a century of efforts, so it has a long way to go before its residents breathe air that meets federal health standards.
“There are still a lot of emission reductions that are being left on the table that will either have to be taken up with subsequent rules or are being foregone,” said Chris Chavez, deputy policy director with the Clean Air Coalition,
The air quality agency’s original plans, which were years in the making, would have guaranteed substantially more emissions reductions. The proposal would have required manufacturers to sell 100% zero-emission water heaters and furnaces by 2031. But after pushback from businesses and gas companies about affordability concerns, the air district amended it.
Under the current draft, the targets are 30% of water heaters and furnaces sold in 2027 would be zero-emissions, ramping up to 50% in 2029, 75% in 2033 and 90% in 2036. Manufacturers will have to pay fees between $500 and $50 for each natural gas one sold in the region. 
The air district expects 90% of all water heaters and furnaces in the region will be zero emissions in 2061. 
Chavez said the original version was projected to eliminate 10 tons per day, accounting for 18% of all the nitrogen oxide emissions in the basin. The proposal as written now reduces emissions by six tons per day.  
Nihal Shrinath, an attorney for the Sierra Club, said “we’ve seen the Trump administration really waging a war on clean energy. And concurrently we have the South Coast (district) basically caving to gas lobbying efforts and really weakening a rule they have been working on for years.
“All the while, the air district is in extreme noncompliance with federal air quality standards and we’re the most polluted air basin in the country,” he said.
The South Coast district’s governing board will hold a public hearing and vote Friday on the measures, which update two emissions rules that the agency set in 1978 and 1982.
Billions of dollars in health savings 
Gas appliances in the L.A. region — mostly water heaters and furnaces — emit more nitrogen oxides and fine particles into the air than power plants, refineries and oil and gas production combined, according to the non-partisan research group Rocky Mountain Institute. 
The basin’s 10 million water heaters and furnaces emit almost 7 tons of nitrogen oxides and 1.5 tons of fine particles each day, according to air district data. In comparison, oil refineries — the region’s largest industrial polluters — emit far less, about 3 tons of nitrogen oxides and fine particles combined daily.
Nitrogen oxides react with other gases in the air and bake in the sun to form ozone, the main ingredient of smog, which causes asthma attacks and other health effects. The gases also pollute indoor air and can trigger respiratory effects. Fine particles can lodge in lungs and raise the risk of heart attacks and respiratory disease.
Between 2027 and 2053, the rules would save $59 billion in health expenses, according to the air district. Each year, the reduction in pollution would prevent an average of 280 new asthma diagnoses, 44 emergency room visits from respiratory problems and 6,100 lost school days, according to the district’s data. That doesn’t include health benefits calculated from the reduction in fine particles.
The Bay Area already has similar rules, enacted in 2023, that mandate zero-emission water heaters in 2027, furnaces in 2029 and large commercial water heaters in 2031. However, they are being amended to allow more flexibility for manufacturers to comply.  
The region’s two largest cities, Los Angeles and Long Beach, have passed resolutions supporting the South Coast district’s rules, while Huntington Beach, Fullerton, Riverside, Rancho Palos Verdes and other conservative cities are opposed.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/051925_Water-Heaters-Lowes_LV_CM_03.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-04 13:12:47.278434

The Council will study and recommend options for a comprehensive statewide approach to cannabis that is grounded in public health and public safety considerations. Stein’s order says the new council will learn from lessons in other states and experts and focus on the protection and safety of all North Carolinians, especially the state’s youth.
The council announced Wednesday includes 24 members and will be co-chaired by State Health Director Lawrence Greenblatt and Robeson County District attorney Matt Scott. Other who will serve on the board will be representatives from the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Public Safety, the state Department of Justice, local law enforcement officials, as well as North Carolina farmers. Notably, the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians would also have a seat at the table. The Eastern Band first approved the use of medicinal cannabis in 2021, launching recreational marijuana sales on its tribal land last year.

In an interview with WRAL on Tuesday, Gov. Stein likened the current situation surrounding cannabis and THC products to the ‘wild, wild West.’
“The idea that we have a system where this product, which is a drug that can get you high, is for sale out there without any restrictions on how it’s sold to me is insane,” said Stein.
Legislators have been grappling with whether to legalize medical marijuana for several sessions as well as how to address the growing number of vape stores that sell THC-infused products.
Stein said he hopes the new council can bring Republicans and Democrats from both chambers together to work with health professionals and law enforcement to find common ground.
What’s clear, said the governor, is that the unregulated marketplace is not working.
“Just go into a vape shop, ask the clerk what product will get me the most high and they will give you something. And it would get you high if you were to take it. So that’s not acceptable,” Stein said. “So, if we don’t accept the status quo, what do we want the reality to actually be?”
According to the governor’s office the rate of emergency department visits in North Carolina for intoxicating cannabis ingestion among children and youth ages 17 and under has increased more than 600 percent in recent years, and among older teens, the rate has increased more than 1,000 percent.
Senator Bill Rabon, a cancer survivor and the primary sponsor of the Compassionate Care Act, has been a leading voice for medical marijuana legislation. He is one of four legislators asked to serve on the advisory council.
Rabon (R-Brunswick) told his colleagues last year that there was very little difference between products like Delta 9 and marijuana and the state would be wise to craft its own regulatory framework. Legislation to regulate hemp-derive consumables and medicinal marijuana passed the NC Senate last June, only to languish in the House.
The new Council will consider public health considerations, potential marijuana prescriptions for certain conditions, as well as what regulatory guardrails are needed regarding potency and purity standards.
Another consideration would be the possibility of expunging past convictions that do not align with the recommendations of the Council, including for simple possession of marijuana.
According to Pew Research, nearly six-in-ten Americans (57%) believe that marijuana should be legal for medical and recreational purposes. USA Today, citing the group DISA Global Solutions, reported in April that North Carolina is one of a tiny minority of just six states in which marijuana is fully illegal for both recreational and medicinal purposes.
The North Carolina Advisory Council on Cannabis will hold its first meeting in July submitting preliminary recommendations for a comprehensive cannabis policy to the Stein by March 15, 2026.
In the meantime, the governor said he would like the General Assembly to prohibit the sales of products that contain intoxicating THC to anyone under 21 by requiring photo ID age-verification, while requiring packaging that lets adults know what is actually in the cannabis products they may be buying.

The CBO, the official financial scorekeeper for Congress, estimates that Trump’s tariffs, as they stand now, would lower the U.S. gross domestic product, or the total value of a country’s goods and services, on average by 0.6% per year through 2035. In addition to increasing costs on supplies and other assets businesses use in production, the tariffs are expected to raise prices on consumer goods in the next couple years. The CBO projects the price index used to measure personal consumption will be 0.9% higher by the end of 2026.While lower-income households spend a higher percentage of their income on consumer goods, the CBO projects that prices will increase the most on goods like home appliances and vehicles more likely to be purchased by higher earners.The eight-page analysis only takes into account the effects of Trump’s tariffs as of May 13. These include the following taxes calculated on the value of imports: a baseline 10% on goods from most countries; a base of 30% on all goods from China and Hong Kong; 25% on most foreign vehicles and auto parts; 25% on steel and aluminum; and 25% on certain goods from Canada and Mexico.The CBO released the figures in response to a request from U.S. Senate Democrats wanting to know the cost of the administration's import taxes.The report did not take into account any tariff changes after May 13, including Trump’s doubling to 50% the import taxes on steel and aluminum. The report also did not factor in changes that could result from a May 29 trade court decision striking down most of Trump’s tariffs — though an appeals court swiftly left them in place while the case plays out.",,,,2025-06-04 13:12:47.278434

Rick Smith, the warning coordination meteorologist in Norman, said the radios seemed to be operational for the “bulk” of Tuesday’s severe weather. 
Maintenance will continue through 4 p.m. Thursday. 
The Norman office is not aware of any complaints of any service issues during Tuesday’s severe weather, Smith said. The public was warned of the outage Monday. 
The maintenance is “mandated” computer upgrades required of all National Weather Service locations, he said. The Norman office was one of around 20 offices to receive the upgrades at this time, Smith said. 
The office remains staffed during the maintenance period and a “back-up office” in Tulsa will conduct forecast operations and the “core warning and forecast products and services will not be impacted,” according to a statement. 
Erica Grow Cei, a spokesperson for the National Weather Service said people should have multiple methods for receiving alerts, such as broadcast media, weather apps and emergency alerts on mobile devices. 
“This is a scheduled and necessary upgrade for our system, and the National Weather Service office in Norman, OK is ready for it,” she said in a statement. “Watches, warnings, and forecast products will continue to be issued in a timely fashion through a wide range of distribution channels including mobile apps, push alerts, websites, local television and radio.”
The Norman office is also being assisted during the disruption by neighboring local forecast offices, Cei said. 
Transmitters in Oklahoma and western north Texas will be affected, including those in: Ardmore, Atoka, Chickasha, Clinton, Enid, Lawton, Altus, Oklahoma City, Ponca City, Wichita Falls, Wewoka, Stillwater and Woodward.

,Mississippi Today,2025-06-04 16:37:26+00:00,Mississippi Today,"Waiting for government action on air pollution, Pascagoula community grabs the wheel",Alex Rozier,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/06/04/waiting-for-government-action-on-air-pollution-pascagoula-community-grabs-the-wheel/,Delay in MDEQ air quality monitoring prompts Pascagoula community residents to confirm pollutants on their own.,"After 14 years of pushing for safer air quality for her Pascagoula neighborhood, 78-year-old Barbara Weckesser is tired of waiting for government officials tasked with such responsibilities to take action. 
In the last seven years alone, she said, over 30 people in her Cherokee Forest neighborhood of just 120 homes have died from heart disease, lung disease or cancer. In 2013, Weckesser started her activist group, Cherokee Concerned Citizens, which has long blamed releases from surrounding industrial operations – including a Chevron oil refinery, a Bollinger shipyard and a Rolls-Royce Naval center – for poor health outcomes in their community. 
“Industry has grown, and chosen to put out more and more and more pollution,” Weckesser said. “And guess what? Our bodies can’t absorb it.” 
Then in 2021, a ProPublica analysis of Environmental Protection Agency data identified the area as one of the nation’s top hot spots of toxic air pollution. Weckesser said that investigation helped boost her cause’s credibility.
Cherokee Concerned Citizens have remained active against potential environmental harms from local industry. Last year, the group sued the EPA for approving a plastic-based fuel experiment at Chevron’s Pascagoula facility that, ProPublica revealed, could have caused cancer to one in four exposed to production emissions. The EPA then in September said it planned to withdraw its approval. 
Weckesser spoke on the phone days before heading to Atlanta to graduate from an environmental justice academy program, through Tuskegee University, that empowered community leaders across the South with knowledge and resources to lead their respective causes. Hearing from former EPA officials, she said the academy taught her a lot, including potential legal avenues for protecting the Cherokee Forest neighborhood. 
In 2022, a year after the ProPublica story, the EPA awarded the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality $500,000 to monitor air quality in Pascagoula, later increasing the amount to $625,000. 
But both agencies have yet to give a timeline for the yearlong study. So instead of waiting, Weckesser partnered with University of Colorado Boulder researcher Caroline Frischmon to do their own investigation, the results of which they published in March. 
“This is the best data that we’ve had,” Weckesser said.
Their study used air sensors to compare “episodes” of pollution – or when the sensors detected rising levels of chemicals such as ammonia or VOCs (Volatile Organic Compounds) – in the neighborhood with those at another location near downtown Pascagoula, about two miles away. VOCs, the EPA says, can cause liver and kidney damage as well as cancer.

The episodes in Cherokee Forest, Frischmon found, were much more frequent than at the other location, and in total lasted about four to five times longer over the course of two months. On top of the significant frequency of those episodes, she also pointed to correlating wind direction data suggesting the pollution came from the nearby industry. 
The timing of those episodes, Frischmon added, also lined up with health symptoms and observations residents recorded, such as red or itchy eyes, nausea – all known impacts of exposure to ammonia and VOCs – and strong “chemical” odors. The largest spike in symptoms, the study says, came just after a jump in emissions from the Chevron refinery. 
When asked about the study, MDEQ Communications Director Jan Schaefer said the agency wouldn’t comment on research that didn’t use “EPA-approved methods.” Mississippi Today also reached out to several facilities, including Chevron, Ingalls and Rolls-Royce, but did not hear back before publication. 
Fischmon admitted the work has its limitations. Most notably, she said, they couldn’t afford calibrated sensors that could say if pollutant levels exceeded public health guidelines. She said her team was set to receive federal funding to expand the study, but in May the EPA said via email, “The agency determined that your application no longer supports administrative priorities and canceled issuance of an award.”
While the EPA-funded monitoring MDEQ is planning would include more advanced measurements, it’s unclear when the state agency will begin its year-long study. 
“We are currently working with EPA to finalize the Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) and install two EPA-loaned VOC sensors,” Schaefer said in a May email, over two and a half years since the EPA announced the grant. “Official data collection will begin once those sensors are installed and the QAPP is finalized.”

Meanwhile, Cherokee Forest residents are hoping to pool enough dollars from public and private stakeholders to fund buy-outs of their homes. According to a survey, nearly three-quarters of those living in the neighborhood want to relocate “as soon as possible.” Weckesser said Cherokee Concerned Citizens is proposing to convert the area into a natural buffer since the neighborhood, which was built in the 1960s, sits in a flood zone.  
Fischmon said she hopes the March study can serve as a model for communities elsewhere who may be discouraged by the high costs of measuring air pollutants. She said the sensors they used for this study cost around $1,000 to build, but that there are others commercially available for around $200. 
“ It is becoming more and more feasible, which I think is really exciting because communities can really tailor what they want to measure for what they’re feeling and noticing,” she said. “ We did this project really to demonstrate that there’s still a lot that we can do with these sensors for communities to highlight issues and get the attention of the agencies that do have the resources to do the (more advanced) monitoring.”

Last Friday, Weckesser graduated from the environmental justice program at a ceremony held in an Embassy Suites hotel in Atlanta. Despite no prior environmental work experience – her only jobs before were in banking and real estate – she said she finished third in her class.
“ The class taught how people need to start holding their own with industry and say, you are not doing this anymore,” Weckesser said, adding she was the oldest student in the academy. “And I only have a high school education. So you can achieve whatever you want to achieve.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/04093818/9DD_5604-1.jpg,,,2025-06-04 13:12:47.278434

Read this story in English.
Los Republicanos en el Congreso están cada vez más cerca de aprobar una importante ley que podría afectar todo, desde los impuestos hasta inmigración y Medicaid.
La “Gran y Hermosa Ley” es el vehículo para promulgar gran parte de la agenda del segundo mandato del presidente Donald J. Trump. Los Republicanos quieren extender las exenciones fiscales de la ley tributaria de 2017, aprobada durante su primer mandato y que expirará a finales de año.
La legislación tiene implicaciones fiscales para individuos y familias de la mayoría de los niveles de ingresos, así como para empresas y universidades. Para compensar algunos de estos costos, el proyecto de ley incluye fuertes recortes de gastos, que tendrían un impacto directo en algunos programas de protección social.
Dado que controlan ambas cámaras del Congreso, los Republicanos pueden aprobar un proyecto de ley de presupuesto por su cuenta. Sin embargo, han estado lidiando con conflictos internos, y el proyecto de ley podría terminar considerablemente diferente en las etapas finales.
Los Demócratas, incluida la delegación del Congreso de Connecticut, se oponen y no participan en la elaboración del proyecto de ley. Argumentan que beneficiará desproporcionadamente a los estadounidenses más ricos y a las grandes corporaciones, inflará la deuda nacional y recortará servicios esenciales.
A continuación, se presenta la situación actual del proyecto de ley y lo que podría significar para sus finanzas.
¿Cómo afectará a mis impuestos en el futuro?
Las personas y los hogares en Connecticut podrían ver un alivio rápido en algunos de sus impuestos. Sin embargo, parte de este alivio será solo temporal y durará hasta el final del mandato de Trump.
Hace permanentes muchas de las exenciones fiscales de la Ley de Reducción de Impuestos y Empleos de 2017, ya que expirarán a finales de año, incluyendo tasas de impuesto sobre la renta más bajas.
Uno de los aspectos más debatidos del proyecto de ley ha sido si se debe aumentar el límite de las deducciones de los impuestos estatales y locales (SALT). Si el límite aumenta, será especialmente beneficioso para los estados con un costo de vida más alto, como Connecticut.
El proyecto de ley elevaría el límite de $10,000 para las deducciones SALT a $40,000, que se eliminaría gradualmente para quienes ganan más de $500,000. Ambos límites aumentarían un 1% hasta 2033. Sin embargo, es probable que el Senado modifique esta disposición.
Los trabajadores podrían deducir el pago de horas extras o propinas de su impuesto federal sobre la renta. Además, se podría deducir hasta $10,000 en intereses sobre los préstamos para automóviles, siempre que el vehículo se haya ensamblado en EE. UU. Las tres exenciones fiscales estarían vigentes hasta 2028.
Las familias podrían solicitar un crédito tributario por hijo ligeramente mayor. El reembolso aumentaría a $2,500 hasta 2028 y luego volvería a bajar a $2,000, indexado a la inflación. También exige que los padres que declaran impuestos conjuntamente tengan número de Seguro Social.
Las personas mayores de 65 años con ingresos bajos o medios podrán obtener una deducción adicional de $4,000. El proyecto de ley crearía automáticamente nuevas cuentas de ahorro para los recién nacidos entre el 1 de enero de 2025 y el 1 de enero de 2029. El gobierno federal otorgaría un depósito único de $1,000 para invertirlo en la bolsa de valores. Otros podrían contribuir hasta $5,000 al año hasta los 18 años.
También habría cambios en los préstamos estudiantiles y la asistencia financiera.
Quienes reciban la Beca Pell y deseen obtener el monto máximo deben ser estudiantes de tiempo completo. Según el proyecto de ley, los estudiantes tendrían que aumentar el número de créditos que cursan cada semestre de 12 a 15 para alcanzar ese nivel. Deben ser estudiantes de medio tiempo para recibir al menos alguna ayuda. Además, ampliaría estas becas en otros casos, haciendo que la formación profesional a corto plazo sea elegible para la Beca Pell.
Además, el proyecto de ley reduciría el número de planes de pago basados ​​en los ingresos para pagar los préstamos estudiantiles y eliminaría los préstamos federales subsidiados para estudiantes universitarios.
Los consumidores ya no verían las exenciones fiscales para vehículos eléctricos y electrodomésticos de bajo consumo que formaban parte de la Ley de Reducción de la Inflación de los Demócratas.
¿Perderé el acceso a las prestaciones de Medicaid o SNAP?
No necesariamente. Pero se esperan recortes si se promulgan requisitos laborales más estrictos y otros cambios. Si el proyecto de ley se aprueba en su forma actual, estos podrían entrar en vigor a finales de 2026.
La Oficina de Presupuesto del Congreso, que analiza y evalúa los proyectos de ley federales, estima que hasta 10 millones de personas podrían perder la cobertura de Medicaid y alrededor de 3 millones podrían perder la asistencia alimentaria en EE. UU. durante la próxima década.
Para calificar a Medicaid como adulto menor de 65 años, deberá trabajar o participar en capacitación, educación o servicio comunitario al menos 80 horas al mes. Se hacen exenciones para ciertos grupos, como mujeres embarazadas o en posparto, beneficiarios de Medicare, veteranos, cuidadores y personas con discapacidad.
Para quienes cumplan con este requisito, el proyecto de ley les exigiría que reportaran su trabajo y el estado realizaría verificaciones frecuentes para garantizar su elegibilidad. Esos mismos adultos también tendrían que pagar un copago de $35 por la mayoría de los servicios.
El proyecto de ley también busca penalizar a estados como Connecticut que ofrecen Medicaid sin importar el estatus migratorio. “HUSKY para inmigrantes” brinda atención médica estatal a niños menores de 15 años y personas en posparto con ingresos que califican. Connecticut utiliza sus propios fondos para brindar dicha cobertura, pero podría verse expuesto a reducciones en su reembolso federal de Medicaid por hacerlo.
Según la propuesta del Programa de Asistencia Nutricional Suplementaria (SNAP), más estadounidenses mayores tendrían que trabajar o capacitarse al menos 80 horas al mes. El proyecto de ley eleva el límite de edad para adultos sanos sin dependientes de 54 a 64 años.
Actualmente, se considera que los dependientes son menores de 18 años. Sin embargo, en lo que respecta al SNAP, el proyecto de ley reduciría significativamente la edad de un dependiente a menos de 7 años. Esto significa que los requisitos de trabajo también se aplicarían a los adultos sanos con hijos de 7 años o más para recibir beneficios.
Estados como Connecticut tendrían que pagar una parte de los beneficios del SNAP por primera vez en la historia del programa. Esto ha generado preocupación por posibles recortes a las prestaciones.
¿Cuál es la situación del proyecto de ley de Trump en el Congreso?
Los Republicanos están utilizando un proceso acelerado conocido como conciliación presupuestaria. Esto les permite evitar las obstrucciones en el Senado y aprobar ciertos tipos de proyectos de ley sin depender del apoyo de los Demócratas. Sin embargo, el proceso aún puede tardar meses en completarse.
A finales de mayo, los Republicanos de la Cámara de Representantes aprobaron por un estrecho margen el proyecto de ley llamado “Gran y Hermosa Ley” tras semanas de negociaciones y divisiones dentro del partido sobre qué incluir.
Con el Congreso regresando del receso la primera semana de junio, el Senado ahora se ocupará del tema. Realizarán sus propias negociaciones tediosas, una serie de votaciones nocturnas sobre las enmiendas y luego una votación final sobre su aprobación.
Dado que es probable que el Senado introduzca cambios, los Republicanos de ambas cámaras tendrían que conciliar las diferencias y votar sobre un proyecto de ley de compromiso. Los Republicanos pretenden concluir el proceso y enviarlo a Trump para su firma antes del 4 de julio. Pero podría llevar más tiempo si el partido sigue dividido sobre la versión final.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Public outcry was swift and forceful after a U.S. House committee last month hastily approved an amendment directing the federal government to sell off more than half a million acres of public land.
A few days later, lawmakers advanced the larger bill — a sweeping list of President Donald Trump’s priorities — but stripped the federal lands provision.
Yet leaders on both sides of the issue say the battle over selling off federal lands is likely just heating up.
Some conservatives in Western states have complained for decades that the feds control too much of the land within their borders. They see a long-awaited opportunity in a Trump administration that’s sympathetic to their cause. Public lands advocates are bracing for more attempts to turn land over to states, industry groups and developers.
“The threat level is red alert,” said Randi Spivak, public lands policy director with the Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental nonprofit. “Some of these states have been champing at the bit for decades to privatize. They’re certainly not going to let this opportunity pass without an aggressive effort.”
 The ‘balance sheet’

In Western states, where most federally owned lands are located, some leaders view these lands as a treasured inheritance — places reserved for all Americans and critical for wildlife, tourism and outdoor recreation. Others feel that too much of the land in their states is controlled by officials in Washington, D.C., leaving it off-limits for development and curtailing its economic value.
Trump officials and allies have embraced the latter view. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum has repeatedly called federal lands America’s “balance sheet,” describing them as untapped assets worth trillions of dollars. He has launched an effort to identify federal lands suitable for housing development.
Other proposals have centered around using land sales to pay for tax breaks or to finance Trump’s proposed government-run fund that could invest in stocks or real estate.
For some state leaders, the newfound interest at the federal level to turn public lands into cash — along with Trump’s cuts to land management agency staff — aligns with a long-standing movement to reduce federal ownership.
“I look at it as an opportunity to say, ‘Hey, turn it over to the state,’” said Utah House Speaker Mike Schultz, a Republican.
Utah leaders have made the most forceful push to challenge federal land ownership. The state filed a legal challenge last year seeking to take control of more than 18 million acres of “unappropriated” lands — parcels held by the federal government without a specific designation such as a national park or monument. That effort hit a roadblock earlier this year when the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the case.
But with Trump in the White House, state leaders may pivot from challenging the feds in court to seeking their cooperation.
“We would love if the federal government just turned it over to us and said, ‘Here, manage these lands,’” Schultz said. “That’s an option as well. Those are discussions that are happening. Everything is on the table.”

Schultz declined to say which federal officials have been involved in discussions about transferring lands to the state.
Some lawmakers in Wyoming backed a state resolution this year — which ultimately failed — calling on Congress to hand over all federal lands except for Yellowstone National Park. Idaho lawmakers passed a measure calling on the feds to turn over a wildlife refuge to the state. And Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo, a Republican, has called for a “systematic release” of federal land in the state.
But public lands also have many supporters in Western states, including some prominent Republican members of Congress, such as Reps. Mike Simpson of Idaho and Ryan Zinke of Montana. Zinke was Interior secretary for two years during the first Trump administration.
John Leshy, who served as solicitor for the U.S. Department of the Interior during the Clinton administration, said proposals to dispose of federal lands tend to be stymied by fierce public backlash.
“Federal lands are really popular,” he said. “It’s political poison [to sell off public land]. It’s a different West now. Public attitudes have changed.”
Leshy also noted that livestock ranchers especially benefit from discounted lease rates offered by the federal government.
 Housing arguments

The most recent clash over the future of federal lands was the amendment sponsored by a pair of congressional Republicans last month. The measure would have directed the Bureau of Land Management to sell more than 500,000 acres of land in Nevada and Utah. Local governments would have been able to buy the land at market value, with no restrictions on how they used it.
Backers said the sale would bring in revenue to cover Trump’s proposed tax cuts, while allowing local governments to build much-needed housing on the parcels. Utah GOP Sen. Mike Lee said he will try to revive the measure as the Senate considers the bill this month, E&E News reported.
In Nevada, where 85% of land is owned by the federal government, some leaders say their communities are hemmed in by a checkerboard of public lands that constrain development. The city of Fernley, which is growing rapidly, would have acquired 12,000 acres under the proposal.
“We need housing,” said Benjamin Marchant, Fernley’s city manager. “The city can’t plan roads and water lines, sewer lines and gas lines, when you have federal land between two parcels that want to develop. This will bring a practical and helpful consolidation of all these lands into one developable area.”
Nevada leaders have long worked on proposals to transfer some federal lands to local governments and allow for increased growth. But some lawmakers say the latest push bypassed that collaborative process — and failed to include safeguards that the money raised from the sale of the lands would be reinvested into conserving public lands elsewhere.
“It was a complete betrayal of everything we’ve worked on in this state,” said Assemblymember Howard Watts, a Democrat. “This amendment is trying to sell off half a million acres of Nevada’s public lands in order to pay for tax cuts for billionaires. This is not going to address our housing problem. These lands are positioned to be sold off for other forms of development and extraction.”
Similar debates are happening in Utah. In southwestern Utah’s Washington County, local officials say the disposal of federally controlled land could help alleviate the region’s housing crisis and increasingly strained infrastructure.
The county is experiencing rapid population growth — in 2022, St. George, the county seat, was the fastest-growing metro area in America. County and city leaders hoped the amendment would have helped them manage the growth. The measure would have disposed of roughly 11,500 acres of federally controlled land in Utah, selling it at market value to local governments.
The proposal received pushback from all sides, including environmentalists, hunting and fishing groups, House Democrats and even conservatives.
“[The amendment] is consistent with how U.S. Department of the Interior Secretary Burgum thinks about federal public lands, as simply assets on a ledger to be sold off,” said Steve Bloch, legal director for the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, an environmental nonprofit. ” … It’s just antithetical to how Westerners think about the federal public lands that make up so much of our landscape.”

Washington County Commissioner Adam Snow, a Republican, said a lot of the opposition was misguided. The county would have acquired almost half of the land earmarked for disposal, and Snow said much of that would have been used to widen existing roads and construct new ones that are bordered by Bureau of Land Management property.
“These were not pristine wilderness lands. Some of the environmental groups tried to make it sound like we’re selling off Zion National Park, and that’s not even close to true,” Snow said. “If we can just not have to deal with the federal government every time we want to chip seal a road or improve an intersection, that would be really nice. Because we have to ask ‘Mother, may I?’ for everything out here.”
Local leaders say federal parcels could help ease housing pressures as well. Snow said transferring parcels to the city or county is one of the only ways to stop the area from becoming wildly expensive.
“We’re running out of room real quick,” he said. “ … There is still private land to develop, but they’re going to charge an absolute premium.”
The amendment that was stripped from the House bill was widely criticized for not having any restrictions on what could be done with the land.
“There was no language whatsoever that would require Washington County or St. George to do anything with these lands. They could lease them for development. They could sell them outright,” said Bloch.
 The costs of management

In Utah, lawmakers have created a state Department of Land Management — essentially a placeholder agency that would be funded and staffed only if their effort to assume control of large swaths of federal land succeeds. Schultz, the House speaker, said the state is committed to keeping the lands in the public domain, reopening roads and campgrounds closed by the feds.
“We’d just take over the job from the federal government,” he said. “It is something that the state absolutely would do, and we’d do it more efficiently, more effectively and we’d have better outcomes.”
Schultz said the state could bring in the revenues needed to manage the land by raising lease prices for oil and gas operations on parcels currently managed for drilling.
But some public lands advocates say that’s not realistic. The federal Bureau of Land Management employed more than 950 people in the state as of 2024, and feds also assume the expensive task of wildfire management on their lands.
“If you look at the history of what Utah has done with their lands, they’ve sold more than half of them,” said Devin O’Dea, Western policy and conservation manager with Backcountry Hunters & Anglers. “We’re certainly of the perspective that states could not handle the economic costs of managing these lands. Their hand would be forced; they would have to sell these lands in order to deal with those costs.”
John Robison, Idaho Conservation League public lands and wildlife director, said Simpson — the Idaho congressman — and the state’s two senators have all won praise from constituents for their work on public lands compromises.
“Savvy Idaho politicians know that public lands are popular,” he said.
But other state leaders insist their governments are better equipped to manage the lands. Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador, a Republican, was among the officials who signed an amicus brief in support of Utah’s lawsuit against the feds.
“We live here, we work here, and we are far better stewards of our forests and resources than federal bureaucrats in Washington,” Labrador said in a statement. “ … If Idaho owned this land, we could lease it for timber, grazing, and mining — just like the federal government does — but reinvest that revenue right here in Idaho.”

Many students feel  stuck paying for classes that don’t align with their professional goals.,"Imagine this: You’re getting ready to register for your college classes, and you’re met with the mountain of required — but unrelated to your major — general education courses. This is the reality for college students. Extensive gen-ed courses take up a lot of time, increasing costs and possibly delaying graduation.


According to Best Colleges, only 49% of undergraduate students nationwide actually finish their degree in just four years, and I believe these unnecessary courses are to blame. At Central Connecticut State University, undergraduates must complete 41 to 46 credits of gen-ed classes — 40% of the credits needed for a bachelor’s degree. This system makes students spend extra time and money on classes that often have little to do with their intended careers.

Allyson Hickey
Supporters argue that gen-eds create well-rounded students. Schools like UConn, for example, defend their own gen-ed programs by claiming they help students navigate future challenges through broad learning. UConn’s system, however, is less intensive: It requires just 21 credits, half as many as CCSU.
At CCSU, the policy appears more demanding. Students must take multiple courses in written and oral communication, world languages, arts and humanities, social sciences, natural sciences and even “Thriving in College” lectures. Some subjects range from three to four classes each. 
Many students feel swamped with coursework and stuck paying for classes that don’t align with their professional goals. As a student myself, I see how these unnecessary courses affect my college life. Instead of building skills for our intended careers, many of us are wasting time sitting through classes that have little to no impact on our education and are almost a review of high school classes.
Cutting down on CCSU’s gen-ed load — or allowing it to be optional for students who might need the review — would save money, reduce dropout rates and get students into their fields faster.
If universities truly want to set their students up for success, they need to rethink the congested gen-ed system. Right now, students are paying too much and waiting too long to earn degrees that should empower them — not exhaust them.

,DC,2025-06-04 16:00:58+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Trump-backed giant tax and spending bill bloats deficit by $2.4T, nonpartisan CBO says",Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-backed-giant-tax-and-spending-bill-bloats-deficit-24t-nonpartisan-cbo-says,,"WASHINGTON — The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released detailed analysis Wednesday showing Republicans’ “big, beautiful bill” would increase federal deficits by $2.4 trillion during the next decade.CBO projects that if enacted as written, the legislation would result in 10.9 million people losing access to health insurance by 2034, a number that includes “1.4 million people without verified citizenship, nationality, or satisfactory immigration status who would no longer be covered in state-only funded programs in 2034.”The score is the most up-to-date analysis by Congress’ official scorekeeper on how the sweeping tax and spending cuts package the House approved last month will impact the federal budget in the years ahead.Republicans have been highly critical of the CBO’s assessment of the legislation’s real-world impacts, arguing that keeping tax rates as they are now, instead of letting them rise at the end of the year when the 2017 GOP tax law expires, will boost economic growth.House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., lambasted the CBO during a press conference shortly after the report came out, arguing its economic growth projections haven’t been completely accurate.""This bill will actually reduce the deficit, if you recognize the historical economic growth that has always been there,"" Scalise said. ""To say you're going to get 1.8% growth. At a minimum, we think you can get 2.5 to 4% growth. Scott Bessent, the Treasury secretary, says over 4% economic growth. So I get that we've got to play by the rules of the referee, but the referee has been wrong.""Disagreement over the ‘big beautiful bill’GOP lawmakers have also sought to brush aside criticism from some of their own members, including Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, who both argue the legislation must cut spending more to reduce the federal deficit in the long run.Billionaire and former Trump administration staffer Elon Musk has also become increasingly vocal about his opposition to the package, writing on social media this week that the “massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination.”The House voted mostly along party lines in May to send the sweeping spending and tax cuts package to the Senate, which is expected to debate and amend the legislation in the weeks ahead.CBO’s analysis will likely inform some of that conversation, and help senators better understand how the policy changes proposed by their House colleagues would affect state government budgets and the communities they represent. The CBO previously shared analysis of each of the 11 bills that make up the package, but those didn’t reflect several changes GOP House leaders made just hours before the floor vote in that chamber.Updated numbersThe updated projections show Republicans’ plan to extend the 2017 tax law and make other tweaks to tax policy would increase the deficit by $3.754 trillion during the next decade. That increase to the deficit caused by the tax changes, which CBO has also found would decrease resources for low-income families over the next decade while increasing resources for top earners, would be partly offset by spending reductions on certain programs.The Armed Services Committee’s bill would increase deficits by $144 billion. Homeland Security’s provisions would increase deficits by $79 billion. And the Judiciary Committee’s language would increase deficits by $9 billion during the 10-year budget window.The section of the package drafted by the Energy and Commerce Committee, which would make substantial changes to Medicaid and several other programs within the panel’s jurisdiction, would decrease spending by $1.086 trillion during the 10-year budget window.The panel’s bill has four subcategories: energy, environment, communications and health. The health provisions, which include substantial changes to Medicaid, would reduce federal spending by $902 billion between 2025 and 2034.Language barring Medicaid from covering gender transition procedures for anyone in the state-federal health program would reduce federal spending by $2.6 billion during the next decade.Requiring some people on Medicaid to work, participate in community service or attend educational programs for at least 80 hours a month would reduce federal spending by $344 billion during the next 10 years.Blocking any Medicaid funding from going to Planned Parenthood would cut federal costs by $261 million during the 10-year budget window. Federal law already bars health care programs like Medicaid from covering abortions unless the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest, or it endangers the life of the woman.Democratic criticismEnergy and Commerce Committee ranking member Frank Pallone Jr., a New Jersey Democrat, wrote in a statement that it's ""shocking House Republicans rushed to vote on this bill without an accounting from CBO on the millions of people who will lose their health care or the trillions of dollars it would add to the national (deficit).""The truth is Republican leaders raced to pass this bill under cover of night because they didn’t want the American people or even their own members to know about its catastrophic consequences.”The Agriculture Committee's provisions, including pushing off some of the cost of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to states, would reduce federal spending by $238 billion during the next decade.The Education and Workforce Committee’s language would decrease federal spending by $349 billion. The Financial Services section of the package would reduce federal spending by $5 billion. Natural Resources would lower spending by $18 billion. Oversight and Government Reform would decrease spending by $12 billion. And Transportation and Infrastructure would reduce spending by nearly $37 billion. Ariana Figueroa contributed to this report.",,,,2025-06-04 12:25:16.280128

Casey Snider, R-Paradise, speaks in the House Chamber at the Capitol in Salt Lake City on Friday, Jan. 26, 2024. (Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)In order to fill an open leadership position left by former House Majority Leader Jefferson Moss, the Utah House Republicans chose their next second-in-command during a closed-door caucus meeting Tuesday night. 
The House GOP elected Rep. Casey Snider, R-Paradise, for their next majority leader, picking him over Rep. Karianne Lisonbee, R-Clearfield. Moss resigned from the Republican-controlled House effective last week to accept Gov. Spencer Cox’s appointment as executive director of the Governor’s Office of Economic Opportunity. 
Lisonbee previously served as majority whip and Snider served as majority assistant whip, leaving both of those positions up for grabs. Rep. Candice Pierucci, R-Herriman, won election to be majority whip, while Rep. Bridger Bolinder, R-Grantsville, was elected assistant majority whip. 

“I am excited to work alongside this new leadership team as we represent our caucus and work on behalf of all Utahns,” House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper, said in a prepared statement issued Tuesday night. “Congratulations to Rep. Snider, Rep. Pierucci, and Rep. Bolinder. This leadership team stands ready to work on behalf of all Utahns.” 
Snider and Pierucci have both been rising stars in House leadership, having previously served in leadership positions before taking the higher-ranking roles. Bolinder is a relative newcomer, having first been elected in January 2023. Snider began his legislative service in October 2018, while Pierucci has served since November 2019. 

Snider has political experience both in Utah and Washington, D.C. He previously worked as a legislative director for a congressman, former Utah Rep. Rob Bishop, and was a staffer on the U.S. House Committee on Natural Resources. He has also served as a firefighter for the Paradise City Fire Department and worked in various agricultural roles. He owns and operates a 300 acre farm in Cache County, according to his campaign website. 
When Snider was first appointed in 2018 at the age of 33, he assumed the role as the state’s youngest legislator. Now, that title belongs to Rep. Tyler Clancy, R-Provo, who took office in 2023 at the age of 25. Previously, Snider served in a powerful position as chair of the House Rules Committee, which decides which bills get committee hearings. 
“I am honored to take on this role and grateful for the opportunity to serve,” Snider said in a prepared statement. “Our leadership team is committed to serving the members of our caucus and the people of Utah with integrity and foresight as we continue to advance meaningful policy for the benefit of every Utahn.”

Pierucci — who was also deemed the Legislature’s youngest lawmaker when she first took office in 2018 at the age of 27 — previously worked as director of community relations for another congressman, former Rep. Chris Stewart, and as development director for the conservative think tank Sutherland Institute. 
As a lawmaker, Pierucci most recently served as chair of the House Education Committee. One of the most high-profile and controversial pieces of legislation she ran included the creation of the state’s “school choice” voucher program, named Utah Fits All, which a district court judge recently ruled as unconstitutional. State leaders said they would appeal the ruling to the Utah Supreme Court. 
“I am thankful for the trust our Majority Caucus has placed in me,” Pierucci said in a statement. “Our leadership team is energized and ready to represent our caucus as we work to make a lasting impact for families and communities across our state.” 

Bolinder owns a family construction company, according to his campaign website. He’s affiliated with the Utah Manufacture Association and lists Grantsville High School as his education, according to his legislative page. Last year, he was selected to serve as chair of the House Health and Human Services Committee.  
“It’s an honor to earn the trust of my colleagues,” Bolinder said. “I’m eager to get to work, to listen, and to help ensure every voice in our caucus, and every Utahn, is represented.”",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/012624_Casey-Snider_025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-04 12:25:16.280128

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerGlobalFoundries announced plans Wednesday to invest $16 billion in its New York and Vermont operations to bolster domestic chip manufacturing.The company expects to dedicate $13 billion of those funds to modernizing its plants in Malta, New York, where it is based, and Essex Junction. It plans to commit an additional $3 billion to research and development in the Northeast, the company said in a Wednesday press release.It was not immediately clear how much of the aggregate $16 billion in new investment would go toward the company’s Vermont operations. The company said it was collaborating with President Donald Trump’s administration and leading tech companies, including Apple and General Motors, to help reshore domestic chip production. “At GlobalFoundries, we are proud to partner with pioneering technology leaders to manufacture their chips in the United States — advancing innovation while strengthening economic and supply chain resiliency,” Tim Breen, CEO of GlobalFoundries, said in the release. “The AI revolution is driving strong, durable demand for GF’s technologies that enable tomorrow’s data centers — including GF’s leading silicon photonics, as well as GaN for power applications.”The announcement is just the latest sign that bipartisan attempts to bolster domestic semiconductor manufacturing have begun to bear fruit for the company’s Essex Junction facility, which is one of the largest employers in Vermont.Last February, GlobalFoundries was awarded $1.5 billion in federal funding through the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act, $125 million of which went to the company’s Vermont plant. In December, the company secured nearly $10 million in additional federal funds to bolster operations in Essex Junction.GlobalFoundries is also a key player in Vermont’s Gallium Nitride Tech Hub, a consortium of entities including the University of Vermont that is dedicated to the development and production of Gallium Nitride semiconductors, a cutting edge chip technology. Earlier this year, the outgoing Biden Administration awarded the Vermont tech hub nearly $24 million in funding for chip manufacturing, a decision that was revoked by the Trump administration, which said it would re-award the grant money next year. GlobalFoundries said it plans to allocate part of its $3 billion in research and development funding toward Gallium Nitride production in Vermont, though it did not specify the amount.Read the story on VTDigger here:  GlobalFoundries to invest $16B in chip manufacturing in Vermont and New York.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/global-foundries-2-20221017.jpg,,,2025-06-04 12:25:16.280128

The opinion released Wednesday said the board violated state open meetings laws, which says school districts must publish a notice about tax proposals in a local newspaper at least a week before meeting to vote on the proposal. The attorney general’s office also refuted a recent claim by the school district to local media outlets that the state law doesn’t apply to the tax increase because it is a “county-level tax” also needing approval from the Fayette County Fiscal Court. 
The opinion said state law “expressly recognizes that levying an occupational license tax is a power shared jointly by the School Board and the Fiscal Court.” It adds that a fiscal court vote could not happen unless the school board “certified” the new tax rate. 
“Accordingly, when the School Board properly certifies a new rate, the Fiscal Court’s role is ministerial; the discretion and decision-making power lies with the School Board — which is why it is the body that must give public notice prior to voting on whether to impose the additional tax,” the opinion said. “Therefore, it is the opinion of this Office that the Fayette County School Board’s May 27 vote to increase the occupational license tax was unlawful.”
The board voted 3-2 to approve the tax increase of 0.25% about a week ago. The tax rate would have taken effect in January. The board approved a  $848 million proposed budget with the tax increase that would cost residents an average of $13 more per month, local media outlets reported. 
However, Coleman’s office wrote the resolution for the tax increase “is void and of no effect.” 
“Tax and spend government is a danger to Kentucky’s future, especially when officials who should be accountable to Fayette County voters try to ignore the rules to raise taxes,” Coleman said in a statement. “If the Fayette County School Board members believe they need more of Kentuckians’ hard-earned dollars, they should clearly and publicly make their case before their own constituents.”
Based in Lexington, Fayette County Public Schools is the second largest school district in the state with more than 41,000 students. 
Sen. Amanda Mays Bledsoe, a Lexington Republican, requested Coleman’s office review the legality of the school board’s vote. 
“This validates what so many in our community, including myself, felt: Taxpayers were shut out of a huge decision about their own tax dollars,” Bledsoe said. “I’m calling on the Fiscal Court to take no action today and for the school board to remedy this misuse of its authority. The board should table any further discussion of a tax increase until trust can be restored.”
Consideration of the school board’s tax increase request is on the agenda for the fiscal court’s Thursday meeting.

In his statement, Liggins said “we respectfully but strongly disagree with the conclusions drawn, particularly because the opinion does not reference the relevant statute that governs this matter.” He added that the district’s legal counsel believes the attorney general’s opinion “raises more questions than it resolves, and we believe there are reasonable differences in interpretation.”
“That said, we remain committed to honoring the spirit of the opinion,” Liggins said. “We have documented the public comments received at the May 27 meeting and will offer an additional opportunity for public comment at our upcoming June 23 Board meeting.”
He continued: “While others may be focused on political maneuvering, our focus remains squarely on student achievement and fulfilling our community’s expectation that we provide a world-class education to every child. We will continue working closely with the Fiscal Court and ensure that our efforts follow both the letter and spirit of the law, especially as we navigate this complex process that blends local and state policy.”
Liggins thanked the community for “continued support of our public schools and our shared responsibility to invest in the future of our students.”
Bledsoe said in a statement to the Lantern responding to the district’s interpretation of the opinion that attempting to pass “a tax increase without the input and transparency of the taxpayers it affects is the ultimate political maneuver—especially when done quietly over Memorial Day weekend.” 
“The Attorney General’s opinion is unequivocal: the Fayette County School Board’s vote to raise the occupational tax was unlawful due to a failure to provide the required public notice,” the senator said. “This is about upholding the law and respecting the voices of our community. Taxpayers deserve transparency and accountability, not maneuvering made behind closed doors. It’s imperative that we restore public trust by ensuring all future actions are conducted openly and in full compliance with the law.”

The New Mexico Court of Appeals ruled to dismiss a lawsuit alleging the state violated the state constituion and failied to protect residents from oil and gas pollution.(Photo by Jerry Redfern / Capital & Main)The New Mexico Court of Appeals ordered a lower court Tuesday to toss a case alleging that state officials failed to protect residents from oil and gas pollution in violation of the New Mexico State Constitution.
In the order issued Tuesday, justices in the New Mexico Court of Appeals reversed a lower court’s ruling and concluded that the judiciary does not have the power to address the plaintiffs’ claims.
“The relief Plaintiffs seek—as presented by their complaint—exceeds the boundary of that which the judiciary is authorized to grant,” wrote Chief Judge Jacqueline Medina.
Justices ordered the lower court to dismiss the complaint.
The civil lawsuit was first filed in May of 2023 on behalf of environmental groups, youth activists and individuals from the Pueblos, the Permian Basin and Navajo Nation against the Legislature, New Mexico’s top officials and rulemaking bodies on oil and gas.
The lawsuit alleged the state government failed to limit permitting of oil and gas production and did not adequately enforce pollution laws, which plaintiffs argued is a violation of a 1971 amendment to the state constitution, called the Pollution Control Clause.




 Pollution Control Clause

“The protection of the state’s beautiful and healthful environment is hereby declared to be of fundamental importance to the public interest, health, safety and the general welfare. The legislature shall provide for control of pollution and control of despoilment of the air, water and other natural resources of this state, consistent with the use and development of these resources for the maximum benefit of the people.”
Further, the plaintiffs argued the state’s actions around oil and gas production and pollution discriminated against Indigenous people, youth and frontline communities.




Plaintiffs requested the courts rule that the state has a constitutional duty to prevent pollution — similar to landmark rulings in education and workers’ compensation — and asked the courts to “suspend additional permitting of oil and gas wells” until the state is in compliance. Moreover, plaintiffs asked the courts order state government to install a regulatory structure and plan to protect from pollution.
Attorneys for the State of New Mexico argued the ruling oversteps separations of power between the branches of government, and that youth and frontline communities are not protected classes and there’s no discriminatory intent.
In June 2024,  First District Judge Matthew Wilson dismissed the plaintiffs’ claims against the Legislature, but allowed the case to continue moving through the courts to determine if a constitutional right to pollution control exists.
On Tuesday, the Appeals Court determined the state Constitution does not grant any specific right “to any individual or group, to be free from a given amount of pollution. Nor can it be inferred to create an enforceable right to a beautiful and healthful environment,” Medina wrote.
Additionally, justices agreed with the state’s arguments that frontline and youth are not classifications for discriminatory treatment.
Gail Evans, lead counsel for the Center for Biological Diversity, said plaintiffs plan to appeal Tuesday’s decision.
“New Mexicans amended our constitution 50 years ago to protect our residents from pollution. With this terrible ruling, the court has eviscerated our constitutionally protected rights,” Evans said in a written statement. “This will lead to more air pollution, more contaminated land and water, and more sickness in our communities. We’ll continue our fight against the filthy oil and gas industry on behalf of all New Mexicans and will be appealing this decision to the state Supreme Court.”

Iowa Dental Board records indicate Shawn Kerby was issued a dental license in 2004. Ten years later, in 2014, Kerby was charged by the board with indiscriminate or promiscuous prescribing or dispensing drugs for unlawful purposes.
The board alleged that it had subpoenaed nine of Kerby’s patient files, and in seven of those cases there were multiple prescriptions issued by Kerby that were never recorded in the patients’ files.  On multiple occasions, the board alleged, Kerby had prescribed controlled substances for patients he hadn’t seen for more than a year.

According to the board, Kerby explained his actions by saying he was unaware of the regulations pertaining to prescribing medications. The board allowed Kerby to continue practicing, but fined him $2,500 and placed his license on probation for two years.
In December 2015, agents from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration served search warrants at Kerby’s dental practice and home. Five months later, in April 2016, Kerby agreed to have his license placed on “inactive” status.
In February 2017, Kerby was indicted on 11 federal criminal charges, including knowingly prescribing hydrocodone and other drugs for other individuals in order to obtain the drugs for his own personal use. The offenses allegedly were committed while Kerby was operating two central Iowa dental clinics, Kerby Family Dental and Bright Smiles Family Dental.
Prosecutors alleged that through his dental practice, Kerby had prescribed patients hydrocodone despite the lack of any medical need for the drug. He would then arrange for the patients to route the hydrocodone pills to him once they had filled the prescription at a local pharmacy.
While awaiting trial in July 2017, Kerby was alleged to have violated his pretrial release agreement by testing positive for opiates.
In January 2018, with the federal charges still pending, Kerby was arrested by police in Marengo on charges of serious domestic abuse assault and interference with official acts. He later pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of disorderly conduct.
In February 2018, a plea agreement in the federal case was reached in which nine of the charges were dismissed and Kerby pleaded guilty to charges of obtaining hydrocodone by deception or fraud and being an unlawful user of drugs while in possession of firearms. He was sentenced to 20 months in prison, according to court records.
Shortly after his sentencing but before he began serving his sentence, Kerby was pulled over by police in Marengo. Court records indicate a search of his vehicle resulted in the discovery of a Crown Royal bag in which a glass methamphetamine pipe was located. Kerby subsequently tested positive for amphetamine and methamphetamine and allegedly admitted using meth, according to court records.
After Kerby began serving his federal prison sentence in Leavenworth, Kansas, he voluntarily surrendered his Iowa dental license. In November 2020, after Kerby’s release from prison, the Iowa Dental Board reinstated his license subject to five years of probation, during which he would have to abstain from drug use and submit to practice monitoring.
Recently, the board agreed to terminate the probation agreement early, restoring Kerby’s license to full privileges, free and clear of any restrictions.

(Amir Levy/Getty Images)Ever since 251 people were taken hostage during the Oct. 7 attack on Israel, a group of residents in Boulder have refused to let the community forget the people who were abducted.
The group is the local chapter of the global Run For Their Lives, which organizes events calling for the release of the hostages. Participants in the Boulder chapter have demonstrated by walking in the city’s downtown area every week — 80 weeks so far — since November 2023.
Their walk on Sunday came on the 604th day since the hostages were taken. It also marked the first time they encountered violence. An assailant attacked the demonstrators with a flamethrower and crude homemade bombs in what federal prosecutors say was an antisemitic hate crime.
The attack came amid rising antisemitism throughout the country and followed other recent acts of violence against Jews. The threat of more violence is real. It’s uncertain when the group will walk again. 
The tragedy is compounded to the extent terror muzzles the group’s message.

Run For Their Lives is nonviolent and nonpolitical. It is not pro-Israel. It is not anti-Palestine. It has a single purpose, which no person of conscience should find objectionable: to raise awareness and call for the release of hostages. There are still 58 hostages in Gaza, including four Americans. Roughly 20 are believed to be alive, and group members want the remains of the rest to be given a proper burial.
“This is an international humanitarian crisis, where people from many varying backgrounds and religions and ethnicities were taken hostage. They were not just Israelis,” Shari Weiss, global coordinator of Run For Their Lives, said during an interview this week on WBUR.
She acknowledged the horrors that have befallen Gaza as Israeli forces continue military operations that have resulted in more than 50,000 deaths, most of the territory destroyed, and unspeakable hardship among survivors. 
“The same people do understand the suffering of the Palestinian people and do understand that they are going through something extremely traumatic. You can absolutely hold space for that at the same time,” Weiss said.
When members of the group demonstrate in Boulder, they walk silently for 18 minutes, the number value of the word “chai,” Hebrew for “life.” Many of the participants are older adults (the age range of victims is 52 to 88). They carry photos of the hostages.
Tara Winer, a member of the Boulder City Council, sometimes joins the group on their walks.
“It’s not a protest, it’s not a march. Nobody talks, nobody does anything except walk,” said Winer, who is Jewish. “I’m upset about the hostages, who are still there. So it’s just a way to remind myself about them and also to remind my community about them.”
Many participants have friends and family in Israel.
“They do not want people to forget these hostages … And this is their way of keeping their memory alive,” Winer said. “I know on the walks I go to sometimes they mention all the people who have died in captivity. They mention the hostages by name. They say them by name, so people won’t forget.”
She was not on the walk Sunday. She described the victims as “good friends.”
Police said 12 people were injured in the attack, and at least one was in critical condition, but all are expected to survive.
Run For Their LIves organizers intend to continue the walks, though they might stop for a time until adequate security can be ensured. Whatever the group’s future, the Boulder and Colorado communities can sustain its humanitarian message. Terrorism succeeds only when its target is cowed or diminished.

(Photo courtesy of the American Wild Horse Campaign)Advocates for America’s wild horses are finding little beauty to behold in Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which would slash funding for the Bureau of Land Management’s Wild Horse and Burro program by 25% and allow the slaughter of some 64,000 federally protected wild horses in government holding facilities. 
“The President’s budget will greatly endanger wild horses and burros,” Rep. Dina Titus, a Democrat from Nevada, said in a statement to the Current. “I am deeply concerned by how these cuts will impact the care of these beloved creatures. Even more worrying is the omission of the long-standing provision against horse slaughter.”
The proposal, horse and burro advocates note, mirrors Trump’s 2017 budget, which initially called for a 30% cut to the program’s funding and the elimination of protections against slaughter. Congress restored the protections against killing the animals and augmented funding. 
“Typically, the president’s appropriations bill contains a provision prohibiting horse slaughter. The Trump budget bill does not have this provision, opening the door to animals being sold off for slaughter,” said Dick Cooper, a spokesman for Titus. 
The budget proposal is straight from the pages of Project 2025, the ultra-conservative manifesto of which Trump once claimed ignorance, but has since adopted de facto as a blueprint for his policies. 
“What is happening to these once-proud beasts of burden is neither compassionate nor humane, and what these animals are doing to federal lands and fragile ecosystems is unacceptable,” says Project 2025, which asserted “the uncontrolled growth of wild horses and burros poses an existential threat to public lands.” 
More than half of the nation’s wild horses, estimated between 70,000 and 95,000, are in Nevada, notes Project 2025. “Congress must enact laws permitting the BLM to dispose humanely of these animals.” 
The policy is an “attack on animal welfare and America’s public lands,” according to American Wild Horse Conservation (AWHC), a wild horse advocacy organization. 
“This budget would be a bullet to the head of America’s wild horses if passed by Congress,” said Suzanne Roy, executive director of AWHC. “Slaughter is a barbaric solution to a fundamentally broken federal program.”
The current program is focused on what critics contend are inhumane roundups that end in the warehousing of the creatures in government holding facilities. 
A better solution, say horse advocates, is increasing fertility control efforts and restoring habitat. 
Last month, Titus announced the formation of the Wild Horse Congressional Caucus, “to encourage federal policies for more humane treatment of wild horses and burros,” according to a news release. 
Days later, Titus and 82 members of Congress urged a subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee to craft legislation requiring the BLM to spend at least 10% of the Wild Horse and Burro program’s $140 million budget on fertility control in additional herd management areas. 
“The letter included several requests but notably included language maintaining the prohibition on the sale or adoption of healthy wild horses and burros that results in their destruction,” Titus said in a news release. 
Titus has opposed the BLM’s use of aircraft in roundups. The U.S. has paid helicopter companies $57.4 million for roundups since 2006, according to Titus, a process she has attempted to ban. 
“Scientific research has shown that more humane and cost-effective alternatives, like fertility control, are equally effective in controlling equine populations,” according to the May statement from Titus announcing the Wild Horse caucus. “The BLM’s Wild Horse and Burro Program, however, currently spends less than four percent of its budget on these methods.”
Diverse interests, ranging from cattle ranchers to animal activists, have called for vast reductions to wild horse populations, which they contend are three times the number public lands can accommodate. 
“The greatest threat to our wild horses and burros and our public lands right now isn’t the BLM, it’s not cattle, ranching or mining interests. It’s not animal advocates. It’s climate change and the new reality is fast settling in,” Stephanie Boyles Griffin, the chief scientist of the Humane Society of the United States’ (now Humane World for Animals’) wildlife protection department,  told Reuters in 2021.
Americans, deeply divided on a plethora of topics, are on common ground when it comes to wild horses, says AWHC, which commissioned a 2017 poll that revealed 83% of Trump voters supported protecting wild horses and burros from slaughter, compared with 77% of Hillary Clinton’s supporters. 
“After decades of costly and ineffective roundups, the BLM now stockpiles more wild horses in government pens than remain free on the range,” said Roy in a news release. “Americans deserve a better federal plan that  genuinely tackles off-range holding issues without resorting to slaughter.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IMG_4372-1024x578.jpg,,,2025-06-04 12:25:16.280128

These treatments have enabled individuals to achieve significant weight loss, improve their metabolic health, and reduce the risk of chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease. 
In August 2024, North Carolina’s Medicaid program expanded coverage to include FDA-approved obesity management medications for beneficiaries aged 12 and older. This policy change recognized obesity as a serious health condition requiring medical intervention and aimed to provide equitable access to effective treatments for low-income residents. 
However, a recent budget proposal circulating within the North Carolina General Assembly threatens to undermine this progress. The state legislature is currently considering significant budget cuts to Medicaid, which would jeopardize coverage for obesity medications. Such cuts could reverse the strides we’ve made in addressing the obesity epidemic and exacerbate health disparities across our state.
Obesity is not merely a matter of personal responsibility; it’s a complex health issue influenced by various factors, including genetics, environment, and socioeconomic status. Obesity medications have emerged as a powerful tool in the medical management of obesity, offering hope to patients who have struggled with traditional weight loss methods. By reducing access to these medications, we risk increasing the prevalence of obesity-related complications, leading to higher healthcare costs and diminished quality of life for affected individuals.
Moreover, the proposed Medicaid cuts could disproportionately impact rural communities in North Carolina, where healthcare resources are already limited. Approximately 40% of the state’s Medicaid beneficiaries reside in rural areas. 
It is crucial to recognize that investing in obesity treatment is not only a moral imperative but also a fiscally responsible decision. Research from Global Data shows that obesity costs North Carolina households $1.4 billion in medical expenses and the Medicaid program $404 million in increased spending.
As healthcare providers, policymakers, and citizens, we must advocate for the preservation of Medicaid coverage for obesity medications. Ensuring access to effective treatments for all North Carolinians, regardless of income, is essential for promoting public health, reducing long-term healthcare costs, and upholding the values of equity and compassion in our healthcare system.
I urge our state legislators to consider the profound implications of these proposed Medicaid cuts on obesity treatment and to take action to protect and expand access to these life-changing medications.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wegovy.jpg,,,2025-06-04 12:25:16.280128

(Kansas Reflector screen capture of U.S. House's YouTube channel)TOPEKA — Members of the Kansas congressional delegation participated in a moment of silence on the U.S. House floor to honor the memory of a couple slain in May during an apparent antisemitic attack outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C.
Federal lawmakers stood in tribute for Sarah Milgrim, who grew up in Prairie Village, Kansas, and her partner, Yaron Lischinsky. Both were staff members at the Israeli embassy. They were fatally shot May 21 by a Chicago man who reportedly yelled “free Palestine” while handcuffed and has been charged with first-degree murder.
U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids, a Kansas Democrat who represents the community where Milgrim was raised, said the couple were “tragically and senselessly killed in an antisemitic attack.”
“This hateful and targeted violence is not only heartbreaking, it is unacceptable,” she said. “Antisemitism has no place in our country, and yet we are seeing a deeply disturbing rise in these acts of hate.”
Davids said Milgrim was a member of Congregation B’nai Jehudah and that Milgrim and Lischinsky were committed to building understanding and connection between Israel and the United States.
“To the Jewish community in Kansas, Colorado and across the nation,” Davids said, “please know that I am standing with you. We mourn with you. We recommit to creating a world where no one fears for their safety because of who they are.”
Davids offered her thoughts Tuesday in collaboration with a group of representatives, including Kansas Republican U.S. Reps. Tracey Mann and Derek Schmidt.

WILMINGTON — Bicyclists hitting the scenic Jack A. Markell Trail can now borrow helmets for free, thanks to a new safety initiative from Delaware Greenways.
The nonprofit has launched a bike helmet loaner program aimed at ensuring riders—especially visitors renting bikes—have proper head protection as they travel the popular route between the Wilmington Riverfront and Historic New Castle.
Helmets are available at three key trail access points: the Greater Wilmington Convention and Visitors Bureau Visitor Center and the DuPont Environmental Education Center, both located on the Riverfront, and the New Castle Courthouse Museum.

The initiative is particularly targeted at those using rental bikes from Fin Outdoor Recreation stations along the trail.
Many visitors arrive without helmets, according to Delaware Greenways.
Funded by a grant from the William Penn Foundation, the program provides adult and child-sized helmets, which are cleaned and sanitized after each use.
To borrow a helmet, cyclists must present a driver’s license or credit card—held securely until the helmet is returned—and sign a waiver.
Borrowers will also receive trail safety guidelines. Helmets must be returned to the original loan location by closing time the same day.
Only adults (18+) may rent helmets, though they may do so on behalf of minors in their group.

The hearing was billed as “discussion only.” Lawmakers will take a vote at their next meeting.
  NC Department of Environmental Quality Secretary Reid Wilson (Photo: NC DEQ)
Wilson formerly served as secretary for the Department of Natural and Cultural Resources from 2021 to 2024. Before that, he was DNCR’s chief deputy secretary from 2017 to 2020.
Following his appointment earlier this year by Gov. Josh Stein, he’s been serving as DEQ secretary on an interim basis while awaiting confirmation.
At the national level, Congress has been working on a federal budget that would include cuts to some of the areas under DEQ’s purview.
Sen. Jay Chaudhuri (D-Wake) asked what the cuts would mean to DEQ and how Wilson would respond.
About half of DEQ’s budget comes from federal sources, Wilson said. In particular, the proposed budget would remove $31.5 million from operating grants.
“We would have to let a whole lot of people go, and the consequences of that are that our permitting processes would take longer, our responses to spills and other problems would take longer, our responsiveness and assistance to businesses would not be as strong,” Wilson said. “Everything we do, we would do less well.”
Chaudhuri jokingly followed up with, “Do you still want this job?” Wilson answered in the affirmative.
Sen. Jim Burgin (R-Harnett, Lee, Sampson) asked about water quality, specifically microplastics.
Wilson said DEQ staff are looking into the issue, and the department also collaborates with others like university researchers to learn more.
“Water quality is a huge priority,” he said. “It is a significant health concern, so we’re gonna’ be involved with that.”
After Hurricane Helene swept through the western portion of the state, DEQ worked closely with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to provide mobile programs testing the quality of drinking wells.
Wilson said the agencies found out how polluted the drinking water was, how to get it cleaned, and tested it to make sure it was healthy before people drank it again.
“For folks with a well in the yard or on their property, they’re more vulnerable, so we want to make sure we are doing as much testing,” Wilson said. “We have a [fund] which helps pay for additional private well tests around the state when we determine that that is needed.”
Lawmakers also voted to approve two pieces of legislation at Tuesday’s meeting, which they discussed yesterday: House Bill 247 (“8-1-1 Amendments“) and House Bill 694 (“Study Water/Wastewater Regionalization“).

(Photo by Marga Buschbell-Steeger/Getty Images)Florida installed the second most solar power capacity in the country last year, and is predicted to become the top-ranked residential solar power state in the nation in 2028, but that growth could be severely impacted by the removal of tax credits in the major spending and tax bill which passed in the U.S. House of Representatives by a single vote last month.
The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) says Florida could lose potentially up to 21,800 solar and storage jobs if the current bill isn’t altered before making its way to President Donald Trump’s desk and into law.
Among the provisions included in the One Big, Beautiful Bill Act that would severely alter the solar power industry are the removal of tax credits. The bill includes a measure to eliminate the 30% residential federal solar tax credit by the end of the year. Also the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for commercial and utility-scale projects would remain intact initially but phase down to 80% of its full value by 2029, then 60% in 2030, 40% in 2031 and fully eliminated by 2032, according to GreenLancer.com.
“Lost jobs in every single state are a recipe for disaster for American families, businesses, and the U.S. economy,”  SEIA President and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper said in a press release. “From Texas and California to Florida and Illinois, lawmakers will put Americans nationwide out of work if this legislation becomes law, plain and simple. Axing energy jobs means shuttered U.S. factories, cancelled local investments, and energy shortfalls nationwide. We hope that U.S. Senators won’t let their constituents lose their livelihoods on their watch.”
If unchanged, the removal of tax credits would also hurt efforts on climate change. The bill could increase U.S. greenhouse gas emissions annually by 1 billion metric tons in a decade, according to an analysis from Princeton University researchers.
Florida GOP Sen. Rick Scott has been critical of the bill passed by the House, saying last week it will raise the deficit. He added that he intends to work hard throughout this summer to find more cuts in the package so that he’ll be able to support it when it comes to the Senate floor.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-04 14:39:30+00:00,CT Mirror,‘Big Beautiful Bill’ dings states that offer health care to some immigrants here legally,Tim Henderson | Stateline,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/04/big-beautiful-bill-health-care-immigrants/,The government would slash funding to states that have expanded Medicaid and provide coverage to immigrants who are on humanitarian parole.,"The Republican budget bill the U.S. House approved last month includes a surprise for the 40 states that have expanded Medicaid: penalties for providing health care to some immigrants who are here legally.Along with punishing the 14 states that use their own funds to cover immigrants who are here illegally, analysts say last-minute changes to the bill would make it all but impossible for states to continue helping some immigrants who are in the country legally, on humanitarian parole.Under the bill, the federal government would slash funding to states that have expanded Medicaid and provide coverage to immigrants who are on humanitarian parole — immigrants who have received permission to temporarily enter the United States due to an emergency or urgent humanitarian reason.The federal government pays 90% of the cost of covering adults without children who are eligible under Medicaid expansion, but the bill would cut that to 80% for those states, doubling the state portion from 10% to 20%. That’s the same penalty the bill proposes for states that use their own money to help immigrants who are here illegally.Ironically, states such as Florida that have extended Medicaid coverage to immigrants who are here on humanitarian parole but have not expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act would not be harmed by the bill, said Leonardo Cuello, a Medicaid law and policy expert and research professor at the Center for Children and Families at Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy.It is “wildly nonsensical and unfair” to penalize expansion states for covering a population that some non-expansion states, such as Florida, also cover, Cuello said. “It would appear that the purpose is more to punish expansion states than address any genuine concern with immigrant coverage.”West Virginia is one of the states where lawmakers are nervously watching U.S. Senate discussions on the proposed penalty. Republican state Rep. Matt Rohrbach, a deputy House speaker, said West Virginia legislators tabled a proposal that would have ended Medicaid expansion if the federal government reduced its share of the funding, because the state’s congressional representatives assured them it wasn’t going to happen. Now the future is murkier.Cuello called the proposed penalty “basically a gun to the head of the states.”“Congress is framing it as a choice, but the state is being coerced and really has no choice,” he said.There are about 1.3 million people in the United States on humanitarian parole, from Afghanistan, Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, Ukraine and Venezuela as well as some Central American children who have rejoined family here. The Trump administration is trying to end parole from some of those countries. A Supreme Court decision May 30 allows the administration to end humanitarian parole for about 500,000 people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela.Not many of those parolees qualify for Medicaid, which requires a waiting period or special status, but the 40 states with expanded Medicaid could be penalized if immigrants qualify for the program, said Tanya Broder, senior counsel for health and economic justice policy at the National Immigration Law Center.Meanwhile, an increasing number of states and the District of Columbia already are considering scaling back Medicaid coverage for immigrants because of the costs.The federal budget bill, named the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, is now being considered by the Senate, where changes are likely. The fact that so many states could be affected by the last-minute change could mean more scrutiny in that chamber, said Andrea Kovach, senior attorney for health care justice at the Shriver Center on Poverty Law in Chicago.By her count, at least 38 states and the District of Columbia would be affected by the new restrictions, since they accepted some options now offered by Medicaid to cover at least some humanitarian parolees without a five-year waiting period.“They’re all going to be penalized because they added in parolees,” Kovach said. “So that’s 38 times two senators who are going to be very interested in this provision to make sure their state doesn’t get their reimbursement knocked down.”The change to exclude people with humanitarian parole was included in a May 21 amendment by U.S. Rep. Jodey Arrington, a Texas Republican who chairs the House budget committee. Arrington’s office did not reply to a request for comment, though he has stressed the importance of withholding Medicaid from immigrants who are here illegally.“[Democrats] want to protect health care and welfare at any cost for illegal immigrants at the expense of hardworking taxpayers,” Arrington said in a May 22 floor speech urging passage of the bill. “But by the results of this last election, it’s abundantly clear: The people see through this too and they have totally rejected the Democrats’ radical agenda.”Some states already are considering cutting Medicaid coverage for immigrants, though Democratic lawmakers and advocates are pushing back.Washington, D.C., Democratic Mayor Muriel Bowser has proposed phasing out a program that provides Medicaid coverage to adults regardless of their immigration status, a move she says would save the District of Columbia $457 million.Minnesota advocates protested a state budget deal reached last month with Democratic Gov. Tim Walz to phase out health care coverage for adults who are here illegally, a condition Republican lawmakers insisted on to avoid a shutdown.Similarly, Illinois advocates are protesting new state rules that will end a program that has provided Medicaid coverage to immigrants aged 42-64 regardless of their legal status. The program cost $1.6 billion over three years, according to a state audit. The state will continue a separate program that provides coverage for older adults.“Our position is that decision-makers in Illinois shouldn’t be doing Trump’s work for him,” said Kovach, of the Shriver Center on Poverty Law. “Let’s preserve health coverage for immigrants and stand up for Illinois immigrant residents who have been paying taxes into this state for years and need this coverage.”Illinois state Sen. Graciela Guzmán, a Democrat whose parents are refugees from El Salvador, said many of her constituents in Chicago may be forced to cancel chemotherapy or lifesaving surgery because of the changes.“It was a state budget, but I think the federal reconciliation bill really set the tone for it,” Guzmán said. “In a tough fiscal environment, it was really hard to set up a defense for this program.”Oregon Democratic Gov. Tina Kotek is among the governors holding firm, saying that letting immigrants stay uninsured imposes costs on local hospitals and ends up raising prices for everyone.“The costs will go somewhere. When everyone is insured it is much more helpful to keep costs down and reasonable for everyone. That’s why we’ve taken this approach to give care to everyone,” Kotek said at a news conference last month.Medicaid does pay for emergency care for low-income patients, regardless of their immigration status, and that would not change under the federal budget bill.Franny White, a spokesperson for the Oregon Health Authority, said her state’s Medicaid program covers about 105,000 immigrants, some of whom are here illegally. She said the policy, established by a 2021 state law, can save money in the long run.“Uninsured people are less likely to receive preventive care due to cost and often wait until a condition worsens to the point that it requires more advanced, expensive care at an emergency department or hospital,” she said.California was among the first states, along with Oregon, to offer health insurance to immigrants of all ages regardless of their legal status. But it now is considering cutting back, looking to save $5 billion as it seeks to close a $12 billion budget deficit. In May, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom proposed freezing enrollment of immigrant adults who are here illegally, and charging them premiums to save money.“It’s possible that other states will decide to cut back these services because of budgetary concerns,” said Drishti Pillai, director of immigrant health policy at KFF, a health policy research organization.If the federal budget bill passes with the immigrant health care provision intact, states would have more than two years to adjust, since the changes would not take effect until October 2027.“We have time to really understand what the landscape looks like and really create a legal argument to make sure folks are able to maintain their health care coverage,” said Enddy Almonord, director for Healthy Illinois, an advocacy group supporting universal health care coverage.Stateline reporter Tim Henderson can be reached at thenderson@stateline.org.

Environmental groups like the Atchafalaya Basinkeeper and Sierra Club worry a new bill will make it easier to develop in isolated wetland areas. (Elise Plunk/Louisiana Illuminator)In a stretch of wild land in Iberville Parish, a small dirt dam built across an out-of-the-way bayou is at the center of a lawsuit. Environmental advocates fear cases like this could become more common if a Louisiana proposal to redefine its wetlands becomes law.
Opponents say this proposed change doesn’t just open doors for mixed legal interpretations; it could also make it easier to erase valuable wetland habitat and build in flood-prone areas. 
The lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana in Baton Rouge two years ago by the environmental group Atchafalaya Basinkeeper and the Louisiana Crawfish Producers Association-West. They allege Benjamin Miller of Miller Hunting Club in Eunice illegally dammed Pat’s Throat Bayou in 2021 to access hunting grounds on the other bank. 
The hunting club didn’t get a permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers before Miller built the dam, according to the lawsuit. Instead, the plaintiffs claim the USACE granted a permit after the dam was illegally built. 
If the Louisiana Legislature approves a proposed update to its wetlands laws, environmentalists fear property owners and developers will argue that wetlands like these – illegally dammed off from a navigable body of water – shouldn’t be protected under state or federal law. 
“There will be lawsuits,” said Margie Vicknair-Pray, conservation coordinator for the Sierra Club Delta chapter. “They’re changing the definition, but that doesn’t change reality.” 
 
Mirroring Sackett
Pat’s Throat Bayou is a window into how a national policy shift could affect Louisiana. 
A 2023 Supreme Court decision, Sackett v. Environmental Protection Agency, narrowed federal protection for wetlands. The case arose from an Idaho family who backfilled their property, which the EPA later determined to be protected wetlands. The Sacketts challenged that determination, arguing successfully their land did not connect to a navigable water body – known in federal law as Waters of the United States (WOTUS). 
Before Sackett, developers needed a permit from the Army Corps of Engineers to dredge or fill a wetland area protected under the federal Clean Water Act. 
The Sackett ruling also left uncertainty as to where navigable channels under WOTUS begin and end when it comes to wetlands, according to Mark Davis, director of the Tulane Center for Environmental Law. 
“They didn’t define exactly how that’s going to play out … and people will agree and disagree where those lines are drawn,” Davis said.
This means owners and developers might not need permits from the USACE to build in isolated wetland areas. The grey area has prompted states to step in and try to fill the regulatory gap with their own wetlands laws. 
Louisiana state Sen. “Big Mike” Fesi, R-Houma, has sponsored Senate Bill 94 in response to the Sackett decision. His bill looks to redefine wetlands cut off by levees that break their connection to navigable water bodies as “fastlands,” disqualifying them from federal protection. 
Fesi said in an interview his bill is meant to bring Louisiana law in line with the Sackett decision.
“We try calling everything wetlands just because it has a little water in it,” Fesi said. “It’s gotten way out of hand.”
The Sackett ruling does not affect wetlands connected to navigable bodies of water, such as the Mississippi River, or tidal wetlands along Louisiana’s coast. They would still have federal protection under the Clean Water Act. 
Wetlands with levees, either through “current or future lawful construction,” are left more vulnerable in Fesi’s proposal. The senator did not give a conclusive answer when asked what will happen to current wetlands cut off by future levees, saying his bill was intended to invite room for individual interpretation 
“One size doesn’t fit all,” he said. 
That’s exactly the issue wetlands advocates have with Senate Bill 94 – the room for interperetation it leaves for how wetlands are defined. 
In the case of Pat’s Throat Bayou, the argument was over whether wetlands connected to the navigable bayou were cut off legally or illegally when Miller built a dam, said Brennan Spoor, a member of Atchafalaya Basinkeepers. The group’s mission is to protect and restore the swamps and waterways of the basin. 
“The bill applies to all [levees and dams] that are currently existing or future ones that are lawfully constructed,” Spoor said.
“You could argue that the dam was lawfully constructed, and therefore the wetlands that they have destroyed since they built the dam were never wetlands at all,” he added, explaining that the bill tries to eliminate the need for a federal permit if the property owners want to dredge or fill the landscape. 
The exact language of the bill is also concerning to legal experts for the confusion they say it will create in the law. 
Fesi’s bill changes the definition of wetlands under the Louisiana Pollutant Discharge Elimination System, the program that regulates contamination released into surface waters. But Louisiana still needs to follow federal law for pollutants. 
“The notion of a continuous surface connection is not really part of the rule for what a pollution discharge covers,” Davis said. “If anything, it creates deeper confusion rather than clarification.”
The Louisiana Senate approved Fesi’s bill Tuesday in a 35-1 vote. It heads next to the governor for his signature. 
 
Flood concerns
As legal arguments mount, environmental advocates say the stakes are high for Louisiana. Building in wetland areas eliminates valuable habitat and increases the risk of flooding in nearby communities, Vicknair-Pray said. 
“People just want to build where they want to build, and they don’t want to think of the long-term consequences” like habitat loss and flooding, she said. “That water has to go somewhere. We need wetlands for that water to back up into.”
When asked about flood concerns, Fesi said he thinks his bill would make it easier to construct and repair levees, aiding with much-needed flood control in some areas and “promoting individual property rights” for those wanting to build in previously defined wetlands. 
“Those aren’t wetlands,” Fesi said, speaking about wetland areas surrounded by levees or cut off from bodies of water. 
The 2023 Louisiana Coastal Master Plan, a document outlining various coastal restoration and flood protection projects, recommends a combination of wetland resources and manmade levees for flood control. The same document also warns that overengineering rivers like the Mississippi can “impact coastal wetlands and undermine their ability to replenish naturally.”
“The marsh behind a levee is going to die,” Vicknair-Pray said. 
Aside from just diminished natural flood control, she worries wildlife living in isolated wetland areas, including migrating ducks and native reptiles, will be put at risk with development encouraged under Fesi’s legislation. 
“We used to consider this Sportsman’s Paradise,” she said. “I don’t think we can say that anymore.”",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_4094-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-04 11:06:40.985358

In part 4 of a five part audio series,  Mabuhay sa Alaska, KMXT’s Brian Venua reports that this is just the latest wave in more than a century of ebb and flow.
The first Filipino known to visit Alaska came in 1788, aboard a Spanish trading ship called the Iphigenia Nubiana. The ship passed by Kodiak Island, where Russia had founded one of its first permanent settlements in Alaska a few years earlier.
That’s according to research by Thelma Buchholdt, the founder of the Filipino Heritage Council of Alaska and the first female Filipino American legislator in Alaska and the U.S.
According to Buchholdt, that sailor’s name was lost to time. He’s listed in the captain’s journals only as “Manilla man.”
Ship records note a handful of “Manilla men” coming to trade with Alaska Natives before the 1800s. At least 27 more came on whaling ships through the 1800s.
The Alaskeros establish the first organized communities
The U.S. bought Alaska in 1867, and the first big waves of Filipinos to make the territory their home came late in the century, when the salmon business went industrial.
“They were coming for education, they wanted to follow the American dream,” said Katherine Ringsmuth, Alaska’s state historian.
In 1882, Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act, cutting off a source of cheap labor. In 1898, Filipinos became U.S. nationals when the United States annexed the Philippines as a colony after the Philippine-American War.
By then, Ringsmuth said pre-Exclusion Act Chinese migrants were aging out of the workforce. That set the stage for American companies to hire Filipino people.
“So the Filipinos, who could speak English, who understood American ways of doing things, fit right in there perfectly and really began to dominate the cannery workforce right up through the 21st century,” she said.
In the early days of the territory’s commercial fisheries, one of the first groups to organize were the Alaskeros, or Filipino salmon cannery workers
“Filipinos would be the ones to really lead the way in organizing labor and unionizing,” Ringsmuth said.
Even though they were seasonal workers, the unions fought for better food, working conditions, and more equitable hiring practices. The Filipino cannery workers later sued to end segregation in cannery bunkhouses.
“This kind of racialized segregation of the canneries – is it constitutional?” Ringsmuth said “And they end up winning that case.”
Canneries used to separate workers by country of origin but switched to numbers after the union won its lawsuit. The legacy of the Alaskeros set the foundations of organized Filipino communities in Alaska – now the state’s largest group of Asian Americans.
The number of new Alaskeros cannery workers wound down after Congress further curbed immigration from Asia with new restrictions in 1924. Still, the Filipino diaspora reaches everywhere across the state.
The Kodiak Island Borough has some of the highest concentrations – about a quarter of the population has some kind of Filipino heritage. Anchorage has a population of 18,000 Filipino people, with thousands more across the state totaling to around 35,000 people.
World War II created a new labor shortage
“During World War II, the United States asked for assistance with the Filipinos to help them,” said Gabriel Garcia, a professor at the University of Alaska Anchorage. He’s teaching a course on Filipino history and community, which starts in the fall.
Under the Second War Powers Act of 1942, military service gave U.S. nationals, who can’t vote or run for office, a path to citizenship.
“That was one of the perks that was promised to the Filipinos at that point,” Garcia said. “And so many Filipinos from all over the Philippines enlisted as members of the military here in the U.S.”
After WWII, the Philippines received its independence, becoming its own nation in 1945.
Immigration after Independence
Filipino immigration boomed again about 20 years after that, when the federal government lifted immigration restrictions from Asia.
“The ban was lifted in 1965, so post-1965, that’s when immigration numbers again significantly increases, specifically in the Filipino community,” Garcia said.
Many of these new immigrants were engineers, doctors, educators, and other professionals. Filipino nurses in particular immigrated in droves through the Exchange Visitor Program.
Schools there primarily teach in English, which makes an immigrant’s transition easier than it might be from many other countries.
“(The) Philippines is a good country to look into particularly because the type of educational system they have in the Philippines is very much Westernized,” Garcia said.
Now, as the U.S. faces a national teacher shortage, school districts are looking at the Philippines once again. Garcia said it’s not surprising that the island nation is supplementing another U.S. workforce, largely for the same reasons as for nurses and other skilled professions.
“With the historical connection of the Philippines and the United States, and the educational system being very close to the United States, I think the Philippines is a natural choice for labor shortages,” he said.
Jobs in America tend to pay better, so many emigrate to send money to their families back home.
“The natural choice is to look for better opportunities for them – financial specifically – so that they can provide for their family back home in the Philippines,” Garcia said.

Ned Lamont. But hundreds will die from inaction at the midnight adjournment.
“It’s an annual event at this stage,” said House Majority Leader Jason Rojas, D-East Hartford.
A select few still have a chance for passage, most notably House Bill 5004, a largely aspirational measure that would strengthen the state’s existing carbon-reduction goals and create a new “Clean Economy Council” to develop strategies and policies to help meet those targets.
It passed the House and has been sitting on the Senate calendar since May 5. Senate President Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven, said Tuesday night it will be one of the Senate’s first tasks on Wednesday.
Nearly 4,000 bills were filed this year. On Wednesday morning, there were nearly 80 Senate bills awaiting final action in the House and 63 House bills awaiting passage in the Senate. House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said most are effectively dead.
“I think most of us know that not every idea that we put out, not every bill that I put in, is going to become law, either,” said House Majority Leader Jason Rojas, D-East Hartford. “And this is just part of the natural process, that is this process of filtering through lots of ideas and only having enough time and or resources to pass so many.”
House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, said the legislative committees churned out too many bills.
“We say that every year: There’s too many bills that get out of committee,” Candelora said. “But I feel as if committees didn’t do their work. These bills are coming very late. A lot of them weren’t ready for prime time.”
Senate Bill 1, a priority bill for early childhood care, passed easily, as did House Bill 5001, an effort to improve special education services. An energy bill glided to final passage Tuesday night.
Other bills found new places to survive, and some are effectively dead.
State finances
Several smaller bills related to fiscal matters received final approval Tuesday when the Senate adopted the $55.8 billion two-year state budget.
Those smaller bills wrapped into the budget package would:

Cap the reserve for the budget’s Special Transportation Fund at 18% of the STF.

Any reserves above that cap would be used to pay down bonded debt tied to highway, bridge, rail or other transportation projects.

Create a business tax credit for farmers’ investments in machinery, other equipment and buildings. The credit would offset 20% of expenses in these categories.


Establish a $500 state income tax credit for owners of a licensed family child care home.


Require the Department of Economic and Community Development to submit a Sept. 1 progress report on an initiative launched last year to reduce concentrated poverty in Connecticut.


Require the Department of Revenue Services to study ways to improve collection of delinquent taxes owed by state contractors. An earlier version of the bill would have allowed the state to deny driver’s license renewals to any delinquent taxpayer, not just to contractors.


Require telecommunications companies to charge subscribers a five-cents-per-month fee to support a cancer relief account for Connecticut firefighters.

Other bills with fiscal elements were expected to die when the 2025 session closes Wednesday at midnight. These include:

A plan to expand an existing property tax abatement program for police, firefighters and emergency medical technicians killed in the line of duty to including surviving domestic partners.


A program to gradually phase out municipal property taxes on motor vehicles, beginning in 2028.

Insurance
The House on Monday gave full passage to a sweeping bill that seeks to boost insurance affordability and transparency, as well as address industry practices that critics say limit patients’ access to care.
Among its many provisions, the bill would allow the state insurance commissioner to limit rate increases for insurers that have a track record of hiking costs. Beginning Jan. 1, 2027, if an insurer’s rate increases exceed the state’s “cost growth benchmarks” for the previous two consecutive years where data is available, the commissioner can reduce the carrier’s proposed rate increase by up to two percentage points.
The insurance commissioner can also fine carriers that don’t comply with a state law requiring insurers to offer mental health coverage that’s as robust as coverage for medical services, known as “mental health parity.” The bill would allow the insurance commissioner to fine insurers up to $625,000 annually for noncompliance with the mental health parity law. It also would require the parity reports submitted by insurers, including the names of each company, to be made public.
The bill also contains measures directly responding to high-profile public scrutiny of the insurance industry over the past year on issues including prior authorization and proposed time limits on the use of anesthesia.
Housing
A bill that would have prevented municipalities from fining people for sleeping outside hasn’t moved forward since it gained Committee passage in March and is likely dead.
House Bill 7033 would prohibit municipalities from penalizing people for conducting “life sustaining activities,” such as sleeping, eating and storing personal belongings, in public spaces. There are exceptions if there is adequate indoor shelter offered that includes transportation to the shelter for the person and their belongings or if people are impeding traffic.
The proposal follows a summer Supreme Court decision that ruled in an Oregon case that towns can pass and enforce ordinances that prevent people from sleeping outside. 
Children’s issues
The Committee on Children debated a bill that would have allowed hospitals to install so-called “baby boxes” on an exterior wall, high-tech, temperature-controlled chambers with alarms where people could have left infants. But that bill died in committee. 
Proponents said the boxes would have given people a judgement-free option to safely relinquish newborns, which could save lives. Opponents argued that the boxes, while well-intended, are not needed because Connecticut already has laws that allow mothers to anonymously relinquish babies with no consequences, and that the boxes could unleash many negative consequences. 
They say that because the boxes are made by only one company in the U.S., Safe Haven Baby Boxes, and are unregulated, there could be unforeseen safety issues in the event of a blackout or technological problem. A baby was recently found dead in a baby box in a church in Italy, where a priest said he never received a notification linked to his cellphone, though that box was not made by Safe Haven Baby Boxes.
Safe Haven Baby Boxes are concentrated in the Midwest. Indiana, the home state of Safe Haven Baby Box CEO Monica Kelsey, an anti-abortion activist, has more than 100 of the boxes.
The Committee on Children also heard testimony on a bill that would have extended financial support for foster youth to attend college and other post-secondary education programs from age 23 to 28. That bill died in the Appropriations Committee.
At the start of the legislative session, Lamont championed the creation of a Universal Pre-K endowment. That bill, House Bill 6867, was since been abandoned for a plan in Senate Bill 1 that also encompasses infant and toddler care and is the result of negotiations between Lamont, House and Senate Democrats and advocates.
Environment
The last week of the legislative session has brought a bit of déjà vu for environmental activists, who once again find themselves waiting for the Senate to take up a climate bill numbered 5004.
Last year, that bill died in the Senate when the clock struck midnight. But this year, advocates are still hoping that lawmakers will find time to pass their legislation, which promises to set Connecticut on a path toward achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.
“I’m like teetering between ‘Is it gonna fail again?’ and hoping that it’s gonna go,” said Samantha Dynowski, the state director for Sierra Club Connecticut. “Every five minutes I hear something different, and I don’t know what to think.”
The bill passed the House on a party-line 98-47 vote in May. The Senate chair of the Environment Committee, Sen. Rick Lopes, D-New Britain, said he expected to run the bill early on Wednesday.
Loosely tied to that bill is the fate of another measure dealing with the state’s growing population of black bears. 
A controversial proposal to allow hunting of bears, Senate Bill 1523, was passed by the upper chamber on May 15. In the House, however, lawmakers plan to strip the hunting provisions of the bill and replace them with a requirement for the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection to come up with a bear management plan.
Should the House pass the amended bill, it would have to go back to the Senate for concurrence. The bill also includes language clarifying when farmers can shoot a bear that is causing damage to crops, a priority for Republicans representing rural districts.
With the session adjourning at midnight, both bills are prime candidates for the last-minute horse-trading that often takes place between the two chambers.
Criminal justice
Amid a public outcry from immigrant advocacy groups and faith organizations, lawmakers passed an expanded version of the Trust Act, Connecticut’s law outlining the circumstances under which local and state officials are allowed to work and communicate with the federal government’s efforts to detain unauthorized migrants. Individuals are now permitted to sue over alleged violations of the law. The bill also expands the situations in which officials can comply with federal immigration detainers — and not be subject to such litigation — to include 13 additional crimes. 
Certain portions of the original bill were removed, including a section that would have prohibited companies who wish to contract with state agencies from working with federal immigration authorities.
A bill prohibiting the use of handcuffs in children passed through the Senate and the House, although significantly watered down. The bill would have originally raised the age at which a child could be arrested from age 10 to age 14, but this was eliminated before the bill reached the Senate. The adopted bill says a police officer cannot place handcuffs on a 14-year-old unless there is a risk to public safety or to the officer. An amendment to the bill says the officer is not held culpable if he or she handcuffs a child under 14 without knowing their age. 
A bill that would have expanded the eligibility of parole for people who committed crimes at a young age has not yet been called in the House of Representatives. The bill would make people who committed a crime while between the ages of 18 and 21 and were sentenced for that crime after Oct. 1, 2005, eligible for parole after serving a portion of their sentence. 
An act revising certain portions of Connecticut’s hate crimes statutes was temporarily passed in the House on Tuesday after a lengthy and technical debate over a proposed amendment that would add law enforcement officers as a protective class. The bill would move all the current statutes that pertain to hate crimes into one section, clarify conflicting language around intent and increase penalties for criminal acts that are found to have been motivated by bias against a protected group. 
Rep. Steven Stafstrom, D-Bridgeport, said Tuesday that the purpose was to consolidate Connecticut’s hate crimes laws, which are “scattered,” “inconsistent” and “difficult for police officers and prosecutors to charge” into one place.
The House of Representatives has yet to call a bill passed by the Senate earlier this session that would penalize companies that manufacture and sell drugs or devices that can be used in capital punishment. Under the proposal, the Commissioner of the Department of Consumer Protection can refuse to issue a certificate of registration to a business that manufactures or sells items the business knows will be used to “execute a sentence of death.” The department can also suspend or revoke a registration that already exists. Republicans have argued that the bill violates the Interstate Commerce Clause, since the death penalty is legal in other states.

Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont signed into law a bill that would establish a 23-member trade commission between the state and Puerto Rico.
“This is a long time in the making, and I believe that it was the collaborative effort. We worked very hard to make it a reality, and we’re excited that this is moving forward,” said Rep. Juan Candelaria, D-New Haven. “I think now the real work begins, right?”
The measure aims to boost trade and economic investment, and allows lawmakers in the continental U.S. and on the island to team up on policy issues of interest to both communities, among other things.
“The committee will break out into academics, pharmaceutical, manufacturing, agricultural and the like because those are four avenues that can parlay and play off each other, going back and forth to Connecticut and Puerto Rico,” explained bill co-sponsor Geraldo Reyes, who represents Waterbury.
Another aim would help to promote business and academic exchanges between the state and the island. Some had already been in talks — like the just-inked agreement between the University of Puerto Rico’s Ponce campus and the University of Bridgeport’s nursing programs.
“(It) opens up a myriad of opportunities for those folks on the island,” said co-sponsor Christopher Rosario of Bridgeport, “and, vice versa, for those students from here that can go and study down there and experience Latin America — being that we have a high concentration of Latinos here in New England — to learn the language and work in that environment.”
Given the skills sharing focus, support has come from both sides of the aisle.
“This is about creating mutual opportunities for job growth and economic development,” said Republican Sen. Henri Martin in a statement. “It makes sense for us to create a panel that will focus on deepening ties with Puerto Rico. Those deeper ties can bring about entrepreneurship and innovative ideas while boosting tourism.”
But before the commission can be formally established, Puerto Rico’s legislature must pass a parallel bill and get a signature from their governor, Jenniffer González-Colón.
And as Puerto Rico still recovers from damage to its electrical grid after a series of hurricanes and earthquakes in recent years, the new commission aims to help garner investment in infrastructure on the island and the state.
“One of the things that we kind of feel helpless here on the mainland is: When something happens back home, what can we do to help? I think this is a way for us to kind of reach out again, and especially when it comes to the infrastructure with energy,” Rosario said. “We want to send our folks as well, those experts that can help fix that electrical grid — something that Washington is not doing, something that we can do as a state.”

Imagine a row of children’s books and educational materials, deemed inappropriate or controversial by some, shoved away in an adult’s only section – further out of reach than that imaginary cabinet – each with a warning that disseminating those books to a minor could be a crime.
In some cities and townships across Michigan, library officials or the members of boards that oversee them, especially those who have expressed hostility to the LGBTQ+ community, are toying with the idea of making those barriers a reality.
The effort has become a second front, so to speak, in the culture war over children’s books and particularly those with LGBTQ+ content or themes. 
Much like the battles over prohibiting library books or criminalizing them for minors that have played out over the last few years, activists and attorneys across Michigan have said that similarly sequestering or restricting access to books runs afoul of the First Amendment.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Jay Kaplan, a long-time staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan staff specializing in LGBTQ+ rights, said in an interview with Michigan Advance that right-wing culture warriors were employing this new tactic because they were losing the overall campaign on outright book bans.
“They’re losing in terms of the public opinion, [because] a vast majority of people disfavor this type of thing,” Kaplan said. “And so they feel, ‘We’ll just try to move it to another place in the library. We’ll try to put a label on it. We’ll try and discourage people from being able to take them out.’”
But federal courts have looked at the issue, and they have found, Kaplan said, that even when a community is not just removing the book entirely from the library, the act of putting a burden on the First Amendment right to receive information based on content amounted to the same.
“Particulary if what’s motivating you to want to limit them is your disapproval of the subject matter of the book, or some of the contents of the book,” he said. “That also violates the First Amendment.”
The crusade in Hartland
For the Hartland Cromaine District Library in Livingston County, the conversation on labeling books started in 2022. Over time and with the election of new library Board of Trustees members, the conversation became much more pointed.
Much of that had to do with the election of Bill Bolin, the pastor of the FloodGate Church in Brighton, and his elevation to the president of the Cromaine District Library board in January. Bolin and his church have been written about by various publications, including The Atlantic’s Tim Alberta, detailing Bolin’s mixture of right-wing conspiratorial politics and Christianity. Bolin also features throughout Alberta’s 2023 book, “The Kingdom, the Power, and the Glory: American Evangelicals in an Age of Extremism.”
Some board members questioned Bolin’s experience and qualifications for running the library board in a breezy rural district just before he was selected as its leader in January. But the board voted 5-2 to install him at the top.
In February, Bolin, as the congregants of the FloodGate Church know him to do, began to speak out of order to introduce himself and detail exactly why it was that he sought the library board position and its leadership post, according to the approved minutes of the board’s February 20 meeting.
“For those who do not know why I ran for this position, I desire to protect children from the harm that can befall them over coercive behavior,” Bolin said in a statement to the crowd. “The approach I am suggesting, along with certain colleagues, is a commonsense approach to changing the sexual tone and nature of some library policies and practices.”
Bolin said that the board would then discuss controversial items on the agenda, including the removal of June LGBTQ+ Pride displays, labeling certain books that may be deemed controversial, moving books to an age restricted area, providing supervision in the teen area to monitor “behavior” and returning the Pledge of Allegiance to monthly meetings.
Bolin then read from Michigan law regarding the displaying or disseminating of sexually explicit materials to minors, followed by a recitation of a potential warning label he had created warning adults of the dangers of providing such material to children.
But Bolin wasn’t talking about dirty magazines in a seedy retail store: he was talking about books within the community’s public library.

“Someone needs to stand up for the children,” Bolin said. “Those who serve on the library board and want to implement policies that restrict access to certain books and place content warning labels will be able to enact policies that reflect the community in which they serve the people of Cromaine Library District, either tonight by vote or later after referral to the appropriate committee for refinement of language and crafting of policies that state intention of the people.”
Bolin added that a list of books that could be recommended for labeling was being compiled with at least 80 titles, minimum, to be presented to the librarian “for labeling and movement into an age-appropriate section of the library.”
Members of the community present at the February 20 meeting noted that the Top 10 challenged books in that list had LGBTQ+ characters or themes. Some questioned if the board had the legal authority to deem what was and wasn’t sexual in nature about these books, while others praised the move.
Among the latter was Livingston County Commissioner Wes Nakagiri, one of the architects of the conservative Tea Party movement in Michigan, which undoubtedly built the framework of the America First and MAGA movement that propelled President Donald Trump to power in 2016 and again in 2024.
Attorneys advise against censorship
A day before that meeting, on February 19, the board sought and received a legal opinion from its corporate counsel at the Foster Swift law firm on whether it could move forward with restricting access to books or otherwise discouraging minor patrons from getting to them.
In a memo provided to Michigan Advance, the law firm expressed concern that the library would be on shaky constitutional ground if it moved forward with a policy that would move books to an adult-only section, placing them behind glass, creating a separate section for controversial books or placing on them labels identifying them as obscene.
The firm said each one of those actions might be unconstitutional based on similar policies already deemed unconstitutional by the courts.

Although each of those actions came with significant risk of opening the library up to a lawsuit, the move to place warning labels on books indicating sexually explicit content and the possibility of criminal prosecution if the material was provided to a minor was noted as having “several practical shortcomings that could lead to further violations of the law.”
Not only would the labels constitute a burden on access to materials, the firm said courts would undoubtedly analyze the motives behind labeling some materials and not others. The firm added that the library would likely lose that challenge.

Some community members have noted that communications between board members and residents or allies in the push to have some books labeled would only help a suing party win a case against the library.
“For example, if the ‘sexually explicit material’ labels tended to stigmatize protected speech or one viewpoint more heavily than another, like anti-LBGTQ+ messages vs. pro-LBGTQ+ messages, the library may be subject to liability,” the firm said in the February legal memo. “Lastly, we note that there is current litigation in federal court involving an Alabama library’s use of ‘labels’ that signaled that a material contained ‘adult’ themes and the library’s prohibition on minors accessing those materials. In that case, the parties are awaiting a hearing and/or decision on the plaintiff’s motion for preliminary injunction.”
Yet Bolin and members of the board who supported the push continued on, and eventually sought a separate opinion from the Alliance Defending Freedom, a Christian legal advocacy group that works primarily to seed Christian religious beliefs, practices and customs in public schools or other government bodies.
Bolin eventually brought a refined version of the proposed policy with labeling as the main avenue to keep LGBTQ+ themed and other materials deemed inappropriate to library staff and the board with notes from ADF attorney Paul Spena. Bolin was wary to name Spena as the attorney he was now working with to craft the policy but later relented when pressed on the issue.
When asked to talk about the legal theory behind the labels and what case law they could point to show that it was legally sound, Spena and the ADF declined to comment or be interviewed for this story.
Letter to Board of Trustees
The ACLU of Michigan formally chimed in on the policy last week, and sent the board a letter drafted by Kaplan warning members that what they were pursuing was an act of censorship, even if the titles are not banned from the library and remain within its walls, located in special sections or with new labels affixed to the covers.
“Doing so impedes the rights of library patrons and runs afoul of the First Amendment,” Kaplan wrote. “It can also harm marginalized communities who may come to places like public libraries hoping for an inclusive space, and in this particular instance, doing so with regard to LGBTQ+ titles will exacerbate that harm.”
Opposition mounts as board moves forward
Several community members who spoke to Michigan Advance in the course of reporting this story said that Bolin and his allies on the board were moving closer to adopting the policy despite those warnings, in essence inviting a lawsuit to be pioneers on the issue here in Michigan. Among them was Stand Against Extremism LivCo (SAGE) co-founder Julie Ohashi, who has been vocal in her opposition to the board’s actions thus far.
On Tuesday evening, Spena was expected to speak at the library board’s special meeting to discuss the policy in full. No such discussion with Spena or another attorney from the ADF occurred, and it was not clear if Spena or another member of the group were present at the meeting.
Bolin mentioned, however, that the legal discourse was changing in America, indicating that courts in the era of Trump might be turning the tide to support measures much like the one being discussed by the Cromaine District Library board.
Present at the meeting, however, were several community members, some in support of Bolin and the board’s majority on the label issue and plenty of others who said they were disheartened, dismayed and angry that the board would continue moving toward a policy they called discriminatory and clearly illegal.

As the board moved through the policy line by line, softening it due to objections from several board members out of fear of being sued and settling more on labeling as the possible avenue, those opposed to the move held signs calling on the board to not mix religion and politics. But those silent protests quickly turned vocal, with shouts and jeers rising above the din of what started as a calm meeting.
Board Vice President Jeannine Gogoleski was appointed as the sergeant at arms for the meeting, and she and her husband, Glenn Gogoleski, a member of the Hartland Consolidated Schools Board of Education, began removing disruptive members of the meeting.
Tensions rose further when the Livingston County Sheriff’s Office was called to ensure there were no further outbursts. The meeting went into recess until deputies could sort out the situation, and they remained there until it ended.
Although the board did not adopt a policy on Tuesday, it is expected to do so at its next meeting.
During public comment, some read lengthy diatribes laden with Christian scripture, while others lambasted the board inviting what they called a hate group to give the board legal advice and defend them if they are forced into court. One woman held up Alberta’s book while speaking, noting that Bolin’s name appeared in it multiple times, to which Bolin smiled.
Ohashi called ADF a “hate group” that has described LGBTQ+ rights as a principal threat to religious freedom, and attacking those rights was at the center of their work.
“Their goal is to trigger as many lawsuits that can get to the U.S. Supreme Court as fast as possible,” she said. “That is precisely the point. They want this to go to court, because ADF’s ultimate goal is eliminating LGBTQ+ Americans’ status as a protected class of citizens.” 
Kate Mazzara of Hartland said she feared that the nation was tiptoeing toward religious fascism and that the small district library in her hometown was sliding on the same path.
“Make no mistake about it, that’s what this is,” Mazara said. “It starts with baby steps, and then it’s over.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/20250603_191506-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-04 10:03:26.228465

Angie Eberspacher of Beaver City, a former member of Educational Service Unit 6, seeks to represent District 5 on the Board of Ed. While on the ESU board, Eberspacher said, she was a strong voice for fiscal responsibility and an advocate for students and teachers. She eventually served as chair. She said she is dedicated to ensuring a “quality education” for all students.

Eberspacher is a graduate of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln with dual degrees in elementary education and early childhood education.
“I’m committed to supporting today’s students and helping ensure the next generation has every opportunity to succeed,” Eberspacher said in a statement.
District 5 on the State Board consists of Butler, Clay, Fillmore, Franklin, Gage, Hamilton, Jefferson, Nuckolls, Pawnee, Polk, Richardson, Saline, Saunders, Seward, Thayer, Webster and York Counties, as well as portions of Lancaster County (south Lincoln and surrounding communities including Denton, Sprague, Hallam, Roca, Hickman, Firth, Bennet and Waverly).
The eight members of the State Board of Education generally oversee the Nebraska Department of Education. Terms in office are for four years.

Eberspacher said she plans to visit communities across her district to listen and focus on how to improve literacy and proficiency scores, recruit and retain quality teachers and strengthen academics. She said she also wants to be “a voice for all parents” and promote spending restraint.
In 2023, Eberspacher testified at the Nebraska Legislature in support of a handful of conservative-led proposals, including opening up teachers or librarians to possible criminal penalties for distributing “obscenity,” prohibiting certain medical care for minors with gender dysphoria, outlawing drag shows for minors, creating a “Parents’ Bill of Rights” in education and allowing public dollars to follow students to private K-12 schools (the “My Student, My Choice Act”).
Eberspacher and her husband of 36 years, Curt, own a farming operation in rural Beaver Crossing. The family has three adult daughters, a son-in-law and a granddaughter.
Penner on Wednesday confirmed to the Examiner that he is not seeking reelection. He has given his “full endorsement” to Eberspacher and said her experience and dedication “make her the right choice to continue advocating for students, parents and educators across the district.”

The race is officially nonpartisan, but Penner and Eberspacher are both Republicans. She previously worked as a spokeswoman for the Nebraska Republican Party. Penner was appointed to the State Board in December 2021 and won election in 2022 with 55% of the vote.
The State Board of Education is currently split 4-4 between Republicans and Democrats. The split has led some to advocate for giving the governor more control over the education bureaucracy. A January vote for board chair required 54 votes in January.
“I am excited to run for the Nebraska State Board of Education and hear from voters across District 5 about their vision for education in Nebraska,” Eberspacher said. “I’m running to support Nebraska’s students, teachers and parents, and to work toward a stronger education system for everyone.”

The probes come after Cromwell Public Schools received a similar notice last week, informing the district that the U.S. Department of Education was investigating whether it was violating federal law by allowing transgender students to participate in sports and use facilities aligned with their gender identity.
At the time, representatives with the state Department of Education said Cromwell’s was the only such investigation they were aware of. Now there are three.
A spokesperson from the state Department of Education said the new investigation notices were sent directly to district officials in Bloomfield and Canton and that the department had not received copies. The department was notified by the districts and was aware of the investigations, the spokesperson said.
If the districts are found in violation of Title IX, millions of dollars in federal funding could be at risk: roughly $1.26 million for Cromwell, $3.3 million for Bloomfield and $700,000 in Canton.

Superintendents Tracy A. Youngberg, of Bloomfield, and Jordan E. Grossman, of Canton, did not respond to requests for comment Tuesday.
Cromwell Superintendent Enza Macri wrote to district parents over the weekend, according to a report from WFSB. “As a public school, we make it a priority to create a welcoming and nurturing environment where all students can participate in our educational programs,” she wrote. “At the same time, we are fully committed to following federal and state laws prohibiting discrimination in educational programs. We are keeping both of these priorities at the forefront as we review our policies with the Office for Civil Rights.”
Policy questions
The investigations follow several executive orders from President Donald J. Trump that have reshaped the federal Department of Education — particularly with respect to Title IX guidance and diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. Under the new rules, the federal Education Department will enforce Title IX “on the basis of biological sex in schools and on campuses.”
Title IX, which prohibits sex-based discrimination, was extended under former President Joe Biden to students who identify as LGBTQ+ and added protections for transgender students. But after Trump took office in January, he reverted Title IX protections back to the 2020 guidance that was issued during his first administration.
Rep. Christie Carpino, R-Cromwell, sent a letter to Gov. Ned Lamont Monday seeking guidance with respect to what she called “conflicting policies at the state and federal level.” The investigation and funding threat, Carpino wrote, “seem to stem from a problem created by the State.”
“We are a small town that values the education and safety of our students,” she wrote. “We are now being faced with mounting legal fees and the potential loss of almost $1 million dollars, annually, for no reason other than dichotomy between state and federal policies.”
Lamont disagreed Tuesday, saying the state was compliant with federal statute and adding that Connecticut “will continue to adhere to those laws.”
“What we will not adhere to is divisive bullying in our schools or targeting of transgender students, who deserve to have their rights protected,” Lamont said in a written statement. “At a time when we’re trying to ensure that all students feel connected and engaged, discrimination and exclusion have no place in our schools or in our state.”

Connecticut law “prohibits discrimination based on gender, gender identity & expression and sexual orientation,” and shall offer “an equal opportunity to participate in the activities, programs and courses of study offered in such public schools, at such time as the child becomes eligible to participate in such activities, programs and courses of study, without discrimination on account of race, color, sex, gender identity or expression, religion, national origin or sexual orientation,” according to the state’s official website.
The Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference says its policy to provide transgender student-athletes with equal opportunities consistent with their gender identity remains unchanged.
“Throughout this process, we continue to support the well-being of all student-athletes while abiding by federal and state law,” CIAC Executive Director Glenn M. Lungarini said, adding that his office has sought additional guidance from the Attorney General’s Office, the Connecticut Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities and the Connecticut State Department of Education.
A common thread
Cromwell, Canton and Bloomfield are three of five school districts who were defendants in a 2019 lawsuit that sought to ban transgender athletes from participating in female sports.
Soule et al v. Connecticut Association of Schools was filed on behalf of four cisgender female high school track athletes who said the participation of transgender girls in their sport took away their opportunities for victory, public recognition, athletic scholarships and future employment and violated Title IX, according to the lawsuit.
Trump administration officials agreed in 2020 that Connecticut violated Title IX, but state leaders pushed back. In early 2021, when President Joe Biden took office, his administration withdrew support for the lawsuit and rescinded the Education Department’s threats to cut funding to the districts. At that time, a district court ruled in favor of the defendants to dismiss the lawsuit and the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the decision in December 2022.
The case, however, remains ongoing after a larger panel of appellate judges from the 2nd Circuit Court sent the case back to the district court to consider the full Title IX claims. The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint last year requesting athletic records be changed where transgender athletes participated.
Dan Barrett, legal director of the ACLU of Connecticut, said Connecticut was not then, or now, in conflict with federal law, nor is the state violating Title IX by allowing transgender students to participate in sports aligned with their gender identity.
“[State law] won’t be in conflict unless and until the U.S. Supreme Court or the Second Circuit rules that agrees with the plaintiffs in Soule and others like them and the current United States government, which is pushing this theory that Title IX actually requires discrimination — requires schools to discriminate against trans kids,” Barrett said. “If one of our higher appellate courts agrees with that theory, then yes, Connecticut’s law will come into conflict with Title IX.”
The federal government’s threat to pull funding “is a mechanism by which the current executive branch can advance its agenda,” Barrett said. 
“Not just when it comes to the rights of transgender kids in Connecticut, but on a range of activities,” Barrett said. “They’re using either federal constitutional provisions or federal statues that would have preemptive effect, to nationalize discrimination and to override state laws that require people to be treated fairly.”
State Attorney General William Tong said in a written statement Tuesday that the investigations were “meanspirited and unlawful, and deeply harmful to all Connecticut students.”
He said precedent from the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Bostock v. Clayton County has “made it clear … that discrimination against transgender individuals is illegal under federal law.” Tong said his office is “considering all legal options within our authority to protect Connecticut’s students and schools.”

Despite being the fastest-growing population group, APIA voices are often overlooked due to sparse data. A new report aims to change that. 
The post New survey shows that Asian and Pacific Islander Americans are concerned about cost of living, lean Democrat, and have high levels of civic engagement  appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER AMERICANS in Massachusetts are concerned about the cost of living and housing in the state, tend to have a high level of civic engagement, and are more likely to vote for Democrats, according to a new statewide poll conducted by the MassINC Polling Group. On Tuesday, a group of organizations that work on issues relating to Asian and Pacific Islander Americans (APIA) released a survey report – titled No Longer Invisible – on the lived experiences and civic engagement of APIA residents in the state. The study included responses from 1,414 APIA residents in the state and was conducted from March 5 to March 31, 2025.  Asian and Pacific Islander Americans make up 7 percent of the population and are the fastest-growing racial group in Massachusetts, with the population rising by nearly 38 percent since 2012, according to the survey. However, little data has been collected that provides insights into the experiences of APIA in the state. Top of mind for APIA survey respondents were issues around the affordability of housing and the cost of living in the state. Twenty-seven percent cited housing, and 32 percent picked cost of living as the most pressing issue. Broader statewide surveys have shown that housing shows up as the top issue for people living in Massachusetts. The survey asked questions about political participation, safety and sense of belonging, and viewpoints on the Trump administration and its policies. Nearly a quarter of respondents said that they had experienced discrimination with 21 percent saying that they faced ethnic slurs.  Only 39 percent of respondents said that they strongly agree that they feel like they belong in the United States. Respondents largely said that they anticipated negative impacts from the Trump administration on critical issues like immigration policy (61 percent), racism (65 percent), reproductive rights (63 percent), climate change (63 percent), and LGBTQ+ rights (67 percent). A majority of survey respondents opposed President Donald Trump’s executive orders purportedly ending birthright citizenship; rolling back diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts; and increasing deportation actions. However, the results were a bit more divided on the deportation executive order compared to the others, with lower overall opposition.   Advocates for APIA communities say that their work is more difficult without adequate data, and elected officials might overlook APIA voters. The survey is meant to address that gap and provide some of the data necessary for more advocacy and policy changes regarding APIA issues. The project was a collaboration between the Massachusetts Asian American and Pacific Islanders Commission, the Institute for Asian American Studies at UMass Boston, the Asian Community Fund at The Boston Foundation, and APIs CAN. The groups worked with the MassINC Polling Group, which is partly owned by MassINC, the nonprofit organization that publishes CommonWealth Beacon, to create the survey questions.  Anti-Asian hate and discrimination have been on the rise nationwide. Nearly 36 percent of Asian Americans across the country reported having experienced harassment, and 63 percent reported that they have felt unsafe in a public place, according to the 2025 STAATUS Index – an annual survey of Asian Americans in the US.  “This project is both a wake-up call and a call to action,” said Danielle Kim, the executive director of the Asian Community Fund at the Boston Foundation and a member of the Massachusetts Asian American and Pacific Islanders Commission, at an event on Tuesday launching the survey report. “This reported partnership represents an important milestone in uplifting greater visibility for our communities and harnessing our collective voice to advocate for lasting change.” The survey also found that APIA survey participants were engaged politically at a relatively high rate, with 80 percent saying that they were registered to vote. Among those who were registered, 84 percent said that they had voted in the 2024 election. APIA survey respondents reported being politically active in other ways as well – 23 percent signed petitions, 19 percent attended government meetings, and 15 percent attended rallies. A majority of APIA survey respondents – 56 percent – leaned Democrat, and 67 percent of those who reported voting in the 2024 election said they voted for Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate for president.  At the report launch event, members of the APIA community spoke of the importance of data in empowering APIA communities to advocate for themselves. Chahat Kalia, a member of the Massachusetts Asian American and Pacific Islanders Commission’s Youth Council, noted that more work needs to be done to include other APIA voices that aren’t present in this survey report. “As a young person, I want to inform a future where our mental health, our safety, our education, and our identities are not an afterthought,” said Kalia. “To the policy-makers and community members in this room, thank you for listening. Please continue to listen to us, include us, and value our stories because we are not just the future. We are the present, and we’re ready to be part of the conversation.”  The post New survey shows that Asian and Pacific Islander Americans are concerned about cost of living, lean Democrat, and have high levels of civic engagement  appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/20250603_132309-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-04 10:03:26.228465

Would paying teachers-in-training more money help California solve its teacher shortage? One state lawmaker thinks it should, but faces an uphill battle as California also grapples with a $12 million budget shortfall, reports CalMatters’ Carolyn Jones. 
To become a California K-12 public school teacher, candidates need a bachelor’s degree and a teaching credential. The credential is usually earned after completing a one-year program that can cost as much as $40,000. During this time, candidates work with experienced teachers or lead their own classes to obtain 600 hours of classroom experience.
Roughly 60% of teachers in 2020 took out loans to finish their degrees, with loans averaging about $30,000, according to the Learning Policy Institute. Meanwhile, the average starting teacher salary in California is $58,000, so it can take some people more than a decade to pay off these debts.
Under these circumstances, about 65% of California teachers surveyed skipped out on family vacations, 37% delayed medical care and 30% took on gig work to earn more income, according to a report by the California Teachers Association union released in January.
To address pay issues and encourage more people to join the profession, Assembly Bill 1128 would create a grant program for school districts to pay student teachers the same amount as substitute teachers — about $140 a day. While the bill has no formal opposition, an Assembly bill analysis estimates that the proposal, if passed, would cost up to $300 million a year.

Assemblymember Al Muratsuchi, a Torrance Democrat and bill author: “This bill ensures that more talented, diverse, and committed educators can complete their training and serve in our public schools.”

The bill advanced through the Assembly Monday and now sits before the Senate.

Tariff fight continues 🥊

Two months ago, businesses and multiple states, including California, filed separate lawsuits against President Donald Trump’s administration to halt its tariff policies. On Monday a federal court judge threw out California’s lawsuit, setting the stage for an appeals process before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, writes CalMatters’ Levi Sumagaysay.
The dismissal is considered a minor win for California Attorney General Rob Bonta. Legal experts anticipate the lawsuit to ultimately reach the U.S. Supreme Court. 
The Trump administration had requested that California’s lawsuit be transferred to the U.S. Court of International Trade. Though the federal court judge agreed the lawsuit should be before the federal trade court, they ruled that the administration “could not articulate why transfer … serves the interests of justice.”

Raising the standard for charging accomplices


The California Supreme Court in San Francisco on May 8, 2024. Photo by Jeff Chiu, AP Photo




This week the California Supreme Court ruled to resentence a prisoner’s murder charge, in the first case that tests a 2018 state law to raise the bar for an accomplice’s murder conviction.
As CalMatters’ Nigel Duara explains, seven years ago California passed a law barring prosecutors from pursuing felony murder charges against accomplices unless they “aided, abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, solicited, requested, or assisted the actual killer … and acted with reckless indifference to human life.” 
Under that policy, the state’s highest court ruled that Louis Emanuel, who was at the scene of a 2012 shooting death in San Jose but did not fire the gun, should be resentenced because his conduct did not reflect “a reckless indifference to human life.”
Emanuel was initially convicted of first-degree felony murder in 2015. This week’s ruling kicks his case back to trial court for resentencing.

AmeriCorps provides California support through emergency disasters, and the federal government’s gutting of the program is shortsighted and dangerous, writes Lauren Levitt, a California Emergency Response Corps member with AmeriCorps.

Ruling also rejects Trump’s attempt to get California’s case transferred. State takes its tariffs fight to the 9th Circuit appeals court, which experts believe is more likely to give it a favorable ruling.


A judge threw out California’s lawsuit against President Trump’s tariffs this week, but the case will keep going because the state itself asked for the dismissal. 
State Attorney General Rob Bonta’s office said he will immediately appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit.
The Trump administration had requested that the California lawsuit, filed in April, be transferred to the U.S. Court of International Trade. The federal court judge in San Francisco rejected the transfer on Monday, even though she said she believes tariff questions belong before the federal trade court. 
“Because California requests dismissal rather than transfer to the CIT, transfer is not in the interest of justice,” wrote U.S. District Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley in her ruling. She also wrote that the Trump administration “could not articulate” why it would serve the interest of justice — in other words, be fair — to transfer the case.
Bonta said in a statement that he was “pleased” that the decision gives the state a chance to bring the case before the 9th Circuit. Bonta has argued that Trump’s tariffs are illegal under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which the administration says gives the president the authority to impose wide-ranging tariffs. 
Trump has already lost two cases that made the same arguments. Last week, the Court of International Trade ruled that the tariffs are unlawful because Trump has exceeded his authority under that act. That decision, in a lawsuit brought by Oregon, 11 other states and five businesses, has been put on hold pending an appeal by the Trump administration. A federal district court judge in Washington, D.C. also made a similar determination last week in a suit brought by a couple of small businesses. 
The tariffs — which have so far affected California ports, agriculture and other industries — remain in effect in the meantime. 
Legal experts say Bonta is more likely to get a favorable ruling in the 9th Circuit appeals court, which has a reputation for being liberal. But they differ on whether the case belongs in that court. 
“It’s hard to see how it belongs in the 9th Circuit,” said Richard Steinberg, professor at UCLA School of Law. “It’s a tariff case.” 
Brian Peck, adjunct professor at University of Southern California Gould School of Law, said “the whole question is whether the (International Emergency Economic Powers Act) gives the president the power, which is more of a constitutional question, so it should be before the 9th Circuit rather than the Court of International Trade.”
An appeal from the trade court would land before the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which Peck said might be more favorable to the Trump administration because it has historically been more deferential to presidential powers.
Bonta recently spoke about his tariffs lawsuit at a roundtable of business leaders in San Francisco, and he noted that the act “doesn’t mention the word tariffs.” 
“Since the Court of International Trade deals with civil actions arising out of U.S. customs and international trade laws — which we argue does not include (the emergency economic powers act) — we believe the 9th Circuit has appropriate jurisdiction here,” wrote Elissa Perez, a spokesperson for the attorney general, in an email to CalMatters.
The White House did not respond to CalMatters’ request for comment.
Peck and Steinberg both said they think the question over Trump’s authority to impose tariffs the way he has been doing — broadly and without consulting Congress — is likely to end up before the Supreme Court.
Steinberg said the Trump administration can cite other statutes that give him the power to impose tariffs, but they would be more restrictive. But he doesn’t doubt that the president will keep trying.
“This is an endless game of whack-a-mole,” Steinberg said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/021225-Port-of-LA-JAJ-CM-09.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-04 09:04:57.034517

While health care workers, community groups and other officials say many factors may contribute to the drop in opioid overdose deaths, they agree that access to overdose-reversing drugs like naloxone, often provided under the brand name Narcan, is saving lives. “I do think […[...]","Narcan dispensing boxes are becoming more common across Missouri. Medicines like Narcan, also known as naloxone, help fight opioid overdose deaths, but officials say more investment is needed to treat addiction (Suzanne King/The Beacon).After years of exponential growth, opioid overdose deaths in Missouri are dropping.
While health care workers, community groups and other officials say many factors may contribute to the drop in opioid overdose deaths, they agree that access to overdose-reversing drugs like naloxone, often provided under the brand name Narcan, is saving lives.
“I do think that Narcan is the reason for those trends statistically dropping,” said Cooper County Ambulance Chief Brandon Hicks. “I see Narcan in a lot more homes than I used to, and I do see family members administering Narcan prior to us getting there.”

In 2014, the state saw 360 opioid overdose deaths from drugs other than heroin. By 2021, that figure rose to 1,493, state data shows.
After increasing through 2021, the trend started changing. The number of deaths flattened in 2022 and began dropping in 2023. By 2024, non-heroin opioid overdose deaths had fallen to 876.
Central Missouri and the St. Louis area saw the largest drop in drug overdose deaths, dropping 38% and 35%, respectively.
But after responding to opioid overdose calls for years, Hicks sees the need for more access to treatment and better coordination between emergency services and long-term care, especially in rural areas.
That belief is shared across community health organizations. Access to things like peer support specialists and community resources is an essential piece of the puzzle, according to Derek Wilson, who runs harm reduction at the AIDS Project of the Ozarks, which serves 29 counties in southwest Missouri.
“I think there is a particular bit of challenge when you come up against some of these societal things,” Wilson said. “When you get into a more rural area … there’s a ton of stigma. There’s still a lot of shaming, whether it’s self-shaming or from outside sources.”
Wilson hopes that a continued focus on naloxone distribution, coupled with community support and more access to medication-assisted long-term treatment, can continue making inroads in rural communities.
 Did Missouri’s naloxone distribution plan lead to the drop in overdose rates? 

In 2016, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration began a new grant program for states to receive federal funds for addiction treatment, recovery and harm reduction services.
The federal money and state settlement dollars from opioid litigation allowed Missouri to increase investment in addiction treatment and overdose prevention. Early funds were mostly used to support treatment efforts. But as the response evolved, the state began investing more heavily in distributing naloxone across the state.
From 2017 to 2023, the Missouri Institute of Mental Health (MIMH) distributed nearly 430,000 naloxone kits across the state. In 2023 alone, nearly 250,000 kits were given out, including more kits shipped off to local health departments, social services and first responders, according to a report from researchers at MIMH.
In their report, researchers connect the drop in overdose deaths with the availability of naloxone across the state. But other rural health researchers think more time is needed to truly understand the drop in deaths.
“It’s encouraging, but I don’t think we know exactly why it’s changed,” said Kelly Price, a rural addiction researcher in Vermont. “It’ll be interesting to see how it plays out over time … It does sometimes seem like it takes a little bit longer to see those effects that you see nationally in some of these more isolated rural communities.”
MIMH researchers also pointed to the westward movement of fentanyl across the country. Data show that eastern parts of the country see lower levels of fentanyl-related deaths, while they are rising in western parts of the country.
Hicks sees the need for better data collection for health officials to truly understand the trends, especially in smaller counties where funds for autopsies may not align with death rates. He pointed to the prevalence of opioid-related cardiac events.
“We just did a community health assessment,” Hicks said. “We identified that there’s really not been any opioid deaths in Cooper County for quite some time. The problem is that they’re getting ruled cardiac arrest.”
“At the end of the day this is a true statement, their heart stopped,” he added. “When it comes to pulling statistics, nobody sees the opioid deaths that we do have.”
If someone’s heart stops as a result of an overdose, naloxone won’t revive them without chest compressions. Researchers at the American Heart Association found that of the 360,000 cardiac arrests from 2017 to 2021, 8% were caused by drug overdoses.
Part of the problem in collecting that data, Hicks said, was funding for autopsies. If the county only budgets for a certain number of autopsies, it can be difficult to determine whether a death was related to drugs in other ways besides an overdose.
“I have one gentleman that I have (used Narcan on) three times that’s been in cardiac arrest, and after the third time, he literally told me: ‘See, I can do whatever I want. You’re going to be here to save me,’” Hicks said. “We can’t save somebody who is dead, and they can’t save themselves either. But if they get Narcan before we get there, usually they refuse care.”
But Stephanie Malita, a health educator at the St. Joseph Health Department, says peer support specialists who are active in the area report that the number of overdoses someone experiences isn’t relevant to their recovery outcomes.
“Peers will say time and time again that some of them overdosed multiple times,” Malita said. “But eventually they got to the point in their lives where they were ready and had a support team around them to make that very scary leap into non-use.”
 Addressing fear of law enforcement when treating overdoses 

Studies show that despite Good Samaritan laws, which offer legal protection for people who are witnessing or experiencing a drug or alcohol overdose, skepticism remains when it comes to calling first responders in the event of an overdose.
Missouri’s Good Samaritan law provides immunity from things like possession of controlled and synthetic substances or paraphernalia, as long as someone is actively seeking medical assistance. It also requires law enforcement to provide treatment resources. It does not protect against other crimes like distributing a controlled substance or active warrants.
Hicks regularly runs into that fear when he responds to overdose calls. If 911 is called, the person overdosing often has already gotten a dose of naloxone, and law enforcement almost always arrives at the scene before EMS.
“People don’t want law enforcement, they feel like they’ve done something wrong,” Hicks said. “So we usually encounter somebody who is angry and upset … because they’re scared of getting arrested. They didn’t want to go to jail, they just wanted to live.”
He and his staff take extra steps to differentiate themselves from law enforcement when responding to overdose calls. They don’t wear button-up shirts or badges to try and make people feel more comfortable.
“I appreciate law enforcement,” Hicks said. “But I don’t want to be associated with them in these scenarios, because then I can’t help somebody like we’re supposed to help them.”
 How to address the need for long-term care in rural Missouri 

Wilson and the AIDS Project of the Ozarks are working on ways to make naloxone more available across their coverage area. The group places drop boxes with naloxone kits in places like libraries and other public settings, so it is available to the community 24/7.

It’s an investment that Malita and the health department, which was one of the top county recipients for naloxone kits from the MIMH, are looking at making as they continue naloxone outreach.
But more attention is needed when it comes to connecting naloxone recipients with longer-term addiction care. Things like distance to a provider, income, transportation and child care are often cited as roadblocks for rural patients seeking care.
Hicks said he hopes to see more investment in things like transportation to crisis centers. He also pointed to integrating 911 and 988, the national suicide and crisis hotline, as a way to ensure Missourians are getting the care they need.
“The emergency room is just not the place for a lot of people in these situations,” Hicks said. “More mental health support (is needed), not a physician that tells them to go seek care elsewhere once they’ve fixed a very temporary problem.”
Price pointed to data that shows starting people on medication-assisted treatment, including buprenorphine or naltrexone, after an overdose and then connecting them with a long-term provider has been shown to be an effective approach.
Things like expanded access to telehealth, where people can meet with providers in the privacy of their own homes, can also help people in smaller communities seek care in ways that are more fitting for them.
Wilson said reducing stigma so everyone feels comfortable seeking care is a priority.
“I do think it is something that is thicker in rural areas, the idea of not wanting to get into it, and: ‘Why don’t those people just go take care of themselves? Why don’t they stop?’” Wilson said. “It’s just not that simple, not with the way that substances interfere with our brain chemistry.”
“It’s just a human being and things get away from them,” Wilson said. “Then they find themselves in very, very horrible situations.”

This bill would pay those who try,Carolyn Jones,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/2025/06/student-teachers-california/,"To earn a teaching credential, students are required to complete a one-year program combining coursework and 600 hours of classroom experience. A new bill would provide money to pay them for that work.","In summary
To earn a teaching credential, students are required to complete a one-year program combining coursework and 600 hours of classroom experience. A new bill would provide money to pay them for that work. 


When Brigitta Hunter started her teaching career, she had $20,000 in student loans and zero income – even though she was working nearly full time in the classroom.
“We lived on my husband’s pathetic little paycheck. I don’t know how we did it,” Hunter said. “And we were lucky – he had a job and my loans weren’t that bad. It can be almost impossible for some people.”
Each year, about 28,000 people in California work for free for about a year as teachers or classroom aides while they complete the requirements for their teaching credentials. That year without pay can be a dire hardship for many aspiring teachers, even deterring them from pursuing the profession.    
A new bill by Assemblymember Al Muratsuchi, a Democrat from Torrance, would set aside money for school districts to pay would-be teachers while they do their student teaching service. The goal is to help alleviate the teacher shortage and attract lower-income candidates to the profession.
“Nothing makes a bigger difference in improving the quality of public education than getting highly qualified teachers in the classroom,” Muratsuchi said. “This bill helps remove some of the obstacles to that.”
Big loans, low pay
To be a K-12 public school teacher in California, candidates need a bachelor’s degree and a teaching credential, typically earned after completing a one-year program combining coursework and 600 hours of classroom experience. During that time, candidates work with veteran teachers or lead their own classes.
Teacher credential programs cost between $20,000 and $40,000, depending on where a student enrolls and where they live. In 2020, about 60% of teachers borrowed money to finish their degrees, according to a recent study by the Learning Policy Institute, with loans averaging about $30,000 for a four-year bachelor’s degree and a credential program.
Entering the profession with hefty student loans can be demoralizing and stressful, the report said, adding to the challenges new teachers face. The average starting teacher salary in California is $58,000, according to the National Education Association, among the highest in the country but still hard to live on in many parts of the state. It could take a decade or more for teachers to pay off their loans.
Muratsuchi’s bill, AB 1128, passed the Assembly on Monday and now awaits a vote in the Senate. It would create a grant program for districts to pay student teachers the same amount they pay substitute teachers, which is roughly $140 a day. The overall cost would be up to $300 million a year, according to Assembly analysts, but Gov. Gavin Newsom has set aside $100 million for the program in his revised budget.
Muratsuchi has another bill related to teacher pay, also working its way through the Legislature. Assembly bill 477, which passed the Assembly this week, would raise teacher salaries across the board.
Paying teachers, saving money
Christopher Carr, executive director of Aspire Public Schools in Los Angeles, a network of 11 charter schools, called the bill a potential “game changer.”
Teacher candidates often have to work second jobs to make ends meet, and sometimes finish with debt of $70,000 or more, he said. That can be an insurmountable barrier for people with limited resources. Paying would-be teachers would attract more people to the teaching profession, especially Black and Latino candidates, he said. 
School districts around the state have been trying to diversify their teacher workforces, based on research showing that Black and Latino students tend to do better academically when they have at least one teacher of the same race.
Carr’s schools pay their teachers-in-training through grants and a partnership with a local college, which has led to more of them staying on to teach full time after they receive their credentials, he said. That has saved the schools money by reducing turnover.
“This could open doors and be a step toward racial justice,” Carr said. “California has a million spending priorities, but this will lead to better outcomes for students and ultimately save the state money.”
Tyanthony Davis, chief executive director of Inner City Education Foundation, a charter school network in Los Angeles, put it this way: “If we have well paid, qualified, happy teachers, we’ll have happier classrooms.”
No opposition, yet
Muratusuchi’s bill has no formal opposition. The California Taxpayers Association has not taken a position. The California Teachers Association, the state’s largest teachers union, is a supporter.
“This legislation comes at a critical time as we continue to face an educator recruitment and retention crisis,” said David Goldberg, the union president. “Providing new grants to compensate student teachers for important on-the-job training is a strong step forward in the right direction to strengthening public education.”  
Hunter survived her student-teaching experience and went on to teach fourth grade for 34 years, retiring last year from the Mark West Union School District in Santa Rosa. The last 15 years of her career she served as a mentor to aspiring teachers. She saw first-hand the stress that would-be teachers endure as they juggle coursework, long days in the classroom and often second jobs on nights and weekends.
But paying student-teachers, she said, should only be the beginning. Novice teachers also need  smaller class sizes, more support from administrators and more help with enrichment activities, such as extra staff to lead lessons in art and physical education. 
“We definitely need more teachers, and paying student teachers is a good start,” Hunter said. “But there’s a lot more we can do to help them.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/032723-Buttonwillow-LV_CM-03.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-04 09:04:57.034517

Many were in the field in L.A., helping the region recover from deadly wildfires.","Guest Commentary written by

Lauren Levitt
Lauren Levitt is an emergency preparedness outreach lead and California Emergency Response Corps member with AmeriCorps. Lauren is a Marine veteran and native New Yorker currently residing in San Francisco.


Last month, I hung up my yellow vest for the last time.
We were there after wildfires tore through Los Angeles communities, standing alongside survivors in shelters, donation centers, disaster recovery centers and scorched neighborhoods. We helped Californians take their first steps toward rebuilding.
And now, we’re gone.
After the federal government cut funding for AmeriCorps’ disaster relief programs, more than 60 of us in the California Emergency Response Corps were told our service was ending early. Some of my teammates were still in the field when the news came in. They had to pack up and leave while the work was still unfolding.
This is not just about a few disheartened young adults losing the opportunity to serve their community. It’s about what we lose as a state when we cut off the pipeline of people trained and ready to show up in times of crisis.
This derailment happened at a curious time. Our deployment to Los Angeles was the biggest operation in the California program’s history. Our teams helped more than 26,000 wildfire survivors navigate FEMA paperwork, replace lost IDs and find emergency housing. 
We didn’t arrive with all the answers, but we came with compassion, training and a willingness to listen. One afternoon, I sat with an elderly couple as they showed me photos of their destroyed home. They weren’t asking for much — just someone to walk them through the maze of forms and requirements while they tried to make sense of their new reality.
Another day, I met a young man sitting outside a disaster recovery center because he was too nervous to go inside. I sat with him for a while as he recounted how he evacuated his elderly neighbors as the fire approached their neighborhood. The trauma he suffered was significant and it was clear he was struggling to process it. Thankfully, we were able to connect him with the wonderful people at the county department of mental health to get him the services he needed.
Moments like these don’t much attention. But they matter.
As a former Marine, I’ve seen how critical it is to have trained, mission-ready people in the right place at the right time. California’s emergency corps gave me a new mission: helping communities prepare for, respond to and recover from disaster. This program provided critical, entry-level emergency management experience that I would not have otherwise received. 
I thought this was the beginning of my career. For me (and so many others) it was supposed to be a first step, a launchpad into public service.
Instead, it’s been cut short.
The argument you may hear is that national service is too expensive, but that’s not the case with AmeriCorps. For modest stipends, people can serve their communities and gain valuable career experience for a fraction of what outsourcing those services would cost. Emergency response members provide support through fires, floods, pandemics and earthquakes, helping fill gaps no one else can or will. 
We’re not waste, fraud or abuse. We’re vital components of the communities we serve.
At a time when wildfires, floods and climate-driven disasters are only becoming more frequent, we need competent and experienced disaster response professionals. They don’t magically appear. They have to get their start somewhere. Programs like this are how we grow the next generation of emergency responders, crisis managers and community resilience leaders.
Ending the corps program is not just shortsighted, it’s dangerous.
I’m proud of the work we did. I’m grateful to my teammates and mentors. And I’m heartbroken — not just for myself, but for the people we haven’t yet had the chance to help.
If you didn’t know who we were before, I hope you do now. We were the ones in yellow vests, and we were just getting started.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/012625_Eaton-Fire-Rain_JH_47.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-04 09:04:57.034517

In Riverside, more people were in shelters than last year but fewer were on the streets.","In summary
Fewer people were living outside or in shelters in San Bernardino County. In Riverside, more people were in shelters than last year but fewer were on the streets.


Homelessness in some parts of the Inland Empire declined this year, according to an annual survey that estimates the number of people living in shelters or on the street.
The 2025 Homelessness “point-in-time” count marks the first drop in San Bernardino County’s homelessness in years. Before that the homeless population had risen steadily, doubling between 2018 and 2024.
San Bernardino reported an overall 10% drop in the number of homeless people counted compared to last year, driven by a 14% decline in people living outside. Riverside County reported that homelessness increased by 7%, with more people in shelters but fewer living on the street.
The count takes place on a single night in January, when public officials and volunteers search their region to see how many homeless people they find. The counts include people staying in private or public shelters or using hotel vouchers, whom they classify as “sheltered,” as well as those living on the street, who are counted as “unsheltered.”
That data helps cities and counties estimate their total homeless populations and plan for services, including emergency shelters and transitional or permanent housing.
Throughout California, other regions’ point-in-time counts showed mixed results. San Diego reported a 7% drop in homelessness, with big drops in unsheltered families and veterans.  But the Fresno/Madera count in the Central Valley found a 3% increase in homelessness in the region since 2023, with a 10% jump in unsheltered homelessness.
California had the highest homeless population in the nation last year, but it also saw slower growth in homelessness, CalMatters’ Marissa Kendall reported. Homelessness grew 3% to more than 187,000 people in California last year, compared to 18% growth nationwide.
In San Bernardino County, the annual count, conducted on Jan. 23, found 3,821 homeless adults and children this year, down by 434 from last year. That was due to a drop in homeless people living on streets or in other public places. 
Marcus Dillard, chief of homeless services, said the county invested $22 million in permanent housing and other support for people experiencing homelessness last year.
“The county appreciates the funding that has been allocated to support local governments providing support and services for people experiencing homelessness,” he said.
County Supervisor Joe Baca, Jr., said in a statement he is encouraged by the data ”because it shows that our efforts are making a difference. Although our work is far from over, I’m glad to see progress in reducing homelessness.”
But there were still hotspots of homelessness, including three of the county’s biggest cities. 
The city of San Bernardino counted 1,535 homeless people — the highest number in the county — followed by Victorville with 448 and Fontana with 364.
In Riverside County, total homeless numbers rose by 7% since 2023, the last time officials conducted the count. That might sound like bad news, but homelessness had climbed 12% in 2023 and 15% in 2022, which means the growth in homelessness has slowed down over the last few years.
Even so, the number of homeless people in shelters rose sharply from 1,284 in 2023 to 2,012 this year, as the county increased shelter capacity by 11%, according to the point-in-time count. But that was offset by a 19% decrease in people living on the streets, dropping from 2,441 two years ago to 1,978 this year.
The city of Riverside had the biggest homeless population, with 1,087 people counted this year. The count found 509 homeless people living in Indio and 322 in Hemet.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/012524_Alameda-PIT-Count_LE_CM-04.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-04 09:04:57.034517

How a new case tested the law,Nigel Duara,,,,,https://calmatters.org/justice/2025/06/felony-murder-supreme-court/,A recent California law raises the standard for when prosecutors can charge accomplices to killings with felony murder. A case testing that law recently reached the state supreme court.,"In summary
A recent California law raises the standard for when prosecutors can charge accomplices to killings with felony murder. A case testing that law recently reached the state supreme court.


Hundreds of people convicted of murder in California didn’t kill anyone. They were handed long sentences because they drove a getaway car or kicked down a door in a robbery that ended in murder  — and the state used to allow prosecutors to charge accomplices with first-degree felony murder. 
That changed in 2018, when California legislators required a higher standard for an accomplice’s murder conviction.
This week, the first case stemming from that law came before the California Supreme Court, and the ruling is expected to lead to a prisoner’s resentencing. 
The court held that a man who was at the scene of a 2012 shooting death in San Jose should be resentenced under the new law. While he was present at the scene of a robbery and murder, the court found his conduct did not reflect “a reckless indifference to human life” — the standard for convictions of first-degree felony murder. 
The decision reverses rulings by both a trial judge and an appeals court, and sends the case back down to the trial court for resentencing.  
Louis Emanuel and Jacob Whitley set up a fake deal to buy a pound of marijuana from John Sonenberg. In reality, they had plans to rob him, and police later said the pair had likely robbed other people of drugs before who didn’t report the crimes.  
They met next to a park in San Jose in the middle of the afternoon on Dec. 11, 2012. According to court records, Emanuel didn’t know Whitley had a gun. The pair pulled up next to Sonenberg’s pick up truck. Emanuel later allegedly told his ex-girlfriend that, in the confusion during the robbery, Whitley shot Sonenberg. 
“The guy started fighting back and (Whitley) pointed the gun,” said Breanna Santos, Emanuel’s former girlfriend and the mother of his son, according to court records quoted in the ruling. “He was trying to aim down, but the guy hit his hand, it went up and (Whitley) pulled the trigger and he said he shot him in his neck.”
Sonenberg died at the scene. 
At trial in 2015, Emanuel was convicted of first-degree felony murder. Though he didn’t pull the trigger, California law at the time equated his actions to murder while committing a robbery. The Sixth Appellate District Court of Appeal upheld his sentence. 
Then, California legislators passed a law which prohibited prosecutors from pursuing felony murder charges against accomplices unless they “aided, abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, solicited, requested, or assisted the actual killer in the commission of murder in the first degree, or the person was a major participant in the underlying felony and acted with reckless indifference to human life.” 
U.S. Supreme Court on felony murder
The U.S. Supreme Court has handed down mixed rulings on comparable cases.
In a 1982 case, they found that a getaway driver in an armed robbery that led to someone’s death could not be given a death sentence. 
But on the other end of the spectrum was a 1987 case in which the people accused of murder broke two people out of prison, armed them, held a family at gunpoint then abandoned the victims in the desert after the escapees shot them. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that those suspects, even though they didn’t pull the trigger, could indeed face the death penalty. 
Those two cases are the opposite ends of the spectrum for defining the culpability of an accomplice to murder, wrote California Supreme Court Associate Justice Kelli Evans in the Emanuel opinion.
“This Court has thus made clear that participation in a “ ‘garden-variety armed robbery’ … is insufficient without more to establish reckless indifference,” Evans wrote.
But when Emanual filed for a resentencing under the 2018 law, the trial court judge ruled that he should have acted to prevent the shooting. 
“In the trial court’s view, Emanuel ‘created’ the situation by participating in the robbery, and thus, had an affirmative obligation to do more than withdraw his aid and support from a murderous cohort,” Evans wrote in the Supreme Court opinion. 
Perhaps most critically, the trial court found that Emanuel acted with reckless indifference to human life. The court of appeal agreed with that decision. 
Focus on Emanuel’s mental state
The California Supreme Court, in reversing both courts, found that Emanuel didn’t have a duty to prevent the robbery. They also pointed to other circumstances, like time of day and location. 
If someone plans to rob a house where methamphetamine is being manufactured by “several armed occupants” at 3 a.m., the person committing the robbery should anticipate violence, the court found. On the other hand, if a person intends to rob an unarmed marijuana dealer in a public park in the middle of the day, “the objective risk of violence posed by the crime and reasonably anticipated by the perpetrator is far less grave.” 
The court also noted that Emanuel tried to dissuade Whitley from robbing Sonenberg and walked away after the shooting. 
“The focus should not be on the ultimate efficacy of his actions, but on what his actions reveal about his mental state,” Evans wrote. “The (trial and appeal) courts did not carefully consider evidence bearing on Emanuel’s state of mind but rather simply judged that he had not employed an adequate measure of restraint.” 
When reached by CalMatters, Emanuel’s attorney, Solomon Wollack, declined to comment.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)The Republican budget bill the U.S. House approved last month includes a surprise for the 40 states that have expanded Medicaid: penalties for providing health care to some immigrants who are here legally.
Along with punishing the 14 states that use their own funds to cover immigrants who are here illegally, analysts say last-minute changes to the bill would make it all but impossible for states to continue helping some immigrants who are in the country legally, on humanitarian parole.
Under the bill, the federal government would slash funding to states that have expanded Medicaid and provide coverage to immigrants who are on humanitarian parole — immigrants who have received permission to temporarily enter the United States due to an emergency or urgent humanitarian reason.
The federal government pays 90% of the cost of covering adults without children who are eligible under Medicaid expansion, but the bill would cut that to 80% for those states, doubling the state portion from 10% to 20%. That’s the same penalty the bill proposes for states that use their own money to help immigrants who are here illegally.
Ironically, states such as Florida that have extended Medicaid coverage to immigrants who are here on humanitarian parole but have not expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act would not be harmed by the bill, said Leonardo Cuello, a Medicaid law and policy expert and research professor at the Center for Children and Families at Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy.
More states offer health care coverage for certain immigrants, noncitizens

It is “wildly nonsensical and unfair” to penalize expansion states for covering a population that some non-expansion states, such as Florida, also cover, Cuello said. “It would appear that the purpose is more to punish expansion states than address any genuine concern with immigrant coverage.”
West Virginia is one of the states where lawmakers are nervously watching U.S. Senate discussions on the proposed penalty. Republican state Rep. Matt Rohrbach, a deputy House speaker, said West Virginia legislators tabled a proposal that would have ended Medicaid expansion if the federal government reduced its share of the funding, because the state’s congressional representatives assured them it wasn’t going to happen. Now the future is murkier.
Cuello called the proposed penalty “basically a gun to the head of the states.”
“Congress is framing it as a choice, but the state is being coerced and really has no choice,” he said.
There are about 1.3 million people in the United States on humanitarian parole, from Afghanistan, Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, Ukraine and Venezuela as well as some Central American children who have rejoined family here. The Trump administration is trying to end parole from some of those countries. A Supreme Court decision May 30 allows the administration to end humanitarian parole for about 500,000 people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela.
Not many of those parolees qualify for Medicaid, which requires a waiting period or special status, but the 40 states with expanded Medicaid could be penalized if immigrants qualify for the program, said Tanya Broder, senior counsel for health and economic justice policy at the National Immigration Law Center.

Meanwhile, an increasing number of states and the District of Columbia already are considering scaling back Medicaid coverage for immigrants because of the costs.
The federal budget bill, named the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, is now being considered by the Senate, where changes are likely. The fact that so many states could be affected by the last-minute change could mean more scrutiny in that chamber, said Andrea Kovach, senior attorney for health care justice at the Shriver Center on Poverty Law in Chicago.
By her count, at least 38 states and the District of Columbia would be affected by the new restrictions, since they accepted some options now offered by Medicaid to cover at least some humanitarian parolees without a five-year waiting period.
“They’re all going to be penalized because they added in parolees,” Kovach said. “So that’s 38 times two senators who are going to be very interested in this provision to make sure their state doesn’t get their reimbursement knocked down.”
The change to exclude people with humanitarian parole was included in a May 21 amendment by U.S. Rep. Jodey Arrington, a Texas Republican who chairs the House budget committee. Arrington’s office did not reply to a request for comment, though he has stressed the importance of withholding Medicaid from immigrants who are here illegally.
Need to go to the hospital? Texas and Florida want to know your immigration status.

“[Democrats] want to protect health care and welfare at any cost for illegal immigrants at the expense of hardworking taxpayers,” Arrington said in a May 22 floor speech urging passage of the bill. “But by the results of this last election, it’s abundantly clear: The people see through this too and they have totally rejected the Democrats’ radical agenda.”
Some states already are considering cutting Medicaid coverage for immigrants, though Democratic lawmakers and advocates are pushing back.
Washington, D.C., Democratic Mayor Muriel Bowser has proposed phasing out a program that provides Medicaid coverage to adults regardless of their immigration status, a move she says would save the District of Columbia $457 million.
Minnesota advocates protested a state budget deal reached last month with Democratic Gov. Tim Walz to phase out health care coverage for adults who are here illegally, a condition Republican lawmakers insisted on to avoid a shutdown.
Similarly, Illinois advocates are protesting new state rules that will end a program that has provided Medicaid coverage to immigrants aged 42-64 regardless of their legal status. The program cost $1.6 billion over three years, according to a state audit. The state will continue a separate program that provides coverage for older adults.
“Our position is that decision-makers in Illinois shouldn’t be doing Trump’s work for him,” said Kovach, of the Shriver Center on Poverty Law. “Let’s preserve health coverage for immigrants and stand up for Illinois immigrant residents who have been paying taxes into this state for years and need this coverage.”
Illinois state Sen. Graciela Guzmán, a Democrat whose parents are refugees from El Salvador, said many of her constituents in Chicago may be forced to cancel chemotherapy or lifesaving surgery because of the changes.
“It was a state budget, but I think the federal reconciliation bill really set the tone for it,” Guzmán said. “In a tough fiscal environment, it was really hard to set up a defense for this program.”
More States Offer Health Coverage to Immigrant Children

Oregon Democratic Gov. Tina Kotek is among the governors holding firm, saying that letting immigrants stay uninsured imposes costs on local hospitals and ends up raising prices for everyone.
“The costs will go somewhere. When everyone is insured it is much more helpful to keep costs down and reasonable for everyone. That’s why we’ve taken this approach to give care to everyone,” Kotek said at a news conference last month.
Medicaid does pay for emergency care for low-income patients, regardless of their immigration status, and that would not change under the federal budget bill.
Franny White, a spokesperson for the Oregon Health Authority, said her state’s Medicaid program covers about 105,000 immigrants, some of whom are here illegally. She said the policy, established by a 2021 state law, can save money in the long run.
“Uninsured people are less likely to receive preventive care due to cost and often wait until a condition worsens to the point that it requires more advanced, expensive care at an emergency department or hospital,” she said.
California was among the first states, along with Oregon, to offer health insurance to immigrants of all ages regardless of their legal status. But it now is considering cutting back, looking to save $5 billion as it seeks to close a $12 billion budget deficit. In May, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom proposed freezing enrollment of immigrant adults who are here illegally, and charging them premiums to save money.
“It’s possible that other states will decide to cut back these services because of budgetary concerns,” said Drishti Pillai, director of immigrant health policy at KFF, a health policy research organization.
If the federal budget bill passes with the immigrant health care provision intact, states would have more than two years to adjust, since the changes would not take effect until October 2027.
“We have time to really understand what the landscape looks like and really create a legal argument to make sure folks are able to maintain their health care coverage,” said Enddy Almonord, director for Healthy Illinois, an advocacy group supporting universal health care coverage.

ADECA is overseeing over $400 million from the American Rescue Plan Act to expand Alabama's broadband infrastructure by 2026. (Mike Kittrell)State officials on Tuesday asked internet service providers tasked with building Alabama’s broadband network to more strictly adhere to reporting requirements.
During a series of project updates at the Alabama Digital Expansion Authority meeting in Montgomery, representatives from nearly two dozen companies provided details about their progress on state-funded internet projects. While most reported being on or ahead of schedule, others were cautioned for lagging reports and a lack of detailed progress.
“I feel like we are having good progress with some, and some that may not understand the system as to what we are asking for,” Kenneth Boswell, director of the Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs (ADECA), said in a firm tone. “We’re happy to provide technical assistance, but we’re not going to do it for you.”

ADECA oversees more than $400 million in American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds, with a significant portion of this funding aimed at building “middle-mile” infrastructure, which provides the link from internet providers to local networks. An initial project, funded up to $85 million in 2022, is supposed to create a 3,000-mile fiber network across the state. A second, $245 million middle-mile effort will add another 4,287 miles of fiber infrastructure to specifically connect nearly 800 institutions like schools, hospitals and government facilities.
ADECA is also managing a “last-mile” broadband program that brings service directly to consumers, using up to $191.89 million in ARPA funds. The projects are expected to be completed by February 2026, though extensions are available until the federal spending deadline of December 2026.
During the presentations, several companies that claimed they had progressed further than the data presented were asked to provide up-to-date information and schedule a meeting with the ADECA within 15 days to discuss their progress.
“What we would like to see at the next field meeting is this dashboard filled up to reflect what you’re sharing with us verbally,” Boswell said to AT&T representatives, saying it’s unfair to the other companies submitting the requested data.
Cleo Washington, vice president of external affairs for AT&T Alabama, said that despite appearances on the dashboard, work was well underway, saying the planning phase for several projects would be completed by late summer and early fall.
“We are already constructing fiber in those areas, so we are building out to get to these areas,” Washington said. Boswell scheduled a follow-up meeting with the company within 15 days.
Terry Metze, CEO of Alabama Fiber Network, said that its middle-mile network is “98% complete,” with only a single permit remaining.
“Our contractors are working heavily. This month, we had a couple of weeks of really heavy rain, kind of slowed this down a little bit, but we’re back on track, and everything’s moving forward right now,” Metze said.
Providers pointed to several challenges affecting progress on specific projects. Several, including Coosa Valley Technologies and Farmers Telecommunications Cooperative, said they had delays in securing permits. Weather, including a couple of weeks of heavy rain, was also a factor.
The meeting concluded with Boswell saying that “time is ticking” and asking companies to be more diligent about ensuring projects meet the funding deadline.
“Sounds like we got a lot of time left, but we really don’t. We don’t know what kind of obstacle that you may run into,” Boswell said.

Mike Kehoe announces a plan to give state funding to the MOScholars program during his State of the State speech Jan. 28 in the Missouri House chamber (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Gov. Mike Kehoe’s first budget proposal launched a tug of war between public-school advocates and those hoping to use state funds for private education. Both sides ultimately came away with what they wanted — but neither expects this to be the final showdown.
State Treasurer Vivek Malek, who oversees the state’s tax-credit scholarship program, told The Independent in an interview last week that he expects to more than double the number of scholarships administered by MOScholars in the upcoming school year.
Those students would have a “reasonable expectation,” he said, to be funded through graduation. And if donor funds continue to come up short, state funds would be required to support them.
In January, Kehoe laid out a budget that did not fully fund public education while giving state funds for private-school scholarships.
His request cut back $300 for the formula that determines state aid for public schools, contrary to the state education department’s recommendation. But he added a $50 million appropriation to the State Treasurer’s budget to help fund private-school scholarships through the MOScholars program. This windfall was not part of the treasurer’s initial request.

“The governor made a policy or a budgetary decision to invest in one form of education and not fully invest in the other,” said state Rep. Betsy Fogle, a Democrat from Springfield and ranking minority member of the House Budget Committee.
The House kept the governor’s recommendations, and the Senate flipped the two priorities: restoring full funding to public schools but axing the $50 million for MOScholars.
In May, state lawmakers reached an agreement to fund both and are awaiting the governor’s signature.
But the infusion of funds to MOScholars is likely to create more need in the program.
Malek said he expects to use the $50 million to offer more scholarships than the current pot of donations could provide. There are 6,000 students ready to participate in the upcoming year, and he expects more to sign up. This past year, 2,700 students received scholarships.
Malek hopes to make MOScholars self-sufficient, with enough donations to meet demand. But until then, he will request funds to, at a minimum, sustain aid for students already enrolled.
“I’ll be working through the years to make sure the tax credits are still utilized and nobody is depending on a direct appropriation from (general revenue),” he said.
Fogle told The Independent that the $50 million did not appear to be a one-time request.
“The $50 million that was put in general revenue was done, in part, because the tax credit program wasn’t very popular, and donors weren’t giving to that,” she contends. “And the governor wanted to figure out another solution to privatizing education.”
MOScholars currently operates through taxpayer-directed spending, where state funds are given to scholarship organizations through donations that receive a 100% tax credit. The program has faced issues funding scholarships each fall with the majority of donations coming at the end of the year.
An additional $50 million — more than double the amount of donations received last year — would solve the funding lag, Malek said.
“Our calendars were misaligned, so now we will be opening (enrollment) up for next year, starting early in the fall so that people can sign up for next year’s academic school year,” he said. “This will give us the flexibility of doing that, which was not possible before.”
The program has a $75 million expandable cap thanks to a large education package passed last year.
State Rep. Stephanie Hein, a Springfield Democrat, said during debate in April that she wondered why the legislature expanded the donation limit from $50 million to $75 million when there have been $23.4 million in donations in 2024. 
In 2023, donations totaled $16.6 million.
“Donors just are not that excited to give to this program, even at a 100% tax credit,” she said.
The program is in its infancy, with just three years of scholarships completed. The increased funding could help grow MOScholars to meet outsized demand — or it could create dependency on general revenue.
Hein said this problem would be exacerbated by tax cutbacks planned by Republican state lawmakers.
“We are setting a precedent,” she said. “And if we eliminate state income taxes, tax credits go away and we are going to be on the hook with (general revenue) to cover this program.”
Even if the appropriation is signed by the governor, it might face legal challenges as some question the constitutionality of using general revenue for MOScholars.
  State Treasurer Vivek Malek speaks during the Disability Advocacy Day rally in the Missouri State Capitol Wednesday (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
The 2021 law that established MOScholars prescribes that scholarships are funded by tax-deductible donations to educational assistance organizations, which are nonprofits that apply to administer the scholarships.
But 2% of donations are directed to an account dubbed the “Missouri Empowerment Scholarship Accounts Fund” overseen by the Treasurer’s Office. The fund is “to be used by the state treasurer for marketing and administrative expenses or the costs incurred in administering the program.”
Some believe the law does not authorize the program to use general revenue. Fogle expects legal “challenges that argue that directly appropriating tax dollars to private schools is unconstitutional.”
“The direct appropriation of general revenue is a completely different foundation than the tax credit,” she said. “There are people on both sides of the aisle, whether they’re voting in favor of it or not, who have considerable doubts and concerns.”
Malek did not speculate on the possibility of a lawsuit.
“We will deal with it and when that happens, we will defer that to our general counsel, the attorney general,” he said. “I cannot predict which course it will take.”
Malek says MOScholars is “another tool” for educating children, in addition to the public school system.
“I don’t see why people would be nervous. This is not taking away any funding dollars from our traditional educational institutions,” he said.
As State Treasurer, Malek was not part of the governor’s decision on public-education funding and considers himself a “big proponent of public schools.”
“My focus was just for the MOScholars program,” he said. “We need some help to strengthen this program… and I’m glad that need was listened to.”

The Rev. D.A. Graham stepped to his A.M.E. pulpit in Indianapolis. He often read from the Gospels or spoke about the love of Jesus, but on this day, he decried the mistreatment of Black Americans. 
Over the past seven years, there had been more than 1,200 lynchings of Black Americans, but nothing had been done to halt them, he said. The newly formed Afro-American Council had just held a National Day of Fasting and Prayer to protest the lynchings of Black Americans: 
“We are arrested and lodged in jails on the most frivolous suspicion of being the perpetrators of most hideous and revolting crimes, and, regardless of established guilt, mobs are formed of ignorant, vicious, whiskey-besotted men, at whose approach the keys of these jails and prisons are surrendered and the suspicioned party is ruthlessly forced from the custody of the law and tortured, hanged, shot, butchered, dismembered, and burned in the most fiendish manner.” 
In some lynchings, mob members collected charred body parts as souvenirs, Graham said. 
“How many of them are guilty? What is the proof against them?” 
In Georgia, a white girl met a young Black man “coming down a path and as he did not get out of the path she was afraid and ran. She swore that he did not speak to her and did not follow her,” Graham said.
Despite the utter lack of evidence, 19-year-old Ed Aikin served 10 years on a prison chain gang for attempted assault, Graham said. 
“How can the colored youth ever learn to look upon himself as a man when he is constantly treated as a brute?” Graham asked.
In March 2022, after more than a century of lobbying, lynching finally became a federal crime.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/05074412/June4-FeatImage-service-pnp-ppmsca-09700-09705v.jpg,,,2025-06-04 09:04:57.034517
,California,2025-06-04 12:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,California’s economy is just limping along. Why is Newsom always boasting?,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/06/california-economy-limping-along/,"California's unemployment rate remains among the nation's highest, while the state struggles to build homes and grow its labor force.","Gavin Newsom loves to boast about the state he governs, claiming that California is No.1 in some category or that the state is leading in some economic or cultural activity.
Sometimes his boasts crumble in the face of reality, such as his 2022 declaration that the state budget had a $97.5 billion surplus and “no other state in American history has ever experienced a surplus as large as this.”
It was later revealed that the surplus claim was based on revenue estimates that were wrong by $165 billion over four years, leading to multibillion-dollar budget deficits.
Undeterred, Newsom has continued his boastful ways. A few weeks ago bragged that California, were it a nation, now has the world’s fourth-largest economy at $4.1 trillion, edging out Japan.
“California isn’t just keeping pace with the world — we’re setting the pace,” Newsom cheered. “Our economy is thriving because we invest in people, prioritize sustainability and believe in the power of innovation.”
Actually, California’s edge over Japan is more the result of currency exchange calculations rather than productivity, but $4.1 trillion is still a big number. Unfortunately, its size masks the darker reality that, by many measures, California is doing no better than treading water.
As the Legislature’s budget analyst, Gabe Petek, said in a report on California’s budget situation late last year, “California’s economy has been in an extended slowdown for the better part of two years, characterized by a soft labor market and weak consumer spending.
“While this slowdown has been gradual and the severity milder than a recession, a look at recent economic data paints a picture of a sluggish economy. Outside of government and health care, the state has added no jobs in a year and a half.”
What Petek described six months ago is still true, as recent employment data indicates. In April, the state’s unemployment rate, 5.3%, was higher than all but two other states, Michigan and Nevada, and it’s been stuck at that elevated relative position for several years.
“Since February 2020, the state’s labor force has grown by just 126,100 workers, a 0.6% increase,” Beacon Economics said in an analysis of the April data, adding, “This slower growth is being driven largely by the state’s chronic housing shortage and the retirement of aging workers.”
Justin Niakamal, Beacon’s research manager says “it’s difficult to see how California will be able to break out of its slow-growth cycle when there has been virtually no increase in housing production. This is an elemental problem that is impacting the state’s ability to grow its population, industry and economy.”
A major indication of California’s relatively moribund economy is what has been happening in the San Francisco Bay Area’s technology industry, a sector that, in essence, been propping up the entire state in recent years.
Having expanded during the COVID-19 pandemic to serve those confined to their homes and working remotely, the industry has been shedding jobs month by month.
While Newsom cited numbers from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics in claiming that California now had the globe’s fourth-largest economy, he didn’t trumpet a recent bureau study that underscores the state’s poor employment picture. California has more than a million unemployed workers. The new bureau report reveals that the ratio of jobless workers to job openings is the highest of any state, 1.6 jobseekers for every one open job.
To put that data point another way, if every job opening in California were to be filled, we’d still have hundreds of thousands of Californians on the unemployment rolls.

ACLU filed a federal lawsuit against the Chambers County Board of Education on behalf of two teachers who were wrongfully arrested in 2023.(Stew Milne for Alabama Reflector)The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Alabama filed a federal lawsuit in May against the Chambers County Board of Education on behalf of two teachers who were wrongfully arrested in 2023.
According to the lawsuit, Yolanda Ratchford and Tytianna Smith held letter-size papers at a Chambers County Board of Education meeting picturing John Lewis reading “Good Trouble.”
“Silently holding pieces of paper is not a crime. What happened to Ms. Ratchford and Ms. Smith is a clear and shocking abuse of power,” said Alison Mollman, legal director at the ACLU of Alabama. “These women were exercising their most basic constitutional rights—freedom of speech and peaceful protest—and they were punished for it.”
According to a May press release, the complaint includes claims under the First and Fourth Amendments, the Americans with Disabilities Act and Alabama common law.
The litigation, filed in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Alabama, is to get Ratchford and Smith compensated for the harm they endured while in police custody. She said Ratchford is wheelchair bound and was not given access to a toilet while in police custody. A judge ruled the two teachers were not guilty of disorderly conduct.
Messages seeking comment from Chambers County Board of Education and the Valley Police Department were left Tuesday.
As of Tuesday, the defendants have not responded to the lawsuit through the court.
According to a press release, the silent protest was part of ongoing community opposition to the school board’s plan to consolidate the county’s two public high schools into a new facility located in Valley, a predominantly white city, which would displace Black students and educators from LaFayette.
Mollman said the merging of the two schools would cause issues with commuting for Black students that live in spread out county and they would get a different education in the city.
“When you’re going a few miles down county roads, it’s much different than going down I 65 or 85 you know, at 80 miles an hour. And so that’s part of the issue,” Mollman said in an interview in May.
The merging of the two schools, Mollman said, would put the Black students at a disadvantage because they would no longer be with their teachers.
“Many of those teachers were black, and so it’s not just the bussing times. It’s also where those students are going to be placed, who they’re going to be taught by, and how that’s going to be different, how they’re going to be differently situated than from their white peers.”
“A judge determined that they were not guilty of those offenses, and made comments to the effect that if anyone was disorderly in the incident, it was law enforcement,” she said. 
For the past 50 years, the Chambers County School District has been under a federal desegregation order. A federal judge ruled that both Valley and Lafayette high schools must be combined into one Chambers County High School.

(Ralph Chapoco/Alabama Reflector)Elected officials and criminal justice reform advocates will continue their efforts to reduce the recidivism rate for people who were formerly incarcerated.
The Alabama Reentry Task Force convened the first meeting on Tuesday because of a joint resolution enacted by the Legislature authorizing it to build on the efforts from the Reentry Alabama Commission by implementing strategies to reduce the barriers that people face once they are released from prison.
“The only way you are ever going to truly reduce recidivism is to provide the full body of services,” said Cam Ward in an interview following the meeting, chair of the Task Force and director of the Alabama Bureau of Pardons and Paroles.
Candidates need mental health treatment, substance abuse and other social services that include medical care and workforce development.
“All that together, one agency can’t do that,” Ward said. “There is no one law that does that. You need five, six, seven, eight agencies working together.”
The Reentry Alabama Commission was created in 2021 and reauthorized in 2024 by the Legislature to review the issues pertaining to reentry and identify any barriers that people face once released from incarceration, either through parole or after completing their sentences.
Commission members, who stem from state agencies to criminal justice reform organizations, in collaboration with the Council of State Governments Justice Center, sought to identify factors to assist with reducing recidivism.
Members met monthly and listened to people who offered different perspectives on the problem. Ronald McKeithen, director of Second Chances at Alabama Appleseed, a criminal justice reform organization, told the commission during a September meeting about the problems people have with obtaining documents they need to rebuild their lives after getting released.
At another Commission meeting in October, Sarah Stewart, chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, proposed job courts as one solution to address workforce barriers for those who are formerly incarcerated.
Members compiled the information from the meetings and other feedback received from people involved in the criminal justice system and produced a report that outlines their findings regarding reentry.
Safe and affordable housing was a barrier to reentry, according to the report.
“Transitional housing for people upon reentry is limited and often does not follow best practices regarding service provision,” the report states.
There were problems collecting quality data, which led to inconsistent information that hindered evaluating decisions that people made to address problems with reentry.
The report also identified problems tied to workforce development, from receiving vital documents, like McKeithen told the Commission, to limited transportation options for people who need to get themselves to work and other appointments.
The study also found that the rules and regulations surrounding the criminal justice system are problematic.
“Alabama law imposes hundreds of barriers to work for people with criminal convictions,” the report states.
The report proposed a series of strategies to address some of the issues. The recommendations were assigned to four domains dealing with infrastructure, workforce development, preparing people for reentry and collecting the appropriate data to gauge the effectiveness of policy and programmatic decisions.
In terms of supporting people’s employment efforts, the authors recommended reducing barriers to obtaining licensing and education, as well as reducing barriers to getting hired.
“Resources should include information about mechanisms that may provide relief from legal barriers to work and how to address criminal history in the hiring and occupational licensing processes,” the report states.
It also suggested speaking with employers to provide them with information about hiring people with a criminal history. This includes the benefits, the incentives and support that is available, dispel myths about hiring people who had been incarcerated and provide best practices and support for those reentering the workforce.
The report suggested providing support for people as their incarceration ends by informing them of the services and benefits that are available, such as SNAP benefits and health insurance.
The report also proposed helping those getting released with fines and fees that they owe.
“The burden on this is also really difficult for criminal defendants to manage when they do get out, whether they are on probation or in accountability court, or they get out of prison at the end,” Stewart said during the committee meeting. “It becomes something that affects their families, their ability to get jobs, their ability to hold onto any of the money they put into their pockets once they get the job. That affects housing, that affects transportation. It becomes a never-ending cycle.”
There are other suggestions listed in the report, from making transportation more available to providing more resources to deal with mental health and substance abuse.
Meetings are scheduled quarterly, but different groups will meet to address different aspects of reentry and develop action items to implement that will help address the barriers for people and reduce recidivism.
“It is going to be a pleasure to work with you all,” McKeithen said, who was assigned to be on the Task Force. “I have had to deal with a lot of these issues. These things that I am reading in the report, I am so excited about it. I can’t wait to get in the room and talk with you all.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_7279-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-04 08:03:04.709942

VA Secretary Doug Collins, the Air Force Reserve colonel now running a public health care system serving nine million former service members, has tried to allay their concerns.
According to Collins, even if more than 80,000 VA positions are eliminated this year (as projected by his chief of staff), veterans will have no trouble accessing doctors, nurses, or therapists elsewhere.
That’s because they will get faster referrals to a network of equally qualified private sector providers, who now number 1.7 million nationwide and receive more than $30 billion in annual reimbursements for treating eligible veterans outside the VA.
Thanks to President Trump, Collins says, “VA is providing veterans with more health care choices…while making it even easier for veterans to get their health care when and where it’s most convenient for them.”
On Friday, May 30, members of American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) Local 2152 challenged this rosy scenario at a noon-time rally in Reno that brought together VA patients and their care-givers.
Rally speakers warned a crowd of several hundred about the possible loss of specialized care provided by their local VA hospital, its counterpart in Las Vegas, eighteen out-patient facilities in Nevada, three community-based counseling centers, one nursing home, and a residential treatment program for substance abusers.
According to VA defenders, local private hospitals, clinics, and medical practices will struggle to meet veterans’ needs if more VA care is outsourced and its own facilities are downsized or closed.
VA patients will have longer wait times for appointments. They will drive further to get less “veteran centric” treatment. And they will be deprived of the wrap-around services currently available to over 120,000 Nevada residents who have qualified for VA coverage due to their low-income, service-related conditions, or recent service in combat zones.
A recent assessment of the state’s healthcare access problems, by the University of Nevada Medical School in Reno, makes this danger quite clear, particularly for vets in rural areas. As the authors of another research paper found, Nevada ranks nationally “among the lowest states in terms of available primary care doctors and general surgeons per capita, resulting in limited access to essential services and an increased reliance on emergency departments and hospitals.”
Currently, none of the state’s 17 counties have enough primary care providers, while 12 report a severe shortage of mental health providers. In 2023, nearly 87 percent of all Nevada residents lived in a federally-designated “mental health professional shortage area.”
According to the Nevada Health Workforce Research Center,  the state  ranked “last in the country for overall youth mental health based on the prevalence of mental illness, as well as access to services” for problems like anxiety and depression.
Since 2005, several of the state’s rural hospitals have closed and more than half of those remaining have curtailed some critical services. Others remain at risk of going out of business, particularly if Medicaid cuts, just backed by the House Republican majority soon win Senate approval as well.
By one estimate, Nevada needs 1,700 more therapists, social workers, and substance abuse specialists just to reduce drug over-dose and age-adjusted suicide rates that, in recent years, have exceeded national averages. To improve primary care access, experts say the state also needs to replace its aging physician workforce and significant proportion of inactive providers with more than 1,100 new primary care docs in the next five years.
None of these estimates anticipate a big influx of new patients from the VA with more mental health problems, chronic illnesses and pain, more back, neck, and shoulder injuries, and higher rates of hypertension and diabetes than non-veterans.
 Those who experienced combat came back with more cases of traumatic brain injury or Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Veterans also suffer from higher rates of substance abuse and suicide, than the general population. Nearly a million post-9/11 vets have qualified for VA care recently due to past toxic exposures – from burn-pits in the Middle East or military bases in the U.S. with poisoned soil or water.
Right now, a major employer in Nevada—the VA—stands ready and able to serve this challenging patient population, with a skilled and committed workforce numbering more than 4,200 (a third of whom are veterans themselves). The VA’s two major medical centers in Nevada provide clinical training for many young doctors, nurses, and other healthcare professionals who either decide to stay at the VA or migrate to private sector jobs, where, as noted above, they are much needed locally.
If President Trump proceeds with his planned downsizing of the VA and the services it provides, one thing is certain. Military veterans promised better “customer service and convenience” outside their own healthcare system will find themselves in the same “medical deserts” (and long lines) familiar to patients already under-served by the private healthcare industry.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/VA.jpeg,,,2025-06-04 08:03:04.709942

(Lindsey Toomer/Colorado NewslineFew Trump administration agencies are so out of control as Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
ICE in recent months has disappeared people from American communities, a hallmark of unaccountable authoritarianism. The agency releases scant information to the public about its activities, and it withholds information even in court proceedings. Its agents wield the awesome power to deprive people of their liberty, and they’ve used that power to deposit hundreds of people in a brutal foreign prison, likely for life.
Demand for oversight has rarely been so great, and no tool of ICE oversight should be left unused.
Members of Congress have at least one method by which to oversee the agency — they can show up at ICE detention centers unannounced and perform inspections. But U.S. representatives and senators in Colorado exercise this authority too infrequently.
ICE this year has undertaken aggressive immigration enforcement efforts as part of President Donald Trump’s plan for mass deportations. In Colorado, which Trump made a particular focus of his anti-immigration program, the agency has undertaken several raids and other operations that have resulted in scores of people being held at its detention center in Aurora, operated by private prison company the GEO Group.
People there are often denied constitutionally guaranteed due process, targeted for their exercise of First Amendment rights, and held without being charged with a crime, according to court documents and immigration advocates. About 12 detainees were removed from the Aurora facility to the notorious CECOT prison in El Salvador.
Federal authorities have gone about this business with essentially no transparency. That’s where oversight comes in.
In 2019, U.S. Rep. Jason Crow, a Colorado Democrat, tried to inspect the ICE facility after learning about poor health conditions there. He was denied entry, prompting him to pursue on-site oversight authority, which he helped secure in law. Members of Congress, according to language that is included annually in appropriations legislation, now have the authority to conduct unannounced oversight visits at Department of Homeland Security facilities.
This was no empty gesture. Crow has routinely invoked the authority ever since, and he posts to his website reports about visits to the detention center in Aurora. His office has already completed two oversight visits this month.
This is the same authority by which three U.S. representatives from New Jersey recently tried to conduct oversight at an ICE facility in that state. They were denied entry, and the Trump administration charged one of the lawmakers with a crime.
But ICE’s refusal to respect oversight authority is no cause to idle it. It’s reason to assert it to its fullest extent.
Crow should not be alone in conducting inspections in Aurora. Democratic U.S. Sens. Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper of Colorado should also show up. Hickenlooper has expressed anger over the Trump administration’s lawless approach to immigration enforcement, even suggesting in April that “the country’s going to rise up” in response. But to a reporter’s question about what senators like him could do, he said, “You want me to get my pitchfork?”
No. But lawmakers can get inside a facility where Colorado residents, snatched off the streets by the federal government, now face unconstitutional removal to prisons run by foreign dictators, and at least demonstrate to ICE and the people of Colorado that they’ve got their eye on MAGA malfeasance in Denver’s backyard.
Other members of the U.S. House from Colorado can also exercise oversight of ICE. The detention center in Aurora sits in Crow’s district, and territorial deference is doubtless a factor, especially among fellow Democrats. But Crow could arrange a multimember visit. The detention center in New Jersey sits in U.S. Rep. LaMonica McIver’s district, and two other members of Congress from neighboring districts had arrived to inspect the facility with McIver when they were denied entry. Strength in numbers sends a message that the members will do everything they can to hold an outpost of authoritarianism in Colorado to account.
A member of Hickenlooper’s staff accompanied a Crow staff member during one inspection in March. In response to questions from Newsline about whether they’d visited the Aurora facility, the six Democratic members of the Colorado congressional delegation — Bennet, Hickenlooper, Crow and Reps. Diana DeGette, Joe Neguse and Brittany Pettersen — responded in a joint statement: “Oversight is a key part of our jobs, and a responsibility we don’t take lightly. The Trump Administration’s recent attempts to intimidate Members of Congress from conducting oversight of ICE detention facilities are alarming — and we will not back down. We are fully committed to providing the necessary oversight and transparency of the GEO ICE facility in Aurora to ensure these facilities are run in full accordance with the law, and our offices will continue to perform the critical casework to ensure detainees are treated fairly.”
The oversight authority alone won’t enable members of Congress to stop the abuses that ICE commits in Aurora. Crow helped establish the authority at a time when immigration advocates were most concerned about health conditions, not cancellation of basic rights. No facility walk-through can remedy the profound injustices at work there.
But at a time when Democrats seem overwhelmed and impotent as the Trump administration dismantles constitutional order, every available counterweight should be applied with maximum force.

Gov. Jeff Landry is pushing House Bill 693, sponsored by House Republican Caucus Chairman Mark Wright, R-Covington. It carves out more circumstances under which political contributions and expenditures don’t have to be disclosed on a public campaign finance report. 
The 101-page proposal is difficult to understand for people who don’t deal with campaign finance regulations frequently. Even staff attorneys for the Louisiana Board of Ethics, which enforces the campaign finance laws, admit the changes are confusing. 

“To be honest with you, it’s going to take quite a grace period to figure all this out,” Ethics Administrator David Bordelon said when presenting the bill to the state ethics board last month. 

SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Private attorneys Stephen Gelé and Charles Spies helped write the bill. They have represented Landry in multiple disputes he has had with the ethics board, including over campaign finance laws and enforcement. 
Gelé has said the proposal respects constitutional rights, including freedom of speech, while still providing transparency and “preventing the appearance of corruption.” 
The state’s preeminent government watchdog group disagrees. The Public Affairs Research Council of Louisiana (PAR) has come out against the legislation, saying the bill would benefit politicians while offering little for the general public. 

“There is a very large bill, and I don’t quite understand the problem it is trying to solve,” PAR President Steven Procopio said at a legislative hearing last month. 
In more than 20 places in the law, the bill increases the minimum dollar threshold at which a donation or expense has to be included on a public campaign finance report. 

For example, national political committees that raise most of their money outside Louisiana are required to publicly disclose their spending on a Louisiana election once it reaches $20,000. The proposed bill would hike that disclosure threshold to $50,000. 
The current law also requires any campaign contributions or expenditures over $200 given within the 20 days before the election to be reported on a public campaign finance report. The proposed law would hike that disclosure threshold to $5,000. 
Louisiana set to spend at least $7 million to bring Saudi-owned LIV Golf to New Orleans

Over a dozen similar changes are also part of the legislation. 
Individuals who are not political candidates and groups that are not explicitly political committees could also spend money on an election without disclosing contributions they accepted for the politicking. 

Those who are not a candidate or a designated political committee would only be required to disclose election spending over $1,000 in a political cycle and if it involved: 

federally-regulated broadcast media; 
 500 pieces of mail;
a phone bank of 500 calls within a 30-day period; or 
digital or print advertising with a candidate’s image that’s distributed in the area the candidate would represent within 30 days of their primary and 60 days of their general election

These changes would apply to large, statewide elections and smaller ones such as those for police juries, town councils and school boards. 
Money spent to communicate with people in a “membership organization” – such as a union, industry association or an athletic club – as well as employees and stockholders of a business also would not have to be reported as a political expense. This could include communication sent to thousands of people at once. 
In some cases, current campaign finance law obliges people to report this type of spending that would be shielded under the Wright bill. Supporters of the legislation said these exceptions were mainly carved out with so-called social welfare organizations in mind. 

The organizations, which critics call “dark money” political groups, are registered with the IRS as 501(c)(4) nonprofits for tax purposes and are not required to disclose their donors under federal regulations. It’s unclear to what extent the groups have to disclose their spending on Louisiana elections under current state campaign finance laws. 
Landry has received help from at least one of these “dark money” groups, Protect Louisiana Values, to advance his political agenda. It also notably put up the money to rent a live tiger to attend an LSU football game last year. 
Defying Landry, Louisiana lawmakers reject giving him more control over licensing boards

Former Gov. John Bel Edwards also established two of his own “dark money” groups during his eight years in office: Rebuild Louisiana and A Stronger Louisiana. 
While limiting disclosure on political spending, Wright’s legislation does open up allowable uses of politician’s campaign funds to a much wider group of expenses, including their home mortgages, country club fees and gym memberships. 

The legislation is also one of a few bills Landry is pushing to soften ethics laws and regulations this session. Lawmakers in favor of them said they are reacting to overzealous enforcement by the ethics board. 

In 2007, former Gov. Bobby Jindal and legislators passed dozens of restrictions and public disclosure requirements for elected officials and public employees as part of Jindal’s effort to reach a “gold standard” of ethics for Louisiana that would be a model around the country. 
Lawmakers are now saying that effort was overreach that needs to be corrected. 

“I haven’t come across an elected official who has enjoyed working through this process and hasn’t questioned what they did back in the Jindal era,” Wright said of ethics and campaign finance regulations.

On Tuesday, the House of Representatives narrowly passed and then enacted — by a one-vote margin — LD 589, which mirrors a proposal Gov. Janet Mills put forward last session. The Senate enacted the measure later that day, sending it to the governor for her approval. 
“By supporting this legislation, we affirm our commitment to fairness and consistency in our labor standards while continuing to honor the invaluable contributions of our agricultural community,” said Rep. Amy Roeder (D-Bangor) during the House debate Tuesday.
Mills has vetoed multiple similar proposals in the past, including her own last session after the Labor Committee changed it. However, Labor Commissioner Laura Fortman said during a committee meeting last month that Mills seems to be on board with the amended version of LD 589.
Similar to the discussion on the Senate floor Monday, some House Republicans raised concerns that this bill would prohibit piecework, which is often used by sectors such as the blueberry industry to pay people based on how much they pick. 
Roeder, who co-chairs the Labor Committee, clarified that piecework is not outlawed by the bill. 
Most agricultural employers who spoke to the committee said they already pay more than the state’s minimum wage of $14.65 an hour, but proponents have said the bill is important because it addresses the historic exclusion of agricultural workers from labor rights.

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters.)State insurance officials warn that thousands of Marylanders who bought health insurance on the state marketplace could see the cost of coverage increase an average of 17% next year unless Congress extends federal subsidies that are set to expire in December.
The Maryland Insurance Administration (MIA) said in a press release Tuesday that health insurers are asking the state to raise premiums between 8.1% and 18.7% for individual plans offered under the Affordable Care Act for 2026. The increase would hit nearly 300,000 Marylanders who buy their health insurance through the state marketplace.
Insurers say the rate increases are needed to account for the impending expiration of federal insurance premium tax credits under the Affordable Care Act that are set to expire at the end of the year. If the tax credit remained, insurers would only be seeking “an overall average rate change of 7.9%, with most carriers filing for an increase between 5% and 7%,” the MIA statement said.
The tax credit expiration is just one of the changes under discussion at the federal level that state officials fear could upend Maryland’s insurance marketplace and lead to higher premium costs.
Maryland Insurance Commissioner Marie Grant said the budget reconciliation bill recently passed by the House of Representatives could lead further increases insurance premiums and make it harder to enroll in an ACA individual plan.
“There are many changes in the House budget reconciliation bill on the federal level that will impact the ability of Marylanders to … enroll in our exchange, as well changes in the calculations that would lower the amount of tax credits further for Marylanders,” Grant said in a virtual press conference Tuesday.

The insurers are also asking for premium increases for small group plans with an “overall average rate increase of 5.5%, with the averages by carrier ranging from 3.3% to 12.2%,” according to the MIA press release, though state officials were more focused on the increases in the individual market Tuesday.
The House narrowly passed the so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill” last month to carry out much of the Trump administration’s policy plans, including massive changes to Medicaid and the ACA. The current bill does not include language to extend the premium tax credit, leaving it to expire in December unless the U.S. Senate decides to extend it.
That “wild uncertainty” at the federal level is driving the need for rate increase requests by Maryland’s insurance companies, said Matthew Celentano, executive director of the League of Life & Health Insurers of Maryland, which includes major providers such as CareFirst, Kaiser Permanente and UnitedHealthCare.
“The budget reconciliation package that passed the House of Representatives last week would have dramatic impacts on Maryland insurance markets, and the loss of subsidies would create affordability challenges across the board for Maryland consumers that would lead to a reversal of progress over the years to drastically reduce the number of uninsured Marylanders,” Celentano said in a written statement.
“We hope that the Senate realizes and reverses course on the negative consequences of reducing premium tax credits and the concerning impacts it will have on the entire health care ecosystem including our most vulnerable neighbors,” his statement said.
Grant said the proposed premium rate increases are not final and will go through a “really careful review” by MIA, with public hearings and public comments over the next couple months before new rates are set for next year.
But legislators and state officials say that the potential expiration of premium tax credits is just the tip of the possible impacts on the insurance market from the federal level.
“We don’t know at this point the exact impact on Marylanders of all those changes, but I think that we can anticipate that they could further lower subsidies and further lead to increases in the market, if they are not addressed by the Senate,” Grant said.
Michele Eberle, executive director of the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange, said that one of the proposals in the House bill would cut a month off the open enrollment period when people shop around for health care plans – running from Nov. 1 to Dec. 15, instead of through Jan. 15.  Eberle noted that many young people who enroll in private health plans tend to enroll in the later weeks of the current open enrollment period.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“We know that younger, healthier people in the risk pool is good for everyone, as it lowers the rates,” she said.
Eberle said that some provisions in the reconciliation bill would also reduce the state’s ability to automatically re-enroll individuals by requiring more upfront eligibility checks. Other language in the bill would prohibit tax credits for many undocumented individuals who are lawfully present, including those with asylum protections.
“The collective impact of these changes will not only destabilize the private health insurance market place, but we anticipate we could go back to pre-pandemic levels of enrollment – a loss of about 30% of our enrollees,” Eberle said.
Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-5th) said during the virtual press conference that the current bill language will “skyrocket prices for average working people,” calling the One Big Beautiful bill is “one big, brazen betrayal of working Marylanders and Americans.”
In the 2025 General Assembly session, lawmakers passed legislation aiming to mitigate potential disruptions in the state marketplace due to federal decisions.
Among those was a proposal to give the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange authority to create a state subsidy if the federal premium tax credit comes to an end. That authority would only be available for 2026 through 2028 under this law sponsored by Del. Joseline A. Pena-Melnyk (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel), chair of the House Health and Government Operations Committee.
Sen. Pam Beidle (D-Anne Arundel), chair of the Maryland Senate Finance Committee, fears the changes will take a toll on the state’s relatively low 6% uninsurance rate for health care, backsliding on legislative efforts to boost insurance coverage across the state.
“To me, health care is like food and water. It’s one of the most important benefits we can provide to people,” Beidle said. “Seeing the changes this bill (budget reconciliation bill) will bring … we’ve seen our numbers go down to where it’s just a small percentage of people who don’t have health insurance, and now we’re going to see that number increase exponentially,” she said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024_dec13_openenrollment2-newsletter-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-04 08:03:04.709942

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Bryce Sammel: Want lower taxes? Then let’s reform education the smart way..","This commentary is by Bryce Sammel of Barnard. He and his wife Nakina are the parents of three children. He previously served on and chaired both the Barnard Academy and Mountain Views school boards and currently runs a baseball program supporting youth from over a dozen towns in the area.Vermonters are rightly worried about taxes. With rising costs across the board, including property taxes, health care and energy bills, many residents, especially those without school-aged children, are asking a fair question: Why are we spending so much on education, and are we getting our money’s worth?If you care about taxes, you deserve to know the truth: closing schools and cutting programs doesn’t automatically lower your property taxes. It can raise them.When schools close, or programs are gutted, young families leave. That shrinks the full-time population and weakens the local economy and the residential tax base. Empty homes get snapped up by second-homeowners, inflating local property values and the grand list, creating the tax increases we’re seeing today in communities across Vermont.At the same time, Vermont’s aging population means we need younger families more than ever. Not just to fill classrooms but to power our economy and support essential services. Strong public schools are a magnet for those families, and they’re also where we prepare students to become skilled workers in trades, healthcare, agriculture, small business and other critical sectors.If those students leave for better opportunities elsewhere or can’t afford to live here as adults, the cycle worsens. That’s why we must invest wisely in education and keep taxes manageable so that working families and young Vermonters can afford to stay.The current proposals in Montpelier, including H.454, claim to answer that question by cutting costs through school consolidation and funding reform. But these proposals don’t appear to fix what’s broken. They shift the costs in ways that may backfire on communities, taxpayers and the economy.In addition, forcing expensive transitions like merging mega-districts, laying off staff or overhauling infrastructure without support creates short-term costs that outweigh any long-term savings. Taxpayers will end up footing the bill for poorly planned reforms that don’t deliver results.There is a better way. A more innovative approach to education reform could stabilize taxes and improve efficiency without destabilizing our communities.Instead of extreme mandates, we should focus on voluntary consolidation and shared services, offering increased per-pupil funding or targeted grants for districts that work together to reduce overhead. A high school that serves 450 students or a classroom with 15 kids may make fiscal sense without sacrificing educational outcomes. Rewarding schools that hit those marks is smarter than punishing those that don’t.We could also set a realistic goal of reducing the number of school districts, not to five, as some have proposed, but perhaps by half. That alone could cut administrative costs and save taxpayers money while preserving local control.Some other ideas the governor has proposed would also help facilitate easier consolidation in the near future.A unified school calendar is a practical way to promote cost savings and future flexibility. If all Vermont schools operated on the same schedule, it would eliminate one of the barriers to collaboration and future district mergers as well as making it much easier for students in different schools to access career and technical education centers without as much of a disruptive impact on the rest of their high school schedule.Setting universal minimum graduation requirements would establish a clear statewide standard for earning a diploma, ensuring every Vermont graduate meets a baseline level of preparation. If, in the future, schools or districts merged, there would be no risk of it affecting students’ outcomes because they would already be aligned. At the same time, individual schools could add additional requirements for advanced programs, CTE tracks or academic pathways, allowing for local innovation and higher achievement.When it comes to school infrastructure, delaying repairs only makes them more expensive later. If we want to reduce costs long-term, we need to invest in energy-efficient, right-sized school buildings today. Let’s raise the state match for projects meeting new enrollment benchmarks and sustainability standards. The cost would pay off quickly through efficiency of scale, reduced heating bills and lower maintenance.Most importantly, we need a funding formula that reflects the real costs of running schools in Vermont. The Senate version imposes arbitrary growth caps that don’t solve the problem but mask it and risk driving up costs to homeowners. The House version of H.454 does this better. It uses more accurate, research-based pupil weights for rural, low-income and high-needs students.We could fine-tune this formula to further reward voluntary mergers, shared programming, community-based schools and those schools offering CTE programming.Short-term grants, limited use of surplus or reserve funds, or revenue adjustments could ease the transition and help districts adjust without sudden tax spikes. This way, we can start today while continuing to discuss the needed broader tax reform.It’s not about protecting the status quo or pretending everything’s fine. Vermont’s education system needs to evolve. But let’s not fall for proposals that sound good on paper and cost us more in practice.Want lower taxes? Then, support a reform strategy that incentivizes smart decisions, doesn’t force bad ones and avoids short-term chaos that leads to long-term costs. Let’s fix what’s broken without bulldozing what works.Let your representatives know that real reform balances cost savings with common sense. It rewards efficient schools and academic achievement, encourages collaboration and respects all Vermont taxpayers.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Bryce Sammel: Want lower taxes?

To stand with the Jewish people today means more than statements of solidarity. It means real, tangible action.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Shalom Alliance: Vermont legislators have a chance to save Jewish lives — now.","This commentary is from the Shalom Alliance, a nonpartisan nonprofit working to build a bright future for Vermont Jews by fighting antisemitism and misinformation in Vermont schools, communities and media. We do this through building bridges, providing educational resources and helping Jews around Vermont have a safe place for Jewish pride.In moments of crisis, history judges leaders not by their rhetoric, but by their response. Today, Vermont lawmakers are facing a defining moment — a moral crossroads where their decisions will profoundly impact the safety and well-being of Jewish people in Vermont.As the war in Israel and Gaza continues and antisemitic violence surges worldwide under the guise of “Free, Free Palestine,” Jewish communities worldwide, including Vermont, are seeking safety and solidarity. Vermont has the opportunity, and indeed the responsibility, to act, because it is not a matter of if this behavior escalates into violence in Vermont. It’s a matter of when.One immediate avenue lawmakers have at their fingertips is H.310, a bill currently introduced that would define ethnic and antisemitic harassment, and provide schools and students with the tools to identify, address, protect against and teach about antisemitism. This legislation recognizes what Jewish students and families have long reported to Vermont elected officials and schools, and the Jewish people have experienced for more than 3,000 years: that antisemitism does not begin with violence — it begins with silence, denial, ignorance and exclusion.Vermont is the only state in New England without any Holocaust education standards, despite bills being introduced seeking this change since 2017. By equipping Vermont’s educational institutions to confront this hatred directly, H.310 not only offers protection but also affirms the dignity and identity of Jewish Vermonters.The urgency of this moment was heartbreakingly underscored by the recent murder of Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim — two young members of the American, Israeli and Jewish communities — gunned down outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, DC. Their killer reportedly shouted ‘Free, Free Palestine’ after targeting the couple, who worked at the Israeli Embassy, in cold blood.Here in Vermont, we cannot ignore the surge in antisemitic rhetoric and conspiracy theories flooding social media platforms, especially in local forums and comment sections. Jewish Vermonters have reported seeing Holocaust comparisons, coded slurs, and explicit denial of Jewish identity or history — often unmoderated and, worse, encouraged by coordinated online mobs.This digital hate translates into real-world fear and threats, particularly for visibly Jewish residents and children in schools. It’s a reminder that Vermont is not immune to the dangerous currents sweeping the country.To stand with the Jewish people today means more than statements of solidarity. It means real, tangible action. It means creating avenues for safe harbor, standing firm against rising antisemitism, and making Vermont a beacon for those fleeing danger. Legislators: you have a choice. You can be remembered as leaders who rose to meet history, or as bystanders who allowed it to pass them by. The opportunity to save lives is before you — take it.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Shalom Alliance: Vermont legislators have a chance to save Jewish lives — now.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Commentaries_featured-image-25.png,,,2025-06-04 07:01:59.583328

Like many of the world’s children, they and their classmates switched to online learning when the COVID-19 pandemic broke out in 2020. But, unlike children in the US, these boys never went back to their old classrooms. 
  Two third grade boys play ping pong outside of their neighborhood school in Kharkiv.

(Cecilia Nowell)
In February 2022, when Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, cluster bombs, missiles and shells began to rain on their hometown of Kharkiv, located just 23 miles from the Russian border. Three years later, the threats have not ceased: drones hover over the city and air raid sirens announce incoming ballistic missiles day and night.
In Kharkiv, it’s never been safe for children to return to the schools they once attended, so public officials moved education underground. 
“I love metro school,” one of the boys says, pausing his game to speak through a translator. In mid-April, shrapnel shattered the windows of the school he is playing outside after Ukrainian air defense shot down an incoming missile. “There you can talk normally and no one will interrupt you.“
The boys attend one of Kharkiv’s six metro schools, where children go to class deep in the city’s subway stations. Last year, the city began work on an additional four underground schools, massive facilities with more than a dozen classrooms each.
“Altogether, about 10,000 students — roughly 15% of all children currently in Kharkiv — are studying in these safe locations in person,” Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov said through a translator. “We are now completing construction of three more underground schools and plan to open them by the beginning of the new academic year.”
While the United States government has terminated funding to international aid organizations previously supporting the schools, like USAID and the UN refugee agency, the City of Albuquerque has not.
The Albuquerque Sister Cities program is currently working to provide 29 laptops to the underground schools in Kharkiv. The organization has secured 19 laptops to date and is hoping to donate the remainder this summer, according to the Albuquerque Mayor’s Office.
“Though the Trump administration’s support for Ukraine has been shaky at best, the City of Albuquerque keeps showing up for our Sister City of Kharkiv and the people of Ukraine,” Mayor Tim Keller said in a statement. 
“We are sincerely grateful for that support,” said Terekhov. “We are deeply committed to properly equipping our schools — especially underground ones, where children study in safe conditions during wartime.”
At the outbreak of the full-scale invasion, Russian soldiers occupied the city of Kharkiv and many surrounding villages. Oksana Suprun, mayor of the nearby town of Savyntsi, says that during that time period, “all laptops and computers were stolen from every educational institution — all of them. Everything related to multimedia equipment was ripped out and taken. Computers, projectors — it was all looted.”
“Basically, no classroom — except for math — was left untouched,” echoed Hennadii Kliuyev, director of the Savyntsi Lyceum, a school for grades first through twelfth.
While the schools have tried to provide laptops to all students as they attended classes remotely, some have had to make do with the devices their families had at home.

“One of our teachers thought that a student wasn’t doing her assignments. She’s a good student, but she had serious issues with IT class. Eventually, we found out her tablet just couldn’t run the software that teachers were used to working with. Other children were using laptops, and she simply didn’t have that option,” said Kliuyev.
As the town of Savyntsi constructs its first underground school, which will bring 400 students back to the classroom, teachers are preparing to organize classes in person again. But there, as in Kharkiv, students will continue attending class online a few days a week to allow more children to rotate through the building.
“It won’t be easy. They’re no longer used to being in school. Some of the children, we can tell, are not socially adjusted. There’s a kind of psychological barrier. They’re even shy to speak up in class,” said Kliuyev. “And we’re talking about tenth graders. There are definitely some psychological issues lingering. As adults, we’ve somehow adapted to the situation. But children’s minds don’t work the same way.”

Those underground schools are especially needed now, as Russia intensifies its strikes on Ukrainian cities even amid ongoing peace talks.
As much as they’ve adapted three years into the full-scale invasion, it’s still important for adults to know their children will be safe returning to school, says Yulia Bashkirova, head of the education department in Kharkiv’s Shevchenkivskyi neighborhood. 
The schools are located six meters underground and a teacher’s aide meets students at the entrance to guide them to class to avoid parents gathering at the entrance and revealing the schools’ locations. 
“We have a generator. We have ventilation that cleans the air. The lighting in the underground school imitates daylight,” Bashkirova said. She oversees an underground school that opened in late April and already has 830 students enrolled.
“It is very important for children to have the opportunity to meet in an underground school, to communicate, to see the teacher and to learn offline,” said Bashkirova. But, “the safety of the kids is the biggest priority. And right now when kids are in the underground school, parents can feel safe that they are in a safe location.”
She hopes that reality does not last forever in Kharkiv. “We’ve gone underground not by choice, but because of the security situation,” Bashkirova said. “We would really like to meet somewhere above ground. Not underground — but in regular schools — because it’s more comfortable and familiar for the children, and it’s the way it should be.”

(Photo courtesy of Aqeela Sherrills)Community-based violence intervention programs nationwide have long worked alongside law enforcement officers to deescalate conflict, prevent retaliatory shootings, and, in some cases, arrive at crime scenes before police do.
In many communities, these initiatives have been credited with saving lives and reducing violence.
But the Trump administration last month abruptly terminated at least 373 public safety grants from the U.S. Department of Justice’s Office of Justice Programs, pulling roughly $500 million in remaining funds across a range of programs, according to a new report by the Council on Criminal Justice, a nonprofit think tank. The cuts come just as summer is approaching — a season when violence consistently peaks.
The grants were initially valued at $820 million, but many were multiyear awards at different stages of rollout, which means some of the money has already been spent.
At least 554 organizations across 48 states are affected by the cuts, many of them small, community-based nonprofits that rely on this money. The rescinded grants supported everything from violence prevention and policing to victim advocacy, reentry services, research, and mental health and substance abuse treatment. Some of the grants were cut from state and local government agencies.
Another new report from the Council on Criminal Justice dug deeper into local effects: It found that the Trump administration’s cuts also eliminated 473 minigrants — known as “subawards” — passed from primary recipients to smaller groups that often face challenges accessing federal dollars directly, such as rural government agencies and grassroots nonprofits.
About $5 million of those subawards were intended for state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies working to reduce violence in rural areas, according to the report.
Experts warn the timing couldn’t be worse. The summer months — historically linked to higher rates of violent crimes — are approaching, and the safety net in many cities is fraying. A growing body of research has found a correlation between spikes in temperature and violent crime, with studies suggesting that heat waves and sudden weather swings can inflame tensions and increase aggression.
“These programs are having to cut staff and cut services, and that will be felt in communities in states all over the country at exactly the time when they’re most needed,” said Amy Solomon, a senior fellow at the Council on Criminal Justice and the lead author of the report.
Solomon also previously served as assistant U.S. attorney general in the Biden administration, where she led the Office of Justice Programs — the Justice Department’s largest grantmaking agency.
Many of the primary grants that were terminated contained no references to race, gender, or diversity-related language, according to the report — despite claims from federal officials that such criteria were driving the cuts. Primary grant recipients received their funding from the feds directly.
 ‘Wasteful grants’

U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi defended the cuts in a late April post on X, stating that the department has cut “millions of dollars in wasteful grants.” She also signaled that additional cuts may be on the way. In her post, she specifically cited grants that supported LGBTQ+ liaison services in police departments and programs providing gender-affirming care and housing for incarcerated transgender people.
The Department of Justice’s cuts come amid a broader push by the Trump administration and the newly created Department of Government Efficiency to pull funding from a range of federal programs — a move they say is aimed at reducing spending and saving taxpayer dollars.
For some groups, the sudden withdrawal of funds has meant scaling back crime victim services or pulling out of some neighborhoods altogether.
Community violence prevention groups aim to stop shootings and other forms of violence before they happen by working directly with those most at risk. Staff — often with experience in the justice system — mediate conflicts, respond to crises, and connect people to support such as counseling or job training. In some cities, they’re dispatched to high-risk areas to deescalate tensions, often before police arrive.
And research shows that community-level violence prevention programs can contribute to drops in crime.
After a historic surge in homicides in 2020, violent crime in the United States dropped in 2024 to pre-pandemic levels — or even lower — in many cities. Preliminary 2025 data suggest that the downward trend is continuing in major cities, including Baltimore, Houston, Los Angeles, and Washington, D.C.
But the progress hasn’t reached every community. Some neighborhoods are still grappling with high rates of gun violence and car theft.
Organizations that faced the toughest financial cuts had been funded through the U.S. Department of Justice’s Community Based Violence Intervention and Prevention Initiative — the federal government’s primary mechanism for supporting this work.
Since the program’s launch in 2022, the federal Office of Justice Programs has invested about $300 million in community violence intervention efforts and related research. But nearly half of that funding has now been wiped out, according to the Council on Criminal Justice report.
“It’s really unprecedented to see these kinds of grants cut midstream,” Solomon told Stateline. “This was an effort that had bipartisan support [in Congress] and in the field all across the country.”
 Impact on communities nationwide

In late April, Aqeela Sherrills received a letter from the federal Justice Department terminating a $3.5 million grant that supported the Community-Based Public Safety Collective. Sherrills is co-founder and executive director of the national organization, which focuses on community-led approaches to preventing violence, including mediating conflicts, building relationships in high-risk neighborhoods, and connecting people to resources such as housing, mental health care, and job training.
The letter said the organization’s efforts no longer aligned with the federal Justice Department’s priorities, which include supporting “certain law enforcement operations, combatting violent crime, protecting American children, and supporting American victims of trafficking and sexual assault.”
Until the end of April, the collective had an agreement with the Justice Department to provide training and technical assistance to 95 local groups — including community groups, police departments, city and county governments, and state agencies — that had each been awarded $2 million over three years to run community violence intervention programs.










We're bracing for what could potentially be a high-violence summer.


– Aqeela Sherrills, co-founder and CEO of the Community-Based Public Safety Collective


But after the department cut $3.5 million, the Community-Based Public Safety Collective was forced to lay off 20 staff members.
“Without the significant funding … it destabilizes the organizations. People’s ability to be able to provide for themselves and their family is at risk,” Sherrills said in an interview. “We’re bracing for what could potentially be a high-violence summer.”
The deepest funding cuts hit states led by both Republican and Democratic governors, including California, Florida, Illinois, Kentucky, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Virginia, and Washington.
About $145 million in violence intervention funding was rescinded overall, along with an additional $8.6 million for related research and evaluation efforts, according to the Council on Criminal Justice report.
Some of the canceled grants funded studies and research on forensics, policing, corrections issues, and behavioral health. Now, those projects may be left unfinished.
Some of the largest losses hit intermediary organizations, such as the Community-Based Public Safety Collective, that support smaller programs by providing microgrants, training, and technical assistance.
For organizations such as the Newark Community Street Team in New Jersey, the loss of federal funding has left some areas of the city without coverage.
The funding had allowed staff to monitor neighborhoods and engage directly with community members to prevent violence. That included weekly community walks, where team members connected with victims of crime and people who may have witnessed violence, linking them to resources such as counseling or legal aid. The team also operates a hotline where residents can report crimes or alert staff to tensions that might escalate — allowing the team to step in before violence occurred.
Some of the lost funding supported school-based initiatives, where mediators helped students resolve conflicts before they escalated into fights or other forms of violence.
Of the 15 Newark positions affected by the cuts, four employees were reassigned to other departments; the others were let go. Some of the team’s staff members are formerly incarcerated, a vital trait that helps them connect with residents and build trust in communities that are often wary of traditional law enforcement.
“We just have to continue working and serving our community the best we can,” said Rey Chavis, executive director of the street team.
That work appears to be contributing to a decrease in the community’s crime rates.
City crime data from Jan. 1 to April 30, 2025, show a significant drop in violent crime in Newark compared with the same period in 2024. The total number of violent crimes reported to police fell by 49%, driven largely by a 68% decrease in robberies, according to Stateline’s analysis of the data. Homicides dropped by 53%, while aggravated assaults declined by 43%. Rapes dropped slightly by 3%.

The annual four-day gathering brings together conservative U.S. lawmakers, international leaders, media personalities and businessmen to discuss and champion conservative ideas. (Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)DOGE claims that it has saved the taxpayer nearly $16 million in grant funds to the University of Minnesota.
It hasn’t.
Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, created and then headed up the Department of Government Efficiency until his recent departure.
He once touted DOGE as “the most transparent organization in government ever.”
He cited DOGE’s website as evidence of this transparency, especially the “Wall of Receipts” that claims to show exactly what the department has cut.
Among these cuts is a $15.8M grant to the U from the Department of Health and Human Services. The purpose of the grant is listed as “currently unavailable,” and the date of the grant’s cancellation was March 23.
The website neglects to mention that the grant was reinstated by April 7.
According to U officials, the grant helps fund the Midwest Antiviral Drug Discovery Center, which conducts research on antiviral drugs to treat SARS-CoV-2, which is the virus that causes COVID-19; Ebola; Lassa; and Zika.
DOGE targeted an array of COVID-19 related grants around the same time. Why these would be considered an example of government waste is unclear, but in any case, the money is still going to the U.
The $15.8 million purportedly cut — but not actually cut from the U — came on March 23. This was just one of 1,339 line items of savings reported that day, all from the Department of Health and Human Services, amounting to ​​$877,628,206.
It’s unclear how much of that money has actually been cut because the incident with the U’s reinstated grant has become all-too typical with DOGE’s accounting. Positions and funding are cut with great fanfare, and then many of those cuts are reinstated. Federal workers are laid off, then re-hired.
Barely a month into President Trump’s second term, a New York Times review of DOGE’s receipts found they were riddled with errors:
“Some contracts the group claims credit for were double- or triple-counted. Another initially contained an error that inflated the totals by billions of dollars. In at least one instance, the group claimed an entire contract had been canceled when only part of the work had been halted. In others, contracts the group said it had closed were actually ended under the Biden administration.”
Early this year, Musk showed up at the Conservative Political Action Conference convention in sunglasses, wielding a chainsaw, in an appearance that had many speculating on his drug use.
The chainsaw was an apt metaphor, just looking at a few days of data.
March 21-23 show cuts to HHS , bookended by days of cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency. The National Science Foundation and Department of Justice are frequent targets.
A chainsaw is not a precise instrument, and imprecision, when it comes to firing federal workers, is expensive. One group that studies the federal workforce estimated all the firing, severance, rehiring, legal bills, lost productivity and paid time off would cost the government $135 billion this year, wiping out most of the alleged savings.
The “Wall of Receipts” webpage is headlined by the total reported savings. As of May 23, that was $170 billion. But the total savings listed in the Wall of Receipts adds up to just over $70 billion. Both of these numbers are far from the $2 trillion Musk promised to cut on the campaign trail, or even $1 trillion he claimed once he started DOGE.
Despite all the moving targets, Musk has repeatedly claimed transparency. “Any action that we make, we post on the doge.gov website, and we post on our X account, so it’s extreme transparency,” he said to Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini at a meeting of Italy’s League Party in April.
Yet the $70 billion savings on the website is just 41% of what the DOGE claims in its headline number — on the very same website.
Belying Musk’s claims about DOGE being the most transparent government entity in history, all of the data on the DOGE website was already publicly available, and has been since 2004 on the Federal Procurement Data System website.
(The claims of transparency are also belied by a key question about DOGE’s actions in government: data security. There is little transparency about what data DOGE has access to, and what that data is being used for.
This is of special concern as the federal government expands its contract with software company Palantir to create an AI-powered data-sharing platform to aid the Trump administration’s goal of merging Social Security, IRS, and immigration information into one central database.)
Even if the math added up, the Wall of Receipts website is difficult to use. The receipt charts are not searchable, and only show 10 line items at a time for sections with tens of thousands of lines.
If you look closely, you can download the data in chunks of 500 lines at a time, which must be combined and then translated into a readable format if it’s to become meaningfully useful.
Here is that readable chart, with data ranging from the inception of the website through May 23.
DOGE has claimed historic levels of government fraud and waste, and provided this website as the smoking gun.
But the government has not indicted anyone for fraud, nor have investigations been announced or leaked.
Meanwhile, Musk’s flagship transparency tool would better be described as opaque and is riddled with errors — to the point of uselessness, except as a scorecard of Musk’s time in government.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2200918595-1024x715.jpg,,,2025-06-04 08:03:04.709942

Victoria Hunt will move from the House to the Senate in the Washington Legislature after the King County Council appointed her on Tuesday to replace the late Sen. Bill Ramos. 
The council also chose  Zach Hall, an Issaquah City Council member, as Hunt’s replacement in the state House. 
The Senate seat will be on the ballot in a special election in November, with the winner serving through 2026. Hunt is a candidate. Republican Chad Magendanz, a former two-term state representative for the district, is opposing her.
Hall will serve through the 2026 election because the appointment is occurring after the filing period for this year’s elections closed.
Ramos passed away unexpectedly while on a trail run near his home in Issaquah on April 19, a week before the legislative session ended. He was 69. 
He was elected to the House in 2018 then won a Senate seat last year. Ramos was one of the Legislature’s leading voices on transportation issues in the 2025 session. 
Hunt, a Democrat, was sworn into the Senate shortly after being selected for the seat in the 5th Legislative District which includes parts of Issaquah, Black Diamond, Covington, and part of Snoqualmie. 
Hunt was elected to the House in 2024. She is a scientist who holds a doctorate in ecology and previously served on the Issaquah City Council. Her seatmate Rep. Lisa Callan, D-Issaquah, endorsed her. 
“With these tools and experiences I have been able to advance policies at the state level to meet the needs of our growing community,” Hunt said. 
Hall was elected to the Issaquah City Council in 2019. Prior to that he was a legislative assistant and a campaign manager for Callan.
“I have the background needed in the district, in the legislature, and in local government,” Hall said, adding that he wants to help build a Washington that’s safe, affordable, green and full of opportunities. 
“Bill Ramos set a high bar for public service and he had an unstoppable drive for the people of our district and we are all united in our commitment to honor his legacy,” Hall said.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Victoria-Hunt-Headshot-1024x810.jpg,,,2025-06-04 08:03:04.709942

Feds now want to end oversight.,"A judge ordered federal oversight after Lakeland Bank was accused of lending discrimination in 2022 in Newark. Feds now want to end oversight. (Photo by New Jersey Monitor)The Trump administration aims to end federal oversight a judge ordered in 2022 of a bank that avoided giving mortgages to people of color and opening bank branches in Black and Hispanic communities in the Newark area.
Lakeland Bank has substantially complied with changes required under the September 2022 consent decree to end such discrimination, which is known as “redlining,” and agreed to carry out whatever court-ordered reforms that remain unfinished, federal prosecutors said last week in a motion asking to end oversight more than two years early.
But a nonprofit that advocates for low- and middle-income residents filed an affidavit this week calling for the consent decree to remain in place, because ending it would threaten progress made in the last two years and leave advocates with no remedy if the bank’s compliance with unfinished remedies falters.
It also “sends a very bad message,” said Leila Amirhamzeh of New Jersey Citizen Action Education Fund, a Newark-based nonprofit that does housing counseling and fair housing investigations.
“Our concern with the Department of Justice’s motion to terminate the consent order really speaks more to the overall message that the administration is sending to financial institutions — that it is not going to enforce fair lending laws, that it is not going to ensure that any bad actors that do engage in discriminatory redlining practices are held accountable,” Amirhamzeh said.
Newark officials did not respond to a request for comment.
Under the decree, Lakeland agreed to open two branches in Newark communities of color and spend $12 million on a “loan subsidy” fund to offset closing costs, mortgage insurance premiums and down payments for Black and Hispanic residents in Essex, Somerset and Union counties who apply for mortgages and home improvement and refinancing loans. The bank also agreed to spend $1.1 million on outreach, advertising, financial counseling and community development partnerships and assign at least four loan officers to serve neighborhoods they had excluded.
Lakeland merged with Prudential Financial Services last year.
Prudential opened a new branch this week on the edge of the Ironbound, a Newark neighborhood home to many immigrants and people of color.
It’s unclear whether and when it will open a second branch, as ordered under the consent decree, as well as how much of the $13 million for the loan subsidy fund and outreach remains unspent.
Keith Buscio, a Prudential Bank spokesman, referred those questions to the Justice Department, and a spokesman there did not respond to a request for comment.
“Provident acknowledges the benefit of the mortgage loan subsidy to underserved communities and, in the event the DOJ’s motion is granted, will commit to spending the remaining amount under the subsidy,” Buscio said.
Despite such assurances, critics remain concerned.
The move to end oversight comes just two months after federal banking regulators announced they would rescind a 2023 update meant to modernize the Community Reinvestment Act, a 1977 law passed to prevent redlining, Amirhamzeh said.
Ending oversight also fits a pattern of Trump-administration rollbacks of Biden-era policies that protect marginalized people, she added.
The Trump administration is terminating $400 million in funds for states across the country to modernize their unemployment systems, money that was authorized in the 2021 American Rescue Plan Act passed under the Biden administration.
Trump officials also recently dropped a federal civil rights investigation into police brutality and racial profiling in Trenton.

Mike Braun speaks to reporters at the Indiana Statehouse on Tuesday, June 3, 2025. (Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana has exhausted its supply of lethal injection drugs after carrying out two executions in the past six months — and Gov. Mike Braun said Tuesday he doesn’t plan to buy more, at least for now.
The governor’s remarks followed the state’s December execution of Joseph Corcoran — Indiana’s first since 2009 — and last month’s execution of Benjamin Ritchie.
Recent reporting by the Indiana Capital Chronicle revealed the state spent $900,000 last year to obtain pentobarbital to carry out executions, but officials wouldn’t say how much was purchased and refused to provide information on expiration dates, storage or other details.
Braun said the high cost and short shelf life of the drug should prompt new discussions on how the state approaches capital punishment moving forward.










... I'm not going to be for putting it on the shelf and then letting them expire.


– Indiana Gov. Mike Braun


“We’ve got to address the broad issue of, what are other methods, the discussion of capital punishment in general, and then something that costs, I think, $300,000 a pop that has a 90-day shelf life — I’m not going to be for putting it on the shelf and then letting them expire,” the governor told reporters at the Indiana Statehouse.
Braun, a Republican in his first year as governor, said the question of whether Indiana should continue to carry out executions at all is one that lawmakers should weigh in the months ahead. 
“There are legislators that wonder if it’s still relevant,” Braun continued. “I’m going to listen to them, the courts, and the broader discussion in general.”
Execution methods in other states
Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita and former Gov. Eric Holcomb announced the state’s acquisition of pentobarbital in June 2024, but it’s not clear when the state ultimately received the drugs.
Indiana Department of Correction officials have refused to disclose how many doses of pentobarbital were used for each of recent executions, or how close the drug was to its expiration when it was administered.
“I think we got in a pickle where we stored three, and now it looks like … it will be coming up again,” Braun said Tuesday, appearing to refer to execution drug expiration. 
‘Violent’ moment during Indiana execution draws scrutiny; DOC officials deny ‘botched’ process

Current Indiana law only allows lethal injection as a means of execution. The one-drug method is a departure from the state’s protocol used since 1995, involving a series of three chemicals.
But with ongoing drug shortages and increasing legal and political complications, some states have revived older execution methods — or approved new ones.
South Carolina recently reinstated the firing squad as an option after years of delays due to its inability to obtain lethal injection drugs. The state has so far carried out two executions by firing squad in 2025 — the first in the U.S. in 15 years.
According to the Death Penalty Information Center, prior to South Carolina’s move only three executions by firing squad had taken place nationwide since 1977 — all in Utah.
It’s expected to be the primary method for executions in Idaho starting in 2026. Mississippi and Oklahoma also permit firing squads, but only as a secondary method to lethal injection.
Braun pointed to South Carolina, specifically, but he didn’t endorse any specific execution method.
Nine states permit executions by lethal gas, but only five — Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Oklahoma — specifically autho­rize death by nitro­gen hypox­ia, a process that deprives inmates of oxygen using nitrogen gas. 
So far, Alabama and Louisiana are the only states that have per­formed exe­cu­tions by nitrogen gas, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.
Arizona and Mississippi additionally allow gas chambers, a method in which inmates are exposed to a lethal gas — traditionally hydrogen cyanide — inside a sealed chamber. The process can take several minutes, however, and has drawn criticism over the risk of prolonged suffering.
Lawmakers could reexamine Indiana’s death penalty
Earlier this year, some Indiana lawmakers — from both sides of the aisle — questioned the future of capital punishment in the state.
Rep. Bob Morris, R-Fort Wayne, filed House Bill 1030, which sought to abolish the death penalty altogether in Indiana and replace it with life without parole. He later discussed plans to scale back the bill — and instead focus on execution drug rules and witness guidelines — hoping that a narrowed proposal could give it a better chance at advancing through the legislative process.



Despite some bipartisan support, Morris’ bill never received a committee hearing in the House, effectively killing the measure.
Separately, an amendment Morris offered on another bill sought to require that Indiana State Police test pentobarbital between 12 and 24 hours before an execution to ensure the substance is “100% effective” before it’s administered. But that proposal never moved, either.
Other Republican and Democratic lawmakers have previously suggested narrowing the list of crimes eligible for execution or mandating that any new methods meet constitutional and ethical standards.
No one has been added to death row in Indiana since 2013 as many prosecutors choose life in prison without parole over the cost of a death penalty trial.
The next opportunity for lawmakers to file and debate bills is during next year’s legislative session, slated to begin in January 2026.
The last person executed in Indiana before Corcoran was Eric Wrinkles in 2009. Six inmates currently remain on Indiana’s death row, and more than a dozen capital punishment cases are still pending statewide.

Clark County District Judge Nadia Krall ordered the city to pay $500 as well as attorney fees incurred by MaQuade Chesley, the city’s former chief of police.
Chesley was terminated in January by then-City Manager Edward “Owen” Dickie, who initially cited a vote of no confidence by the Mesquite police union as the reason for Chesley’s firing. He later said Chesley was fired for recording a conversation, which is not illegal in Nevada. 
Mesquite residents and Chesley provided the Current with recordings they made of Dickie, in which he makes racially-charged statements regarding the hiring of the city’s next police chief. 
The council, by a vote of four to one, terminated Dickie in late April, citing the recordings.  
Councilwoman Patti Gallo noted a string of “bad decisions” by Dickie, including firing Chesley at the behest of the local police union. “It’s time for this city to start healing,” she said before making the motion to terminate Dickie.  
In March, Krall granted Chesley’s request for a restraining order and injunction, prohibiting the city from holding a public investigation into Chesley’s termination because he was not afforded rights due police officers under Nevada law.
The city council ignored the order and ratified Chesley’s termination in March. Chesley then filed a motion for the city to show cause as to why it violated the order. 
Krall, in her order Tuesday, noted the city had more than a month to respond, but failed to file an opposition.
The City of Mesquite, “notwithstanding the Court’s clear and unambiguous order, willfully disobeyed and violated the Court’s order by calling and holding this prohibited agenda item,” Krall wrote, adding the city “tried to relabel” the agenda item “in an attempt to flout and circumvent the Court’s order.”
The city took the action even though two council members stated that hearing the item would violate Krall’s order, the judge wrote. 
Krall called the city’s subsequent effort to lodge a criminal allegation against Chesley “a bad faith attempt to harass” him and relieve the city of its legal obligations regarding terminating police officers under Nevada law. “This is part of an ongoing pattern of bad faith defenses” by the city, Krall wrote.  
“I am very grateful Judge Krall saw the injustice and found them in contempt,” Chesley, who is suing the city for wrongful termination, said via text Tuesday.  
Mayor Jesse Whipple and Lee did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Last week, Branum, the city attorney, resigned hours before the city council was scheduled to review his performance.
“There is a small group of people who are upset that Joseph [MaQuade] Chesley was terminated from his position as Chief of Police,” Branum wrote in an email to city staff a week before the meeting. 
“For those of you who I have worked with, whether you think I am competent or not, I request that you provide your feedback to Council next Tuesday evening.” 
In a subsequent email, Branum told staff he could not “in good conscience” ask anyone to speak on his behalf, and would resign. “The last thing I would want is for any of you to be the next with a target on your back.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Mesquite7_SM-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-06-04 08:03:04.709942

It’s common sense that if you make something harder to access, fewer people are going to access it.
There are plenty of good reasons to prevent toddlers from eating their weight in gummy worms. 
There are no good reasons to prevent people from exercising their ability to vote.
And yet we continue to see more attempts—both nationally and here in Indiana—to chip away at the rights of lawfully eligible citizens to cast ballots for their preferred candidates.
Indiana elections chief defends voting ban on ‘unsecured’ student IDs after legal challenge

In order to understand the big picture, we have to rewind the clock to 2013, when the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a requirement that places with a history of racial discrimination in voting had to get federal approval to change their voting laws or practices.
In the years since that decision, the Brennan Center for Justice has tracked dozens of states, including Indiana, enacting a total of almost 100 restrictive laws making it harder for eligible voters to register, stay on the voter rolls or actually cast a ballot.
The latest effort here is Senate Enrolled Act 10, which bans student IDs issued by Indiana’s public colleges and universities from being used as valid identification to vote. Worth noting: 20 of the 37 states with a voter ID law on the books allow the use of some form of college student ID.
Removing student IDs from the list of acceptable voting identification puts one more roadblock in their path. Young voters already face higher barriers to participation in our democracy: They’re more likely to have recently moved, to lack access to transportation or to not yet have a driver’s license with their current address.
Proponents of these restrictions haven’t been able to produce a single case of student ID being used to commit voter fraud in Indiana.
Time to make democracy a habit
This years-long push to restrict voting access has had a negative impact. The latest attempt comes at a time when Hoosiers aren’t exactly showing up and showing out at the polls. In the 2024 general election, Indiana ranked 43rd in voter participation, with fewer than two-thirds of eligible voters casting a ballot. 
Here’s the thing: Voting is habit-forming. A 2003 Yale study found voting in one election substantially increases the likelihood of voting in the future. So if we want to improve that dismal turnout percentage, we should be doing everything we can hook young voters on democracy.
One idea lawmakers might consider is voter pre-registration, which allows 16- and 17-year-olds to sign up in advance so that when they turn 18, they’re automatically added to the voter rolls ready to cast a ballot.

In most states that offer it, pre-registered voters are listed as “pending” until they reach voting age, at which point their status switches to active without requiring any further action. By making the process easier and more accessible, we could turn first-time voters into lifelong voters.
That should be the goal. 
The conversation about voting is about so much more than Senate Enrolled Act 10, which was a solution in search of a problem from the jump. It’s about what happens when we slowly chip away at electoral freedom over time. 
It’s easy to say, “Well, it’s just one form of ID. What’s the big deal? People need to adapt.” And that’s how democracy dies by a thousand paper cuts. 
There’s bipartisan agreement that young people should be learning more about how government works, including how to get involved and the requirements to vote. To make that shared civics education vision a reality, we need to remove barriers instead of adding them. Let students use college-issued IDs to vote. Make it possible for them to pre-register at 16. Democracy should be attainable, accessible and habit-forming.

Josh Hawley, R-Missouri, speaks at a confirmation hearing for Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer. (screenshot courtesy of C-SPAN via Investigate Midwest)Despite rising child labor violations and new Senate demands to investigate the nation’s largest meat processor, the U.S. Department of Labor remains silent on whether it has the staff to conduct future probes amidst a major reduction in its workforce.
At a May 22 congressional hearing, newly appointed Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer said 2,700 department employees have taken a deferred resignation program offered to nearly all federal employees as a part of Trump administration-led staff reductions. However, she said enforcement staff with the Wage and Hour Division, who are responsible for investigating child labor, are exempt from the program.
“At the Department of Labor, our goal is to fully enforce the law and make sure that we are using the full enforcement capability of the Department of Labor to crack down if someone is knowingly breaking that law, and we will double down to do that,” Chavez-DeRemer said.

Federal agencies that enforce labor, environmental and agricultural laws have seen layoffs, budget cuts and attacks on federal workers in recent months under the Trump administration.
Jessica Looman, former administrator for the Wage and Hour Division under the Biden administration, said she worries ongoing cuts to staff and budgets will have a chilling effect on the division’s ability to carry out its work.
“Enforcing federal child labor laws is one of the most important things that the Wage and Hour Division of the U.S. Department of Labor does and it’s critical that they have the resources to be able to do that work,” Looman said in an interview with Investigate Midwest.
An excerpt from Sen. Josh Hawley’s letter to Labor Secretary Lori Chavez DeRemer, dated May 6, 2025. The letter in full is available to read below.
The Wage and Hour Division has roughly 1,400 full-time employees and a budget of $260 million as of fiscal year 2024, according to DOL budget documents and interviews with former staff. The agency has around 700 investigators tasked with enforcing federal child labor and other labor laws.
In its 2025 budget proposal under the Biden administration, the Wage and Hour Division requested 50 additional full-time employees to continue investigating child labor.
“Over the last decade, WHD enforcement capacity has decreased from more than 1,000 on-board investigators to just over 720 investigators — one of the lowest levels in fifty years,” the document states.
The DOL would not answer direct questions from Investigate Midwest about how federal budget cuts and deferred resignations have impacted the Wage and Hour Division, or how these changes would affect its ability to conduct child labor investigations.
An excerpt from DOL Acting Administrator Donald M. Harrison III’s response addressed to Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Missouri, dated May 12, 2025. The letter in full is available to read below.
The concerns over cuts to staff responsible for child labor investigations come as multiple senators are calling for more investigations into potential child labor in meatpacking plants.
This month, U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri, sent a letter to DOL Secretary Chavez-DeRemer demanding an investigation into Tyson Foods, the nation’s largest poultry processing company. Hawley said he was contacted by a whistleblower who previously worked for the company and claimed to have seen underage workers at a processing plant employed by a third-party contracting service, as well as hearing from other coworkers that underage workers were working at the facility.
“They’re using child labor, they’re using illegal immigrant labor and they’re basically participating in an illegal human trafficking ring,” Hawley said in an interview with Investigate Midwest. “This has got to stop.”

Tyson Foods is still under investigation for the use of child labor at two of its facilities in Arkansas, according to a DOL statement from March. In a letter sent to Hawley, the Department of Labor confirmed the company is under investigation for child labor, but did not detail specific facilities.
“We do not allow the employment of anyone under the age of 18 in any of our facilities, and we do not facilitate, excuse, or in any other way participate in the use of child labor by third parties,” a Tyson spokesperson said in a statement to Investigate Midwest.
Hawley and Democratic New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker reintroduced legislation in March to prevent companies with child labor violations from obtaining federal contracts and funding.
Nearly half of all child labor violations in the past two decades have come from agriculture industries, with the number of child labor violations increasing 35% in the past 10 years, according to DOL data.
While crop production accounts for most of these violations, major meatpacking companies, such as Tyson Foods, JBS USA, Perdue Farms, Cargill and Mar-Jac Poultry have been fined and investigated for violating federal child labor laws in the past decade.

In 2023, the Wage and Hour Division announced that Packers Sanitation Service, a company formerly based out of Wisconsin and now headquartered in Atlanta, employed more than 100 children – ages 13 to 17 – at 13 meatpacking plants across the country. The company was fined $1.5 million for child labor law violations.
Some worry Trump’s cuts could harm future enforcement efforts
“With cuts going on in the Trump administration, we certainly have a fear that there’s going to be even less capacity and less appetite for enforcing child labor laws,” said Todd Larson, co-executive director for environmental and labor advocacy group GreenPeace, part of a coalition working to prevent child labor in meatpacking and food processing..
While it’s unclear how child labor in the U.S. will be affected by federal cuts, international enforcement already has seen an impact.
The quasi-governmental Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, cut $240 million in funding for the Department of Labor’s International Labor Affairs Bureau in March, according to POLITICO. The office investigates global use of child labor in supply chains, as well as labor performed under human trafficking or coercion.
In a letter to the DOL, Democratic members of the House Ways and Means Subcommittee called on the agency to reinstate funding to the bureau to prevent goods made under child labor conditions from entering the country’s supply chain and competing with the U.S. labor force.
“American trade policy relies on critical federal programs working overseas to challenge unfair competition from governments that commit egregious abuses in global supply chains,” the letter states. “By eliminating these and other technical assistance projects, the Administration is surrendering an essential tool for leveling the playing field and holding our trade partners accountable.”

In many communities, these initiatives have been credited with saving lives and reducing violence.
But the Trump administration last month abruptly terminated at least 373 public safety grants from the U.S. Department of Justice’s Office of Justice Programs, pulling roughly $500 million in remaining funds across a range of programs, according to a new report by the Council on Criminal Justice, a nonprofit think tank. The cuts come just as summer is approaching — a season when violence consistently peaks.
The grants were initially valued at $820 million, but many were multiyear awards at different stages of rollout, which means some of the money has already been spent.
At least 554 organizations across 48 states are affected by the cuts, many of them small, community-based nonprofits that rely on this money. The rescinded grants supported everything from violence prevention and policing to victim advocacy, reentry services, research, and mental health and substance use treatment. Some of the grants also were cut from state and local government agencies.
Another new report from the Council on Criminal Justice dug deeper into local effects: It found that the Trump administration’s cuts also eliminated 473 minigrants — known as “subawards” — passed from primary recipients to smaller groups that often face challenges accessing federal dollars directly, such as rural government agencies and grassroots nonprofits.
About $5 million of those subawards was intended for state, local and tribal law enforcement agencies working to reduce violence in rural areas, according to the report.
Experts warn the timing couldn’t be worse. The summer months — historically linked to higher rates of violent crimes — are approaching, and the safety net in many cities is fraying. A growing body of research has found a correlation between spikes in temperature and violent crime, with studies suggesting that heat waves and sudden weather swings can inflame tensions and increase aggression.
“These programs are having to cut staff and cut services, and that will be felt in communities in states all over the country at exactly the time when they’re most needed,” said Amy Solomon, a senior fellow at the Council on Criminal Justice and the lead author of the report.
Solomon also previously served as assistant U.S. attorney general in the Biden administration, where she led the Office of Justice Programs — the Justice Department’s largest grantmaking agency.
Many of the primary grants that were terminated contained no references to race, gender or diversity-related language, according to the report — despite claims from federal officials that such criteria were driving the cuts. Primary grant recipients received their funding from the feds directly.
 ‘Wasteful grants’

U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi defended the cuts in a late April post on X, stating that the department has cut “millions of dollars in wasteful grants.” She also signaled that additional cuts may be on the way. In her post, she specifically cited grants that supported LGBTQ+ liaison services in police departments and programs providing gender-affirming care and housing for incarcerated transgender people.
The Department of Justice’s cuts come amid a broader push by the Trump administration and the newly created Department of Government Efficiency to pull funding from a range of federal programs — a move they say is aimed at reducing spending and saving taxpayer dollars.
For some groups, the sudden withdrawal of funds has meant scaling back crime victim services or pulling out of some neighborhoods altogether.
Community violence prevention groups aim to stop shootings and other forms of violence before they happen by working directly with those most at risk. Staff — often with experience in the justice system — mediate conflicts, respond to crises, and connect people to support such as counseling or job training. In some cities, they’re dispatched to high-risk areas to deescalate tensions, often before police arrive.
And research shows that community-level violence prevention programs can contribute to drops in crime.
After a historic surge in homicides in 2020, violent crime in the United States dropped in 2024 to pre-pandemic levels — or even lower — in many cities. Preliminary 2025 data suggests that the downward trend is continuing in major cities, including Baltimore, Houston, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.
But the progress hasn’t reached every community. Some neighborhoods are still grappling with high rates of gun violence and car theft.
Organizations that faced the toughest financial cuts had been funded through the U.S. Department of Justice’s Community Based Violence Intervention and Prevention Initiative — the federal government’s primary mechanism for supporting this work.
Since the program’s launch in 2022, the federal Office of Justice Programs has invested about $300 million in community violence intervention efforts and related research. But nearly half of that funding has now been wiped out, according to the Council on Criminal Justice report.
“It’s really unprecedented to see these kinds of grants cut midstream,” Solomon told Stateline. “This was an effort that had bipartisan support [in Congress] and in the field all across the country.”
 Impact on communities nationwide

In late April, Aqeela Sherrills received a letter from the federal Justice Department terminating a $3.5 million grant that supported the Community-Based Public Safety Collective. Sherrills is the co-founder and executive director of the national organization, which focuses on community-led approaches to preventing violence, including mediating conflicts, building relationships in high-risk neighborhoods and connecting people to resources such as housing, mental health care and job training.
The letter said the organization’s efforts no longer aligned with the federal Justice Department’s priorities, which include supporting “certain law enforcement operations, combatting violent crime, protecting American children, and supporting American victims of trafficking and sexual assault.”
Until the end of April, the collective had an agreement with the Justice Department to provide training and technical assistance to 95 local groups — including community groups, police departments, city and county governments, and state agencies — that had each been awarded $2 million over three years to run community violence intervention programs.
But after the department cut $3.5 million, the Community-Based Public Safety Collective was forced to lay off 20 staff members.
“Without the significant funding … it destabilizes the organizations. People’s ability to be able to provide for themselves and their family is at risk,” Sherrills said in an interview. “We’re bracing for what could potentially be a high-violence summer.”
The deepest funding cuts hit states led by both Republican and Democratic governors, including California, Florida, Illinois, Kentucky, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Virginia and Washington.
About $145 million in violence intervention funding was rescinded overall, along with an additional $8.6 million for related research and evaluation efforts, according to the Council on Criminal Justice report.
Some of the canceled grants funded studies and research on forensics, policing, corrections issues and behavioral health. Now, those projects may be left unfinished.
Some of the largest losses hit intermediary organizations, such as the Community-Based Public Safety Collective, that support smaller programs by providing microgrants, training and technical assistance.
For organizations such as the Newark Community Street Team in New Jersey, the loss of federal funding has left some areas of the city without coverage.
The funding had allowed staff to monitor neighborhoods and engage directly with community members to prevent violence. That included weekly community walks, where team members connected with victims of crime and people who may have witnessed violence, linking them to resources such as counseling or legal aid. The team also operates a hotline where residents can report crimes or alert staff to tensions that might escalate — allowing the team to step in before violence occurred.
Some of the lost funding also supported school-based initiatives, where mediators helped students resolve conflicts before they escalated into fights or other forms of violence.
Of the 15 Newark positions affected by the cuts, four employees were reassigned to other departments; the others were let go. Some of the team’s staff members are formerly incarcerated, a vital trait that helps them connect with residents and build trust in communities that are often wary of traditional law enforcement.
“We just have to continue working and serving our community the best we can,” said Rey Chavis, the executive director of the street team.
That work appears to be contributing to a decrease in the community’s crime rates.
City crime data from Jan. 1 to April 30, 2025, shows a significant drop in violent crime in Newark compared with the same period in 2024. The total number of violent crimes reported to police fell by 49%, driven largely by a 68% decrease in robberies, according to Stateline’s analysis of the data. Homicides dropped by 53%, while aggravated assaults declined by 43%. Rapes dropped slightly by 3%.

(2023 file photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)While providers, their supporters and Democratic lawmakers are pressing for a substantial continuing direct state investment in Wisconsin’s child care sector, Republicans in the Legislature are pursuing another route: expanding a child care tax credit for employers.
So far, child care providers and some small business owners aren’t interested.
The legislation circulated in draft form in early May. On Friday, May 30, it was formally introduced in the Assembly (AB 283) and the state Senate (SB 291).
“We really think it’s an important opportunity to reward employers for getting involved in child care,” Neil Kline, who says he encouraged GOP lawmakers to draft the tax credit legislation, told the Examiner.
Kline is executive director of Family Friendly Workplaces, a nonprofit based in Woodville that works with businesses in Burnett, Pierce, Polk and St. Croix counties. The organization certifies employers as family-friendly “to support their recruitment and retention efforts,” Kline said. To that end, one of its missions is focusing on workforce-related problems such as housing and child care access.
In early May Sen. Howard Marklein (R-Spring Green) and Rep. Karen Hurd (R-Withee) circulated the proposed bill seeking cosponsors.
The legislation was written “to encourage more businesses to invest in child care in their communities,” Marklein and Hurd wrote in their May 12 cosponsor memo. “These changes will increase the number of available child care slots and provide more options for families.”
Demanding direct support
The legislation has been introduced while child care providers and Democrats are continuing their campaigns to revive direct support for the child care sector.
During the COVID-19 pandemic the Evers administration used federal pandemic relief funds to pay child care providers monthly stipends through the Child Care Counts program. The $20 million a month that the state doled out helped providers stabilize child care, increasing workers’ pay while keeping care more affordable for families.
When Evers tried to use $360 million from the 2023-25 budget to continue Child Care Counts with state money, none of the Legislature’s Republican majority got behind the measure. The governor was later able to reallocate other federal dollars to fund Child Care Counts through June 2025, but at half the original amount: $10 million a month.

With lawmakers now writing the 2025-27 budget, Evers, child care providers and their advocates have been campaigning for $480 million to continue the program for the next two years. A survey commissioned by the state and conducted by the University of Wisconsin Institute for Research on Poverty forecast closures and tuition hikes if the state payments end.  
At their very first budget vote, however, Republicans on the Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee removed the proposal along with more than 600 other items Evers had included in his budget draft. The GOP outnumbers the Democrats 3 to 1 on the committee.
Democratic lawmakers responded by circulating a draft stand-alone bill to reinstate the Evers proposal.
“Child care providers are facing increasing cost to operate while still making poverty-level wages,” said Sen. Sarah Keyeski (D-Lodi) at a May 22 press conference to announce the Democrats’ bill. “This has made it extremely difficult to hire and retain quality staff. [Meanwhile] providers desperately want to avoid rising costs and rates on families already struggling to afford child care.”
Child care as business investment
As yet no Republican lawmakers have gotten behind the Child Care Counts proposal.
Instead, the bills that Marklein and Hurd have introduced would make changes to the Business Development Tax Credit, which is provided through the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation (WEDC).
That tax credit is granted to reward a variety of business investments and reduces the state income tax that a business pays by the amount of the credit.
Currently, a business that spends money on starting a child care program for its employees can get up to 15% of that cost taken off its tax bill. The credit applies only to capital investments, however — building or remodeling the child care facility.

“Unfortunately, we have heard that the current program parameters limit the incentive for businesses to invest in child care programs,” Marklein and Hurd wrote in their co-sponsor memo. “While many businesses may want to provide child care as a benefit to employees, the current credit limitations reduce the incentive for this investment.”
In addition to capital expenditures, the draft bill would extend the tax credit to cover 15% of several other costs:

An employer’s spending on child care program operations;
Spending to reimburse employees for their child care expenses;
Spending to buy or reserve openings for its employees at a child care center;
Contributions an employer makes to an employee’s flexible spending account for dependent care.

The draft bill also allows the tax credit for “any other cost or expense incurred due to a benefit provided by an employer to facilitate the provision or utilization by employees of child care services.”
The tax credit would be refundable: Even if the credit totals more than the employer pays in taxes, the company would get its full value back from the Wisconsin Department of Revenue. 
It also would give a refund to nonprofit employers, which don’t pay taxes.
“While not a silver bullet, these changes are another step in the right direction to address the child care issue in Wisconsin,” Marklein and Hurd wrote in their memo.
  Neil Kline (Family Friendly Workplaces photo)
Kline, the Family Friendly Workplaces director, said the proposal would help engage employers more directly in addressing child care shortages.
“We really think it lays the groundwork for ongoing, self-sustaining support of child care in Wisconsin,” he said. “The primary goal is to help introduce new money into the child care — really, the child care ecosystem — by rewarding employers to support the ongoing expenses of child care, because the reality is that the sector needs additional money in it.”
Kline said he understands that “the ongoing operational economics” is a central problem for the child care sector. “That’s why we are so focused on helping employers find avenues and be rewarded for helping defray the expenses that are related to child care and helping support that ongoing operational side of child care.”
Chilly reception
To date the existing child care employer tax credit hasn’t had any takers, according to the WEDC. In January, as part of an overall evaluation of the state’s business development tax credit, an outside consultant told WEDC that “due to the high operational costs of childcare centers, affordability would likely be better achieved through subsidy as opposed to a tax incentive.”
The proposal to expand the tax credit isn’t gaining traction with providers or small business owners.
Main Street Alliance, which organizes small business owners to advocate for state and national legislation, has already announced objections to the bill.
  Shawn Phetteplace, Main Street Alliance
“These kinds of programs and tax credits are often advantageous for employers who can afford compliance and the procedural costs and have economies of scale,” said Shawn Phetteplace, MSA’s national campaign director. That leaves out the typical small business, said Phetteplace, who sent lawmakers a memo calling the proposal “deeply unserious.”
Evan Dannells, a chef and owner of two Madison restaurants, questioned how a relatively small business like his would benefit from the tax credit.
Of his eight full-time employees, one has two children. Most of the others are graduate students. Directly paying for the one employee’s child care, even if receiving a tax credit, doesn’t feel fair to the others who don’t have that expense, Dannells said.
“If you put the onus of taking care of child care on the employer, the employer won’t hire people with children,” he said.
Dannells considers the cost of child care a legitimate use of his tax dollars. “This is why government should be doing this,” he said. He observed that children are required to go to school when they reach the age of first grade. “Why can’t we take care of them from age 1 to 5?”
While the tax credit may make it easier for a particular company’s employees to afford child care thanks to the employer’s support, skeptics of the proposal say that assistance only helps some people — not the system as a whole.
“That doesn’t help keep the doors open,” said Heather Murray, who operates a child care center in Waunakee. “We’re hitting crisis mode and centers are shutting down now, and a quarter of them will be gone if [Child Care Counts] isn’t renewed. We need the investment to go directly to providers to make sure that the doors stay open.”
Child care as a public good
National child care analyst Eliot Haspel is also skeptical. Haspel is a fellow at Capita, a think tank that works in the area of family policy. In February 2024, the think tank New America published his report raising questions about the impact of various employer-sponsored child care benefits.
  Eliot Haspel (Capita.org photo)
Haspel views child care as a public good that benefits society broadly. For that reason, he contends, it should serve families regardless of whether they work for an employer able to fund a child care benefit.
“Small business will never be able to offer a really robust child care workplace benefit,” Haspel says. That puts small businesses and small business employees at a disadvantage if supporting child care is primarily an employer’s responsibility, he argues.
The large number of low-wage workers and “gig workers” “also raises the specter of increasing inequalities,” he writes in the New America report.
Haspel says that tying child care to a job also locks people into a job — or strands them from needed care if they lose their job. It also disrupts children’s early education at a time when they need consistent and reliable connections with their caregivers, advocates say.
“It’s really bad for workers and it’s really bad for kids for your child care to be tied to your employment,” Sen. Kelda Roys said at the Democrats’ May 22 press conference.
Tying health insurance to employment has been “a disaster,” Roys said. Health care is “rationed based on the job that you have or the wealth that you have,” she added, “and we do not want to exacerbate the current problems in our child care system by tying it to people’s employment.”
In his New America report and in an interview, Haspel says the problem isn’t providing child care at the workplace.
“I’m not against the idea of onsite child care — that can make all the sense in the world,” he says. “You can have an onsite center as part of a publicly funded system” — one to which employers contribute as taxpayers.
Focusing on the employer, however, carries with it “an opportunity cost,” Haspel says. “The more we say child care should be solved primarily through employers, the harder it is to say we need a fully public system that is universal and reaches everyone.”

(Photo courtesy of Yellowstone National Park)EDITOR’S NOTE: This is the first installment of Howl, a five-part written series and podcast season brought you in partnership between the Idaho Capital Sun, States Newsroom and Boise State Public Radio. 
The helicopter was flying low above a remote snow-covered mountain ridge outside Hinton, Alberta, Canada, when pilot Clay Wilson jumped the wolves and gave chase.
Carter Niemeyer picked the tranquilizer gun off his lap and sighted through the opening where the helicopter’s passenger side door had been removed especially for the mission.
Less than 50 feet below, a 9-month-old wolf pup broke into a run, bounding through the December snowpack.
His coat was the color of coal.
Even though the pup wasn’t yet a year old, he weighed 83 pounds and had developed a thick coat that would help him endure his first winter in the mountains.
The chopper made a pass at the wolf and doubled back, but Niemeyer wasn’t close enough to fire a dart loaded with tranquilizer drugs.
After essentially killing off all wolves in the U.S. Rocky Mountains by the 1930s, the United States government sent Niemeyer and a small team to Canada just over 30 years ago to sedate, catch, study and reintroduce wolves to the American West, where wolves were a native species. 

Wilson and Niemeyer had never flown together before this flight took off in December 1994.
Niemeyer was an experienced government trapper and wildlife biologist with a United States government agency called Animal Damage Control (which later changed its name to USDA Wildlife Services), but he had never been to Hinton and didn’t know his way around Alberta’s Northern Rockies.
To make matters worse, the local tranquilizer gunners the government hired for the mission hadn’t shown up yet.   
Niemeyer was supposed to be on the ground, carrying wolves out of the snow to a safe spot to land the helicopter after the wolves were darted from the air.
“I was mostly mugging,” Niemeyer said. “The mugger is the guy who you dump out in snow 20 feet deep. And you roll and crawl and drag yourself through this ungodly deep snow, sometimes where just the little tops of the pine trees were sticking out, because the wolves get darted in there and you can’t land (a helicopter). It’s too dangerous, between snags and deep snow that could collapse. So the mugger, you’ve got to get that wolf out of that deep snow situation, down the slope and try and drag them to river ice, somewhere where you’ve got a footing, where the helicopter can land securely.” 
An average adult male wolf weighs about 100 pounds.
The largest wolf caught for wolf reintroduction in 1995 and 1996 weighed 135 pounds, Niemeyer said. 
“And, yeah, talk about a workout,” Niemeyer said. “Sometimes it was something else.”
 Capturing wolves in Canada to release them into Yellowstone, Frank Church wilderness 

The reason Niemeyer was in Hinton is because the U.S. government decided to bring back wolves after a decades-long extermination campaign.
The controversial plan called for Niemeyer and the reintroduction team to capture gray wolves from Canada and release them in Yellowstone National Park and the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness in Idaho. 
And the only way to do so was by hand.



But when Niemeyer showed up to Canada searching for wolves to bring back to the Lower 48, he found the local trappers who were supposed to be capturing live wolves for collaring and medical exams had grown distrustful of the American government.
Instead of caring for live wolves, the local trappers were killing them.
“The guys were killing them, skinning them and putting them on stretching boards and then I got up there and met them, and we had a confrontation, me and them, and they told me (to) take my truck and get the hell out of town,” Niemeyer said.
An already tense situation in Canada came to a head when a local trapper hauled in two dead wolves and threw them at Niemeyer’s feet. 
Standing 6 feet, 6 inches tall and fond of wearing a mustache and a fur trappers hat, Niemeyer wasn’t one to back down from a challenge. 
Since he was a boy following in his father’s footsteps, Niemeyer had trapped, skinned or taxidermied just about every predator and varmint in the West. 
It started with pocket gophers – 10 cents a head.
That night he ended up squaring off with a local trapper in a drunken wolf skinning competition inside the man’s cabin. 
It had been about 60 years since the wolves’ howl fell silent across the U.S. Rocky Mountains. 
If wolves were going to make a comeback, things were off to a bad start.
 Wolves driven out of the Rocky Mountains 

Wolves are a keystone species of apex predators that ranged from the Arctic, down through the Rocky Mountains and plains of the United States and into Mexico for thousands of years.
There used to be tens of thousands of wolves in the U.S. Rocky Mountains.




But thanks to government bounties meant to encourage westward expansion, settlers used trapping and widespread poisoning to kill off virtually every wolf in the American West by the 1930s.
Between 1914 and 1926, at least 136 wolves were killed in Yellowstone, including two wolf pups killed in 1926 near a geologic feature named Soda Butte.
Yellowstone National Park reports that the last wolf pack in the park was killed in 1926. 
It wasn’t hunters or poachers who killed off the last Yellowstone wolves.
It was park rangers.
Congress had put up $125,000 to remove wolves and other predators from public lands, and it worked. 
The Idaho Department of Fish and Game says the last wolf in Idaho was believed to have been killed in the 1930s.
Wolves survived in Alaska, Canada and Minnesota but they were functionally extinct in the Western U.S.
Then things began to change for wolves in 1974, slowly at first.
Four subspecies of gray wolves, including the gray wolf of the Northern Rocky Mountains, were listed under the Endangered Species Act, which had just been signed into law the year before by President Richard Nixon.
Dozens of conservation groups, nonprofit organizations, biologists, veterinarians and members of the public pushed to save and restore wolves.
Meanwhile ranchers, hunters, politicians across Idaho, Montana and Wyoming and countless residents of small rural communities pushed just as hard in the opposite direction. 
By 1980, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Northern Rocky Mountain Wolf Recovery plan recommended reintroducing wolves to Central Idaho and Yellowstone National Park.
As the federal government set wolf reintroduction in motion, hunters and ranchers vehemently opposed the plan. They warned of conflicts between humans, wolves and livestock.

 ‘Wolf ground zero’: How wolves and livestock can collide in the West 

Ranchers said the loss of livestock like sheep and cattle would threaten to wipe out generations-old family businesses. 
They were already struggling with the thinnest of margins and facing uncertainties like drought.
They didn’t need wolves eating their livestock.
“We have family stories from my grandfather and great grandfather about the first generation of wolves and how they warned us about keeping them away from our livestock, and how important it was to not have livestock interactions with wolves,” said Jay Smith, owner of J Lazy S Angus Ranch in Carmen, Idaho. “So we have that long, long family history of knowledge on top of our own.”
Smith is a fourth-generation rancher. His ancestors first bought a ranch on Carmen Creek in 1924.

His own ranch is located a few ridges over from Corn Creek in the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness – the original site of wolf reintroduction in Idaho in 1995.
Smith calls the area “wolf ground zero.” 
From the ranch, Smith can gaze across the valley and see the Diamond Moose grazing allotment. It was one of the first – and remains one of the most consistent – sites of conflict between wolves and livestock, Smith said.
“There’s no rhyme or reason,” Smith said. “You know, in 30 years, we never know what to expect. One year we’ll lose 20 head of cattle, and one year we’ll lose zero. And we just never quite know how to explain or how to do better, or how to mitigate that risk.”  
 Tense public meetings showed just how controversial wolf reintroduction was, not just to the West, but to the world 

Ranchers weren’t the only ones worried about wolf reintroduction. 
Hunters warned the return of wolves would lead to the decimation of elk herds, which would threaten a way of life for generations of passionate hunters.
A series of heated wolf reintroduction public meetings played out in cities and small towns across Idaho, Wyoming and Montana in the 1990s. 
Yellowstone National Park staff reported that over about 2.5 years, the team developing the environmental impact state conducted more than 130 meetings and considered more than 160,000 public comments, which came in from all 50 states and 40 foreign countries.


Upcoming Howl schedule

Wednesday, June 11: River of No Return: How the Nez Perce Tribe stepped in to save wolf reintroduction in Idaho. After the Idaho Legislature nearly derailed the entire operation, the tribe faced racist questions on whether it was capable of repopulating the Lower 48.
Wednesday, June 18: Fixing Yellowstone: How an intact ecosystem set the stage for a wolf queen’s long reign. Despite being orphaned and repeatedly challenged for alpha status and ultimately being killed by a rival pack, Wolf 907 leaves a long legacy.
Wednesday, June 25: Cattle Battle: How wolves and livestock collide – and how one Idaho project offers solutions. Western ranchers say their livelihood is at stake after wolves were reintroduced into the Lower 48 30 years ago.
Wednesday, July 2: Ghost Wolves: While wolves might represent nature’s greatest comeback, some longtime advocates say they aren’t seeing wolves in the same places they always used to after the Idaho Legislature expanded wolf hunting and trapping in the state. Some scientists have openly questioned how the state tracks and counts wolves, and some original members of the wolf reintroduction team worry 30 years of hard work to bring wolves back could be undone.



Several people in the room during those meetings described increasingly tense hearings, where emotion and fear trumped science and reason.  
“Working with wolves all the years I did before coming here, you can’t underestimate human hatred of wolves,” said Doug Smith, a biologist who led wolf reintroduction and monitoring in Yellowstone for nearly 30 years until he retired in 2022. “I mean reason, compromise, facts, science doesn’t even dent people’s attitudes about (wolves).”
“Prior to wolves being listed as an endangered species, they weren’t just killed, they were tortured,” Smith continued. “People cut their lower jaws off and set them free, and they died that way. They would wire their jaws shut. They would take nails or razor blades and put it in hunks of meat… So they’d swallow the razor blades and nails. This is human hatred.”
Some wolf meetings ended in screaming matches.
But in 1994, former Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt authorized the reintroduction of wolves into Yellowstone National Park and Central Idaho.
“It was a long slog,” Smith said. “Wolves were listed in 1974, so it was a 20 year process to get wolves back.”
After it became clear wolf reintroduction was going to happen, Doug Smith landed his dream job in 1994 – becoming a wolf project biologist at Yellowstone National Park. There were no wolves there yet, but he was there to lay the groundwork for reintroduction.
Within two years, Smith was named leader of the Yellowstone Wolf Project.
“If you’d studied wolves at all, or carnivores at all, it was the biggest opportunity in decades to come along,” Smith said. “I mean, wolves are eradicated from Yellowstone by the government. The government decides to restore them. It’s the largest intact temperate zone ecosystem in the world, and the government’s going to undertake wolf reintroduction – as controversial a thing as you can get.” 
 Howling for wolves – and a wake up call 

Babbitt’s authorization to reintroduce wolves didn’t ease the tension.
A few weeks before wolf reintroduction, Suzanne Asha Stone and a team of researchers were surveying the land where the wolves would be reintroduced in Idaho’s Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness. 
Stone is the co-founder of the International Wildlife Coexistence Network. At the time, she was an intern working for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and a member of the wolf reintroduction team.
After landing a small plane on a wilderness airstrip, the researchers received a report of a wolf sighting in an area called Bear Valley, just outside of the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness.
“Dr. (Steven) Fritz was teaching me how to howl for wolves,” Stone said. “That’s how we used to look for wolves before there were more of the digital type recordings that you would play for them. You just go out and do some howling. And so he was teaching me how to do that. And it was my first time to go solo.”
“We were on a Forest Service road out in the backcountry on the national forest and I got to my second howl, and we had rifle bullets just zing right over the top of our heads,” Stone said.
Nobody was hurt, and Stone still doesn’t know if the shooters knew people were in the area.
But the episode served as a wakeup call, a visceral reminder of how deep wolf hatred ran for some.

By the time Stone and the reintroduction team arrived in Salmon to prepare to reintroduce wolves in Idaho, Stone was concerned for the team’s safety and worried about the potential for violence.
Members of the reintroduction team began to travel with an armed guard.
“We’d already received death threats in town from people’s signs,” Stone said. “They were handwritten. And it said, ‘kill all the wolves and all the people who brought them here.’”
  ‘Carter’s Hope’: How one man and one wolf made the West a little more wild  

Babbitt’s signature cleared the way for Carter Niemeyer and the reintroduction team to head to Hinton in November 1994. 
And that brings us back to that alcohol-fueled wolf-skinning competition.
Niemeyer, refusing to blink, won the competition with the local trappers and earned their respect. That’s when the capture and reintroduction mission finally got off the ground. 
With his credibility firmly established, Niemeyer got in touch with Clay Wilson, a helicopter pilot out of Cranbrook, British Columbia. 
Niemeyer and Wilson hoped to search for wolves by air, dart them with tranquilizers fired from the helicopter and then fit the wolves with radio collars. 
Once the captured wolves were temporarily released again, the radio collars would help the reintroduction team track the wolves to the location of the larger pack.
But the gunners hired for the operation hadn’t arrived yet.
Wilson decided to take a test flight and invited Niemeyer. 
Niemeyer was a seasoned hunter and government trapper who had experience using sedative drugs like telazol and ketamine.
But he did not know the area or have any leads on local wolves.
“When the pilots got there they go, ‘So do we have anybody who knows how to gun that could go ride with us to go dart a wolf?’” Niemeyer said. “And I was the only one.”
The team took two helicopters up.
Wilson and Niemeyer eventually spotted a group of three or four wolves, including that 9-month-old male pup with the thick black winter coat.
After several passes, Wilson flew in low and Niemeyer finally fired at the running pup.
The dart struck the wolf on one its front paws – just barely.
Wilson landed the helicopter, and Niemeyer sprang after the young wolf. 
The wolf was only partially sedated, still staggering and thrashing through the snow. 
After a mad dash, Niemeyer got close enough to slip a catchpole over the wolf and administer another round of drugs to sedate it. 
It was a moment he will never forget: Niemeyer had just darted and captured the first wolf for reintroduction in America.
“I named it Carter’s Hope, because it was the first wolf we caught up in Canada by darting,” Niemeyer said. “And I was just being silly and called it Carter’s Hope. Hoping that this was the beginning of a successful project, which it turned out to be.”
Once the wolves were darted and captured, they were sent to Idaho and Yellowstone National Park, where they underwent medical examinations, were given vaccinations and tested for disease. 
During exams, the wolves were given numbered radio collars that allowed biologists or park rangers to track the wolf’s location. 
Idaho elementary school students decorated collars for each of the wolves bound for Central Idaho.
Each collar has a different number and Carter’s Hope, who was bound for Yellowstone, received collar number 15. (Niemeyer said the collars don’t have any negative effects on the wolves who wear them.)
After his capture, Carter’s Hope was flown to Montana and then driven to Yellowstone National Park in January 1995.

As the horse trailers carrying Carter’s Hope and the other wolves entered Yellowstone’s North Entrance at Gardiner, Montana, and passed under the iconic Roosevelt Arch, crowds of people lining the side of the road cheered and waved.
 A soft release into Yellowstone country 

Carter’s Hope became one of the original members of the Soda Butte Pack, one of the first three packs of wild wolves to live in Yellowstone in nearly 70 years.  
Initially, the Yellowstone wolves were kept in one-acre acclimation pens, set back from the park’s roads, as part of a so-called soft release.
“We were on the receiving team, so our job was to take care of the wolves in the pens for 10 weeks. That meant visiting them twice a week, every week, to feed them, check on them, and then release them,” Smith said.
Yellowstone staffers used horse-drawn sleds to haul animal carcasses to the pens to feed the wolves. 
  After they were captured in Canada, the wolves released in Yellowstone National Park initially stayed in acclimation pens, like this wolf pictured in Crystal Creek on Jan. 26, 1996. (Photo courtesy of Jim Peaco/Yellowstone National Park)
But outside of the temporary acclimation pens where the new wolves were first held upon reintroduction, Yellowstone National Park is wild landscape with no fences – the park boundary is an invisible line.
After the wolves were released from Yellowstone’s acclimation pens in March 1995, Carter’s Hope didn’t stay within the boundaries of Yellowstone, where rangers patrolled and poaching was almost unheard of. Wolves were still listed as an endangered species in 1995, but protecting them in the vast tracts of national forest and ranchland outside of the park would be a challenge. 
After Carter’s Hope and the Soda Butte Pack left the park in April 1995, Niemeyer and Smith worried the wolves could be at risk of poaching anytime they strayed beyond Yellowstone’s invisible boundaries.

“We’ve learned through decades of wolf research that making it illegal to kill wolves doesn’t stop people from killing them,” Smith said in an interview in the Yellowstone backcountry. “Wolves are one of those cultural lightning rods that a ton of society doesn’t care about what the rules are. They hate wolves so much they’re going to shoot them. And you know, a country like this that I’m looking out upon is broken country. It’s forested. The wolves have got a chance to get away from human killing. (But) ringing the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem is a sea of humanity, and it’s open country. And what I mean by open county is no place to hide. People jump on four wheelers. People jump in pickup trucks, and they’ll run them down… Yeah, they run them down with snowmobiles, or four wheelers. Or they get close enough where they can take a rifle shot on them when there’s no place to hide. And there’s no place to hide all around the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.”
Aside from poaching, Smith and Niemeyer worried about wildlife control officers killing wolves if the wolves killed livestock outside of the park.
It turns out, it was only a matter of time.
The first report came in December 1995 – wolves killed a dog in Fishtail, Montana.
By spring and early summer 1996, wolves had killed sheep on a ranch about 30 miles north of Yellowstone’s border.
This time, Niemeyer was able to capture Carter’s Hope and bring the wolf back to a Yellowstone acclimation pen for two more months.
While Carter’s Hope was in the pen, a young visitor took notice.

Wolf 26, a female wolf pup from the Nez Perce Pack, began hanging around the pen.
Wolf 26 was one of the wolves brought to Yellowstone from Canada during the second year of reintroduction, in 1996, Yellowstone National Park records show. 
After inching closer and closer, Wolf 26 and Carter’s Hope touched noses through the fence in the pen, Niemeyer wrote in his memoir, “Wolfer.”
No longer a part of the Soda Butte Pack, Carter’s Hope paired off with Wolf 26 after he was re-released from the pen on Sept. 27, 1996.
Along with humans, wolves are among the few mammals that form long-term pair bonds – often remaining together for life, raising pups jointly and sharing food.
Carter’s Hope and Wolf 26 stayed together and traveled throughout the southern portions of Yellowstone National Park through the end of 1996, Yellowstone records show.
Eventually the two wolves left Yellowstone, heading south to Wyoming, where Wolf 26 had five pups.
The new pack was named the Washakie Pack.
Carter’s Hope had become an alpha wolf and made history.
“He did successfully acclimate to being a wild wolf and got away from livestock, and he became the first breeding male wolf to establish a pack in the state of Wyoming,” Niemeyer said. 
 A long line of descendants – and fear for the future 

But two years after Carter’s Hope arrived in Yellowstone, ranchers reported more calves were killed near the Washakie Pack’s territory.
This time, Niemeyer couldn’t save the wolf.
Carter’s Hope was shot and killed by a USDA Wildlife Services officer in October 1997 for killing livestock outside of Yellowstone National Park, according to the Yellowstone Wolf Project’s 1998 annual report.
Although wolves were still an endangered species, animal control officers tracked and killed Carter’s Hope under rules established to reduce conflict with ranchers. 
Niemeyer still thinks killing Carter’s Hope was unnecessary.

“I was upset, and I was saddened,” Niemeyer said. “I was disappointed.”
But he also realized the place Carter’s Hope holds in history.
Carter’s Hope was one of the 66 wolves captured in Canada released in Idaho and Yellowstone National Park in 1995 and 1996.
“He made it a couple, three years, but he did have pups, and that’s a nice thing with wolves – they’re prolific animals, and some of his progeny lived to see another day,” Niemeyer said.
Today, just over 30 years later, there are an estimated 2,800 wolves in the Western United States.
Almost all of them descended from Carter’s Hope and the other 65 other wolves that a small team of biologists, veterinarians, trappers, pilots and conservationists reintroduced to America. 
Today, 30 years removed from reintroduction, Niemeyer, Stone and Smith say wolves are in danger once more. Wolves were removed from the Endangered Species List in 2011.
Now, Niemeyer, Smith and Stone worry about increased hunting and trapping and new government programs enacted in Idaho, Montana and Wyoming that are intended to reduce the wolf population. 
“I am worried about the future, because the most important thing for wolf restoration is human attitudes, and human attitudes have not changed about wolves,” Smith said. “One of my favorite sound bites when I started working in Yellowstone 30 years ago was, ‘I hope in 30 years, some of the controversy has died down, and people have gotten used to the ideas that wolves aren’t that bad.’ And that hasn’t happened at all. They are still hated as much as they were 30 years ago. They’re still a political football. They’re still controversial.”

Journalists Clark Corbin and Heath Druzin reported and wrote Howl over the course of 14 months, trekking deep into the backcountry in some of the most remote places in the Lower 48 chasing the story of America’s wildest and most controversial wildlife comeback story – wolf reintroduction.

As the state’s longest-running school prepares to shutter, students and staff will scatter to new classrooms and jobs. Many mourn the loss of an institution they say offered one-of-a-kind learning.
The post Eulogy for a school; Laramie students, staff say farewell to Lab School appeared first on WyoFile .","LARAMIE—The Lab School is a family affair for Corelle Lotzer. 
Not only did Lotzer enroll her daughter and son in the school, but she taught math here for over a decade. Her daughter, who thrived years ago as a student in the K-8 atmosphere, returned as an adult to work as a paraprofessional — just down the hall from her mom.
Because Lotzer took a year off to take care of an aging aunt, she lost tenure. So when the closure of the 138-year-old school became official this winter, she did not receive a contract with the district to continue working at one of its other schools. 
Lotzer, who was raised in Laramie, instead accepted a position at Cheyenne East High School. In early May, she was still trying to figure out the logistics involved with working in Cheyenne while her other, younger kids continue their education in Laramie. 
“It’s been tough,” Lotzer said in a second-story room in the Lab School. The shrieks and laughter of children at recess drifted in from an open window. “I would have rather stayed in Albany County.”
Lotzer is one of 11 Lab School teachers without tenure, Principal Brooke Fergon said. “That’s probably been the most difficult challenge, that our tenured teachers have been placed in other schools throughout the district, and our teachers who do not have tenure … were not initially placed in positions.”
It’s not the only pain point involved in closing a school that predates the state of Wyoming itself. Many people fought to keep the Lab School open, and the past year has been a rollercoaster of emotions for school staff, students and their families as hopes have been raised and dashed, Fergon said. The school, which sits on the University of Wyoming campus, started as an educational learning site for college students studying to be teachers. It’s beloved for its experiential and outdoor-based approach to learning and emphasis on inclusivity.

But the school’s future was thrown in doubt last summer as the university and Albany County School District 1 hit a stalemate over a lease agreement. School advocates pleaded to keep it open by some means and floated ideas that didn’t stick. The Lab School no longer served its former functions, university and district officials said, and issues from maintenance costs for the 75-year-old building to district-wide enrollment trends factored into closure talks. 
The final Hail Mary came during the Wyoming Legislature. A bipartisan bill sponsored by Laramie Democrat Chris Rothfuss would have required UW and a coordinating district to operate a K-8 public lab school. The bill passed out of the Senate, but House lawmakers killed it in February, and that was pretty much that for the Lab School. 
In the last year, Fergon said, “I think we’ve really been sitting in a place of uncertainty, just with all of the different avenues that could have kept the school going, and so that did feel kind of like a final door closing.”
And for her staff, she said, “even though we’re not happy to say goodbye to the school, and we didn’t want to see the school close, I think that having some certainty and a path forward … feels better than just sitting in limbo.”
With the school year ending Thursday, Lab School students will be saying goodbye to their classrooms and dispersing to other schools in the district. Some teachers will too, but others are starting new jobs or moving out of Laramie entirely. The school community spent the last couple of months bidding farewell, some with regret about how it ended.

“We love the school,” said Lindsey Rettler, a parent with two elementary students in Lab. Rettler was experiencing a mixture of emotions, she said in May. “Surprise, a little bit of shock, really, really sad, super disappointed and honestly, quite betrayed by those who are supposed to be leading people based on what’s best for the people.”
End of an era 
The school was established in 1887 as the Preparatory School to serve secondary education students from counties without access to high school. In 1913, it transitioned to the Training Preparatory School, used as a learning laboratory by UW’s College of Education. 
In 1999, the private school partnered with the Albany County School District to become a district public school. The Lab School then operated as a “school of choice,” meaning any district family could enter a lottery to enroll their kids.
College of Education students continued to train in its classrooms, but they also did so in classrooms across the district, state and beyond.
Historically, UW and the school district operated with a memorandum of understanding laying out terms of tenancy. Efforts to renew that MOU, however, failed to produce an updated agreement. Instead, the university announced last summer it was pursuing an extension only for the 2024-’25 school year, meaning the school would have to find a new home if it was to continue beyond that.

Among the major sticking points: whether the district or UW should pay for things like major maintenance in the aging building. UW also cited the fact that the school “no longer serves a significant role for teacher training in UW’s College of Education,” along with security challenges regarding having a school-district-operated facility located on university grounds; the Lab School’s incongruence with the state’s public funding model and the fact that the school district “has excess capacity in its existing facilities to accommodate current Lab School students.”
The Albany County School District Board of Trustees voted in December to close the Lab School after considering options to move it into another district building. Trustees expressed heartache but also a fiduciary obligation before making the decision. 
Concerned residents bemoaned the decision, and Albany County state lawmakers took notice. Sen. Rothfuss’ bill was the product of that concern. The bill brought together strange bedfellows, with co-sponsors ranging from Freedom Caucus-aligned lawmakers like Ocean Andrew to Laramie Democrat Karlee Provenza. Both serve in the Wyoming House of Representatives.
The issue raised questions about the state’s role in local education and what constitutes a situation so exceptional that lawmakers should meddle. Lab School supporters argued its unique role as a teaching laboratory and its century-plus of education history made it a place worth saving. 
“This legislation is not about saving a school,” Rep. Andrew, R-Laramie, said on the House floor on Feb. 28. “It is about protecting a legacy and educating future generations of Wyoming teachers.”

True local control reflects the wishes of the people in the community, he continued, “and in this case, the overwhelming support for keeping the Lab School open has been ignored. The people of Wyoming, the parents and the students have spoken, and they have been met with indifference by those in power.”
But others said the state should not interfere in a matter of local concern.
“This really feels like we’re being asked to micromanage a local school,” said Rep. Art Washut, R-Casper. “I don’t think this is the proper role of the state legislature.”
The body ultimately killed the measure on a 24-32 vote. 
Moving on 
With that, school staff began the work of transition, making plans with its 145 students to help them figure out transfer schools and options, Fergon said.. The school counselor even brought in a “transition curriculum” to help students navigate and cope with the stress of such significant change.
There was also a staff of roughly 20 teachers along with employees like janitors and paraprofessionals. Many say they are sad to leave a school community that felt like family. 
Some, like Fergon, are continuing to work in the district. She will be an assistant principal at another high school.

Others, like Matt Klima, hadn’t quite decided their next steps by early May. “I’m trying to figure out what I want to do when I grow up,” he joked. 
Klima moved to Laramie three years ago from Big Piney and started at Lab School in 2024, teaching middle school social studies.  
The school culture, he said “is lightning in a bottle. You don’t just transport it. This school allows me to do weird stuff.” He dressed up as a king and bossed students around when teaching about the Magna Carta, and helped take them on multi-day trips in nature. “That’s the kind of stuff you can’t do with 700 kids.”
Klima isn’t worried about himself, he said. “I’m more worried about some of my students.”
Lab was a good fit for students who don’t do well in large school populations, he and other supporters said. The small scale was well-designed for integrated and experiential learning. Older kids got to mentor younger ones in a unique way. The location on campus afforded easy access to incredible resources, they said.

Rettler’s two children have had “an amazing experience” at Lab School, she said. Rettler, who works at UW, has enjoyed the three-minute walk from her office to the school to have lunch with her children or help with reading. Since the closure became official, “We’ve definitely had a lot of tears in our household.” 
Annica Fenus is Lotzer’s daughter, the one who returned to the Lab School as a paraprofessional. Fenus fondly remembers taking ropes courses and visiting the astrology tower as a student. It was hands-on and vibrant, and a place that embraced weird kids like her, she said. “I’ve cried quite a bit over [the closure] because this school has made me who I am.”
Outside the window, the sounds of children playing started to wane. Bubbles drifted upward from the playground, disappearing one by one with a conclusive pop.

Beware of Wyoming political forces that don't mean what they say, columnist Rod Miller writes. 
The post Our new profanity appeared first on WyoFile .","Back in the day, comedian George Carlin did a scandalous routine about the “Seven Dirty Words” that shocked almost everyone. He explicated sexual terms in a way that either made you laugh or made you reach for your Bible.

Opinion

A few years prior, Lenny Bruce did an impromptu comedy set where he poked holes in racially charged words to show us how our language has the power to wound if we don’t use it with wisdom.
Both Carlin and Bruce should be required course material in any English Comp 101 or Introductory Civics classroom.
I, myself, sometimes sprinkle scatological words in my opinion pieces because quite often they are the most effective tools for the task at hand. For instance, at my former publication, I wrote a piece on Frank “Oral” Eathorne, the former GOP state chairman. In said piece, I used a street synonym for an intimate act that rhymes with “snowbob.”
The editor didn’t censor that piece and published it intact. But I received a cordial request to minimize my use of that word in future columns. I haven’t used the word @#$%&# in a column since.
Occasionally, a reader will push back against my use of the word “goddam” as an emphatic modifier. They say that is taking the Lord’s name in vain. I disagree.
To me, the only way to violate the third commandment in the Decalogue is to swear an oath using God’s name (like an oath for a political office), then to piss on that oath through official performance. Or perhaps another way is for politicians to cloak themselves in God’s name to gain worldly power. Goddamn ‘em!
That brings us to the language we use today in our civil discourse. A lot of terms that, in years past, were benign or neutral have, through political misuse, assumed a darker, more sinister semantic impact. The words are spelled the same, but the effects they have on us have changed.
These are the new dirty words, in no particular order.
“Grassroots” used to mean “of the common folks, widespread, holding the thin soil of Wyoming in place against a fierce wind.” The word has been co-opted by the Wyoming Freedom Caucus to the point that it has lost its meaning as a descriptor of the prairie landscape, and now means nothing more than an isolated patch of locoweed or larkspur in the corner of a dry pasture.
“Conservative” once denoted a political ethos exemplified by Mr. Conservative, Barry Goldwater, that emphasized fiscal restraint, individual freedom coupled with personal responsibility, reliance on the free market and a skepticism toward central government. The root meaning of the word has been bastardized by those who want to use it as a means of division, of control. “Conservative” now is less of an honest political movement, and more the team name on a bowling shirt.
“Common sense” was once self-explanatory. But, through devious misuse, it now means little more than adherence to a right-wing point of view. It seems as if everything is seen through a political lens these days, and that lens distorts our words.
“Equal” and “Equality” are mathematical expressions of equivalency, defined in the Equality State’s Constitution as “all members of the human race are equal.” Yet the term is used as a lever by both the right and the left to push us to one side of the political spectrum or the other. That, to me, is bait-and-switch semantic dishonesty and profanity.
“Freedom” and “Liberty” are the most basic of human impulses. But these words have been prostituted by the “Freedom” Caucus and Moms for “Liberty.” They are now used in political propaganda as nothing more than sweeteners for a program of authoritarian control — control over what we can read, how we can pray (or not), how we can use our bodies, what we can say, how we can vote, what our children can learn and who we can love. Goddamn the hypocrisy!
“Patriot” once described brave citizens who were willing to sacrifice their lives to resist tyranny. Those folks built our republic. Now the word is self-applied by apologists of despotism who hide behind keyboards and wouldn’t recognize true patriotism if it bit ‘em in the ass.
There are other words in our language that have similarly been hijacked by dark political forces, and their intrinsic meanings polluted by partisan hyperbole. I think you’ll recognize them when you see them.
So the next time you see this new profanity used in a politician’s press release, on a website or in a flashy mailer that shows up in your mailbox, plastered with buzzwords that appeal to base emotions, ask yourself a simple question. What does it REALLY mean?

The state’s top elected officials should listen to the people and oppose plans for a gravel pit in one of Central Wyoming’s most pristine spaces, writes guest columnists Michael Fernald and Carolyn Griffith.
The post There’s still time to stop a bad deal for Casper Mountain appeared first on WyoFile .","Stand on Casper Mountain’s north slope at dawn and you’ll hear little more than meadowlarks and a magpie’s rasp over Platte Creek. Families draw drinking water from shallow wells, kids and parents alike run dogs along dusty two-track and the mountain’s shoulder reveals first light for the 60,000 people in Casper. That Casper Mountain peace is why thousands of us chose to live and invest here. 

Opinion

Now, swap the birds for dozens of gravel trucks grinding up Coates Road six days a week — that is the stated future that Prism Logistics hopes to lock in by reapplying for sand and gravel leases on what Casper calls the “School Section.” School sections are state lands granted throughout the West at statehood to be managed for revenue production that supports schools and other public institutions. The state currently makes money through grazing fees and leasing the lands now at issue at the base of Casper Mountain. On Thursday, the State Board of Land Commissioners will decide whether to trade one of Casper’s signature landscapes for a short burst of road base and a royalty that amounts to less than $2 per student, while risking millions in long-term damage. 
The leases were granted in 2023 without even a postcard being sent to adjacent landowners or Natrona County officials. The first word came when residents witnessed test pits being dug. Within weeks, neighbors formed the Casper Mountain Preservation Alliance, gathered more than 20,000 signatures, and requested that county commissioners correct zoning in the area to “Mountain Residential 1—no mining allowed” to once again preserve fragile water resources. The commissioners agreed unanimously. Prism has since sued the county, and unless the state land board acts, the leases are on track to move forward. 
But the board now has a second chance to look before it leaps and to prove it answers to the people, not the pit. The choice is not gravel versus nothing; it is gravel versus water security, property values and the mountain that defines Casper’s southern horizon. Trust lands like this sit in every Wyoming county. How Casper Mountain and Wyoming citizens are treated will echo from Sundance to Star Valley.
Why water is the red line
 Casper Mountain’s north slope sits atop a fragile perched aquifer — rain and snowmelt seep into gravel above an impermeable shale layer, feeding shallow wells. Strip away that gravel and the water drains off the mountain instead of soaking in. Hydrologists warn that even moderate excavation can lower the water table or cause it to drain downslope faster than it can recharge. Prism’s owner says the company will drill deeper wells “if something goes wrong.” Ask homeowners what that promise is worth: A replacement well, if water can even be found, costs tens of thousands of dollars and erases the security families thought they had bought. Long-term related expenses exceed the promise of drilling a water well. 
The money is laughably small 
In theory, schools benefit from gravel royalties. Even if production reached Prism’s high-end projection of about 300,000 tons a year, royalties at 60 cents per ton would only top out near $180,000 annually, or $1.95 per Wyoming K-12 student. Wyoming’s school system spends more than $20,000 per pupil annually. One failed well can cost $30,000 to replace; damage to a hundred wells would wipe out decades of royalties in a single summer. Factor in lost property value, dust-control expenses and road repairs, and the ledger flips from black to deep red. 
A process failure the board can fix
Secretary of State Chuck Gray and Superintendent Megan Degenfelder have acknowledged that they originally approved the leases without realizing the full scope of the situation. Their openness shows how quickly the original application moved through the system and onto the consent agenda in 2023. The board now has a second chance to do what should have been done the first time: evaluate environmental risk, economic trade-offs, and community input and deny this new round of lease applications. 
Things you can do right now 
1. Reach out to your elected officials who make up the State Board of Land Commissioners: 

Gov. Mark Gordon, 307-777-7434, governor@wyo.gov 
State Auditor Kristi Racines, 307-777-7831, SAOAdmin@wyo.gov 
Superintendent of Public Instruction Megan Degenfelder, 307-777-7675, askthesuperintendent@wyo.gov 
Secretary of State Chuck Gray, 307-777-7378, SecofState@wyo.gov 
State Treasurer Curt Meier, 307-777-7408, treasurer@wyo.gov

2. Speak up. Email lands@wyo.gov with “Casper Mountain leases — public comment” and/or attend the meeting at 8 a.m. Thursday at the Wyoming Capitol Building in Cheyenne. Casper Mountain points us toward what matters: ample, clean water for our homes and leaders who listen. Make sure the land board hears that message — loud and clear — before they vote Thursday.

Brent Comstock, 29, is the CEO of the Lincoln-based marketing firm BCom, which he started a decade ago, after having thought up the idea for the business while he was in school. The District 1 seat Comstock is running for is held by Regent Tim Clare of Lincoln, who told the Lincoln Journal Star in April that he would not seek a fourth six-year term next year.

Comstock said it’s important to preserve Clare’s legacy of being principled and that he hopes to continue Clare’s ability to bring all Nebraskans to the table.
“With the current political climate and the current budget environment, I think the next decade is going to shape how future generations choose to work and live here in the state,” Comstock told the Nebraska Examiner. “All of that future depends on a strong, forward-thinking university system that brings everyone to the table and recognizes that every Nebraskan is impacted by what happens through the university system.”
Comstock said NU is the “most important public institution in the state,” from Nebraska Extension and 4-H in rural communities to degree programs across NU campuses and world-class research at the University of Nebraska Medical Center.
“I think it touches every person in Nebraska,” Comstock said.
‘Education, opportunity and progress’
Comstock, the son of a plumber and a former special education teacher, is a graduate of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He said he made his own college decision similar to other small town Nebraska kids: on finances, dreams and aspirations.
A scholarship made it more economically viable to go to school in North Carolina, Comstock said he returned home and invested in BCom, which partners with start-up companies, a bipartisan group of candidates and other causes or organizations.
Comstock’s campaign announcement included endorsements from Nebraskans, including Lincoln Mayor Leirion Gaylor Baird, community leader and philanthropist Connie Duncan, former State Sen. Matt Williams of Gothenburg (who ran for the regents in 2022) and former U.S. Sens. Bob Kerrey and Ben Nelson, who both also served Nebraska as governor.

In a statement, Gaylor Baird said Comstock “helped put Lincoln on the map” and has played a key role in shaping Lincoln’s “growing entrepreneurial ecosystem.” He lives and works in the downtown and Haymarket space in Lincoln.
“Brent understands that the success of the university and the success of Lincoln are deeply connected. He brings people together — across politics, industries and generations — to focus on what really matters: education, opportunity and progress,” Gaylor Baird said. “He’s exactly the kind of regent we need right now.”
Jeff Raikes, the former Microsoft executive and Nebraska native who co-founded the Raikes Foundation, also endorsed Comstock. The Jeffrey S. Raikes School of Computer Science and Management at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln is named after Raikes, the former CEO of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. 
Raikes said in a statement that Comstock understands that NU “is not only a world-class institution, but also a vital economic engine for our state.”
“His ability to work across sectors and across the aisle makes him exactly the kind of regent we need to lead with vision, integrity and purpose,” Raikes said.
New district boundaries
Clare ran unopposed in 2014 and 2020 and won in 2008 with 58% of the vote. New district boundaries took effect in 2021 and match those of the State Board of Education District 1, which in November elected newcomer Kristin Christensen.

Races for the education boards are officially nonpartisan, and Comstock is a registered nonpartisan, while Clare is a registered Republican and Christensen is a registered Democrat. Christensen won with 58% of the vote in a highly watched election in November, succeeding former State Board of Education member Patsy Koch Johns, a Democrat first elected in 2016.
Comstock said that while he would bring a “fresh perspective,” he also brings a decade of leadership in building a company in the Cornhusker State.
“I told people, if I were ever to seek elected office, I would want it to be in a place that we can make impact that touches as many people as possible,” Comstock said. “I think that this is the moment to do that.”
The top two vote-getters in May 2026 will advance to the November 2026 election.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Advocates for low-income and disabled Tennesseans sounded the alarm Tuesday over federal legislation that could slash an estimated $1.1 trillion over the next decade from federal safety net programs that provide food and healthcare to millions of Americans. 
The package includes a $600 billion reduction in federal Medicaid spending over 10 years, impacting TennCare, Tennessee’s program, which currently covers healthcare costs of 1.4 million people, including two of every five children in the state. 
It also includes nearly $300 million in cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), formerly known as “food stamps,” which helps more than 700,000 Tennesseans buy food. Some savings from SNAP cuts would then be used to increase farm subsidies. Both programs would establish new work requirements for adult recipients. 
Tennessee counties stand to lose a net $5.3 billion in federal help over 10 years if Congress approves the SNAP cuts even with increases in farm subsidies, one recent analysis found. 
Jeannine Carpenter, chief communications officer for the Chattanooga Area Food Bank, warned the proposed cuts to SNAP would create a surge in hunger among Tennessee families.

The food bank provided 17 million meals last year to families in southeast Tennessee and northwest Georgia, but, Carpenter noted, those efforts pale in comparison to the role SNAP plays in Tennessee. 
“For every meal we provide, SNAP provides eight,” she said. “So, if we take these benefits away, we’re talking about a food insecure population that cannot be cared for by our current charitable infrastructure.”
Speaking during a downtown Nashville news conference held outside the offices of Tennessee’s two Republican senators, Marsha Blackburn and Bill Hagerty, Carpenter urged the pair to reject the cuts and “protect the very people they were elected to protect,” she said.
Medicaid cuts in the so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill” would largely come from new work requirements for adults and imposing more paperwork requirements that are expected to disqualify recipients unable to complete them. 
The work requirements could have a narrower impact on Tennessee, which has opted not to expand Medicaid, than other states. They apply primarily to non-elderly adults without disabilities. Most TennCare enrollees are children, their parents, pregnant women, seniors and people with disabilities. 
TennCare has an uneven history for the existing paperwork process it uses to enroll and then periodically verify people enrolled in the program. One government audit found that of the more than 240,000 children cut from TennCare between 2016 and 2019, only 5% were found to be disqualified from the program. Other children lost insurance because families did not fill out paperwork correctly. 
Neither Hagerty nor Blackburn responded to requests for comment about the bill left with their offices.
The Senate is expected to take up the package already approved by House Republicans later this month. GOP supporters of the bill say it is designed to root out  “waste, fraud and abuse” from the programs.
Analysis projects SNAP cuts will far outweigh subsidy bumps in Tennessee counties
An analysis by the Environmental Working Group, which has tracked farm subsidies for over the past three decades, found that just three of Tennessee’s 95 counties would see their net funding increase even with deep cuts to SNAP: Crockett ($32 million increase), Haywood ($32 million increase), and Lake ($1.2 million increase). 
The rest would see farm subsidy bumps far outweighed by SNAP cuts.
The group examined USDA county-level farm subsidy data and federal data for SNAP by county to determine how much funding each county stands to gain or lose should SNAP funding see a $300 billion cut and farm subsidies get a $35 billion boost under the bill. 
Tennessee’s most populous counties would lose the most, with Shelby County expected to see a net $1.2 billion decrease, followed by Davidson ($500 million), Knox ($301 million), Hamilton ($283 million), and Rutherford ($167 million). 
But more rural counties will also see significant reductions in overall funding.
“We have thousands of SNAP recipients in a single county that receives support to help their families eat on a daily basis, but that will get cut so that a couple hundred (farmers), maybe, will receive a few extra thousand dollars when it comes to harvest time,” said  Jared Hayes, senior policy analyst for the Environmental Working Group. 
These particular farm subsidies have higher payouts for larger commodity harvests, Hayes said, benefiting large-scale farmers over smaller operations.
“No matter what, people are going to be losing out in every single county. It’s just who is getting the money,” he said.

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)A record number of people sought services from North Dakota domestic violence and sexual assault advocacy centers in 2024, a statewide coalition reported this week.
The statistics include more than 6,300 victims of domestic violence and nearly 1,400 victims of sexual assault, according to the North Dakota Domestic and Sexual Violence Coalition. 
That represents a 3.3% increase in reports of domestic violence over 2023 and a 5.8% increase in reports of sexual assault. Seth O’Neill, executive director for the coalition, added he believes cases of domestic violence and sexual assault continue to be underreported. About one in four women and one in nine men will experience domestic violence in their lifetime, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
“More people are being served, so that is a good thing,” said O’Neill, who oversees the coalition that includes 18 advocacy centers across the state.
We all have the power to stand up against domestic violence

The coalition received an increase in state funding in the legislative session that ended last month. The advocacy center will receive $11.7 million from the Department of Health and Human Services for the 2025-27 biennium, an increase of about $4.1 million over the previous biennium. The organization had requested $19.1 million from the Legislature.
O’Neill said some of that funding will go to increase wages for case advocates across the state. He added those frontline workers make about $21 per hour on average and some need to take additional jobs to make ends meet.
“No one is making a ton of money at this,” he said. “We’re hopeful this increase will allow people to be paid a living wage and take care of their families, but I still think we have a long way to go in that area.”
While O’Neill said the coalition is grateful for the state funding increase, he’s concerned about the potential of federal budget cuts. North Dakota’s advocacy service centers receive about 30% of their budgets from federal funds and the coalition receives about 95% of its money from federal sources, he said.
“We’re certainly reliant on federal funds,” O’Neill said. “We are in a holding pattern and we’re doing our best to apply for grants and different things, but we don’t know what the future will hold.”
Rep. Emily O’Brien, R-Grand Forks, said state lawmakers are monitoring the federal budget negotiations.
“We definitely are very cautious and thoughtful in the decision-making, and what we need to do to ensure these programs are still running because the needs are there,” said O’Brien, who served on the House Appropriations Committee. “It’s something that we have to do to make sure that those people are being served.”
In 2024, North Dakota advocacy centers secured 481 emergency orders for protection for domestic violence victims, an increase of 50 over the previous year.
O’Neill said increasing the number of protection orders for domestic violence victims is important because that means law enforcement can provide protection to the victims.
During the 2023 legislative session, O’Brien said the Legislature passed a series of laws, including House Bill 1268 and House Bill 1269, that made it easier to serve court papers for people with protective order hearings and mandated intervention programs for domestic abuse offenders.
  State Rep. Emily O’Brien, R-Grand Forks, speaks during a meeting of the Legislative Management Committee from the House Floor on Nov. 13, 2024. (Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)
“To see the work that we’ve done previously come to fruition is huge,” O’Brien said.
According to the 2024 data, 81% of North Dakota domestic violence victims were women, including 150 who were pregnant when they were assaulted. About 4,700 children were impacted by domestic violence last year.
About 38% of the total victims of sexual assault reported the incidents to law enforcement, according to the coalition.
O’Neill also said he believes the stigma around not reporting domestic and sexual violence is beginning to be chipped away.
“Our goal is to make North Dakota a place where people feel they can report these things and they will be taken seriously by law enforcement and the criminal justice system, as well as our program,” O’Neill said.
O’Brien said lawmakers focusing on providing services for victims, rehabilitation programs for offenders and preventative education for the public are long-term structures that can correct behaviors.
“We’ve started to see an improvement, but there is so much more work that needs to be done,” O’Brien said.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Tennessee’s newly-released listing of companies netting a business tax refund creates the appearance of transparency without providing the public a true picture, according to an open government advocate.
Deborah Fisher, executive director of Tennessee Coalition for Open Government, said Tuesday the information posted May 31 on the Department of Revenue website should contain more exact amounts of refunds to the 60,000 companies that received an estimated total of $1.5 billion. The lists also should remain available for more than 30 days because removal lends itself to “secrecy,” Fisher said.
When lawmakers passed the Republican-backed measure in 2024 at the request of Gov. Bill Lee, senators were loath to put out any public information. But the House demanded a modicum of openness before supporting Senate Bill 2103.










These are people threatening to sue the state, and they got $1.5 billion in refunds. Tell me who they are, tell me how much they got.


– Deborah Fisher, Tennessee Coalition for Open Government 


That included posting the names of companies that receive the refunds in categories of less than $750, between $750 and $10,000 and more than $10,000.
“To say something is above $10,000 is not transparent, because it could be $10,500 or $100,000. This covers three years of tax payments that were calculated … and it is not inconceivable that some companies might get a lot of money back,” Fisher said. “That’s why (businesses) got the legislature to change the law.”
In addition, Fisher said the governor should release the amount that Lee Company received in the refund and that any lawmaker who applied for a refund should disclose the amount. Lee has consistently said his interest in the family company was placed in a blind trust during his governorship, which will run out in late 2027.
Most proponents of the legislation said last year it was necessary because of the threat of litigation, though state officials never revealed the names of companies challenging the legality of the state’s franchise and excise tax. Others who supported the measure said it was good tax policy to slash the property tax for businesses statewide.
“Was it truly a legal threat or did they just want to give more money away to corporations who contribute to their campaign or who they’re connected with?” Fisher said.
Besides the refunds, lawmakers cut the franchise tax — which is levied on companies in amounts based on net worth of capital — by $410 million annually, a move critics say is putting a dent in revenues to the tune of $335 million so far this year.
Lawmakers and state officials argued against listing more specific information on the rebates by saying taxpayer information is confidential. Fisher, though, said if the matter had gone to court, the information would have become public record, and the public would have had a better indication of how the state’s franchise tax was faulty.

“Maybe it was cheaper to change the law,” Fisher said. “But still, these are people threatening to sue the state, and they got $1.5 billion in refunds. Tell me who they are, tell me how much they got.”
Rep. Jeremy Faison of Cosby, chairman of the House Republican Caucus, defended the law Tuesday by saying every recipient of the “significant tax cut” is listed on the state site for the public to search and save.
“I believe in transparency, and so do my fellow Republicans. That’s exactly why the House made sure the public has easy access to this information,” Faison said via text message.
Only one Republican, Rep. Gino Bulso of Brentwood, voted against the bill, and only one Democrat, Rep. Johnny Shaw of Bolivar, voted for the bill last year. Otherwise, the measure passed along party lines with supermajority Republicans supporting it.
Democratic Rep. Sam McKenzie of Knoxville said Tuesday the list doesn’t provide enough transparency and called it a “self-serving” measure “to keep the rich folks rich” and hurt working-class Tennesseans. He added that the policy enables businesses such as Lee Company to hide behind the refund ranges, even though they could have received much more than $10,000.
“It’s obvious that they’re ashamed of it. If they’re not ashamed of it, they wouldn’t allow it to sit out there for just 20 or 30 days,” McKenzie. “It’s an indictment.”
Democratic Rep. Caleb Hemmer of Nashville echoed those comments, saying the ranges of money are “worthless” as far as transparency when Fortune 500 companies are lumped in with mom-and-pop businesses.
“They didn’t want to put targets on some people’s backs, but they’re asking for pretty significant (refunds), $2 billion of tax revenue in a very odd and unique situation, and I think the more transparency the better,” Hemmer said.
Democratic lawmakers, Rep. John Ray Clemmons and Sen. Jeff Yarbro of Nashville proposed an alternative bill last year that they said would have enabled the state to avoid a lawsuit and continue to collect the business tax. Republican lawmakers declined to consider it. Yarbro’s law firm, Bass, Berry & Sims, received a refund.
Several Senate Republicans declared a conflict of interest when voting for the bill in March 2024, including Sen. Shane Reeves of Murfreesboro, CEO of TwelveStone Health Partners, which is listed as receiving a refund.
Reeves said via text message Tuesday he was “comfortable” with the reporting ranges in regard to the franchise and excise tax law and said they “seemed like a fair compromise.”

Even-steven. That was the intent of delegates from the seven basin states in 1922 when they met near Santa Fe to forge a compact governing the Colorado River.
But what exactly did they agree upon? That has become a sticking point in 2025 as states have squared off about rules governing the river in the drought-afflicted and climate-changed 21st century. The negotiations between the states, according to many accounts, have been fraught with tensions. Becky Mitchell, Colorado’s lead negotiator, delivered a peek into that dispute at a forum on May 22 in Silverthorne along the headwaters of the river.
The Colorado River Compact was a quid pro quo. California, in particular, but also Arizona, was ready to see the highs and lows of the rivers smoothed out. They, as well as Nevada, wanted a giant reservoir in Boulder Canyon in Nevada near the small town of Las Vegas, which then had a population of 2,300. Those Southwestern states couldn’t do it alone, though. They needed the federal government to build the dam later called Hoover. For that, they needed the support of Colorado and the three other upper-basin states.

Colorado, represented by Delph Carpenter, and the three other headwaters states realized that they had best reach a compromise, as they would more slowly develop the rivers. If the doctrine of prior appropriation that they had all adopted within their own states prevailed on the Colorado River, the water would be gone by the time they found need for it.
This was the foundation for Article III of the Colorado River Compact. It apportions 7.5 million acre-feet in perpetuity for the exclusive beneficial consumption by each of the two basins. On top of this 15 million acre-feet, they knew there would be water lost to evaporation, now calculated at 1.5 million acre-feet annually, plus some sort of delivery obligation to Mexico, which later turned out to be 1.5 million acre-feet.
In Santa Fe, delegates had assumed bounteous flows in the river, as had occurred in the years prior to their meeting. And so, embracing that short-term view of history, they believed the river would deliver 20 million acre-feet.

It has not done so routinely. Even when there was lots of water, during the 1990s and even before, as Eric Kuhn and John Fleck explained in their 2019 book, “Science be Dammed,” troubles ahead could be discerned. And by 1993, when the Central Arizona Project began hoisting water to Phoenix and Tucson, the river ceased absolutely to reach the ocean.
Then came the 21st century drought. Those framing the compact understood drought as a temporary affliction, not the multi-decade phenomenon now perplexing the states in the Colorado River Basin.
Nor did they contemplate a warming, drying climate called aridification. Similar to drought in effects, it is rooted in accumulating atmospheric gases. Unlike drought, it has little to no chance of breaking.
Now, faced with creating new rules governing the sharing of this river, delegates from the seven states are at odds in various ways, but perhaps none so much as in their interpretation of compact’s Article D. It says that the upper-division states “will not cause the flow of the river at Lee Ferry to be depleted below an aggregate of 75,000,000 acre-feet for any period of ten consecutive years.”
The lower division states have so far received 75 million acre-feet over every revolving 10-year period. The upper-basin states have not fully developed their apportionment, although Colorado has come close. In the last 25 years, the upper-basin states have been using 3.5 million to 4.5 million acre-feet. The lower-basin states that a decade ago were still using 10 million acre-feet have cut back their use to 7.5 million acre-feet.

Lake Powell serves as a water bank for the upper basin states. The storage in 2022 had declined to 22%, although a good snow winter in 2022-23 restored levels somewhat. Today, the two reservoirs are at a combined 34% of full.
“That means 66% empty,” said Mitchell at the forum along the Blue River in Silverthorne at a “state of the river” forum organized by the Colorado River Water Conservation District.
Mitchell, an engineer by training, has a large on-stage presence. She’s not one to mince words, sometimes straying into the colloquial. This outspokenness is more evident when she speaks exclusively to a home-town crowd. Silverthorne certainly counted as one.
Shared risk is at the heart of the dispute. Colorado and other upper-basin states want the lower-basin states to accept that the river will not always satisfy all needs.
“How do we handle drought? We know how to do that in the upper basin, and most of the people in this room know that you get less,” said Mitchell, Colorado’s representative on the Upper Colorado River Commission. “That hasn’t been the case in the lower basin.”
The two basins differ in three fundamental ways. One is the pace of development. The lower basin developed quickly. The upper basin still has not used its full allocation. From the upper-basin perspective, that does not mean that the lower-basins states should expect something beyond a 50-50 split.
“The main thing that we got from the compact was the principle of equity and the ability to develop at our own pace,” said Mitchell. “We shouldn’t be punished because we didn’t develop to a certain number. The conversation now, she added, is “what does equity look like right now?”
Another difference is that the upper basin has thousands of individual users. Sure, there are a few big ones, like Denver Water and the other Front Range transmountain water diverters who collectively draw 400,000 to 450,000 acre-feet annually across the Continental Divide. The lower basin has just a handful of diverters, and the diversions are massive.
Also different — as alluded to by Mitchell — is that the lower basin has the big reservoirs lying upstream. The largest is Mead, with a capacity of almost 29 million acre-feet, followed closely by Powell at a little more than 25 million acre-feet. Mead was created expressly to meet needs of irrigators and cities in the desert southwest.

Powell was created essentially to ensure that the upper-basin states could meet their delivery obligations. Mitchell shared a telling statistic: More water has been released from Powell in 8 of the last 10 years than has arrived into it.
Upper-basin states must live within that hydrologic reality, said Mitchell. If it’s a particularly bad snow year in the upper basin, the farms and ranches with junior water rights and even the cities can get shorted. The lower basin states? Not a problem. They always get their water — at least so far. But the two big reservoirs have together lost 50 million acre-feet of stored water.
“We’re negotiating how to move forward in a way different place than we were negotiating 20 years ago,” said Mitchell.
Upper-basin states have managed to deliver the 75 million acre-feet across 10 years that the compact specifies, but what exactly is the obligation? That has long been a gray area.
At a forum two days before Mitchell spoke in Colorado, her counterpart in Arizona, Tom Buschatzke, reiterated at a conference in Tucson that they see the compact spelling out a clear obligation of upper-basin states to deliver 75 million acre-feet plus one-half of the water obligated to Mexico.
What if the water isn’t there? That’s the crux of this dispute as the upper and lower basin states negotiate in advance of a September deadline set by the Bureau of Reclamation.
In theory, if the situation were dire enough, Colorado could stop all its post-1922 diversions to allow the water to flow downstream. But is that what those gathered in Santa Fe in the shortening days of November 1922 had in mind?
Will lawsuits toss this into the court system for resolution? That process might take decades and, if it ended up at the Supreme Court, it might not yield a nuanced outcome. Mitchell didn’t address that directly, although she did say everybody on the river wants to avoid litigation.
The situation described by Mitchell and other upper-basin proponents is perhaps analogous to a divorce settlement. The settlement may call for a 50-50 split of all earnings between the partners, but what if one becomes destitute and has no money to pool?
Upper-basin states do have reservoirs to help buffer them from short-term droughts. Altogether, however, they don’t come close to matching the capacity of Powell.
Again, from the perspective of upper-basin states, California and Nevada have a sense of entitlement. Not that the upper basin states are angelic, said Mitchell. It’s because they have no choice.
“I say we use three to four million acre-feet less than our apportionment. It varies. You know why? Because hydrology varies. And so we respond to hydrology. It’s all based on snowpack and it’s all gravity. Most of it is gravity dependent. We don’t have those two big reservoirs above us like the lower basin does. We don’t have those reservoirs to equal out the flows or allow us to overuse. We have to live with variable hydrology, and we take cuts every single year.”
Upper-basin states want a willingness in this settlement for agreement that focuses on the water supply, not the demand. “Common sense would tell you, maybe Mother Nature should drive how we operate the system.” That, she said, is the bedrock principle of the proposal from the upper division.
With plentiful snowfall, greater releases from Powell might be possible, said Mitchell, and in times of extreme duress, water from Flaming Gore and perhaps the Blue Mesa and Navajo too. She said there might be room for greater conservation measures in the upper basin states.
But there must be “real work happening down in the lower basin,” she said.

(Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator).The Louisiana Senate approved last-minute amendments to a bill that would shield the personal information of state lawmakers, statewide elected officials and public service commissioners from being shared with the public. 
In its original state, House Bill 681 by Rep. Marcus Bryant, D-New Iberia, would have added retired district attorneys, assistant district attorneys and district attorney investigators to an existing law that shields certain personal information of “protected individuals” from public disclosure. Existing law currently only lists judges, retired judges, current and retired judicial commissioners and hearing officers as protected individuals. 
Bryant’s bill passed the Senate as amended on a unanimous vote and has to return to the House for approval of those changes. The bill is scheduled for a final vote Wednesday. 
Tacking on the amendments with no opportunity for public input is troubling to government watchdogs. 
“While it’s reasonable to protect certain sensitive information about elected officials, quietly adding these provisions to a bill about district attorneys and other judicial officers, without public debate, is not the right way to do it,” Steven Procopio, president of the Public Affairs Research Council of Louisiana, said in an emailed comment. “Especially when the law threatens violators with jail time” 
The law shields home addresses, phone numbers, personal email address, Social Security numbers, driver’s license numbers, federal tax identification numbers, bank account numbers, credit or debit card numbers, license plate numbers, marital records and date of birth. 
An official’s church, the school or daycare of their child attends and the employment location of their spouse, children or dependents would also be shielded. 
The existing law creates a process for protected individuals to have their personal information taken down from public view and allows for them to sue if their request is not followed. Violators can be charged with a misdemeanor and could face jail time.

John Cavanaugh is throwing his hat into the ring Wednesday and running for Congress in Nebraska’s 2nd District.

The Omaha-based lawmaker joins one high-profile local candidate in PAC co-founder and small business owner Denise Powell, along with Mark Johnston and Evangelos Argyrakis.
The winner of the May 2026 Democratic primary will try to do what former Omaha State Sen. Tony Vargas fell short of doing so two times — becoming the first non-Republican to represent Nebraska in Congress since the late former U.S. Rep. Brad Ashford served in early 2017.
Cavanaugh said he is banking on his record “of being a leader in the Legislature” to separate himself from Powell.  He said he has a record of standing up for “working people” and protecting access to reproductive health care, something he plans to continue to do in Congress if elected. Bacon is anti-abortion in a district where a majority supports abortion rights. 
An Omaha name
The Cavanaugh name also holds weight in Omaha, as John is part of a state political dynasty. His father, in the late 1970s, held the congressional seat that he hopes to win, and his sister, State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha, serves in the statehouse with him. 
Cavanaugh’s pitch: “The country is in crisis. [We] need strong leadership to help us correct course from this chaotic president and Congress.”

The attorney and former Douglas County Public Defender points to his experience in government as a contrast to Powell’s campaign. Powell has argued people want a fresh face in political office. She said she would prioritize protecting Medicaid and Social Security, vote to ensure the federal government does its part to boost quality K-12 education and push back against the Trump administration.
The nonpartisan Cook Political Report has rated the Omaha-based 2nd District seat held by U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., as a Republican toss-up. National and state Democrats are using the recent Omaha mayoral race as evidence of growing voter “energy” against President Donald Trump and political fuel for the congressional midterms.
But the fundamentals of the district haven’t changed. It remains Nebraska’s most politically divided and diverse district, with a slight GOP tilt. The 2nd District contains Democratic-leaning Douglas County, home to Omaha, Republican-leaning slices of western Sarpy County, largely suburbs and exurbs, and rural Saunders County.
A complex district
The 2nd District voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024 and former President Joe Biden in 2020 after voting for President Donald Trump in 2016 and Mitt Romney in 2012. It backed then-U.S. Sen. Barack Obama in 2008.

Bacon has fended off Democrats in close races five times in previous years and bucked the “blue dot” voting trend in the past two presidential elections. The retired Air Force brigadier general is a reliable Republican vote on most matters. But he has again stepped into the national spotlight as one of the few House Republicans willing to criticize the Trump administration.
Bacon hasn’t announced a decision yet on whether to retire from Congress, though he said that decision would come this summer. Nebraska Democrats, who view Bacon’s seat as vulnerable with him in it or not, have multiple candidates to choose from. Republicans could have a 2nd District primary regardless of what Bacon decides.  
Former 2022 GOP gubernatorial candidate Brett Lindstrom has told people in conservative political circles that he might be interested in a bid if Bacon retires. Another candidate that has been discussed is Dan Frei, who lost a bid to challenge Bacon in the 2024 GOP primary.

Dems keep eyeing NE-02
If Cavanaugh emerges from the Democratic primary, he would be the second Democratic-aligned state senator to run against Bacon, following Vargas. 
Cavanaugh said the difference between Vargas and him is that he was born and raised in Omaha and has a “stronger record of being a leader in the Legislature.”
Bacon has already criticized Cavanaugh’s voting record early this year, saying that outside political groups would easily use it to highlight his “left-wing votes.”
Cavanaugh said the biggest motivation for him to run is that the federal government is currently populated by “people who are self-interested and self-dealing.”

“That starts with the president and includes Congress, but we saw it in the Legislature this year,” Cavanaugh said. 
Cavanaugh spent much of the most recent legislative session arguing against efforts by the  GOP-majority in the officially nonpartisan Legislature to resist ballot measures passed by Nebraska voters, including new laws requiring paid sick leave, raising the minimum wage, repealing school vouchers, and legalizing medical marijuana. 
He was often one of the Democratic-aligned lawmakers filibustering the majority’s proposed changes to what voters approved. 
“I don’t shy away from a fight, but I’m not trying to be combative with people just for the sake of being combative,” Cavanaugh said. “We need that kind of principled strength representing us in Congress.”

This year, 11 states decided not to offer the federal program, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food and Nutrition Service. All 11 non-participating states — Alaska, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Mississippi, South Carolina, Texas, Tennessee and Wyoming — are led by Republican governors.
A 12th Republican-led state, Oklahoma, will offer the program only to tribal nations.
“Recognizing the importance of ensuring children have access to nutritious meals year-round, [West Virginia] opted to participate in this federally funded initiative to combat food insecurity among its youth,” Angel Hightower, a communications specialist for the state Department of Human Services, said in a statement.
The federal program provides families with $120 in grocery benefits per each eligible school-age child during the summer.
The Department of Human Services estimates the program will benefit 165,000 children in the state this year. Most existing participants received their first benefits by June 1, Hightower said. The state will continue processing new applicants through Aug. 20.
Those with school-age children who already receive benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Medicaid or  Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) are automatically enrolled in the program.
Families are also eligible if their child attends a school that participates in the National School Lunch Program and the household makes up to 185% of the federal poverty level. For 2025, a family of four can make up to about $59,000 and be eligible for the program.

(Courtesy of CPW)It’s been a week of bad news for supporters of Colorado’s voter-mandated efforts to reintroduce gray wolves.
 
Connecting the news in Colorado to the big picture.

Colorado Parks and Wildlife officials announced Friday that agents had shot and killed wolf 2405, a yearling male belonging to the first litter of wolf pups born in the state since reintroduction, after a series of livestock attacks in Pitkin County. That news was followed Monday by CPW’s announcement of the death of a recently reintroduced wolf, 2507-BC, in northwest Colorado on May 31.
The latest confirmed death means at least five of the 15 wolves relocated from Canada in January have now died. Two of the animals traveled north into Wyoming, where wolves are largely unprotected under federal and state laws; one was killed by federal officials after livestock attacks, and the other is widely assumed to have been legally hunted — Wyoming wildlife officials have invoked a hunter confidentiality law when asked for details. The causes of death for three wolves found dead in Colorado are all under investigation by CPW and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

Roughly 20 other adult or yearling gray wolves remain alive and in the wild across the state, and advocates and CPW officials hope that an unknown number of pups born this spring can soon be confirmed and added to the total.
But for now, with a small population working to establish itself in the early stages of the program, the deaths of one-third of the individuals reintroduced this year have pushed Colorado wolves’ survival rate below a critical threshold outlined in CPW’s formal reintroduction plan.
Citing research derived from other states’ wolf management plans and the federally-led effort to restore wolves to Yellowstone National Park in the 1990s, that plan, adopted by the Colorado Parks and Wildlife Commission in 2023, anticipated that survival rates for reintroduced wolves would range between 70% and 85% in the early years of the program. Early survival rates were listed among the benchmarks CPW said it would use to measure “short-term success.”
“A survival rate of less than 70%” for reintroduced wolves within six months of release, the plan says, “would initiate protocol review.”
“An unusually large number of losses during the first year of releases or following any modification to established protocols will prompt a full review of management procedures,” the document continues. “To assure high initial post-release survival, the project may be suspended at any time until likely cause(s) of problems are identified, and acceptable solutions can be implemented to resolve the problem(s).”
CPW spokesperson Travis Duncan confirmed to Newsline Tuesday that the agency would review its procedures, but not until causes of death for the animals are established.
“Out of an abundance of caution, CPW will assess the mortalities of wolves translocated in 2025 to determine if any translocation protocols should be modified,” Duncan said. “This cannot occur until final determinations from the USFWS necropsies have been made on the cause of the mortalities.”
A decades-old benchmark
The 70% target in CPW’s plan comes from a 2015 technical report by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife assessing that state’s wolf population. The Oregon report, in turn, cited three previous studies from wildlife biologists who found that wolf populations can be sustained with mortality rates as high as 25% to 30%. Crossing that threshold, the report’s authors wrote, results in an “increased risk of conservation failure and biological extinction.”
The target also roughly aligns with benchmarks set by planners of the first-ever managed wolf reintroduction program, undertaken by the USFWS in and around Yellowstone National Park beginning in 1995. Federal officials projected that the restoration effort would be successful if overall mortality could be limited to 20% to 10% from authorized killings of wolves due to livestock conflicts and another 10% from “natural causes, accidents, or illegal killing.”
The 1990s efforts near Yellowstone met or exceeded those expectations, successfully reestablishing sustainable wolf population in two different areas ahead of the predicted schedule of three to five years. In the Yellowstone area, 24 of 31 relocated wolves survived the program’s first two calendar years, along with 19 of 23 their pups, for a total mortality rate of 20%. In a parallel effort in central Idaho, wolves fared even better. Although no pups were born within the first year of reintroduction, 30 of 35 relocated individuals survived the program’s first 20 months, a 14% mortality rate.
CPW biologists will have a better understanding of the state of reintroduction once the number of pups born in Colorado in 2025 is confirmed. The agency says it’s monitoring four “potential dens” of breeding pairs.
But it’s clear now that Colorado’s restoration effort is falling short of the successes experienced in the northern Rockies in the 1990s: Including three deaths confirmed in 2024, eight of the state’s first 25 relocated wolves have died, a mortality rate of 32% — with more than half of calendar year 2025 left to go.
The state’s plan calls for winter releases of 10 to 15 wolves annually in the program’s first three to five years, with an initial target of a stable population of at least 50 animals within the state. Without a turnaround in survival rates and pup production, however, that timeline could be in jeopardy.
“CPW is developing plans for the coming year’s translocation efforts, so Colorado’s wolf population will continue to grow, leading toward a self-sustaining population,” the agency promised in a press release this week.

Facebook’s parent company Meta locked in 20 years of nuclear power on Tuesday from Constellation Energy to help meet the tech giant’s surging energy demand for artificial intelligence and its other power-intensive computing needs.
“Securing clean, reliable energy is necessary to continue advancing our AI ambitions,” Urvi Parekh, head of global energy at Meta, said in a statement.
The agreement, which calls for Constellation to provide Meta with 1.1 gigawatts of power from its Clinton Clean Energy Center in Illinois, is the latest in a slew of deals tying large tech companies to nuclear energy.
Google signed the first corporate agreement to purchase nuclear energy from multiple small modular reactors (SMRs) developed by Kairos Power in October. Amazon anchored a $500 million investment into X-energy Reactor Co.’s research and development of SMRs and is working with Dominion Energy to advance nuclear development in Virginia.
Microsoft entered into a power purchase agreement with Constellation in September to restart the energy company’s Three Mile Island nuclear unit in Pennsylvania. The 20-year deal is slated to contribute to Microsoft’s goal of matching the power its data centers use with carbon-free energy.
Constellation’s Clinton Clean Energy Center, about 160 miles southwest of Chicago, was slated to close in 2017 after years of financial losses. But a zero-emission credit program saved the plant after legislation in Illinois provided financial support into mid-2027.
The agreement announced Tuesday with Meta takes effect in June 2027, when the state’s taxpayer credit program expires. It essentially replaces the credit program and ensures long-term operations of the plant without ratepayer support, according to Constellation.

“This partnership keeps Clinton at the forefront of clean energy while securing jobs and driving local growth,” said Illinois state Rep. Sally Turner, a Republican representing the 44th district, which includes Clinton. “It’s the kind of smart, private investment that strengthens communities without adding taxpayer burden.”
The Clinton power purchase agreement is set to preserve more than 1,000 local jobs and deliver $13.5 million in annual tax revenue, according to the Baltimore-based energy company. Bobby Wendell, an official at a unit of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, said in a statement that the agreement will deliver a “stable work environment” for workers at the plant.
The Energy Center generates enough clean electricity to power some 800,000 homes, according to Constellation. The deal with Meta will relicense and continue the operations in Clinton, while expanding its output by 30 megawatts from its current 1,121 megawatts. The financial details of the deal between Meta and Constellation were not disclosed.
The power purchase agreement comes as nuclear regains traction. Some see the energy source as an answer for the increasing power demands from data centers and AI as long as the technology can scale.
A coalition of large energy users like Amazon, Google, Dow and Meta pledged in March to triple global nuclear energy capacity by 2050. Financial institutions like Bank of America, Citi, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley also endorsed the commitment for nuclear expansion.
Constellation President and CEO Joe Dominguez said the deal with Meta ensures prior mistakes aren’t repeated by allowing a valuable energy plant to shut down as demand soars.
“Sometimes the most important part of our journey forward is to stop taking steps backwards,” Dominguez said.

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)It’s still unofficial, but with 89% of the vote in early returns there’s little doubt: Prince George’s County State’s Attorney Aisha Braveboy is likely the next county executive.
Braveboy, standing beside her parents, and sporting matching outfits with her boyfriend, Will Anderson, told a crowd of several hundred people at an election night watch party at SoBe Restaurant and Lounge in Seabrook that her victory represents unity for Maryland’s second-largest jurisdiction.
“This is the first time in a very long time that we have a united executive and legislative branch,” Braveboy, 50, said. “Everyone who has been elected to serve, we have all agreed that we are going to work together to serve you and not ourselves.”
One of the first priorities in the office, Braveboy said, is simply cleaning up the county.
“Your roadways, the trees that need to be trimmed, the hedges that need to be cut back, the grass that needs to be mowed,” she said. “I will prioritize that because this county should look as beautiful as the people in this room.”
According to election returns from the county’s special general election, as of 10:41 p.m. Tuesday night, the Democrat had received 27,505 or 89% of the votes, against her Republican opponent Jonathan White, who garnered 3,024, or 10%. There are still thousands of votes to count — more than 62,000 ballots had been cast by last Thursday in early voting — but Braveboy backers were confident declaring victory.
Among those to celebrate and congratulate Braveboy’s victory was Attorney General Anthony Brown (D), the first person to declare an early victory.
“We got a new leader in Prince George’s County,” Brown said. “We got a county executive who’s going to be focused on public safety, public education, public health and economic development opportunity. The people of Prince George’s County [have] spoken tonight.”

Some of the others to congratulate Braveboy included Del. Joseline Pena-Melnyk (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel), County Council Chair Edward Burroughs III (D) and former Del. Darryl Barnes.
A few remarks even came from one of Braveboy’s special primary election opponents, At-Large Councilmember Calvin Hawkins.
“Most of you in this room, if not all of you, supported her to be the next county executive. I was one of those that thought I should be the county executive,” Hawkins said. “Aisha Braveboy, tonight belongs to you and Prince George’s County.”
Braveboy’s Republican opponent, White, 51, a retired Air Force veteran, said in an email less than five hours before the polls closed Tuesday that he sought the executive position because “people are tired of promises that never turn into progress.”
“I understand that Prince George’s County has long been a Democratic stronghold, and I respect the history and values that many residents associate with that affiliation,” he said. “But I believe voters are ready to look beyond party labels, especially when the issues affecting our communities are getting worse, not better.”
But the voters overwhelmingly chose Braveboy to fill out the remaining two-year term of former County Executive Angela Alsobrooks, who stepped down in December to take her U.S. Senate seat.
Besides the voters, Braveboy had the state’s biggest cheerleader to back her: Gov. Wes Moore (D).
The state’s attorney won in a crowded special primary election among nine Democrats, including Hawkins, who was endorsed by Alsobrooks, and former County Executive Rushern L. Baker III, who had the endorsement of state treasurer and county resident Dereck Davis (D).
The county’s chief administrative officer, Tara H. Jackson, who has been acting county executive since Alsobrooks stepped down, chose not to seek the seat.
County Council seat
In terms of working with the County Council, three council members backed Braveboy’s candidacy: Burroughs, Vice Chair Krystal Oriadha and Councilmember Wala Blegay.
Voters in Tuesday’s special election also chose another Braveboy supporter for a council seat: former school board member Shayla Adams-Stafford, received 2,583, or 92% of the votes against GOP challenger Fred Price Jr., who received 189, or 7% of the votes in the special election for an open District 5 council seat.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Adams-Stafford will fill the seat vacated last year by Councilmember Jolene Ivey, who won an at-large seat and then briefly sought the Democratic nomination in the county executive race. She withdrew her candidacy, but still came in fourth place. By withdrawing, Ivey spared county residents the prospect of another special election for her at-large council seat.
Adams-Stafford will represent the area that includes Cheverly, Colmar Manor and Glenarden.
“We are in a challenging position when it comes to several of the large projects we were hoping would stay in the county,” Adams-Stafford said in an interview at SoBe Restaurant. “Having a unified voice, or a cohesive voice around these projects from members of the council and the county executive, I think that really helps our position when we’re looking outward to bring business here and to bring new ideas here.”
The county’s Board of Elections is scheduled to have votes certified by June 13. Swearing-in of the new county executive and new council member is scheduled for June 19, the federal holiday of Juneteenth, also observed by the state and county, when government offices will be closed.
Braveboy’s selection ends this year’s special primary and general elections that cost about $4.2 million, or $2.1 million each.
But her selection by voters won’t cost taxpayers anything because the county’s circuit court judges will select a replacement to serve out the remaining two years of her term.
One person interested in the state’s attorney position is County Councilmember Wanika Fisher (D), who worked as a prosecutor in the state’s attorney’s office in 2017 and then served as a state delegate from January 2019 to December 2022.
“You can’t live out your best dreams, or the things you want from your family or yourself or your business, without having safety and justice,” Fisher, who turns 37 this month, said in an interview Tuesday. “I really am excited to get my hands fully engaged in what that office has to do with when it comes to our criminal justice system and making sure that Prince Georgians are protected.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Aisha-Braveboy-and-parents-6-3-2025-1024x674.jpg,,,2025-06-04 06:07:29.356442

(LRC Public Information photo)A great darkness has descended upon the Democratic Party of Eastern Kentucky. All but banished from the hills and hollows they call home, Democrats are searching for a path to political relevancy that seems increasingly narrow and increasingly unlikely. 
Despite what seem to be some positives for Democrats, state Sen. Robin Webb — one of the longest serving Democrats in the Kentucky legislature — changed her party affiliation from Democrat to Republican. This comes even as  popular Democrat Andy Beshear is serving his second term as governor amid  talk that Eastern Kentuckian Rocky Adkins, a Beshear aide, could run to succeed him. Meanwhile, a bonafide Democratic challenger, Prestonsburg attorney Ned Pillersdorf, is considering a run against Republican U.S. Rep. Hal Rogers in the 5th Congressional District.
Webb is simply the latest in a long line of prominent Appalachian Democrats who have decided to join the swelling ranks of the Republican Party of Kentucky. Most of these conversions have been explained as a product of the Democratic Party no longer representing the values of the politician in question. More cynical political observers ascribe this mass exodus from the region’s ancestral party to simple self-preservation: long time politicians fearful of losing their preciously held jobs at the very heart of Trump country. 
Regardless of the reasons, these now common party switches are not a positive sign for the Democratic Party. Nor are they the only evidence that Appalachian Democrats should be worried. Despite Beshear’s relative success across Eastern Kentucky in the last gubernatorial election and the mounting number of enthusiastic liberal activists in the region, Democrats have failed to make significant headway of any kind in the region. A reality made all the more stark by Elliot County, Kentucky, breaking its 144 year support for the Democratic Party in the 2016 election for president.  
After 2024, an outside observer cannot help but conclude that all the fervor of local activities and all the efforts of a relatively popular governor do nothing to boost the chances of the Democratic Party in the Kentucky mountains. So is all hope for the Democratic Party lost in Appalachia? Is there simply no immediate future left for the party of Rocky Adkins in his native region? The short answer is “quite possibly.” Yet, as is often the case, the long answer is both more complex and more truthful. 
The long answer is that the situation is bad for Eastern Kentucky Democrats. Nor is any attempt to sugarcoat this fact with hopeful news coverage and opinion pieces likely to improve circumstances. To solve a problem requires first a frank admission of the facts as they are and not as anyone may wish them to be. From these hard realities, a solution may emerge and a path to two-party competition in the region becomes, if not likely, at least possible. 
First and foremost, Kentucky Democrats must admit that the average Appalachian voter does not trust the Democratic Party anymore. The brand has been greatly damaged and no blunder in the Trump administration is likely to provide a miracle realization among the populace that will change this fact. Voters in the region feel that the Democratic Party has abandoned them in favor of various ill fated social crusades that do little to better society and certainly have done little to solve the great troubles that plague the Appalachian mountains. 
As an obvious consequence of this, Appalachian Democrats simply must give up any and all attempts to appeal to voters through the methods and messages of the national Democratic Party. There should be no more attacks in Johnson County by the Kentucky Democratic Party chairman on Republican attempts to end deeply unpopular D.E.I. programs. Democratic officials should also acknowledge that abortion and LGBTQ issues are simply not the cross to die on in a largely conservative region. Nor should the party persist in its continued and constant veiled attacks upon a president whose popularity remains rock solid across the region. 
Instead, Democrats should focus on their historic strength in the region — the economy. They should offer solutions to the housing and jobs crises that face Eastern Kentucky. They should make “putting Eastern Kentucky back to work” and other local issues the heart of their message. As Republicans tie themselves to the newly popular national party,  they should break free from Harris and Schumer to develop a uniquely Appalachian brand of liberal economics. The social liberalism can be left to Louisville and Lexington. 
Second, Appalachian Democrats must face the reality of a changed Appalachia and party system. Union voters once formed the heart of the Democratic Party in the region. However, many of these voters feel that Democratic policies undercut their jobs and have hollowed out the unions. Whether this is true or not is beside the point; it is how voters feel and Democrats must acknowledge that older working class miners are unlikely to be the backbone of their party, though they should of course continue to angle for their support. 
Instead, Democrats should target those in the region who tend to be most skeptical of Trump and the policies of the newly constituted Republican party — public school teachers, small business owners, and the young. Though most of these groups have historically voted Republican, things are changing in this country and seizing upon this reality is to the advantage of Eastern Kentucky Democrats. 
All of this advice is not given to “save” the state from the Republican Party or because I fear the Democrats are the only avenue to creating a better commonwealth. This advice is not even offered by someone who is currently a member of the Democratic Party. Instead, I offer this frank counsel because as a citizen and political scientist, I understand that both parties are strongest when they are faced with a formidable and influential opposition. Iron sharpens iron, and two party competition creates the best sort of policy. Kentucky is very close to losing this vital check on political authority — that is, unless rural Democrats step up their game.

As budget talks heat up in Washington, Southside Richmond resident Dana Wyatt is bracing for impact. After years of waiting for a housing choice voucher — a federally-funded program that operates like a rent coupon for qualifying tenants —  she now fears she could lose it and once again become rent-burdened. 
This is because a series of White House budget requests sent to Congress in May proposes deep cuts for housing programs that Virginia has long relied on to help struggling renters, first-time homebuyers, and those who are unhoused and in need of shelter. Federal housing funds also support organizations that fight housing discrimination. 
“It’s like a smack in the face,” Wyatt said.
Even after finally receiving her voucher last year, Wyatt found it didn’t offer much “choice” at all. She said multiple landlords turned her away, highlighting what she called the irony of the program’s name.  Her case is now being investigated by Housing Opportunities Made Equal (HOME), a Richmond-based housing advocacy organization. 
She worries not just for herself, but for others who could lose critical safety nets if the federal government slashes its housing support to state and local agencies. 
That’s a concern that U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond, plans to raise with her congressional colleagues. 
If enacted, the Trump administration’s budget would eliminate or reduce funding streams from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), including Community Development Block Grants, the Fair Housing Initiative Program, and the vouchers that people like Wyatt depend on. 
The housing cuts are among other proposed changes to federal agencies like HUD, as Congress also explores cuts to Medicaid — which supports health insurance for low-income and disabled residents. The wishes from the White House are part of President Donald Trump’s plan to reduce taxes across all income levels. 
McClellan emphasized that while Trump and his Republican allies in Congress may celebrate the tax cuts for the “wealthiest few at the federal level,” states and localities will be forced to make up for lost federal funds — often by raising taxes themselves. 
“It’s all just going to flow downhill,” McClellan said. “States and localities are going to have to raise taxes.”
The budget proposals are moving on parallel tracks in Congress. While Trump’s “big beautiful bill” —  a reconciliation package that includes Medicaid cuts — has passed the House and awaits Senate deliberation, his formal request, which includes housing aid cuts, is already under review in the Senate. 
During his 2024 reelection campaign, Trump distanced himself from Project 2025, a sweeping policy blueprint published by the conservative Heritage Foundation. Still, the Foundation had praised  Trump’s first-term record and many of the current budget proposals mirror the project’s recommendations. 
Chapter 15 of the project, which focuses on housing, calls for  Congress to “consider a wholesale overhaul of HUD that contemplates devolving many HUD functions to states and localities with any remaining federal functions consolidated to other federal agencies.”
Housing Opportunities Made Equal (HOME) spokesman Lance Warren called the requests from the Trump administration a “radical reshaping of the social safety net.”
In practical terms, Warren said, it would leave localities holding the bag on “promises made” — from vouchers and downpayment assistance to homelessness services. 
“The federal government is pulling the rug out from communities like ours even as they claim to be setting the table,” he said.
 What HUD helps with in Virginia

Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond, and Virginia Housing Alliance Policy Director Isabel McClain discuss policy in McClellan’s district office in Richmond on June 2, 2025. (Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)
Nearly 200,000 homes in Virginia receive some form of support from HUD, according to an analysis from the Virginia Housing Alliance. About 50,000 of those residents use vouchers like Wyatt’s. 
Beyond programs for renters or first-time homebuyers, localities in Virginia also rely on federal funding to meet the temporary housing needs of residents.  Nearly 6,000 Virginians receive housing and support in HUD-funded shelters. In the 2024 fiscal year, HUD allocated nearly $60 million for homelessness services in Virginia, while the state contributed about $30 million.
Other streams of federal housing funding also enable housing organizations to work with vulnerable populations. Thomas Okuda Fitzpatrick, director of HOME, expressed concerns about the long-term viability of some of them.
“HOME will be around to fight the fight, but we have partners around the country that are unsure what their outcomes are going to look like,” he said. 
To offset the $550,000 cut his organization is facing, Fitzpatrick explained that HOME has scaled back some office operations to trim costs. 
Laura Dobbs, a policy director with HOME, also shared anecdotes of clients served by the organization — assistance that could be jeopardized for others like them if HUD cuts come to fruition. For instance, she explained how HOME and Commonwealth Catholic Charities advocated for an unhoused military veteran who had been denied housing vouchers. From sleeping in a tent behind a movie theater to his legal battle to obtain a voucher, he’s now celebrating a year living in his Richmond apartment, Dobbs said. 
Likewise, a Community Development Block Grant supported a fund through HOME that helped with downpayment assistance for a Black first-time home owner. Reports have indicated disparities in homeownership for people of color due to a variety of factors, including the lingering impact of historically racist housing policies. Though the individual was able to afford her monthly mortgage payments, the upfront cost required to purchase a home had been a barrier until she was able to access down payment assistance through HOME. 
This is because HOME’s Investment Partnership program both supports first-time homebuyers and  localities’ efforts to build or preserve affordable housing units. Localities also utilize Community Development Block Grants for a variety of infrastructure projects, ranging from maintaining existing public housing units to creating other types of affordable housing.
 What could happen if cuts are enacted?

While federal lawmakers like McClellan continue to push for or against the Trump administration’s proposed funding cuts, Virginia’s state lawmakers are bracing for the potential fallout. 
Last month, Gov. Glenn Youngkin carved out $900 million from Virginia’s budget surplus as a “cushion” for uncertainties at the federal level. Meanwhile, members of the legislature’s appropriations committees have pondered whether they will need to reconvene for a special session later this year to address federal funding shortfalls — or if those issues will dominate the 2026 legislative session.
It’s possible lawmakers will focus on how to allocate the surplus Youngking withheld during negotiations over the most recent state budget. 
A member of the House of Delegates Appropriations committee, Del. Rodney Willett, D-Henrico, is working to determine what he and his colleagues might need to address. 
“What’s troubling is that even before this potential cut was announced, we were in a housing crisis at all levels,” he added. 
Though local governments have direct influence over housing supply and affordability through tools like zoning codes and development approvals, state lawmakers from both parties have explored what levers they can pull to support or encourage local efforts. Many of those proposals, however, did not survive this legislative session — either failing in committee or falling to Youngkin’s veto pen. 
Wyatt, the Richmond resident, is flustered by the proposal from the White House but remains hopeful that her state and local officials can keep their promises to constituents like herself. 
“I just hope that everything turns out okay,” she said.

Rare is the time when a state legislator – through the power of his own personal, painful narrative – changes the minds of colleagues.
Jerrauld C. Jones, given that platform on the floor of the Virginia House of Delegates in January 1999 as he discussed the Confederate battle flag, displayed an oratory so gut-wrenching, so authentic, that he swayed opposing delegates to his side. There’s nothing I can compare it to in the General Assembly since that moment.
Jones, a 70-year-old Norfolk native and son of civil rights attorney Hilary H. Jones, died Saturday. Today, he will be memorialized. 
I don’t mean to lessen his sterling lifetime of achievements – including being among the first Black students to integrate Ingleside Elementary School in 1961.
He later earned bachelor’s and law degrees. In addition to being a state delegate from 1988 to 2002 representing the state’s 89th District anchored in his hometown, he later directed the state Department of Juvenile Justice. He then was appointed a juvenile and domestic relations court judge, and then a circuit court judge. He retired from the latter post last year because of health problems.
That moment in 1999, though, was an inflection point in his career. People across the commonwealth unfamiliar with his background and determination were introduced to him in a dramatic way.
(Full disclosure: Jones’ wife, Lyn Simmons, and son, Jay Jones, and I have long attended the same Catholic church in Norfolk. Simmons is a juvenile and domestic relations district judge, and Jay Jones is a former delegate and current Democratic candidate for state attorney general.)

I was an editorial writer at the (Newport News) Daily Press in 1999. I remember seeing television accounts of Jerrauld Jones’ speech as he explained why Virginia shouldn’t give its imprimatur by placing the Confederate flag on state license plates.
I couldn’t find footage of Jones’ impassioned comments that day; a House of Delegates official told me video archives don’t go back to 1999. News articles can’t truly capture Jones’ gripping explanation of how – for African Americans – the flag represented fear, intimidation and white supremacy.
 But those news stories will have to do:
The Sons of Confederate Veterans had wanted the flag symbol on a specialty license plate. Jones, a Norfolk Democrat and head of the legislative Black caucus, relayed his first memory of the flag to colleagues. When he was just 6, returning with other Black children and their parents from a field trip, they saw the flag being waved in a field next to a burning cross at a Ku Klux Klan rally,  The Washington Post reported.
“The fear in that bus was so great you could smell it,” said Jones. “I saw the stark fear in my mother’s face as she looked out that window. … All we could do was hope and pray that we would not be molested because of that symbol of hate and violence.”
A year later, he and his brother attempted to enroll at Ingleside Elementary School. “We not only were told, ‘Ni–er stay out, ni–er go home’ – that we would dare try to integrate their schools – but we were greeted with waving Confederate flags,” he said.
And later, he brought his point home: “And now, some want to put that symbol of pain on the cars of Virginia.”
The Post noted that when Jones rose to speak, many delegates were paying their usual scant attention to business. By the time Jones was halfway through his 20-minute teachable moment, though, “a respectful silence had settled over the room.”
The House approved by voice vote an amendment allowing the words “Sons of Confederate Veterans” on the plate, but not the logo. Jones later received hate mail, and the SCV went to federal court to restore the flag.
No matter: Jones’ courage, persuasiveness and representation of African Americans were on full display that day a little more than a quarter-century ago. That incident was a microcosm of his lifetime of leadership and service.

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer called attention to the memo from the State Budget Office Wednesday, estimating the losses anticipated for Michigan. The Republican-championed spending bill cleared the U.S. House in May, with Whitmer warning in a news release that if the bill, backed by President Donald Trump, makes it through the U.S. Senate, 42 million Americans who rely on food assistance could go hungry.
“No one should go to bed hungry in Michigan or anywhere in [the] wealthiest, most powerful country in the world,” Whitmer said in the news release Wednesday. “In Michigan, we will fight to make sure our kids and families are fed, but we need Republicans in our congressional delegation to step up for their own constituents who need SNAP and Medicaid to survive. If these cuts are signed into law, more Michiganders will go to bed with a pit in their stomach. That’s unacceptable.” 
The memo from the State Budget Office, or SBO, says it reviewed the potential impacts of the cuts with the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, or MDHHS and found that it was unlikely that the state could backfill the impacted food assistance programs without devastating education, public safety and Medicaid spending.
About 15% of Michigan’s population, or nearly 1.5 million residents, rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, which is on Congress’ chopping block, the SBO memo said. More than 59% of the state’s SNAP recipients are families with children and nearly half of state recipients are for working families.
Members of the food insecurity, religious and other equity groups joined in chorus, offering statements of condemnation for the proposed cuts to food insecurity programming in the Wednesday news release from Whitmer’s office.
The federal plan is “cruel and unconscionable”, Pastor Richard R. White III, President of the Council of Baptist Pastors of Detroit & Vicinity, said in a statement.
“These cuts will rip vital support away from countless Michiganders—children, seniors, working families, and the most vulnerable among us—at a time when they need it most. For those we serve, who already struggle to put food on the table, this is not just a policy decision—it is a moral failure,” White said in the statement. “This decision is a direct assault on the dignity and survival of millions of Americans. We call on all people of conscience to oppose these cuts and demand policies that uplift, not abandon, those most in need.” 
More than 39% of SNAP recipients have family members who are elderly or living with a disability and more than half a million of Michigan’s children receive SNAP benefits, according to the SBO.
Food pantries and food banks in Michigan will see even higher demand for nutrition assistance than what they already struggle to serve, representatives of Feeding America West Michigan and Kalamazoo Loaves and Fishes said in the governor’s news release.
“Many are already facing higher costs at the grocery store, along with the growing price of housing, childcare, and healthcare. More families will be skipping meals, falling behind on rent, and giving up other essentials to try and make ends meet,” Kalamazoo Loaves & Fishes said in a statement.

Among the most important public policy developments in North Carolina over the last several decades was the rise of one of the nation’s strongest networks of consumer advocacy nonprofits.
Together with elected leaders from both major parties, these advocates helped make North Carolina a state to avoid for predatory lenders who target consumers with high interest loans and fees and abusive collection tactics.
Indeed, the successes in this area were so numerous that following the Great Recession, they helped inspire the establishment of a federal government agency known as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
Unfortunately, as you might expect, laws and lawyers that target scammers and predators are anathema to President Trump, and he and Republicans in the U.S. House are working hard to gut or abolish the agency.
The bottom line: Last week, a coalition of activists and small business owners pleaded with Senator Thom Tillis to help protect the agency. Their simple message: stand with the people of North Carolina, not the billionaires. Let’s fervently hope he was listening.

(Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)Thursday brings a major deadline: the final day in which the House and Senate can pass remaining legislation. And Republicans in both chambers will be pushing to achieve a long-sought priority and finally approve a “parental bill of rights.” 
In past years, those votes have failed, often defeated by a handful of votes in the House. This week, the House and the Senate are considering two separate bills: House Bill 10 and Senate Bill 72. Each looks slightly different from past versions. 
Here’s what to know. 
What are the bills intended to do?
Supporters of the bills say they are meant to give parents a toolkit to assert control over their child’s education in public schools. The laws outline a number of rights the parents have over that education. 
Many of those rights already exist in law, such as the right for a parent to choose whether to send their child to a charter school, private school, or to home school them; to learn about school disciplinary procedures and class curriculum; to opt their child out of sex education courses by providing alternative instruction; to receive a report card; to review medical records; and to exempt their child from immunization with a doctor’s note or because of religious beliefs. 
Other provisions of the bills would be new. School boards would be required to develop policies to promote parental involvement in school around homework, attendance, and discipline. They would also be required to pass policies making it easy for parents to examine instructional materials and to withdraw their child from any lesson or material being taught. 
And the bills would clarify in law that “no school may infringe on the fundamental rights of a parent to direct the upbringing, education, health care, and mental health of his or her minor child.” 
But the legislation has inspired fierce pushback from teachers and LGBTQ groups, who say it puts too many burdens on teachers and staff, and that it could force them to divulge to parents details about students’ sexual orientation or gender identity against the students’ will.
Do this year’s bills require teachers to tell parents about a student’s sexual orientation or gender identity?
Unlike past attempts at a parental bill of rights, this year’s bills do not explicitly require school staff and teachers to divulge to inquiring parents details about their child’s sexual orientation or gender identity. Some bills in the past have included that explicit language, sparking opposition from LGBTQ rights groups and driving some Republicans to vote against them on the House floor. 
But this year’s versions of the legislation do include a catch-all phrase that opponents argue achieves a similar result.
Language in a floor amendment to SB 72 expected to be brought forward by House Speaker Sherman Packard Thursday provides parents the right to “inquire of the school or school personnel and promptly receive accurate, truthful, and complete disclosure regarding any and all matters related to their minor child, unless an immediate answer cannot be provided when the initial request is made.” If an immediate answer is not available, the school employee must provide one within 10 business days. 
The bill provides an exception to providing the information if there is a “compelling state interest” against doing so, and it defines that interest as “an actual and objectively reasonable belief, supported by clear and convincing evidence, that the infringement upon parental rights is necessary to prevent the child from being abused,” under the state’s abuse laws.
HB 10 includes similar language.
Republicans say the requirement is necessary to prevent teachers from withholding information from parents and to allow parents full information about their children. Democrats and LGBTQ advocates say the requirement that the disclosure “complete” could be difficult to follow, and that the standard that must be met to constitute a fear of abuse, “clear and convincing,” is too high to meet in most situations.
How would the bills affect health care services for students?
While Republicans broadly support the parental bill of rights, they have disagreed over one key area: medical care for students. 
A version of SB 72 recommended by the House Children and Family Law Committee would have included language requiring parents to consent in writing before any biometric scans are conducted by a medical provider on a child, or before any DNA or blood is drawn. That version would also give parents the right “to make health care decisions unless otherwise provided by law” and “to be physically present at any health care facility providing care.”
However, Democrats and advocates had raised concerns that the medical provisions would violate teenagers’ health care and reproductive rights by impeding their ability to receive birth control and pre- and post-natal care without getting parental permission. And House Republican leadership appears aware: The floor amendment from Packard expected to be introduced on Thursday would strike those parental medical rights from the final bill. 
Meanwhile, both of this year’s House and Senate versions of the bills include language to protect confidential conversations between children and counselors. Both bills protect school counselors, psychologists, nurses, or other health care providers from being required to disclose information about children to parents that “was reasonably expected to be privileged.” 
What could be the consequences of noncompliance for schools or teachers? 
Past parental bill of rights legislation has made teachers personally accountable for failing to follow the law, in some cases opening teachers up to litigation or potential disciplinary action by the State Board of Education against their license. But this year, the House and Senate bills do not include direct consequences for teachers.
The bills do provide that a parent who claims a violation may sue the school district for injunctive relief or for damages. 
What should be expected on Thursday?
In their current versions, the two bills up for a vote Thursday — HB 10 in the Senate and SB 72 in the House — are largely identical. Both bills include parental rights over medical care that have attracted debate. 
But Packard’s floor amendment, which removes those medical rights, would make SB 72 more moderate, and potentially more palatable for Gov. Kelly Ayotte to sign. 
Should the House Republican caucus vote to pass that floor amendment, as well as the underlying bill, SB 72 would return to the Senate, which would decide next week whether to accept the moderating changes and send the bill to Ayotte. 
But if conservative-leaning House Republicans join with Democrats to reject the floor amendment, SB 72 and HB 10 could head to the governor’s office in their most robust form yet.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/P2203005-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-04 06:07:29.356442

(Screenshot from NCGA video feed)Back in Raleigh after a weeklong break, North Carolina lawmakers gave final approval Tuesday to a bill that changes how the state oversees its investments.
House Bill 506 would create a five-person board to oversee the state’s $127 billion pension fund. It marks an expansion of a responsibility currently held solely by the state treasurer.
The House unanimously agreed to the Senate’s changes to the bill Tuesday, sending it to Gov. Josh Stein’s desk. Stein, a Democrat, has said he supports the measure; so has Treasurer Brad Briner, a Republican. It received bipartisan support from lawmakers.
Four of the five members of the board would be appointees. Two will be appointed by the heads of the House and Senate. Stein and Briner will also appoint one member each; their appointees would be subject to approval of the legislature.
Members of the board will serve staggered six-year terms. They must have “expert knowledge of investments” and a minimum decade of experience in the field.
The bill is one of multiple attempts by lawmakers to reform the state pension fund. The system has a $16 billion deficit, Briner has told lawmakers. Another bill, also backed by Briner, would allow the state to invest up to 5% of the pension fund in digital cryptocurrencies.

Utah is among several Western states seeking to reduce federal land ownership. (Photo by Utah News Dispatch)Public outcry was swift and forceful after a U.S. House committee last month hastily approved an amendment directing the federal government to sell off more than half a million acres of public land.
A few days later, lawmakers advanced the larger bill — a sweeping list of President Donald Trump’s priorities — but stripped the federal lands provision.
Yet leaders on both sides of the issue say the battle over selling off federal lands is likely just heating up.
Some conservatives in Western states have complained for decades that the feds control too much of the land within their borders. They see a long-awaited opportunity in a Trump administration that’s sympathetic to their cause. Public lands advocates are bracing for more attempts to turn land over to states, industry groups and developers.
“The threat level is red alert,” said Randi Spivak, public lands policy director with the Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental nonprofit. “Some of these states have been champing at the bit for decades to privatize. They’re certainly not going to let this opportunity pass without an aggressive effort.”
The ‘balance sheet’
In Western states, where most federally owned lands are located, some leaders view these lands as a treasured inheritance — places reserved for all Americans and critical for wildlife, tourism and outdoor recreation. Others feel that too much of the land in their states is controlled by officials in Washington, D.C., leaving it off-limits for development and curtailing its economic value.










Some of these states have been champing at the bit for decades to privatize. They're certainly not going to let this opportunity pass without an aggressive effort.

Trump officials and allies have embraced the latter view. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum has repeatedly called federal lands America’s “balance sheet,” describing them as untapped assets worth trillions of dollars. He has launched an effort to identify federal lands suitable for housing development.
Other proposals have centered around using land sales to pay for tax breaks or to finance Trump’s proposed government-run fund that could invest in stocks or real estate.
For some state leaders, the newfound interest at the federal level to turn public lands into cash — along with Trump’s cuts to land management agency staff — aligns with a long-standing movement to reduce federal ownership.
“I look at it as an opportunity to say, ‘Hey, turn it over to the state,’” said Utah House Speaker Mike Schultz, a Republican.
Utah leaders have made the most forceful push to challenge federal land ownership. The state filed a legal challenge last year seeking to take control of more than 18 million acres of “unappropriated” lands — parcels held by the federal government without a specific designation such as a national park or monument. That effort hit a roadblock earlier this year when the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the case.
But with Trump in the White House, state leaders may pivot from challenging the feds in court to seeking their cooperation.
“We would love if the federal government just turned it over to us and said, ‘Here, manage these lands,’” Schultz said. “That’s an option as well. Those are discussions that are happening. Everything is on the table.”

Schultz declined to say which federal officials have been involved in discussions about transferring lands to the state.
Some lawmakers in Wyoming backed a state resolution this year — which ultimately failed — calling on Congress to hand over all federal lands except for Yellowstone National Park. Idaho lawmakers passed a measure calling on the feds to turn over a wildlife refuge to the state. And Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo, a Republican, has called for a “systematic release” of federal land in the state.
But public lands also have many supporters in Western states, including some prominent Republican members of Congress, such as Reps. Mike Simpson of Idaho and Ryan Zinke of Montana. Zinke was Interior secretary for two years during the first Trump administration.
John Leshy, who served as solicitor for the U.S. Department of the Interior during the Clinton administration, said proposals to dispose of federal lands tend to be stymied by fierce public backlash.
“Federal lands are really popular,” he said. “It’s political poison [to sell off public land]. It’s a different West now. Public attitudes have changed.”
Leshy also noted that livestock ranchers especially benefit from discounted lease rates offered by the federal government.
Housing arguments
The most recent clash over the future of federal lands was the amendment sponsored by a pair of congressional Republicans last month. The measure would have directed the Bureau of Land Management to sell more than 500,000 acres of land in Nevada and Utah. Local governments would have been able to buy the land at market value, with no restrictions on how they used it.
Backers said the sale would bring in revenue to cover Trump’s proposed tax cuts, while allowing local governments to build much-needed housing on the parcels. Utah GOP Sen. Mike Lee said he will try to revive the measure as the Senate considers the bill this month, E&E News reported.
Trump wants to log more trees. He’ll need states’ help.

In Nevada, where 85% of land is owned by the federal government, some leaders say their communities are hemmed in by a checkerboard of public lands that constrain development. The city of Fernley, which is growing rapidly, would have acquired 12,000 acres under the proposal.
“We need housing,” said Benjamin Marchant, Fernley’s city manager. “The city can’t plan roads and water lines, sewer lines and gas lines, when you have federal land between two parcels that want to develop. This will bring a practical and helpful consolidation of all these lands into one developable area.”
Nevada leaders have long worked on proposals to transfer some federal lands to local governments and allow for increased growth. But some lawmakers say the latest push bypassed that collaborative process — and failed to include safeguards that the money raised from the sale of the lands would be reinvested into conserving public lands elsewhere.
“It was a complete betrayal of everything we’ve worked on in this state,” said Assemblymember Howard Watts, a Democrat. “This amendment is trying to sell off half a million acres of Nevada’s public lands in order to pay for tax cuts for billionaires. This is not going to address our housing problem. These lands are positioned to be sold off for other forms of development and extraction.”
Similar debates are happening in Utah. In southwestern Utah’s Washington County, local officials say the disposal of federally controlled land could help alleviate the region’s housing crisis and increasingly strained infrastructure.
The county is experiencing rapid population growth — in 2022, St. George, the county seat, was the fastest-growing metro area in America. County and city leaders hoped the amendment would have helped them manage the growth. The measure would have disposed of roughly 11,500 acres of federally controlled land in Utah, selling it at market value to local governments.
The proposal received pushback from all sides, including environmentalists, hunting and fishing groups, House Democrats and even conservatives.
“[The amendment] is consistent with how U.S. Department of the Interior Secretary Burgum thinks about federal public lands, as simply assets on a ledger to be sold off,” said Steve Bloch, legal director for the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, an environmental nonprofit. ” … It’s just antithetical to how Westerners think about the federal public lands that make up so much of our landscape.”

Washington County Commissioner Adam Snow, a Republican, said a lot of the opposition was misguided. The county would have acquired almost half of the land earmarked for disposal, and Snow said much of that would have been used to widen existing roads and construct new ones that are bordered by Bureau of Land Management property.
“These were not pristine wilderness lands. Some of the environmental groups tried to make it sound like we’re selling off Zion National Park, and that’s not even close to true,” Snow said. “If we can just not have to deal with the federal government every time we want to chip seal a road or improve an intersection, that would be really nice. Because we have to ask ‘Mother, may I?’ for everything out here.”
Local leaders say federal parcels could help ease housing pressures as well. Snow said transferring parcels to the city or county is one of the only ways to stop the area from becoming wildly expensive.
“We’re running out of room real quick,” he said. “ … There is still private land to develop, but they’re going to charge an absolute premium.”
The amendment that was stripped from the House bill was widely criticized for not having any restrictions on what could be done with the land.
“There was no language whatsoever that would require Washington County or St. George to do anything with these lands. They could lease them for development. They could sell them outright,” said Bloch.
The costs of management
In Utah, lawmakers have created a state Department of Land Management — essentially a placeholder agency that would be funded and staffed only if their effort to assume control of large swaths of federal land succeeds. Schultz, the House speaker, said the state is committed to keeping the lands in the public domain, reopening roads and campgrounds closed by the feds.
Western states’ budgets, industries rely on federal lands. So does wildlife.

“We’d just take over the job from the federal government,” he said. “It is something that the state absolutely would do, and we’d do it more efficiently, more effectively and we’d have better outcomes.”
Schultz said the state could bring in the revenues needed to manage the land by raising lease prices for oil and gas operations on parcels currently managed for drilling.
But some public lands advocates say that’s not realistic. The federal Bureau of Land Management employed more than 950 people in the state as of 2024, and feds also assume the expensive task of wildfire management on their lands.
“If you look at the history of what Utah has done with their lands, they’ve sold more than half of them,” said Devin O’Dea, Western policy and conservation manager with Backcountry Hunters & Anglers. “We’re certainly of the perspective that states could not handle the economic costs of managing these lands. Their hand would be forced; they would have to sell these lands in order to deal with those costs.”
John Robison, Idaho Conservation League public lands and wildlife director, said Simpson — the Idaho congressman — and the state’s two senators have all won praise from constituents for their work on public lands compromises.
“Savvy Idaho politicians know that public lands are popular,” he said.
But other state leaders insist their governments are better equipped to manage the lands. Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador, a Republican, was among the officials who signed an amicus brief in support of Utah’s lawsuit against the feds.
“We live here, we work here, and we are far better stewards of our forests and resources than federal bureaucrats in Washington,” Labrador said in a statement. “ … If Idaho owned this land, we could lease it for timber, grazing, and mining — just like the federal government does — but reinvest that revenue right here in Idaho.”

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)After a campaign promise to bring in outsized federal dollars for Maine, U.S. Sen. Susan Collins won reelection during Trump’s first term, overcoming a record amount of spending against her and defying public polls. At the start of the president’s second term, Collins rose to the helm of the Senate Appropriations Committee, the first time a Mainer has chaired one of the upper chamber’s most powerful committees in 92 years.
However, Maine’s longest-serving member of Congress has reached this pinnacle of authority as President Donald Trump is attempting to flip the system on its head. His administration, by Collins’ own admission, has unjustly rescinded congressionally appropriated funds, at times singling out Maine in what are widely considered retaliatory actions over the state’s defiance of his executive order rolling back transgender rights.
During Trump’s second term so far, Collins, a Republican, has bucked the executive periodically, particularly with attempts to rein in tariffs by reasserting congressional control and voting against a budget framework passed by the Senate in April because of possible cuts to Medicaid, the state-federal health program for low-income people and some people with disabilities. Though, in the budget currently being considered, she is supportive of adding work requirements to limit Medicaid eligibility.
Some of her constituents want to see more public pushback.
“I focus on results, not rhetoric,” Collins said in an interview. “My goal is not to get on Fox News and MSNBC and rant and rave.”
Outlining her strategy for Maine Morning Star, Collins said she’s had success restoring some funding largely due to conversations outside of public view, relying on her long-developed relationships.
“It is far more effective for me to, for example, restore the funding that the administration wants to cut for the Low Income Heating Assistance Program, LIHEAP, which is so important to the state of Maine, than it is to go make a fiery speech to anywhere that doesn’t result in any change,” Collins said.
But some constituents argue a piecemeal approach to restoring funds will ultimately be ineffective as overall democratic checks and balances are tested.
Collins’ public use of power
During Trump’s first few weeks back in office, Collins said she hoped the courts would side with Congress if the president’s attempts to control spending were litigated.
Now, with numerous cases in the courts, Collins said, “some of the actions taken by the administration have and will be overturned in court, and others Congress will overturn through the appropriations process.”
She added, “When I disagree with the actions of the administration, I have not hesitated to intervene.”
Collins said she consulted with the Trump administration in order to restore the U.S. Department of Agriculture grants to the University of Maine, renegotiate the Maine Sea Grant, secure an exception to the hiring freeze at Acadia National Park and reverse the cancellation of a decades-old program that allows parents to register their newborns for a Social Security number while at hospitals. Though Collins’ spokesperson told Maine Morning Star that Social Security Administration Acting Commissioner Leland Dudek told the senator it was an error but reporting later revealed that he deliberately sought to punish Maine after Gov. Janet Mills’ heated exchange with Trump over the state’s transgender protections.
But some Maine voters argue Collins should be using her seniority — as the seventh most senior member of the Senate and the most senior Republican woman — for more than piecemeal fixes.
Falmouth resident Anne Scheer — who carried a sign during a Tax Day protest in Augusta that read “Where’s Susan?” — said she wants the senator to rally her caucus to stand up for democracy, adding that she doesn’t think that has to be an anti-Trump message.
“She needs to talk with her fellow Republicans and say, ‘This is enough,’” Scheer said.
Cape Elizabeth resident Jerry Kaufman, an independent who protested against Collins in Biddeford in April, said he’d vote for Collins if she could convince her colleagues to confront the president to say “stop the foolishness.”
“Show some leadership and bring some people along with you,” Kaufman said.
At that same protest, Biddeford resident Anthony Burgess, a registered Democrat who voted for Collins once in 2014, criticized her statements of concern and disappointment about some of the Trump administration’s actions as lacking conviction.
He said independent U.S. Sen. Angus King’s attendance at the “Hands Off” rally in Portland in April demonstrated for him a refusal to cow to Trump.
“Her vote is the mechanism of government but she has a platform that she could be speaking from,” Burgess said.
When asked what her response is to those who say she should be doing more to ensure the separation of powers remains, Collins pointed to her questioning officials in subcommittee hearings.
One main purpose of subcommittees is to hold hearings on spending proposals during which members can directly question agency heads. Collins has questioned several, including U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on the proposed elimination of the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program.
“We’re actually holding these subcommittee hearings at a breakneck pace to evaluate spending requests and reductions, as well as to assess compliance with congressional intent and enacted laws,” Collins said.

Exercising private influence
However, Collins said the public does not see what she feels is her most efficient tactic.
“My goal is to get things fixed and to get problems solved, and I do that through the federal hearings where I’m laying the foundation for restoration of the cuts in biomedical research, which is an extraordinarily high priority for me,” Collins said, as an example. “But also I do it privately by calling up Cabinet members.”
Collins said she is so far largely approaching her qualms with the administration through these one-on-one conversations.
This tactic has burned her at times in the past, notably when Collins voted for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh after she said he gave her private assurances he wasn’t a threat to Roe v. Wade, the landmark abortion ruling that he later voted to overturn.
More recently, ahead of the deadline to avoid a government shutdown, Collins said she started texting with Trump’s billionaire adviser Elon Musk, who heads the Department of Government Efficiency. That outreach does not appear to have gone as planned, at least for the immediate outcome.
While Collins initially said she was “absolutely” opposed to a full-year stop gap approach, she told Politico that Republican leaders instructed her to start writing a plan for that approach anyway. The version that passed, drafted by House GOP leadership, was ultimately pushed through with limited input from spending leaders of either chamber.
But in other cases, she’s touted success that she’s had with these conversations that happen behind closed doors, such as with the restoration of the USDA funding and renegotiation of the Maine Sea Grant.
“Because I have these relationships with the president’s Chief of Staff Susie Wiles and with Cabinet members, I have been able to restore funding that was in jeopardy,” Collins said.
Mark Brewer, chair of the political science department at the University of Maine, sees this as a strength unique to Collins.
“Given that she’s the only Republican member of the current Maine delegation and she’s the only person with a committee chair, I think she’s better positioned to have those communications than any of the other members,” Brewer said.
But while Collins sees these behind-the-scenes negotiations as the most effective way to restore funding that, as she puts it, has been arbitrarily and unfairly cut from Maine, when it comes to attempts to gut entire programs, “that’s going to take legislation,” she said.
Republicans’ ‘big, beautiful bill’
The sprawling budget bill is the main vehicle where such attempts are currently being made.
Cokie Giles, a registered nurse at Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor, protested with National Nurses United outside Collins’ office in Portland in March to demand the senator oppose the possible cuts to Medicaid in the budget.
While Collins often talks about her ability to work across the aisle, Giles said, “Well, work on your own side, and don’t let these cuts go through.”
After Collins, citing concerns about possible Medicaid cuts, was one of two Senate Republicans to vote against the budget framework that the chamber passed in early April, Giles told Maine Morning Star she was pleased but not confident the senator’s opposition would remain as budget debates continues, nor that her vote would make a difference in the end.
Late last month, the U.S. House narrowly approved the massive tax and spending plan. The legislation now heads to the Senate, where Republican lawmakers are expected to rewrite much of it, now taking into consideration the more detailed budget plan Trump released on Friday. The bill will then have to head back to the House for final approval, with a goal to get it to the president’s desk by the Fourth of July.
As passed by the House, the 1,116-page package combines 11 bills. Among its many components, the current plan would overhaul Medicaid, reducing the program by $625 billion over 10 years under the latest estimate by the Congressional Budget Office.

Collins did not provide specific red lines that would lead her to not support the budget package, but she described Medicaid as critically important for Maine’s health care system and a vital resource for many seniors, low-income families, disabled patients and those who cannot work. She told Maine Morning Star she “cannot support proposals that would create more duress for our hospitals and providers that are already teetering on the edge of insolvency.”
However, Collins is supportive of placing further limits on program eligibility, specifically “work requirements for able-bodied men and women who are capable of working and do not have obligations that preclude them from participating in the workforce,” she said.
As passed by the House, people who are between the ages of 19 and 65 would be required to work, participate in community service, or attend an educational program at least 80 hours a month to be eligible. The language has numerous exceptions, including for pregnant people, parents of dependent children and people who have complex medical conditions, among others.
Under these requirements, 34,000 Mainers would be expected to lose their Medicaid coverage, reducing federal funding by $215 million, according to the progressive Maine Center for Economic Policy.
Maine Gov. Janet Mills warned in a radio address on Friday about these cuts, as well as others that would limit access to the Affordable Care Act health insurance marketplaces.
“If you receive health care through MaineCare or CoverME.gov, which is the Affordable Care Act, I encourage you to contact Members of Congress to share what that coverage means to you,” Mills said. “They need to hear your story.”
Some shared their stories at a protest against Collins organized by the Maine Democratic Party in Bangor on Saturday, which drew almost 200 attendees who demanded the senator block the health care and other program cuts in the budget.
“In 2020, [Collins] told us that her seniority would protect us, that chairing Appropriations would give her the power to defend Maine’s interests,” said Shawn Yardley. “Her party now controls the White House and both chambers of Congress, but the cuts and the cruelty keep coming.”
While Collins emphasized some possible future impacts on MaineCare at the federal level, she said, “the state has not been perfect on this issue.” The senator called out the Maine Legislature for being unable to reach a compromise on its state budget.
“The state is holding up more than $100 million in emergency supplemental funding that would draw down nearly $400 million federal funds,” Collins said.
Maine Senate Republicans held out their support for the supplemental budget plan, and later the two-year budget, because they’d wanted it to include structural reform to Medicaid — notably the work requirements Collins is supportive of adding on the federal level.
Last month, the Maine House failed to secure enough support to get the now already allocated Medicaid funding out sooner. Some Republicans, though not ultimately enough for passage, supported that effort, arguing the state needs to pay its bills owed to providers, but others called it a blank check they wouldn’t sign.
With Maine hospitals already struggling to keep services available, state groups are calling on Collins in particular to reject federal health care cuts as well as cuts to childcare and food assistance in a digital ad campaign launched this week by Family Values @ Work Action, a national network of state and local coalitions aimed at promoting family-friendly workplace policies.
“This package takes food and medicine from the mouths of Maine families to fund tax cuts for the wealthy,” Destie Hohman Sprague, executive director of the Maine Women’s Lobby, said in a statement on Monday.
Among many other components, the federal budget bill proposes cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP, through expanded work requirements and shifting some program costs to state governments. Maine would also lose federal matching funds as a penalty for providing coverage to some immigrant populations.
The budget plan would also raise the debt limit by $4 trillion.
“We have an enormous deficit and debt,” Collins said, “and we do need to evaluate programs.”
As the Senate negotiates what to keep and do away with in the “big, beautiful bill” that represents the heart of Trump’s domestic agenda, how Maine’s senior senator chooses to use her influence, whether in public or not, will be put to the test.

A new state law aimed at expanding gas and nuclear power plants in Ohio may also provide opportunities for solar developers — if they can overcome other policy and political barriers.


Solar industry advocates say House Bill 15, signed by Republican Gov. Mike DeWine in mid-May, contains several technology-neutral provisions that could benefit clean energy projects, including property tax breaks for siting them on brownfields and former coal mines. The law also loosens restrictions on behind-the-meter electricity generation and lowers the overall tax burden for new power plants.


“This is just smart economic development. We need the energy,” said Michael Benson, board president of Green Energy Ohio, whose members include a variety of clean energy companies. In his view, a market-based approach should work in favor of renewables and battery storage, which can generally be deployed more quickly and cheaply than power plants that burn fossil fuels.


Much of the public discussion around the legislation focused on its repeal of coal plant subsidies mandated by HB 6, the 2019 law at the heart of Ohio’s ongoing public corruption scandal. HB 15 also will end the use of ​“electric security plans,” which let utilities add special charges to customer bills without reviewing all revenue and expenses in a full rate case.


But many of the measures in HB 15 are meant to encourage new electricity production in the state.


“We should open the market to dispatchable energy generation to address future energy shortages,” the bill’s primary sponsor, Rep. Roy Klopfenstein (R-Haviland), said in his February testimony, in which he also noted growing energy demand from data centers and other large electricity users, and energy supply issues raised by grid operator PJM Interconnection. The term ​“dispatchable” is often used to refer to power plants that can be turned on or off as demand requires, as opposed to solar or wind without battery backup.


Most of the law’s incentives for new energy production are technology-neutral, however.


Under HB 15, new electricity production on brownfields and minelands designated as priority investment areas will be exempt from property taxes for five years. Grants of up to $10 million each will be available to clean up or prepare the sites for construction. And the Ohio Power Siting Board will speed up its review of energy projects in those areas.


“It’s a huge opportunity,” said Rebecca Mellino, a climate and energy policy associate for The Nature Conservancy in Ohio. Last year the organization estimated that Ohio has more than 600,000 acres of minelands and brownfields suitable for renewable energy production. The sites often have good access to roads and transmission lines, too.


As Mellino sees it, solar in priority areas would avoid objections raised by some people about displacing farmland. And counties with renewable energy bans could presumably modify them to allow development in priority investment areas without affecting other parts of their jurisdictions, she suggested.


The law also removes a restriction that has required behind-the-meter generation to be located on the premises of the customer who is using the power. The change might allow data centers to tap into gas-fired backup generators on an adjacent property, for example. But it could also create new opportunities for clean energy-powered microgrids, in which a group of customers share solar panels and a large battery.


“That is significant, all by itself,” because it provides more flexibility, said Dylan Borchers, an energy attorney with law firm Bricker Graydon in Columbus, Ohio. Just as importantly, the law ​“allows essentially a portfolio approach for customers and energy resources.”

In other words, multiple businesses could form a shared ​“self-power” system with equipment for electricity generation or battery storage on adjacent land or on premises controlled by one or more of them. Such a system could include numerous generation or storage facilities, allowing a cluster of data centers, factories, or other large energy users to combine multiple behind-the-meter resources, whether they be natural gas, solar, batteries, or small nuclear when it becomes available.


The ability to combine resources means customers wouldn’t necessarily need lots of land to add renewable energy, said Benson. ​“If you want the most power quickly and cleanly, you can use rooftops and parking lots and build out a lot of small-scale generation.”


The law also reduces the overall tax burden for new electricity production. Local governments may collect less revenue but still welcome the jobs and other spending that come with new energy investments. And less stringent requirements might even benefit some communities when new power generation is sited, Borchers suggested.


Ohio’s current tangible personal property tax rates have been so high that companies have often used ​“payments in lieu of taxes,” also known as PILOT programs, to avoid getting walloped by huge tax bills as soon as energy production starts. But counties face somewhat strict requirements for how they must allocate PILOT payments. Developers that take advantage of the lower tax rates available under HB 15 may have more financial flexibility to be able to fund some projects that local governments want most, such as a new fire station or community center, Borchers said.


Taken together, the provisions in HB 15 promise to make it easier to build more solar in the state, industry representatives say.


The governor and legislature saw ​“the urgent need to expand energy generation as Ohio confronts rapidly increasing demand and the threat of escalating costs and supply shortages,” said Will Hinman, executive director for the Utility Scale Solar Energy Coalition of Ohio. ​“House Bill 15 is a critical step towards addressing these challenges by reducing barriers to energy development — including utility-scale solar projects.”


 Ohio is still not a level playing field for clean energy

The law still requires projects to meet multiple criteria to benefit from its provisions. For example, power-generating facilities and transmission lines exceeding certain thresholds may need approval from the Ohio Power Siting Board. The state’s director of development must approve local governments’ designations of priority investment areas. And self-power systems have to be independent of the main power grid.


The biggest downside is that the new law left in place a 2021 statute, Senate Bill 52, which requires utility-scale renewable energy developments to get local approval, said Molly Bryden, a climate and sustainability researcher with think tank Policy Matters Ohio.


Under that earlier law, 34 of Ohio’s 88 counties have banned new solar generation in all or part of their territories. Even where the local law doesn’t bar a new project, local officials can still block projects before a developer even seeks a permit from the Ohio Power Siting Board. A county representative and a township representative also get to vote with state siting board members on whether facilities get a permit, even for some projects that were in the grid operator’s queue before the 2021 law.


Another law took effect in early 2023, letting local governments limit small solar and wind projects that connect to the grid but don’t otherwise fall within the scope of the 2021 law.


Requirements of the 2021 and 2023 laws don’t apply to generation fueled by natural gas, coal, or nuclear power. And Ohio’s high court has ruled local governments can’t ban or regulate gas wells and related infrastructure or even enforce broader zoning laws that would prevent such development.


Lawmakers also cut out provisions from an earlier version of HB 15 that would have allowed community solar development. Community solar lets residential customers save money by sharing the electricity from a local solar array, which doesn’t have to be on their own property.


“There’s still a real need for permitting reform,” Bryden said.

(Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)The U.S. Department of Homeland Security released a list of “sanctuary jurisdictions” — a term for towns and cities that have policies hindering local law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration officials — that included Lebanon and Hanover Thursday, but by the end of the weekend, it had pulled that list offline.
In unveiling the list (which has been archived online by third parties), DHS demanded Lebanon and Hanover, as well as communities in 34 other states and Washington D.C., revise their policies. The list was mandated by an executive order signed by President Donald Trump in April requiring DHS to produce and publicize such a list.
Soon after its release, however, law enforcement officials nationwide pushed back. National Sheriffs’ Association President Sheriff Kieran Donahue called the list an “unnecessary erosion of unity and collaboration with law enforcement” on Saturday, and said it “not only violated the core principles of trust, cooperation, and partnership with fellow law enforcement, but it also has the potential to strain the relationship between Sheriffs and the White House administration.”
In a statement to States Newsroom, DHS didn’t answer questions as to why the list was removed.
“As we have previously stated, the list is being constantly reviewed and can be changed at any time and will be updated regularly,” a DHS spokesperson said. “Designation of a sanctuary jurisdiction is based on the evaluation of numerous factors, including self-identification as a Sanctuary Jurisdiction, noncompliance with Federal law enforcement in enforcing immigration laws, restrictions on information sharing, and legal protections for illegal aliens.”
The saga came after New Hampshire officials themselves demanded the policies be re-written. In May, Gov. Kelly Ayotte signed two anti-sanctuary city bills — House Bill 511 and Senate Bill 62 — into law. When they go into effect in January, the bills will require New Hampshire cities and towns to comply with Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainers “if safe to do so,” prohibit policies that would ignore federal immigration-related directives and authorities, forbid local police and sheriffs from investigating the citizenship status of someone in their custody — unless that person is under investigation for violating New Hampshire law — and take away state or local governments’ authority to prohibit their police or sheriffs from entering into voluntary agreements with ICE.
At the bill signing ceremony in May, Ayotte declared, “there will be no sanctuary cities in New Hampshire.” Legislators at the ceremony said they’d identified between nine and 12 communities with sanctuary city laws that hinder law enforcement from working with federal immigration authorities.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/AyoteBeforeSigningMay222025-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-04 05:02:10.161580

Ohio House lawmakers got a stark warning Tuesday from a leading cybersecurity firm: potential threats are changing “dramatically” in terms of “sophistication, speed and complexity.”
The presentation came on the heels of lawmakers introducing a bill requiring municipalities to develop their own cybersecurity policies.
What’s in the bill?
House Bill 283 is a response to wave of cyber-attacks aimed at relatively low-level government agencies. The bill’s co-sponsor, state Rep. Haraz Ghanbari, R-Perrysburg, explained in April last year, the state auditor reported at least 23 cyberattacks against government offices in the last 12 months.
“In Licking County,” Ghanbari added, “just one attack resulted in the theft of more than $700,000.”
The measure directs local governments to review their systems and identity risks and detection strategies. The also have to develop training programs and create plans for repair, and response and in the event of an attack.
Ghanbari’s co-sponsor, state Rep. Adam Mathews, R-Lebanon, said locals would have to inform state safety officials within seven days and the state auditor within 30.
“This will ensure prompt and accurate information is relayed to the proper authorities involved in the response,” he said.
The proposal also puts added pressure on local response to ransomware attacks. Under the proposal, Matthews said, municipal governments would be prohibited from paying a ransom unless it “formally and out in the open” approved legislation to that effect.
“This requirement bolsters transparency and ensures constituents are both aware of the incident’s occurrence and have an opportunity to provide feedback on the best use of their taxpayer dollars,” he said.
Threat potential
Thomas MacLellan from the cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks, told lawmakers that governments, agencies and businesses aren’t defending against a random hacker.
“Ransomware is now a business,” he said. “It is a business where they actually have help desks.”
And just as the sophistication of attacks has grown, so has the speed.
“In 2021, it took about nine days to exfiltrate data,” he said of bad actors removing information. “In the latest attacks now leveraging artificial intelligence, it literally only takes hours.”
Beyond these kinds of ransom attacks, where an actor holds critical data or access hostage in exchange for money, MacLellan described several other threats, including attackers exploiting industrial control systems.
“Those are the things, the switches that turn on things that are connected to the internet,” MacLellan said, “that turn on bridges and dams and traffic lights and hospital systems.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXIn terms of preparing for attacks, he suggested state lawmakers get a security firm on retainer. “You need a bat phone,” MacLellan said, “to be able to pick up and say, we need some help, because we are overwhelmed, we’ve been hit by something.” Notably, Palo Alto Networks could be the one on the other end of that phone line.
He also argued the state needs to be aggressive about understanding and monitoring its exposure — what MacLellan termed “attack surface management.” A computer, router or other piece of hardware running out-of-date software could be a vulnerability, he said, and organizations need to make sure to find and fix those problems.
MacLellan added that some states have begun developing joint security operations, effectively a state-run cybersecurity team to protect state and local governments in the event of an attack. He repeatedly argued the biggest challenge in cybersecurity is workforce; centralizing talent could allow for greater reach and impact.
State Reps. Ismail Mohamed, D-Columbus, and Ron Ferguson, R-Wintersville, asked HB 283’s sponsors about a statewide approach to cybersecurity planning.
“Why isn’t there a centralized place,” Mohamed asked, “instead of requiring each subdivision to have their own cyber program?”
Ghanbari and Matthews said they would leave the finer points up to local governments to maintain local control and allow greater flexibility.
Highlighting a well-publicized cyberattack against Columbus last year, Rep. Christine Cockley, D-Columbus, asked about the cost prevention compared to the cost of response and recovery. She noted the city has faced significant costs investigating what happened and providing safeguards for people impacted by the breach.
MacLellan acknowledged he didn’t have hard and fast numbers to offer, but said “when you begin to look at the cost of remediation versus the cost of actually putting together a good system, the delta is pretty significant.”

Susan Collins visited with first responders in Clinton, Maine and reviewed plans for an upgraded facility built with the help of $2 million secured in Congressionally Directed Spending. (Photo via Sen. Susan Collins/ Facebook)Editor’s Note: This story is part of a series about U.S. Sen. Susan Collins’ role during the second Trump presidency. 
As Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins approaches three decades in Congress, the self-described moderate’s balancing act has meant she’s angered both the left and right. However, even Mainers otherwise critical of Collins commend her ability to secure federal funding for Maine.
“I think her big goal has been what it always has been and that’s delivering economically for the state,” said Jim Melcher, a professor of political science at University of Maine Farmington. “I think [that] really interests her a lot more than being an ideological vote, honestly, for anybody.”
Though, the bounds of that unifier are now being tested by the Trump administration. 
Since President Donald Trump threatened to withhold federal funding unless Maine complies with his executive order banning transgender girls from playing girls’ sports, the state has been the subject of several probes and funding cuts that have been widely interpreted as retaliatory.
Some Mainers say these terminations underscore why Maine needs Collins, one of Congress’ most senior members and top appropriators. Others argue the executive’s actions reveal a crack in Collins’ power.
When asked whether she believes she can still ensure Maine receives both the funding it’s owed and continued appropriations for new initiatives, Collins did not hesitate to say, “I do.” 
Her record
Both Republican leaders of the Maine Legislature, Sen. Trey Stewart of Aroostook County and Rep. Billy Bob Faulkingham of Winter Harbor, said, without a doubt, that Collins should not face a primary challenger. Why? Federal funding. 
“I think it’s absolutely insane to vote out Susan Collins, who brings so much money into the state of Maine,” Faulkingham said. 
In fiscal year 2022, Congress reinstated earmarks, formally referred to as Congressionally Directed Spending in the Senate, where individual members have the ability to request funds for specific projects in their home states. Collins has secured more than $1 billion for Maine using this method since. 
Collins secured more than $200 million for 105 projects in fiscal year 2022, more than $308 million for 108 projects in fiscal year 2023, and more than $577 million for 231 projects in fiscal year 2024. Her 2024 total was the most secured by any senator that year. 
Throughout the years, these have gone toward initiatives related to infrastructure, medical services and affordable housing, among others. 
The University of Maine System received $125.45 million from Congressionally Directed Spending secured by Collins between fiscal year 2022 and 2024, according to Chief External and Governmental Affairs Officer Samantha Warren, who called the funding “transformational.”  
Though, Warren added, these earmarks don’t reflect all of the funding that Collins has helped funnel to the system, both since the earmark process was restored and before, noting Collins’ longtime championing of investments for Maine’s public universities including through need-based federal Pell grants and TRIO programs. 
Another key funding source outside the earmark process is defense spending, which Collins has helped secure for Maine-based contractors such as Bath Iron Works and Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. 
“Do you think we’re going to be building ships at Bath Iron Works if we have a freshman legislator in the Senate? No, I don’t think so,” Faulkingham said.

When asked whether the General Dynamics-owned contractor has any concerns about Collins being able to continue to deliver in light of other congressionally appropriated funds being rescinded, David Hench, communications principal for BIW, pointed to her track record. 
“Senator Collins’ leadership as a member and now chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee has been invaluable in not only providing resources for our national defense, but in helping to address the transportation, housing and childcare needs of our state and workforce,” Hench said.
When asked the same, Kate Dufour, director of advocacy and communications for the Maine Municipal Association, a nonprofit state municipal league, described a similar working relationship between its members and the senator.
“Collins is a strong proponent of municipal government and has done much during her career to ensure that Maine has access to federal revenues, which reduce the burdens placed on the property taxpayers,” Dufour said. 
Several other major benefactors of Collins’ earmarks declined to comment on her performance as a top appropriator, including Jackson Laboratory and Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, or did not respond to requests for comment, including Maine Medical Center.  
When asked about her record of delivering for the state, Collins also pointed to her ability to work with both parties to advance legislation that aids many Mainers, and Americans more broadly. For example, she pointed to her co-authoring of the Social Security Fairness Act, signed into law earlier this year under former President Joe Biden, which she said she spent more than two decades working toward. The Act restored full benefits for millions of public sector workers. 
A breakdown
The funding process has been upended during Trump’s second term, challenging Collins’ otherwise steadily growing appropriations power. 
The continuing resolution from GOP leadership this winter cut earmarks for community projects. Collins had secured nearly $361 million in earmarks this year before they were removed from the resolution, which she said she ultimately supported to avoid a government shutdown. 
While it appears earmarks will return in bills this year to fund projects for fiscal year 2026, Mark Brewer, chair of the political science at the University of Maine, said he doesn’t think anyone can actually say whether that will consistently be the case moving forward. 
“Really, a lot of the things that we thought for years and years that had been norms for how things are done in Washington are not at the moment,” Brewer said.
How the White House implemented that stopgap bill demonstrated another breakdown of normal procedure, defying precedent in vetoing certain emergency spending allocations made by Congress. Collins warned the Trump administration in a letter then that the move could strain its working relationship with the Appropriations Committee.
State Sen. Rick Bennett of Oxford, a moderate Republican who has crossed paths with Collins when she previously held state-level positions and on campaign trails, said the senior senator has long focused on being institutionally responsible, an objective he also shares.   
On the state level, Bennett has argued the Legislature has ceded too much power to the governor and on the national level that Congress has ceded too much to the president. Calling Congress “barely functional on a good day,” Bennett said of Collins, “I think it’s difficult for her to find a normal process that is inclusive in this chaos.” 
When asked whether Collins is charting the most effective path amid that chaos, Bennett said, “I think we’re going to find out. I don’t have any advice for her. I think you’d have to be sitting in her seat in order to see what avenues she has.”
Collins has touted her behind-the-scenes conversations with officials as the most effective means to restore funding so far. Maine has been subject to both the Trump administration’s across-the-board slashes as well as targeted terminations.  
For example, in late February, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration notified the University of Maine that it was immediately discontinuing funding for the $4.5 million Maine Sea Grant, which has helped finance statewide research, strengthen coastal communities and support thousands of jobs over more than five decades.
While one of 34 grants across coastal and Great Lakes states throughout the country, Maine’s grant was the only one terminated. 
The funding cut came about a week after Trump threatened to withhold federal funding unless Maine complied with his executive order banning transgender girls from playing girls’ sports. Since then, the state has been the subject of several probes and funding cuts.
On March 4, independent U.S. Sen. Angus King and Democratic U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree of Maine sent a letter to Vice Admiral Nancy Hann demanding she immediately reverse the decision. But when Hann announced on March 5 that the grant would be renegotiated, she credited conversations with Collins and her staff. The University of Maine also credited the renegotiation decision to Collins.
“We are deeply appreciative of Senator Collins’ leadership and relentless advocacy on behalf of Maine Sea Grant and the hard-working Mainers it has long served,” UMaine President Joan Ferrini-Mundy said in a statement.

Values versus funding 
Collins lost Saco resident Sandy Katz’s support on issues of principle, and while not enough to gain her vote, Katz said, “The funding is the one thing she does well.”
Values and funding, however, are becoming increasingly entwined, as exemplified by Trump’s attempt to force compliance with his executive order through cuts.
On principle, Collins is against transgender athletes playing in women’s sports, but when it comes to funding, she criticized the president’s attempts to rescind federal dollars for Maine schools. 
Trying to find her balance between the two has also been challenged with her votes on Trump’s Cabinet picks. She voted for the vast majority of nominees, confirming 20 and voting against two: Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation Kash Patel. 
Regarding Hegseth, Collins said, “I think his difficulty in managing the department effectively has shown that my judgment was correct on that.” Since his confirmation, Hegseth has been involved in a spate of security scandals over his use of the open-source, encrypted messaging app Signal. 
Regarding Patel, Collins said, “I felt particularly at this time, but at any time, we need an apolitical FBI director and I did not think that Kash Patel was based on his writings.” Patel has authored children’s books and been involved with projects that promote pro-Trump conspiracy theories.
Concerning the Cabinet picks Collins supported, one confirmation in particular stuck out to political scientist and writer Amy Fried: Director of the U.S. Office of Management and Budget Russell Vought. 
Vought, an architect of Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation’s blueprint to overhaul the federal government, has said he doesn’t believe Congress has the final say on federal spending. 
When asked whether he would comply with the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, which clarifies that presidents don’t have the legal authority to ignore Congress on federal spending, Vought responded, “No, I don’t believe it’s constitutional. The president ran on that view. That’s his view, and I agree.”
Collins told Maine Morning Star she gives deference to presidential Cabinet picks regardless of party. 
“Despite my disagreements with [Vought], which are pretty profound when it comes to the Impoundment Act, he is clearly well qualified for the position,” Collins said. “He previously served as both deputy director of OMB and as director of OMB. So when I’m evaluating Cabinet nominees, I, in general, base my decision on whether or not the person is qualified for the job, not on whether I agree with all of their positions.”
Fried argued Collins’ vote for Vought undermines her own power.
“Her big claim was ‘I will be able to help the state of Maine because someday I’m going to be chair of the Appropriations Committee,’” Fried said. “Well, if the Appropriations Committee isn’t deciding what money goes where, then that just renders that whole thing null and void.”

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)Male legislators in Kansas use women as political pawns and defy the will of voters.
In Kansas, the go-to move for some members of the Legislature is to ignore the will of the people and criticize, restrict or oppress the personal, legal behaviors of women.
Even with their recent increase in pay, certain state House and Senate members still advocate for rushing through the session despite their own colleagues being critical of this action, or they promote bills contradictory to voters’ wants and needs. 
In the most recent legislative session, women were used as political pawns by inexperienced legislator Sen. Patrick Schmidt, a Democrat, who gambled on women’s health care rights because he viewed himself as some kind of political mastermind and champion for women. 
To be clear, most women do not view men who voluntarily attempt to make their lives harder as their champions.
Other legislators, like Republican Rep. Pat Proctor, who recently announced his bid to oversee our state’s elections, scrutinized the legal voting behavior of young women he claimed he was watching.
Proctor is captured in a video Loud Light posted to Instagram stating: “There’s, like, all these, like, women, like 20- to 30-year-old women who, you know, that you never saw at the polls before.”
He adds: “They’re stealing it far and square.”
To be clear, it is your fundamental right to vote regardless of your gender or sex as long as you are registered appropriately, according to the laws of your state. If these women were not registered, they would not have been allowed to vote. They stole nothing.
It is beyond concerning that Proctor, who also can be seen here discussing how he’s chipping away at issues regarding voting rights, does not appear to respect the right to vote, particularly as for young women.
These women were exercising their fundamental rights guaranteed in the U.S. Constitution. That legal activity alone does not merit the personal monitoring or the hysterical outcries of a state representative.
In Kansas, women face extreme challenges that are unlikely to change without meaningful policy designed to promote the health and well-being of all women, especially women of color. The Status of Women in the States report paints a bleak picture for the women of Kansas.
Research on the project’s website indicates women in Kansas are not projected to see equal pay until 2074, 30% of women work in low-wage jobs, and women disproportionately experience mental health issues in comparison to their male counterparts. These numbers are even more staggering when we examine the effects on women of color.
Where are the bills addressing these issues?
Women endure so much, both publicly and privately, and Kansas women deserve legislators who view them as whole people, not dehumanized versions of an archetype produced by a patriarchy bent on subjugating women for their benefit.
Women have held the hands of their sisters in the aftermath of rape by men who see us as objects for the taking.
We have offered shelter and washed the blood off of our sisters when they’ve been beaten by men who claim to love them.
We cook meals to nourish other women’s families in times of illness or crisis.
We work multiple jobs, we clean messes we didn’t make, we appease, we follow orders, we submit out of fear or survival, we carry the emotional loads for our households and communities — a woman’s walk is never to be understood until you walk it.
The beautiful, innocent women of Kansas deserve better.
Perhaps, moving forward, members of the Legislature should consider consulting with the women they are so hyper-focused on regulating in an inappropriate, terrifying way. What these legislators might find is that policies designed to burden women are unfair and unimaginable to most of the decent, good-hearted women and men Kansas is known for. That is, if legislators are truly interested in helping women.
The forced positioning of women as pawns in elected officials’ political games is wicked and vile. Either support us appropriately, or leave us alone.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)The Republican budget bill the U.S. House approved last month includes a surprise for the 40 states that have expanded Medicaid: penalties for providing health care to some immigrants who are here legally.
Along with punishing the 14 states that use their own funds to cover immigrants who are here illegally, analysts say last-minute changes to the bill would make it all but impossible for states to continue helping some immigrants who are in the country legally, on humanitarian parole.
Under the bill, the federal government would slash funding to states that have expanded Medicaid and provide coverage to immigrants who are on humanitarian parole — immigrants who have received permission to temporarily enter the United States due to an emergency or urgent humanitarian reason.
The federal government pays 90% of the cost of covering adults without children who are eligible under Medicaid expansion, but the bill would cut that to 80% for those states, doubling the state portion from 10% to 20%. That’s the same penalty the bill proposes for states that use their own money to help immigrants who are here illegally.
Ironically, states such as Florida that have extended Medicaid coverage to immigrants who are here on humanitarian parole but have not expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act would not be harmed by the bill, said Leonardo Cuello, a Medicaid law and policy expert and research professor at the Center for Children and Families at Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy.
It is “wildly nonsensical and unfair” to penalize expansion states for covering a population that some non-expansion states, such as Florida, also cover, Cuello said. “It would appear that the purpose is more to punish expansion states than address any genuine concern with immigrant coverage.”
West Virginia is one of the states where lawmakers are nervously watching U.S. Senate discussions on the proposed penalty. Republican state Rep. Matt Rohrbach, a deputy House speaker, said West Virginia legislators tabled a proposal that would have ended Medicaid expansion if the federal government reduced its share of the funding, because the state’s congressional representatives assured them it wasn’t going to happen. Now the future is murkier.
Cuello called the proposed penalty “basically a gun to the head of the states.”
“Congress is framing it as a choice, but the state is being coerced and really has no choice,” he said.
There are about 1.3 million people in the United States on humanitarian parole, from Afghanistan, Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, Ukraine and Venezuela as well as some Central American children who have rejoined family here. The Trump administration is trying to end parole from some of those countries. A Supreme Court decision May 30 allows the administration to end humanitarian parole for about 500,000 people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela.
Not many of those parolees qualify for Medicaid, which requires a waiting period or special status, but the 40 states with expanded Medicaid could be penalized if immigrants qualify for the program, said Tanya Broder, senior counsel for health and economic justice policy at the National Immigration Law Center.

Meanwhile, an increasing number of states and the District of Columbia already are considering scaling back Medicaid coverage for immigrants because of the costs.
The federal budget bill, named the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, is now being considered by the Senate, where changes are likely. The fact that so many states could be affected by the last-minute change could mean more scrutiny in that chamber, said Andrea Kovach, senior attorney for health care justice at the Shriver Center on Poverty Law in Chicago.
By her count, at least 38 states and the District of Columbia would be affected by the new restrictions, since they accepted some options now offered by Medicaid to cover at least some humanitarian parolees without a five-year waiting period.
“They’re all going to be penalized because they added in parolees,” Kovach said. “So that’s 38 times two senators who are going to be very interested in this provision to make sure their state doesn’t get their reimbursement knocked down.”
The change to exclude people with humanitarian parole was included in a May 21 amendment by U.S. Rep. Jodey Arrington, a Texas Republican who chairs the House budget committee. Arrington’s office did not reply to a request for comment, though he has stressed the importance of withholding Medicaid from immigrants who are here illegally.
“[Democrats] want to protect health care and welfare at any cost for illegal immigrants at the expense of hardworking taxpayers,” Arrington said in a May 22 floor speech urging passage of the bill. “But by the results of this last election, it’s abundantly clear: The people see through this too and they have totally rejected the Democrats’ radical agenda.”
Some states already are considering cutting Medicaid coverage for immigrants, though Democratic lawmakers and advocates are pushing back.
Washington, D.C., Democratic Mayor Muriel Bowser has proposed phasing out a program that provides Medicaid coverage to adults regardless of their immigration status, a move she says would save the District of Columbia $457 million.
Minnesota advocates protested a state budget deal reached last month with Democratic Gov. Tim Walz to phase out health care coverage for adults who are here illegally, a condition Republican lawmakers insisted on to avoid a shutdown.
Similarly, Illinois advocates are protesting new state rules that will end a program that has provided Medicaid coverage to immigrants aged 42-64 regardless of their legal status. The program cost $1.6 billion over three years, according to a state audit. The state will continue a separate program that provides coverage for older adults.
“Our position is that decision-makers in Illinois shouldn’t be doing Trump’s work for him,” said Kovach, of the Shriver Center on Poverty Law. “Let’s preserve health coverage for immigrants and stand up for Illinois immigrant residents who have been paying taxes into this state for years and need this coverage.”
Illinois state Sen. Graciela Guzmán, a Democrat whose parents are refugees from El Salvador, said many of her constituents in Chicago may be forced to cancel chemotherapy or lifesaving surgery because of the changes.
“It was a state budget, but I think the federal reconciliation bill really set the tone for it,” Guzmán said. “In a tough fiscal environment, it was really hard to set up a defense for this program.”
Oregon Democratic Gov. Tina Kotek is among the governors holding firm, saying that letting immigrants stay uninsured imposes costs on local hospitals and ends up raising prices for everyone.
“The costs will go somewhere. When everyone is insured it is much more helpful to keep costs down and reasonable for everyone. That’s why we’ve taken this approach to give care to everyone,” Kotek said at a news conference last month.
Medicaid does pay for emergency care for low-income patients, regardless of their immigration status, and that would not change under the federal budget bill.
Franny White, a spokesperson for the Oregon Health Authority, said her state’s Medicaid program covers about 105,000 immigrants, some of whom are here illegally. She said the policy, established by a 2021 state law, can save money in the long run.
“Uninsured people are less likely to receive preventive care due to cost and often wait until a condition worsens to the point that it requires more advanced, expensive care at an emergency department or hospital,” she said.
California was among the first states, along with Oregon, to offer health insurance to immigrants of all ages regardless of their legal status. But it now is considering cutting back, looking to save $5 billion as it seeks to close a $12 billion budget deficit. In May, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom proposed freezing enrollment of immigrant adults who are here illegally, and charging them premiums to save money.
“It’s possible that other states will decide to cut back these services because of budgetary concerns,” said Drishti Pillai, director of immigrant health policy at KFF, a health policy research organization.
If the federal budget bill passes with the immigrant health care provision intact, states would have more than two years to adjust, since the changes would not take effect until October 2027.
“We have time to really understand what the landscape looks like and really create a legal argument to make sure folks are able to maintain their health care coverage,” said Enddy Almonord, director for Healthy Illinois, an advocacy group supporting universal health care coverage.

When my son was diagnosed with a neurological disability, I worried about the ways he might struggle, not only physically and emotionally, but academically. I found peace in knowing that Ohio’s public schools would support him through protections provided by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). 
What I didn’t expect was the depth of care, commitment and expertise his public school teachers would bring. They see him. They celebrate his brilliance, advocate for his growth, and make sure I am part of a team.
This is why it is devastating to watch our state systematically strip resources from public education while funneling hundreds of millions of dollars more into private and charter schools that are not held to the same standards. This isn’t just a financing shift. It’s a shift in values.
Early in my career, I worked in charter schools, and while that experience shaped me as an educator, it also exposed me to harsh realities. I saw how poor accountability led to inefficiency and blatant disregard for students. These schools prioritized profit over people, with faceless management sending impersonal directives from beach homes in Florida. 
I watched students be discarded for not fitting an image and dedicated educators penalized for speaking up. My experiences confirm these are not the schools that best serve Ohio’s children, yet our state continues to prioritize them over public schools that educate all students – no exceptions.
Our public schools don’t pick and choose. They don’t push out students who need more support. They don’t quietly ignore civil rights protections like IDEA. My child thrives today because of this commitment, but I worry—for how much longer?
Proposed education budget changes feign a preference for school choice, but reflect a deeper truth: Ohio is abandoning its responsibility to educate all children. 
Underfunding public education puts supports like my son’s at risk. As an educator and a parent, I know what questions to ask and what rights to fight for, but many parents do not. Without the legal oversight and rules public schools must follow, too many students with disabilities may receive inadequate support, or be denied support, and their families may not even realize it. My child, and every child, deserves an education that meets their needs, not one that depends on whether a school chooses to serve them. 
Voucher and charter schools are not bound by the same transparency, equity, or admissions requirements as public schools. They can, and do, exclude students of color, LGBTQ+ students, students in poverty and students with disabilities, further damaging how these students feel seen and valued in the world. Yet, they’re receiving hundreds of millions more in taxpayer dollars.
Meanwhile, public schools are expected to do more with less. Because Ohio refuses to fund public education fully, districts are forced to rely on local property taxes. When those levies fail, as they did recently in my own communities of Twinsburg and Stow-Munroe Falls, students pay the price. Teachers stretch their resources, families scramble for support, and achievement gaps widen, particularly for rural and urban districts already struggling.
I’m proud to be Ohio’s Teacher of the Year, but this title means little if I don’t speak up. My colleagues in my district, the educators so tenderly caring for my baby in his, and those across the state working every day to make public schools places of learning, belonging, and possibility for every child can’t do it alone, and shouldn’t have to.
Ohio’s children deserve better—all of them.

Nine soldiers were killed in August, 1944, in the fight to liberate Gathemo.","The aftermath of the battle between the 28th Division and German troops in Gathemo, France, in August, 1944. (Screenshot from National Archives film)The liberation of Gathemo, France, won’t be found in many history books about the Second World War.
After all, it was one town among hundreds on a map that needed to be taken from the occupying Germans in the slow, methodical, grinding Battle of Normandy that began on D-Day: June 6, 1944. That’s when the Allies landed soldiers on five beaches and airborne troops dropped behind enemy lines as part of the war to wrest Europe from Nazi Germany.
Public perception may condense what happened after the invasion into simple terms: The Allies landed, established a beachhead and the fight was over. Tragically, it did not all end in a matter of days and the cost was steep – nearly 210,000 Allied casualties, and around 400,000 German losses.

Throughout the summer, the Allies pushed the German Army back through tiny villages, cities, farmland, hedgerows and plains in a war of attrition. U.S., British, Canadian, and other allied forces gained ground – sometimes only in mere yards — each day. 
By August, the Germans were retreating and desperately attempting to avoid becoming encircled. Gathemo soon found itself in the midst of the maelstrom.
For the first time in the war, Pennsylvania’s own 28th Infantry Division was leading the way to try to liberate the town, flanked by the veteran 4th and 29th divisions.

The men and women of Gathemo have never forgotten the men who wore the red keystone patch – dubbed the “bloody bucket” by the Germans – on their shoulders. 
Nearly 81 years later, the community will show its gratitude on Saturday by unveiling a memorial honoring nine men from the 28th who gave their lives so Gathemo could be free and  are renaming a street after the division.
At a time when international relations are tense and some American leaders are questioning alliances in Europe, the gesture is a reminder of how deep the bond runs between the French and their liberators. And the commemoration that will take place Saturday began because one man wondered what happened to his great-uncle in the war. 
He could never have imagined where his search would lead.  
‘Filling in the blanks’ 
Fifty-year-old Shaun Nadolny doesn’t have any ties to Pennsylvania.
The assistant airport operations manager for Milwaukee County in Wisconsin is a self-described history lover, whose grandfather Leo Nadolny fought in the Pacific Theater with the Marines against the Japanese.
Shaun Nadolny’s dad, born four years after the war ended in 1949, was named after Leo’s brother Jerome Francis, who was one of nine men killed in Gathemo. The two brothers never knew each other’s whereabouts while in combat, so Leo didn’t learn about Jerome’s death for nearly a year. 
Letters from his parents informing him about the loss weren’t reaching him, so tragically, he kept asking about his brother when writing home.

Like most families at the time, the Nadolnys didn’t know much about Jerome’s service, except that he died in France. A family member has the Purple Heart that was issued posthumously.
“I’ve learned a lot about my grandpa, Leo, because in about 2001, I sent a letter to the government saying, ‘As part of the Freedom of Information Act, I was wondering if you could share his military file.’ And they did,” he said.
The packet arrived about 18 months later and provided him with a window into his grandfather’s wartime experiences – where he fought, the battles he survived and even the ships he was transported on in the Pacific. 
“It kind of led me down this path about his brother Jerome, that we knew nothing about. We just literally had a picture of his cross on his grave over in Brittany (France), and a picture of him. That’s all my dad ever had,” he said. “He just knew that, ‘Hey, I was named after my uncle who I never met who was killed over in France.’”                                                                                                        
About a decade ago, he wrote the government again with a request for Jerome’s military file. He wasn’t as fortunate this time around. The records were believed to have been destroyed in a fire at the National Personnel Records Center in St. Louis in 1973. It was one of up to 18 million service members’ files lost. 
He did receive some basic information: Jerome’s draft enrollment card and where he was originally buried in France before his remains were repatriated in the Brittany American Cemetery.
Another key detail came from a picture of Jerome’s grave marker. He served in the 109th Infantry Regiment, as part of the 28th Infantry Division. Prior to the war, the 28th was a Pennsylvania National Guard unit based at Fort Indiantown Gap in Lebanon County. It was nationalized by the federal government in February 1941. 
“I just started kind of looking into that unit in that division,” Nadolny said. “A friend said, ‘Hey man, you’re kind of at a dead end with this research on your great uncle. You should look at a 28th Infantry Facebook group or a family group, because you’re not going to get anything more from the government.’”

So in the group, he ended up in touch with a Frenchman, Christophe Clement, who works in logistics. But, his real passion is World War II history. When he was 15 or 16, he would ride his bike from cemetery to cemetery to make sure the graves of Allied soldiers were well kept. He’s studied in Canada to be a historical adviser and volunteers with the Mike Pride Mobile Museum. Clement’s Facebook page is filled with pictures and videos – historical and current – of his efforts to keep the memory of Allied soldiers alive.
But, he has always felt a connection to the men wearing the keystone symbol on their uniforms and helmets. His hometown of Senlis was liberated by the division. During WWI, a soldier from the 28th died there and another five were killed in the same area during the second worldwide conflict.
Clement connected Nadolny with a retired lieutenant colonel from the 28th – Corey Angell, who served in Iraq and Afghanistan and who has a passion for documenting the history of his beloved unit. 
Angell soon was able to add a few more pieces to the puzzle for Nadolny – Jerome’s company, his death from a gunshot wound and how he was identified by his paybook. 
“So, they kind of started filling in just some of the blanks,” Nadolny said. “And all I ever was doing for the last 15 years was just learning a little bit more about my family history.”
‘Just another guy’ 
Clement had an idea after corresponding with Angell and Nadolny – to build a memorial to the 28th’s fallen in the nondescript town of Gathemo in Normandy. The idea blew Nadolny’s mind. He figured his great-uncle was just a typical grunt doing his job. After all, he wasn’t part of the D-Day landings or some super soldier that earned a chestful of medals.

“He’s just another guy. He came after the invasion, and was killed very early in – Aug. 12,” he said. “Nothing heroic about it.”
Nadolny didn’t want his relative to be singled out, so Clement did some digging and learned the names of eight other members of the 28th who were killed in the fight to liberate the townspeople from four years of German occupation.
“When you search for information about soldiers or about combat actions or whatever, it really is like a police inquiry,” Clement said, speaking through a translator.
Clement is an old pro at working to honor the memory of Allied soldiers who paid the ultimate price on French soil. About a dozen years ago, he started working to create monuments to members of the 28th around his part of France. 
He will turn 40 on Saturday, the same day as the ceremony, which will have special significance because Clement says it will be the last monument he helps build. Organizing the tributes is becoming increasingly complicated, said Clement, who has worked to preserve the memory of 15 members of the Bloody Bucket who were killed in France during the world wars and an estimated 400 other Allied soldiers.
The Battle
 The 28th Infantry Division didn’t enter the conflict until about a month-and-half after D-Day – July 22, 1944 – and landed at Omaha Beach. At that point, the Allies were building  momentum toward a breakout inland.
The division found itself in hedgerow country (known to the French as “bocage”).
The fighting across the terrain  – made up of farm fields broken up by a series of overgrown hedges and trees that towered above walls of dirt that could reach up to six feet in height— was slow, brutal and hindered any sustained advance.
Six days after arriving on French soil, the 28th suffered its first casualty when an officer was seriously wounded. 
But its biggest test to come was in Gathemo, beginning on Aug. 7.
“The 28th Division troops got their first experience in hedgerow warfare during the fighting at Percy and Hill 210, but they faced a far more intense test a week later at Gathemo and Hill 288, just outside the town,” said Walter Zapotoczny an author, Army veteran, former command historian of the 28th Infantry Division and president of the 28th Infantry Division Association.

Jerome Nadolny and his fellow soldiers in the 109th regiment were among the first American troops moving toward the town around 6:30 a.m. Waiting for them, according to Zapotoczny, was at least half of the German 84th Infantry Division, an 88-mm anti-tank battalion, the 84th Division artillery and other enemy forces.
After hours of heaving fighting and nightfall approaching, three battalions of the 28th dug in – without much forward progress. But, the Germans weren’t done. As the Allies had learned through Africa, Sicily, and Italy, their enemy utilized the counterattack as a favored tactic. 
Major Paul F. Gaynor, who was commanding the regimental anti-tank company described what happened next:  

Three German tanks accompanied by more than 100 infantrymen came out of Gathemo. The tanks were equipped with searchlights which were used to illuminate the area where the men were digging in. Direct fire from the tanks’ guns and machine guns at ranges of 60 to 75 yards caused heavy casualties. The accompanying infantrymen, who were equipped with a large number of automatic weapons, took advantage of the confusion. 
Bazookas were quickly brought into action (by U.S, troops)….the tanks and their infantry support withdrew to Gathemo upon meeting this resistance.”

The next day didn’t yield much gain in ground. The 28th advanced another 300 to 400 yards. The Germans may have been in retreat, but continued to fight tenaciously. It wouldn’t be until the morning of Aug. 10 that American troops entered the town, and by the afternoon Gathemo was liberated. 
“The battle of Gathemo caused the greatest losses and the most resistance up to that point in the 28th Division’s experience,” Zapotoczny added,  “It was at Gathemo that the 28th Division endured its most brutal battle of the Northern France campaign.” 
The cost in and around Gathemo was the lives of nine members of the 28th, including three from Pennsylvania:



















































 
An estimated 235 men were wounded. 
 On Aug. 19, the 77-day Battle of Normandy came to an end with the Germans in full retreat and tens of thousands captured when the Falaise pocket was closed by Allied troops.
“Although not directly involved in the fiercest fighting at Chambois, where Polish and Canadian forces sealed the pocket, the 28th Division’s aggressive advance helped prevent German units from escaping to the east or regrouping, effectively pressing the western and southern flanks of the pocket,” Zapotoczny said.
A mere 10 days after the German defense of Normandy collapsed, the men of the Bloody Bucket were taking part in the liberation day parade throughout Paris.

Tracking down the relatives
As plans for the dedication ceremony took shape, Cory Angell, the retired 28th Division officer, continued to try to reach as many families of the nine soldiers killed in Gathemo as possible to give them a chance to attend in-person or watch it online. 
He spends his spare time researching photos and videos throughout history of the men and women who served in the country’s oldest Army division. 
“We’re kind of a small group, right? A lot of people just retire and move on. There’s some of us that are just diehards and I’m one of them,” Angell said. “I’m an old soldier, retired from the division which I grew up with. Really, the beginning and end of my career was in the division wearing the keystone patch.”
Since Pvt. Irwin S. Fox was from Pittsburgh, he turned his attention to trying to find his relatives. 
Military records show Fox enlisted in the Army on Jan. 9, 1944, just months before the invasion. He was assigned to the 110th Infantry Regiment with the 28th Division. 
Angell started by Googling the names of the nine soldiers. With Fox, he was able to make a connection to Pittsburgh. He then reached out to the Heinz History Center, who put him in touch with the Pittsburgh Jewish Genealogy Society. 
“The guy said, ‘Last I can tell, that family moved to Columbus, Ohio. Let me put you in touch with a guy for Jewish history in Columbus, Ohio.’ And that’s how they go, ‘Yeah, we got him. Here’s her phone number.’”
Soon, he was on the phone with Evelyn Fox Weiner, Irwin’s 89-year-old niece.
“What was a real joy to me and I hope that all those that are involved can really appreciate it when we do find the family members, the three that we found have been amazed and thrilled,” Angell said. “People are like, ‘What? You’re kidding me.’”
‘My grandmother became a Gold Star mother’
Fox was a first-generation American. His grandfather was from Ukraine and his grandmother grew up in Latvia. He graduated from Schenley High School in Pittsburgh’s North Oakland neighborhood. His mom, dad, sister and brother eventually moved to Squirrel Hill. He was married to Josephine Greenberg. A picture from 1944 shows a striking couple – Josephine sporting a knee-length skirt and a clean-shaven Irwin in uniform with his right arm casually, but firmly around her hip.  
He was 29 when he died in combat. 
“He was very loving and nice,” said Weiner. “He was revered enough that my family had another son who was named after him.”
His namesake, Irwin S. Fox, is 77-years-old and lives in Phoenix, Arizona, with his wife. 
He didn’t know much about his uncle until about 1964, when he came across some old photos.
“All I knew was that he was killed shortly after D-Day. I didn’t know any of the details until I saw the gravestone,” Fox said. The headstone is marked with his uncle’s date of death, Aug. 13, 1944. “I just knew from history that he was in hedgerow country in France.”


Irwin Fox and his wife recorded a message on a record to his parents, after Passover in the spring of 1944. The audio and photos were provided to the Capital-Star by his namesake, Irwin S. Fox. (Audio slideshow produced by Tim Lambert)
Fox’s death in Gathemo hit the family hard and Weiner isn’t sure her grandmother ever recovered from the loss of her youngest child.
“I remember the Blue Star in the window in their apartment and their home at that time, if you had somebody in the service, it was a small banner,” said Weiner, who still has the telegram from the War Department informing the family of his death. “Then my grandmother became a Gold Star mother after he was killed.”
When the war was over, families had to decide whether to bring the remains of their loved ones home or whether they would remain buried in Europe. Fox’s mother chose to have his body returned to the U.S. 
In March 1949, he was buried at Shaare Torah Cemetery in Whitehall in Allegheny County. 
A family photo dated Sept. 15, 1964, shows his mother standing in front of his grave marked by an American flag. Her graying hair peeks out from her yellow headscarf and she’s wearing a long, black coat. Her hands are clasped and her face is grief-stricken.
“I think that’s the most poignant picture I have,” Irwin Fox said.

The family is grateful to have learned a little bit more about Irwin’s short time in France, but will not be able to make the ceremony.
“It meant enough, and Irwin was revered enough, then when we found out about it, which was only two weeks ago, that there were 15 members of our family that were ready to go to France, really, to be there at that dedication, that’s how quickly we all wanted to be there to honor and to share what we could with him,” Weiner said. “Due to logistics and complications due to travel, it’s not happening. We all revered Irwin’s service to the United States and what he did and the sacrifice that he made. It totally changed several generations.”
She and Irwin are touched by the gesture of the people of Gathemo. 
“The people actually cared what Americans did and the sacrifice they made (It) had an effect on the world. That is wonderful,” Irwin said. “It kind of renews in me to want to make a difference in the world.”
Weiner said it’s gratifying that the town is remembering the soldiers who died to liberate it from the Germans.
“It never replaces a life, but does it give hope or meaning or set something up for generations to come,” she said.
 ‘Such a rewarding feeling’ 
The next puzzle piece was tracking down another fallen soldier with Pennsylvania connections.
Not much is known about Pfc. Merritt Boyle’s military service. He was from Chinchilla, Lackawanna County, and served in the 109th Infantry Regiment of the 28th Infantry Division.
He’s buried at the Shady Lane Cemetery in Dixon City.

Angell had a lead on another namesake – 53-year-old Merrit Boyle of Old Forge,, who trains athletes, owns a gym and does life coaching.
It turns out, though, that Merrit doesn’t really answer his phone.
So Angell reached out to the 109th Infantry Regiment Association in Scranton and one of their members just showed up at Boyle’s doorstep. 
“I came back from walking my dogs and I locked both doors and I’m setting up my schedule for the day and I heard a banging on the back door. I’m like, ‘Who the hell is banging on my back door?’” he said. So, I’m looking at him and he said, ‘Are you Merrit?’”
The two talked for about 90 minutes about the division, about where Merritt was killed and the upcoming ceremony. The talk started to fill in some blanks for the younger Boyle. 
He had heard some stories about the man he was named after – like how he loved his country and was only in France a short time before his death. 
Like, how his grandmother, Marjorie, who was Merritt’s mother, asked her daughter, Mary, to name one of her children after her fallen son. 
“They weren’t planning on having another kid. I’m the youngest by six years, so I was kind of like a surprise,” he said. “Marjorie went to my mom and said, ‘Look, it would mean a lot for me to keep his legacy alive,’ because Merritt was a very special person to her. You could tell just from talking to her, telling me stories, and I remember sleeping over at her house and she’d be telling me great stories on how he was always into trouble.

The twist is they spelled his name wrong on his birth certificate. As his namesake, he has one “T” in his name. 
“I love that I have that legacy. I’ve always felt a connection to him when I pray at night, I always have that connection that there’s someone watching me,” Boyle said. “That’s why it was such a rewarding experience to find out a little bit more of his history and I learned a lot from talking to many people that were very helpful and getting me up to pace with some of the details of where he was and what happened.”
Boyle said his uncle didn’t get a chance to live his life. 
“I feel him live through me in many regards. …  That I was named after him and (in) his honor and that just hearing how they spoke of him, it made me want to do better,” he said. Merrit does have a wooden carving Boyle made when he was in service and the flag that was put over his coffin when his remains were returned to Pennsylvania. 
He is grateful to know his uncle’s memory will live on in the land where he fell.
“We kind of sometimes today get caught up in the politics and the cynicism a lot of times of Republican or Democrat, all this kind of stuff. To see 80 years later that there’s still appreciation for what those great men did gives such a rewarding feeling,” he said.

The foundation is a private nonprofit organization that raises funds for the Atlanta Police Department, helps with police recruitment and serves as the driving force behind the controversial 85-acre training facility that opened earlier this year after mass protests and crackdowns from the state.
The plaintiffs, Atlanta Community Press Collective and Chicago-based research center Lucy Parsons Labs, had first requested records regarding the training center back in 2023. The requested records included APF board meeting agendas and minutes, budget documents, emails between foundation officials and Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr, and various contracts. However, they received no response from the APF, even as the foundation provided records to news outlets like the Atlanta Journal-Constitution and WSB. 
In a 12-page order released Friday, Judge Jane Barwick ruled that the APF’s decision to withhold the records violated Georgia’s open records laws, stating that “records ‘maintained or received by a … private person or entity in the performance of a service or function for or on behalf of an agency’ are subject to the Open Records Act.”
As a result, “APF was under a duty to provide records to ACPC and Lucy Parsons Labs pursuant to the Open Records Act,” the ruling reads. “Under the authority explained in this Order, no exemptions applied.”
Barwick also emphasized that public records could not be withheld on the basis of which person or group requested them.
“Let the record also be clear that the identity of the requestor does not determine whether records are characterized as public,” she wrote.
However, she declined to award attorneys’ fees to the plaintiffs, reasoning that the police foundation did not “knowingly and willfully” violate the Open Records Act. During a two-day bench trial in April, APF President and CEO Dave Wilkinson testified that he viewed responding to the records requests as voluntary, since he did not believe that the private nonprofit was subject to Georgia’s open records laws. He also argued that releasing unredacted records could endanger the individuals named in those records by exposing them to harassment and threats from protestors.
The press collective applauded the ruling, but condemned the multi-year battle it took to gain access to the records.
“While we’re pleased with the result of the lawsuit, we’re frustrated that it required a lawsuit to confirm what we already knew to be true: the Atlanta Police Foundation should be responsive to records requests regarding its operations for and on behalf of the City of Atlanta,” the community press collective said in a statement on the ruling. 
Joy Ramsingh, an attorney who represented the plaintiffs in the suit, also criticized the police foundation’s initial refusal to provide the records.
“The fact that APF continued to fight even though the law was so clearly established against them, I think shows bad faith,” Ramsingh said. “I think it shows a very political mindset on their part as opposed to a willingness to comply with the law.”
The police foundation also applauded the ruling, saying it “welcomes and celebrates Judge Barwick’s court ruling as a clear affirmation of our role, our structure, and our ongoing commitment to public safety in Atlanta,” and that they plan to “fully comply” with the plaintiffs’ record requests.
Georgia’s shifting public records landscape
The issue of public access to government records has been an ongoing issue across the state in recent months. Last August, the Georgia Supreme Court ruled that private contractors working for public entities are still subject to open records laws, and can be sent requests for public records they may possess. The ruling reversed an appeals court decision that government transparency advocates argued would shield certain public records from disclosure.
The case also prompted new legislation aimed at clarifying Georgia’s existing public records law. Under Senate Bill 12, which was signed into law by Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp earlier this year, requests for public records that involve a private entity must now go through the local governmental agencies that contracted with those third parties. Though a last-minute amendment sought to restrict public access from records of police officers’ stops, arrests and incident responses, legislators in the House ultimately reversed the changes before advancing SB 12 to the governor’s desk.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-04 04:15:55+00:00,CT Mirror,CT Senate sends new biennial budget to Lamont’s desk,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/04/ct-senate-budget-approved/,The CT Senate OK'd a budget that prioritizes children and relies on accounting maneuvers to comply with the constitutional spending cap.,"The Senate gave final approval late Tuesday to a biennial budget that prioritizes children, dramatically scales back a pledged boost to health care providers who treat the poor and relies on accounting maneuvers to comply with the constitutional spending cap.
The Democratic-controlled Senate voted 25-11 along party lines to adopt the $55.8 billion two-year budget, which now heads to Gov. Ned Lamont for his expected signature. But the plan still may be tweaked before the General Assembly adjourns at midnight Wednesday because of problems with a related hospital tax increase.
The package, which the House approved minutes after midnight Tuesday, would boost funds for nonprofit social service agencies two years from now and increase taxes on corporations.
It also eases aggressive state spending controls used since 2017 to build reserves and pay down pension debt faster than ever before.
The budget, which would spend $27.2 billion next fiscal year and $28.6 billion in 2026-27, needed at least 22 votes to pass in the 36-member Senate. That’s because changes to state budget controls must be approved in each chamber by at least a three-fifths margin. 
Lamont, whose administration negotiated the deal, praised it immediately after the Senate wrapped its 10 hour, 40-minute debate shortly before midnight.
“This is a balanced, sensible budget that is under the spending cap, provides predictability and stability for residents, businesses, and municipalities, and holds the line on taxes while keeping us on a sound fiscal path,” the governor said. “While other states are increasing taxes and cutting services, economic analysts are pointing to Connecticut as an example of a state that has worked hard to maintain fiscal stability and make the smart decisions that are critical for economic growth.”
Analysts project Connecticut will be poised to continue saving hundreds of millions of dollars annually to continue paying down its hefty pension debt at an accelerated pace.
A new child care fund and a $200 tax break for poor families
“The budget is, in my opinion, a great investment in children,” Sen. Cathy Osten, D-Sprague, co-chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee, said as she opened Tuesday’s debate. “It’s the best investment in children in our state’s history.”
That involves taking about $220 million from this fiscal year’s $2.4 billion surplus and creating a new fund to pay for future increases in early childhood development programs.
Legislators could spend up to 12% of that fund each year — outside of the traditional budget and spending cap — to support a child care industry weakened greatly by the first two years of the coronavirus pandemic.
Sen. Julie Kushner, D-Danbury, co-chairwoman of the Labor and Public Employees Committee, said the initiative, which is expected to add more than 16,000 affordable child care slots by the early 2030s, would be like a major salary increase for many Connecticut families.
“It’s going to make an enormous difference in their lives,” she said.
Democratic legislators decided the state couldn’t afford a new income tax credit that covered middle-class households with kids. Credits of $600 and $150 per child were projected to cost more than $300 million and $80 million per year, respectively.
But lawmakers did order $250 in new relief for working poor families, which would cost about $35.5 million per year.
Connecticut has about 195,000 low-income households that receive the state’s Earned Income Tax Credit, a program to help the cover basic needs and increase savings. That credit is worth 41.5% of the federal EITC’s value, meaning it adds an average of $1,061 to a qualifying household’s Connecticut income tax refund, according to nonpartisan analysts. 
The new budget stipulates EITC-eligible households with children or other dependents would receive the additional $250. Most filers that receive the EITC have children and earn between $50,000 and $63,000 per year.
Osten noted children also would benefit from the budget’s municipal aid package.
It bolsters the Education Cost Sharing program, the chief grant to support K-12 school districts’ operating costs, by $90 million next fiscal year. 
It not only continues a $40 million increase special education grants ordered earlier this fiscal year but builds upon it, appropriating another $30 million in each of the next two years.
The budget sends a message to Connecticut’s working families, said Sen. Herron Gaston, D-Bridgeport. “You matter. You count, and we are investing in you,” he said, adding, “This budget proves government can still work for the people when the people demand it.”
‘The greatest sin in this budget’
But minority Republicans said the budget is fatally flawed, undermining the spending cap and other budget controls launched eight years ago that ended a string of deficits and tax hikes, built reserves and reduced pension debt.
On paper, the budget narrowly complies with a spending cap that tries to keep most budget growth in line with household income and inflation.
But one accounting gimmick was needed to launch the new child care fund. Another maneuver uses a one-time payment into the teachers’ pension to increase the spending allowed under the cap formula. And a third underfunds contractually guaranteed health care for retired state employees by almost $230 million across two years. 
Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding of Brookfield noted that the final budget would spend nearly the same next fiscal year than would a late April proposal from the Appropriations Committee.
But while that committee plan was set to exceed the spending cap by about $200 million, the final budget is reported to be narrowly under the limit by $1 million or 1/240th of 1% of the General Fund.
“If that isn’t budget gimmicks, tell me what is?” he said.

“It’s really a shell game,” said Sen. Heather Somers of Groton, ranking Senate Republican on the Appropriations Committee. Regardless of whether such moves are legal, they violate “the spirit of the [fiscal] guardrails,” she said.
Those budget controls have added an unprecedented $4 billion to state reserves since 2017 while another $8.6 billion in surplus has been used to reduce pension debt.
But critics say those surpluses, which have averaged $1.8 billion since 2017 — equal to 8% of the General Fund — weakened education, human services, municipal aid and other core programs.
The new budget reduces the savings program that has driven the bulk of those surpluses — a mechanism that has barred lawmakers from spending, on average, $1.4 billion per year in income and business tax receipts. It specifically reduces that savings benchmark by $600 million per year.
“We are breaking our promises to Connecticut residents, and that is perhaps the greatest sin in this budget,” said Ryan Fazio of Greenwich, ranking GOP senator on the Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee, who also protested tax hikes in the budget.
The package would generate an extra $340 million over the coming biennium through adjustments to the corporation tax.
Senate Republicans have been warning for nearly two weeks, since it became clear that Lamont, a fiscally moderate Democrat, would agree to ease savings rules, that reckless spending and tax hikes were on the horizon
“Once you break the rule once, you can break it again,” Sen. Jason Perillo, R-Shelton, said during Tuesday’s debate. “It’s like that first potato chip, right? You eat it and then you can have another and another and another.”
Fazio tried to amend the budget to reduce state income tax rates on poor and middle-class filers, predicting it would save households an average of $650 per year at a annual cost of at least $250 million to the state.
To help pay for it, Fazio said, the state should end Medicaid coverage for undocumented adults and children, which analysts say costs Connecticut about $58 million per year.
But the rest of Fazio’s tax break would be paid for by weakening another budget cap, one that forces the legislature to design its budget with a built-in surplus.
Given Fazio’s “greatest sin” statement, Osten questioned why the GOP would defend some budget caps but weaken another to pitch a tax cut.
Osten also said refusing medical coverage to undocumented residents wouldn’t save as much as some hope, since those residents likely would turn to hospital emergency rooms, which cannot refuse treatment to anyone under state law.
“It’s easy to play the sympathy card,” said Sen. Rob Sampson, R-Wolcott. “We should no longer have a bright neon sign suggesting Connecticut is the place [undocumented residents] should come to.”
Osten responded: “I guess I just look at children in the world as needing health care, and I think we should support all of them.”
Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven, said Connecticut needs to ease its spending controls because “heartless” cuts in federal aid to states being considered by the Republican-led Congress and President Donald Trump’s administration could cost Connecticut hundreds of millions of dollars in annual revenue.
“We are fortunately in a better position than many other states,” because Connecticut saved so effectively over the past eight years, Looney said.
Human services, higher ed feel the budget pinch
Democrats also said the budget, which increases spending 4.6% next fiscal year and another 5.3% in 2026-27, reflects many hard choices.
Payments to doctors and other providers who treat Connecticut’s poor grow by a much smaller amount than legislative leaders pledged shortly after the 2025 session began in January.
The budget allocates $15 million to boost Medicaid rates for most providers next fiscal year. The extra funding would grow to $45 million in 2026-27. 
But leaders initially proposed spending an extra $300 million to providers by 2028-29, starting with a $75 million jump next fiscal year. The state has adjusted such rates in comprehensive fashion since 2007.
The hundreds of community-based nonprofits that deliver the bulk of state-sponsored services to people with developmental disabilities or facing mental health or addiction issues also had to settle for less.
Nonprofits, which sought an extra $264 million to compensate for decades of state payments that haven’t kept pace with inflation, got no general rate hike in the first year of the new budget and $76 million extra in the second.
The biennial package also includes $34 million in the first year and $66 million in the second year for nonprofits that run group homes for residents with developmental disabilities. But the funds for those nonprofits must be used to increase caregivers’ wages. 
The state’s largest health care workers’ union agreed last month to suspend planned strikes at more than 190 group homes and 51 nursing homes after Lamont pledged to boost funding for caregivers in these two service areas.
Lawmakers also included an extra $30 million in the second year of the new budget specifically to bolster nonprofits serving clients with mental health and addiction issues or providing counseling to formerly incarcerated people reentering society.
Meanwhile, public colleges and universities, which entered the current fiscal year with considerable reserves, receive less funding in the new budget.
The Connecticut State Colleges and Universities system, which includes community colleges, four regional universities and online Charter Oak State College, would receive the same funding from traditional state resources next year that it got this year.
But legislators also had given CSCU $140 million in federal pandemic grants this fiscal year, and those funds won’t be available in 2025-26. 
The new state budget also would reduce overall aid next fiscal year by $58 million for the University of Connecticut’s main campus in Storrs and its regional campuses and by $55 million for the health center. Their funding would drop in 2026-27 by another $15 million and $4 million, respectively.
A last-minute adjustment to the tax hospital tax
Despite the Senate’s vote, the legislature’s work on the next state budget likely won’t be completed until Wednesday, the last day of the regular 2025 session.
That’s because Lamont, following a meeting Tuesday morning with hospitals, agreed to slice $90 million off a $375 million tax increase included in the new budget.
The hospital levy is a tax in name only. Connecticut currently collects $820 million yearly from the industry and then redistributes those funds, plus more, back to hospitals. This back-and-forth arrangement, which most states employ, helps Connecticut qualify for hundreds of millions of dollars yearly in federal Medicaid reimbursements.
Back in February, Lamont proposed boosting the tax by $140 million, projecting it would result in Connecticut gaining $94 million in annual Medicaid revenue.
But its future is uncertain with Congress and the Trump administration looking to cut Medicaid spending dramatically. 
Still, Connecticut officials said the wisest course was to seek one more increase before Washington potentially caps this program or orders reductions. And if a $140 million increase might leverage $94 million, a $375 million hike could trigger more.
But hospital officials told Lamont on Tuesday they fear any increase over $285 million might exceed current federal limits on the provider tax program.
House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said legislative leaders had other bills expected to be debated Wednesday that could be amended to support a revision to the hospital tax rate.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025_0603_SR_Session_043-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-04 01:03:57.948928

As a Trumbull resident who owns a single family home, I want to be clear: I do >not feel threatened by the idea of welcoming more neighbors to our wonderful town. For me, it’s just the opposite: adapting underutilized areas and adding more homes, including more affordable homes, is a win-win for the town and its residents.

Thomas Broderick
For those unfamiliar with Reservoir Avenue, the area is already the site of numerous homes and businesses, including multiple apartment complexes. In one direction it leads to Bridgeport, the largest city in the state, and in the other direction you reach Trumbull Center in mere minutes. If anywhere makes sense for new apartment homes, it’s Reservoir Avenue.
Rather than fear-mongering, what Reservoir Avenue needs from the Planning and Zoning Commission is less zoning and more planning. 
This area contains numerous Trumbull residents: where are the plans to build continuous sidewalks (or bike lanes!) safely connecting the area to our center? Where are the bus shelters so people waiting for Greater Bridgeport Transit Bus 6 aren’t standing unprotected on the open grass? We should see these new housing proposals as an opportunity to make sound, strategic decisions about growing Trumbull while actually planning for its future.
I know some of my fellow Trumbull residents think the apartments will take services away from current folks, but the town has studied this and found that it’s not the case. We can also look at calls to the police department and other emergency services and see that the apartments are not straining those, either. Instead, the new apartments are providing new places for recent grads, downsizers, divorcees, and anyone who wants to come to Trumbull and grow our tax base. And in a town with a slowly-dying mall, the apartments are stepping in to staunch the loss of tax revenue as our economy changes and the mall loses value.
From an altruistic perspective, the more people that get to live in a town like Trumbull, the more people that have access to all the opportunities we have to offer. And from a selfish perspective, new residents are new taxpayers, new employees, new customers, and new friends and neighbors. Fortunately, we don’t have to choose between altruism and selfishness, we can do both. Some things in life are truly positive sum, win-win, and permitting new homes is one of those.
Building more homes isn’t a punishment for our town —it’s an incredible opportunity. We can continue to see nearby apartment homes as a threat, or we can envision the new family we’ll invite to our backyard barbecue. We can think of new kids as a risk for Trumbull’s current students, or we can think of the lifelong friendships they’ll make. And we can think of new neighbors as potential drains on services, or we can see them for what they actually are: future taxpayers who will contribute to our town.
I have a positive vision of Trumbull where everyone who contributes to our community can make a home here, but you don’t have to share my worldview to think more homes will be good for our town. The data supports doing what’s right and welcoming more neighbors to Trumbull.
More housing—including more affordable housing—is good for our current residents, good for our tax base, and good and the future families that will call our wonderful town home.

Participants in this program need nursing home level of care but are able to remain in their homes with the assistance they receive from the program.
The State Funded Home Care Program served approximately 4,100 individuals in 2024. The state estimates that this proposal will cut an estimated $400,000 in FY ’26 and $500,000 in FY ’27, from the state budget.
To qualify for the State Funded Home Care program, individuals must be 65 or older, at risk of nursing home placement, and meet the financial eligibility criteria set by the state. Individuals accepted into the program can receive help at home for critical activities of daily living, including bathing, dressing, eating, taking medications and bathing. The cost for providing these services must be less than 50% of the cost of nursing home care. Currently, persons served by the program pay a flat 3% of their monthly costs of care. The budget proposals increase the cost from 3% to 5%, with a cap of $175 per month. The average out-of-pocket cost sharing will increase from $46 to $114 a month.
This increase may seem small to many of us, but through our work with low-income seniors, CT’s Legal Services Programs (CT Legal Services, Greater Hartford Legal Aid and New Haven Legal Assistance) are acutely aware that many low-income elders are working with very narrow margins in their budgets. With recent and ongoing increases in the price of food, energy and health care, any additional cost may be overwhelming. Frail elders may fail to apply or drop out of the program or opt not to receive preventative medical care in order to keep their out-of-pocket costs down.
This would be a shame. Connecticut has worked hard to support elders living in their homes in the community. The State-Funded Home Care Program is an important part of this effort.
Individuals without this service will have an increased risk of falling, being injured or becoming ill. These events can and do lead to emergency room visits, hospitalizations and nursing home stays – some of them permanent.
The consequences of not having adequate levels of home care are costly in both human and economic terms. Aging in place is what people want. It is also extremely cost effective for Connecticut’s taxpayers. Keeping the current 3% cost sharing rate will allow elders to continue to maintain their homes, pay their bills and stay out of hospitals and nursing homes.

The Democratic nominee received 67% of the unofficial vote Tuesday against five opponents, including a police officer who ran as a Republican and four independents – a businessman with ties to south Jackson anti-violence efforts, a 27-year old musician and frequent city council public commenter, a child care development specialist and a conservative talk radio host who publicly dropped out of the race but still appeared on the ballot.
The general election held June 3 did not come with a possibility of a runoff, meaning whoever secured the most votes won, even if they lacked a majority of votes – a requirement only in primaries.
With an 82% Black population that votes heavily Democratic, Jackson’s general elections aren’t typically competitive. Despite chatter that a white businessman named Rodney DePriest was on Horhn’s heels, Tuesday was no exception. Horhn would have avoided a runoff anyway. Political newcomer DePriest had won 28% of the counted ballots Tuesday night.
About 21% of registered voters visited the polls Tuesday, roughly on par with turnout in the primary.

The senator was favored in the race after he claimed victory over incumbent Mayor Chokwe Lumumba in the April primary, winning almost 50% of votes in a field of 12 Democratic candidates and then besting Lumumba nearly 3-to-1 in a head-to-head runoff.
During the primary, Horhn faced accusations that he was a pawn for white business interests and buoyed by northeast Jackson Republicans, a sliver of the electorate, switching sides to vote in the Democratic primary. But it wasn’t convincing to the majority of Jacksonians across the city who continued to support him in the runoff and general. 
The 2025 municipal election marked Horhn’s fourth attempt at the mayor’s seat after he ran unsuccessfully in 2009, 2012 and 2017. His campaign slogan was “Jackson is ready.” 
The lifelong Jacksonian, now 70 years old with more than three decades of legislative experience, argued during his campaign that he was the best man to both secure outside resources for Jackson’s poorly maintained infrastructure and fight state efforts to strip the city of local control.
“I’ve been the go-to guy in the Senate when it comes to fighting that stuff,” Horhn told Mississippi Today in April. “I’m not all of a sudden going to change my stripes and hand over the city.”
Horhn, son of a labor organizer and public school cafeteria worker, served the state as a program manager at the Mississippi Arts Commission, State Film Commissioner, federal state programs director for the Governor’s Office and State Tourism Director before becoming a state senator in 1993. Among the legislative accomplishments he’s touted during this race are securing $85 million for the downtown convention center, $20 million for the Westin Hotel, and $20 million for the JSU Metro Parkway. 
Horhn has focused his campaign on the need to restore basic services and functionality back to the city. 
“I’ve chaired the Senate Economic Development Committee in the past. I’ve worked on economic development for the past 32 years as a member of the Senate,” Horhn said during a candidate forum in northwest Jackson last week. “But let me tell you something, we’re not going to have economic development if we don’t clean the city up. We’re not going to have economic development if we don’t restore trust in our city government. We’re not going to have economic development if we don’t have a plan. And so those are going to be the things that I’m going to focus on.”
During his victory speech at The Plant venue in west Fondren, Horhn said that his team is working on a comprehensive plan that lays the groundwork for goals his administration hopes to accomplish in the next three, five and even 10 years.
“Talk is cheap,” he said. “It is now time for action.”

“I’m gonna say we won, but I mean obviously it’ll probably be contested, I mean it could be contested by the other candidates, and that’s their right to do when you have a really tight vote,” he said. “But for the time being it appears that I won.” 
As of Tuesday night, Foote stands at 1,738 votes with Greene at 1,728, according to an unofficial count that includes in-person absentee votes. Democrat Jasmine Barnes, an auditor at the Mississippi Department of Transportation, is in third with 1,713 votes, a drop off from the 2,465 votes she claimed in the April 1 Democratic primary. 
There will be no runoff as Foote does not need a majority of the vote to win, only a plurality. In Mississippi, municipal general elections do not feature a runoff. 
Election officials will process mail-in ballots until up to five days after the June 3 election, meaning it’s possible the race will not be called until next week. The number of affidavit ballots was not known as of Tuesday night. 
The Ward 1 race was considered the most competitive, with seasoned politicos struggling to predict the outcome due in part to recent demographic changes in northeast Jackson. As of last year’s redistricting, the ward, long considered the city’s “white Republican bastion,” was recorded as having fewer white residents than Black. 
“I’m just thankful for all the voters who showed up and thankful to the competitors for the race that they ran,” Greene, an entrepreneur who runs an online reselling business, told Mississippi Today from a call outside her house, which she said was full of neighborhood kids.

LaDarion Ammons, Barnes’ campaign manager, said that Barnes is in good spirits but they plan to wait until receiving the number of affidavit ballots before making a decision on whether to concede. 
“We think it’s too close to call right now,” he said. 
Foote, the founder of a financial services company, has represented the ward as the council’s lone Republican since 2014. He ran as an independent this year. 
“What a nutty finish,” he said in the parking lot of Bravo, where he got together with a few friends to watch the results.
Foote said he thought the race would be close, so he stopped by the city clerk’s office yesterday to see how many absentee ballots had been filed. The clerk told him there were about 800 for the city and 187 for Ward 1 — 89 of which ended up going to him, he said. 
“I gotta give a special thanks to the people who went to the trouble of going down to City Hall, filling them out and turning it in so they still had their vote even though they were gonna be out of town,” he said. 
Despite leading with a plurality, Foote said he thought Mississippi should change its laws to force a runoff after a general if no candidate gets a majority of the votes, because that would make governing easier for the victors. 
“In this case, I only have 33.6% of the vote and that’s not exactly a resounding majority to say I speak for the citizens,” he said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20185525/3X0A4608.jpg,,,2025-06-04 00:00:19.337635

We need laws and regulations that enable us to thrive —not just survive — and give us a fair shot at growth and sustainability. 
The post Cannabis reform bill is important step forward appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","WE ARE A group of owner-operators of minority-owned, women-owned, social equity, and economic empowerment cannabis businesses from across the Commonwealth and have deep concern about our ability to survive under the currently outdated laws and regulations.  Massachusetts once stood at the forefront of cannabis equity reform. We were the first state to create a social equity program. However, businesses like ours urgently need relief and support to survive in an incredibly challenging market. We’ve built businesses that hire from our communities, reinvest locally, and model what social equity and economic empowerment can look like, but we’re barely surviving due to oversaturation and oversupply. We need laws and regulations that enable us to thrive —not just survive — and give us a fair shot at growth and sustainability. With the current limit of three licenses for any owner, we cannot structure models for growth or provide financial security for small owner-operated businesses. We also cannot raise capital based on the negative narrative around the market. The numbers don’t work unless you’re a vertically integrated or multi-state operator with better profit margins in neighboring states. That’s why we support the recent redraft legislation, titled An Act Modernizing the Commonwealth’s Cannabis Laws, released by the House members of the Joint Committee on Cannabis Policy. We commend House leaders for recognizing the harsh reality that many of us operating businesses in Massachusetts are closing, and for putting forth changes that will give us breathing room and a future. This bill offers something we have not seen in a long time — a policy that actually reflects the realities of running a cannabis business in today’s market. One of the most important reforms it includes is the gradual increase of the retail license cap from three to six. Lacking the ability to scale, we’re permanently disadvantaged in every negotiation with landlords, investors, and suppliers. The current cap stunts our businesses before they can grow. Without bankruptcy protections, some of our businesses will need to go into receivership, and some may even need to file for personal bankruptcy — losing homes and livelihoods. Increasing the license cap gives struggling businesses the option to sell and protect personal, family, and community assets.  The bill also embraces equity joint ventures and employee ownership, paving the way for new investment dollars to come back into the local cannabis market. This gives social equity businesses a path to new sources of capital to stabilize and scale their businesses while traditional sources are still out of reach. Critical guardrails requiring audits of business ownership and strict enforcement of the license caps are also included in the bill. These reforms ensure that changes to the licensing structures will uplift the people and communities they were meant to benefit. The legislation also increases the adult-use possession and purchase limits from one ounce to two — which is seemingly small, but incredibly impactful. It is a necessary step that will help consumers access safe, tested products, boost legal sales, and chip away at the illicit market that undercuts us. Finally, this bill ends the mandatory vertical integration requirements in the medical cannabis program. We need to allow all small and disadvantaged businesses to participate in the medical market without requiring them to control the whole cannabis supply chain or demonstrate that they have capital resources of at least half a million dollars. For medical patients in cities like Boston and Springfield, vertical integration requirements are a huge barrier to access to medical cannabis, which is sold tax-free. This change opens the door for those purchases for those with medical needs in communities with large populations with limited disposable income. This legislation is not a perfect bill, but it delivers meaningful, immediate, and enforceable reforms that will help small, minority-owned cannabis businesses survive today and grow tomorrow. We didn’t enter this industry to be shut out from realizing the original intent of the first social equity and economic empowerment programs in the nation. We entered it to lead and build businesses that reflect our communities and repair decades of harm. This bill gives us a chance to do that.

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)PIERRE – After years of political upheaval, court battles and legislative tugs-of-war, the plan to build a new men’s prison in Lincoln County south of Harrisburg is dead.
Members of the Project Prison Reset work group spent more than eight hours at the Capitol on Tuesday running through possible site locations, building designs, budget needs and public comments before voting unanimously to scratch the original site from its list of replacement options for the aging state penitentiary in Sioux Falls.
Also gone? The former Citibank site in Sioux Falls, a patch of land outside of Huron, a former cheese plant in Grant County – and more than $50 million in cash, spent to prepare the Lincoln County site for a prison that now won’t be built.
The members set a $600 million cap on a penitentiary replacement, budgeting for between 1,500 and 1,700 beds – about the same capacity as the original Lincoln County site, but $125 million under that version’s guaranteed maximum price.
The legislature spent three years dumping money into an incarceration construction fund in the run up to February, the month lawmakers balked at the Lincoln County project’s location and price tag. The project needed but couldn’t secure two-thirds majority support. The failure spurred the creation of the prison reset group by Gov. Larry Rhoden, who’d pushed for the Lincoln County prison.
Now, the task force has asked the state’s contractor, JE Dunn, to study a site in Mitchell, another near Worthing, and state-owned land on the grounds of the Mike Durfee Prison in Springfield and at the penitentiary in Sioux Falls.

House Speaker and task force member Jon Hansen, R-Dell Rapids, said the new parameters are a “departure” from the original plan, but a “necessary step” to find consensus.
“The Legislature has already said we don’t need that big of a prison, we don’t want to spend that much money all in one big shot,” Hansen said.
‘You need to build beds now’
In a report presented to the group Tuesday, consultants with Phoenix-based Arrington Watkins Architects projected that the state’s total prison population will grow by 31.7% by 2036 — from 3,926 in 2025 to 5,172 in 2036. That’s largely driven by the state’s truth in sentencing law, which requires people convicted of violent offenses to serve between 85% and 100% of their sentences, depending on the category of their crime.
Even without considering projected growth in prison population, the consultants said, every correctional facility in South Dakota is beyond its capacity now. The state needs more than 1,500 beds to deal with current capacity issues at Durfee and the penitentiary are needed immediately.
“You need to build beds now,” said Mike Quinn, managing principal at Arrington Watkins.
Report: Tough-on-crime policies could push prison construction costs as high as $2.1 billion

The parameters set Tuesday significantly restrict the project’s scope, said Vance McMillan, senior vice president of JE Dunn. That includes additions to existing facilities or building cheaper, steel-celled options that’ll last 50 years. The original campus-style prison was meant to stand for 100 years.
“A hundred years is out the door with the new budget challenge, in my opinion,” McMillan said.
That “not really” a responsible use of taxpayer funds, Senate Majority Leader Jim Mehlhaff, R-Pierre, told South Dakota Searchlight. But it’s politically necessary.
The $600 million cap is more “palatable,” he said, since it’s roughly the amount of money the state has on hand to fund the project already.
“We have nearly 800 inmates living in a medieval setting,” Mehlhaff said, referencing the penitentiary in Sioux Falls, which opened in 1881 and predates statehood. “We have to do something to correct that as soon as possible.”
Lawmakers prefer building on existing Corrections land
The state engineer and contractors are expected to present designs that meet the new parameters by the task force’s July 8 meeting. Legislators will convene for a special session at the state Capitol on July 22.
JE Dunn will present options, but McMillan said they might not be able to pull together many details in five weeks.
Open process and publicity draw wide range of offers for state prison site

Members of the task force, especially the lawmakers, want to build on or expand upon existing prison sites. Increasing capacity on land the state already uses for prisons avoids the public’s general distaste for a new location, said Rep. Karla Lems, R-Canton. Lems was an outspoken opponent of the original Lincoln County site.
“You take some of the heartburn away,” she said. “Then you just deal with the money.”
JE Dunn representatives said the state could expand capacity at Springfield with new dorms or barracks facilities for around $55 million. A barracks would fit another 420 minimum security beds in an open space filled with bunkbeds.
Members also considered building a compact facility on unused acres at the state penitentiary and adding a second floor to the Jameson Annex in Sioux Falls.
Options to build on existing DOC land is limited and more costly, because it would limit a construction workforce to non-felons, take more time to get in and out of the site, and impact operational hours, said Sen. Ernie Otten, R-Tea. JE Dunn representatives estimated it’d cost more than $130 million to build 192 beds on top of the facility.
“Modifying Jameson is a no-go,” Otten said.

Mitchell leaders pitch site as leading contender
Business and local government leaders from Mitchell enthusiastically pitched their site to the task force. The city brought letters and resolutions of support and said  a prison would drive economic growth.
The site got a tepid recommendation from consultants because it’s about an hour’s drive from Sioux Falls. It’s also located next to several possible escape routes:he interstate, the James River and a railroad. 
The Mitchell City Council unanimously approved a resolution supporting the prison being built in Davison County. 
But division is already surfacing in the community. Mitchell residents voiced concerns at its Monday city council meeting. According to reporting from the Mitchell Republic, some residents are concerned about the prison’s location, parolees released in the city, property taxes and a lack of a citywide vote on the matter. 
Sen. Joy Hohn, R-Hartford, said she listened to the city council meeting and said residents are “just becoming aware of the proposal.”
City officials plan to hold community forums to increase awareness, educate residents about the impacts, and listen to concerns from community members.
The DOC plans to survey its staff to determine if they’re willing to commute to Mitchell or Worthing.
The Worthing site in Lincoln County received a slightly more positive response from consultants, but the only speaker during public testimony who spoke to the location raised concerns about drainage and flooding at the site.
Members remain skeptical of budget restraints, administrative oversight
Several members said they’d vote for the budget restrictions and new plan, but added they might not be able to support a decision next month.
Rep. Tim Reisch, R-Howard, is a former Department of Corrections secretary. He aired “serious operational concerns” about the current administration’s handling of the prison in recent months and years due to recent suicides, overdoses, attacks on correctional officers and gang activity.
Reisch recalled walking through the minimum custody unit during a penitentiary tour and observing that of 230 inmates in the unit, “only nine of them had jobs, and the rest of them were sitting around watching Oprah Winfrey every day.”
“These are inmates that are getting ready to go out and rejoin society,” Reisch said, “and we are failing them.”
Venhuizen told reporters after the meeting he believes it would be easier to manage such issues in a more modern facility.
Sioux Falls Democrats Sen. Jamie Smith and Erin Healy both expressed hesitancy. The budget could limit space needed for rehabilitation and education efforts, they both said.
Healy emphasized that her “number one goal” is to build a safe prison with proper rehabilitation space.
“We absolutely need to ensure that our responsibility for taking care of people is of our greatest concern,” Healy said.

(Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)After the Maine House of Representatives worked until 10 p.m. on Monday, when the Senate reconvened just after 5 p.m. on Tuesday there were bets on how long it would take to get through the remainder of the chamber’s work. 
It ended up being one hour, four minutes and 32 seconds. “Take that, two-hour camp,” Senate President Mattie Daughtry joked.  
A lot of consequential decisions were packed into that last hour, pushing legislation closer to its final disposition than just hours earlier. Here are some takeaways from Tuesday: 
Both chambers
As the chambers move through votes, they often pause as lawmakers interject to voice opinions or request clarity on an issue or bill. 
One such request came Tuesday from Senate Minority Leader Trey Stewart (R-Aroostook) regarding LD 1626, which would establish annual training requirements for schools to provide education technicians and support staff. 
“The reason we tabled this — I don’t even know what day we tabled it on, yesterday, they all blend together — was because the fiscal note currently reads that there is the potential for a mandate,” Stewart said, referring to the requirement such a change would put on schools. 
The fiscal note of the bill currently states that, as written, this would be an unfunded mandate. So, if passed, the bill will inevitably land on the appropriations table, where bills backed by the full Legislature are placed to vie for remaining funds after the budget is set. 
While the bill initially passed the Senate and House without a roll call vote, Stewart said that support was with the expectation that a more complete funding picture would be available before enactment votes. The bill was tabled without enactment.
Sometimes enactment votes are crucial, most often with emergency legislation, which needs a two-thirds vote in both chambers. 
For example, while the House enacted LD 1323, an emergency measure to prohibit the use of neonicotinoid pesticides and the use and sale of neonicotinoid-treated seeds, the Senate failed to enact it with a 22-9 vote. This leaves the bill in nonconcurrence, meaning it will bounce between the chambers until they can agree, or not and then the bill dies. 
Other nonconcurrent matters after Tuesday’s votes: 
The House voted against LD 544, aimed to create parity in the taxation of medicine by exempting sales of cannabis for medical use, bucking the committee recommendation. But Sen. Craig Hickman, co-chair of the committee, moved that the Senate accept the majority report and pass the measure. His motion prevailed 17-15, which now sends the bill back to the House in nonconcurrence. 
Another example is a bill (LD 723) that would direct the Maine Criminal Justice Academy to study the feasibility of establishing a nonresidential law enforcement training program. The House failed to finally pass the bill on Tuesday, while the Senate did finally pass it. While the lower chamber attempted again on Wednesday to secure enough votes for final passage, it failed to do so with a  71-74 vote.
The chambers also failed to agree on LD 1255, which would limit eligibility for the free community college program, which Rep. Shelley Rudnicki (R-Fairfield) described as placing a one-year “guardrail” on free community college, and argued “it’s protecting the taxpayers of Maine.” The House insisted on its position rejecting the bill, which the Senate supported. 
In revisiting a matter that had sat unfinished for almost a month, the House rejected LD 588 — a move that goes against the recommendation of the Labor Committee. The bill seeks to grant agricultural workers the right to engage in concerted activity. The bill then headed back to the Senate in nonconcurrence, as it had passed the upper chamber 21-13 in late April. Later Tuesday evening the Senate insisted on its position. 
Current law prohibits the sale of a beverage to a consumer in a container composed of one or more plastics if the basic structure of the container, exclusive of the closure device, also includes aluminum or steel. LD 1582 seeks to establish a definition of “closure device.” The House passed the bill but on Tuesday the Senate voted it down. 
The chambers also can’t agree on a bill submitted by the the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife (LD 402), which would move the Natural Areas Program from the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry to the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, among other technical tweaks. The House passed the bill with one amendment, while the Senate passed it with another. 
The House followed the Senate by passing LD 598, which would require some pay for employees who report to work and the employer cancels or reduces the number of hours in their scheduled shift. But the bill is now in nonconcurrence because the House further altered it with a floor amendment introduced by Rep. Gary Drinkwater (R-Milford). 
Though Drinkwater said he was skeptical of this bill when it was introduced to the Labor Committee, he said he received a call from a relative who is employed by the local public works department who said he could benefit from it because he is often called in on nights and weekends. The amendment, which committee co-chair Rep. Amy Roeder (D-Bangor) said she likes, would add an exception to the definition of “employee” for an employee of a public employer who is covered by a collective bargaining agreement. 
The chambers also can’t agree on LD 277. The bill originally sought to repeal restrictions on  certain places of business from being open on most Sundays but an amended version is being considered that would instead alter restrictions for grocery stores on Thanksgiving Day.

Growing tables
The number of bills on legislative “tables” now abound. 
As mentioned earlier, the appropriations table, which is managed by the Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee that sets the budget, is where bills that need to be funded are placed for that committee to decide how to appropriate remaining money.
For example, LD 820, which proposes an amendment to the Constitution of Maine to establish the right to hunt and fish, was placed on the table by the Senate on Tuesday after being supported by both chambers. Such a change would ultimately have to be approved by voters, and all ballot measures have associated costs. 
The House took back its initial vote against LD 331, which would direct the Department of Health and Human Services to ensure timely MaineCare reimbursements for hospital cost reports. While the Health and Human Services Committee opposed the bill, the Senate passed it and the House on Tuesday receded and concurred. It also cleared enactment in the lower chamber, securing the two-thirds vote needed to pass as an emergency measure, but the Senate placed it on the table. 
Other bills placed on the table include: LDs 34, 366, 434, 496, 876, 896, 996, 1226, 1287, 1588, 324, 1279.

Mike Dunleavy. (Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)The Alaska Department of Education and Early Development is proposing new rules that could reduce the amount of money that local governments are able to contribute to their neighborhood school districts.
The new rules, contained within emergency regulations published Monday, would redefine a municipality’s “local contribution” — the amount of money a school district can receive from a city or borough — to include “services provided at no charge to a district by the city or borough.” 
That would mean that any time a school activity takes place at a city-owned pool or library, the city would effectively have to charge the school district rent, subtracting rental fees from the amount of money it normally gives to the school district for instruction.
Monday’s announcement comes toward the end of the fiscal year for school districts, many of which are already cutting programs and closing schools because of flat state funding. 
A formula increase approved this spring by the state Legislature over Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s opposition would provide only a small year-over-year funding increase, and the governor could end up vetoing that increase anyway. The state budget isn’t due back from the governor until later this month.
The Department of Education did not respond to requests for comment about the proposal on Tuesday.
If approved by the state school board — something that could take place as soon as Wednesday — the regulations could become quickly effective. Although Dunleavy has announced a freeze on new regulations, the education department already sought and obtained a waiver exempting this new rule from the freeze.
The state education department has been discussing proposals similar to Monday’s rule change for almost a year. 
The new rule is being driven in part by the state’s choice to use $81 million in federal “impact aid” for schools as a replacement for state funding.
Impact aid is distributed to states to compensate for federal land that is non taxable and doesn’t contribute to local property taxes, which typically benefit local schools.
Alaska is the only state in the country to use that federal money as a replacement for state money, rather than an additive. As a result, the state must pass what’s called a “disparity test” — it looks at how much is spent per student at each of the state’s school districts, then removes the bottom 5% and top 5%. The difference between the remaining schools can be no more than 25%.
This year, the federal government warned that the state had failed the disparity test and failed a similar “equity test,” putting the $81 million in impact aid at risk.
The state could have sought to fix the problem by increasing education funding, but it now appears to be reducing funding instead.
Other states send the impact aid to local schools directly, noted Nils Andreassen, director of the Alaska Municipal League, which represents cities and boroughs.
“To further reduce local contributions while taking $81 million from local school districts is pretty incredible to me,” he said.
Making things more difficult for local school districts, he said, is the fact that the change would be retroactive to fiscal year 2025, which ends June 30.
“I think the local governments and school districts would have to go back and re-evaluate all their local contributions,” he said. “It could be problematic, moreso for some than others. … It’s going to be anybody who’s close to the cap. It’s Juneau, it’s probably Anchorage, but also anybody who provides other types of support for districts. I’m thinking Sitka, who just took over the pool. It’s those kinds of things they’re going to be looking for.”
Frank Hauser, superintendent of the Juneau School District, said he’s still trying to understand the pending change, but his first impression is that it could cost the district as much as $2.1 million.
“Why is this (regulation) going through when there’s been a freeze on everything else?” he said.
DEED commissioner Deena Bishop told the state school board on Tuesday that “the local contribution issue started with a headline that said a district is funding outside the cap.”
That alerted the department to a possible problem with impact aid, she said.
“That really is the basis for this. It is an equalizing factor in our formula,” Bishop said, adding that the regulation change will be “shoring up” the limits on local contributions.
“The reason we were proposing these changes … is to help put some siderails to ensure that future tests don’t fail,” said Lori Weed, school finance manager for the Department of Education.
Assistant attorney general Susan Greenlee Sonneborn said the emergency regulations are needed now because school districts are approaching the end of their fiscal year and want the new limits to take effect before the fiscal year ends.
“We believe that by getting this regulation in place within this fiscal year, we’ll limit our exposure to the chances of failing the disparity test for 2027, based on fiscal year 2025 data,” she said.
The state school board is scheduled to take public comment on the regulation change and other items on its agenda starting at 8:25 a.m. Wednesday, and it is scheduled to vote on the proposal before 11 a.m.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/240315-Deena-Bishop-copy-1024x652.jpg,,,2025-06-03 23:01:57.433596
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-04 02:33:51+00:00,CT Mirror,"Relief on electric bills passes House, sent to governor",John Moritz and Janhavi Munde,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/03/ct-electric-rates-bill-house-pass/,"The bill will lower residential electric bills by roughly $100 a year, with small businesses and large consumers of electricity saving more.","The House of Representatives gave bipartisan approval Tuesday to legislation promising some relief for utility customers saddled with some of the highest electric costs in the U.S., fulfilling a key priority for members of both parties this legislative session.
Democrats and Republicans joined together to praise Senate Bill 4, which they said would immediately offer customers savings of 1 or 2 cents per kilowatt-hour off current electric rates. For most residential customers, that equates to $100 or more a year off their current electric bills, with even more savings going to small businesses and large consumers of electricity.
“While this is progress, energy costs are still going to continue to be high in Connecticut, and that requires a whole different conversation around producing energy,” said House Majority Leader Jason Rojas, D-East Hartford. “But we can certainly build off of this [bill] to provide the kind of relief that I think a lot of families were demanding.”
The bill passed the House by a vote of 144-3, after getting a similar bipartisan show of support in the Senate. It now heads to Gov. Ned Lamont, who said he planned to sign it.
“Like many people, I think electric bills are too damn high, and this bipartisan bill is a first step in addressing a complex issue that is the result of policy decisions made years ago by legislators in both parties that have continued to impact our utility rates,” the governor said in a statement. 
The final draft of the legislation did not become publicly available until Monday evening, after several weeks of behind-the-scenes negotiations between Lamont’s office, lawmakers and other key stakeholders.
Republicans initially had pushed for a much more expansive — and expensive — energy package that would have spent roughly $1 billion a year to eliminate the public benefits charge entirely from customer’s bills. That proposal died in the Energy and Technology Committee after failing to gain support from Democrats, who argued it would force unpalatable cuts to other state services.
The ranking Republican on that committee, state Rep. Tracy Marra, R-Darien, said that her colleagues in the minority party were eventually brought into the negotiations as Democrats began to coalesce around a plan. 
“I think this has been an up and down process along the way, and many of you know we weren’t necessarily in the process at the very beginning,” Marra said. “But it is also fair to say that we were brought to the table to have discussions at the end. So I think there’s a lot of bipartisan input.”
Two Republicans and one Democrat were among those who voted against the bill in the House. One of those, state Rep. Bill Buckbee, R-New Milford, said he was concerned that borrowing money to pay for portions of the public benefits charge would “come back and bite us.” 
“I hope I’m wrong, I hope we’re not going to get back here in two years and have to fight this again,” Buckbee said. “But I don’t think it’s going to do what it needs to do for the ratepayers.”
The only Democratic ‘no’ vote came from state Rep. Minnie Gonzalez, D-Hartford, who told a reporter afterward she was “not interested” in discussing her position on the bill.

The last round of changes to the bill on Monday prompted some hand-wringing from House Democrats, especially after environmental advocates said the final draft included a much steeper reduction in incentives for renewable energy sources than they had been led to believe would be in the bill.
The bill made wood-burning biomass facilities, which burn refuse wood to make electricity, ineligible for the highest class of renewable energy credits — a policy supported by environmental groups — but also reduced the amount of credits that electric suppliers must purchase on behalf of customers over each of the next five years.
“We are backing off from the renewable portfolio, and that makes me sad,” said state Rep. Mary Mushinsky, D-Wallingford, who nonetheless voted in favor of the bill. “We used to be a leader in the United States, and we won’t be after this.”
Advocates did succeed in paring back an earlier version of the bill that would have removed an additional $750 million over five years from the public benefits charge to pay for energy efficiency programs. While the bill would have allowed the state to borrow the money to continue those programs, critics argued the plan would have put them at risk of being cut once the money ran out.
“I think there was a really robust conversation about energy efficiency this session, where we were really beating the drum,” said Connor Yakaitis, the deputy director of the Connecticut League of Conservation Voters. “The cheapest or fastest way to save money on your bills is the energy that you don’t use.”
The total amount of savings from the bill was still subject to some speculation and back-of-the envelope math on Tuesday, though most estimates ranged in the hundreds of millions of dollars.
State Sen. Norm Needleman, D-Essex, who led passage of the bill in the Senate, estimated it would save customers $800 million over three years. Jonny Dach, the governor’s energy policy advisor, said it would save ratepayers $350 million a year. 
“It’s not mission accomplished, but it is a powerful example of what the state can do when Democrats and Republicans get in one room with one other and with experts and stakeholders in and out of government to prioritize good policies and families’ budgets,” Dach said in a text message. 
A large chunk of the savings is the result of a plan to use state bonds to pay down the cost of certain public benefits programs, prompting some Republicans to deride them as “fake savings” because they will be paid back by taxpayers, with interest. 
The bill also allows utility companies to securitize costs related to storm damages and the rollout of advanced metering technology. Other savings would come from cost-cutting measures for the installation of electric vehicle charging infrastructure, renewable energy credits and the low-income discount rates offered by utilities.
Jamie Ratliff, a spokeswoman for Eversource, said in a statement that customers could expect to see an average savings of $4 a month strictly off the public benefits portion of their bills. Lawmakers in both parties have estimated higher savings.
“Other aspects of the legislation will need to play out, and it’s unclear at the current time what the bill impact will be, such as the changes to energy procurement,” Ratliff said. “There is higher risk to purchasing power more frequently on the day ahead spot market that could lead to savings or continued cost volatility. We look forward to continued work with policymakers to achieve the best result possible for customers.”
United Illuminating, the state’s other electric utility, released a statement in support of the bill upon its passage in the Senate Monday.
Taren O’Connor, a spokesperson for the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority, PURA, released a statement on Tuesday afternoon saying, “We’re encouraged to see so many people focused on the important issues before PURA and grateful to the legislature for its leadership and engagement on this critical issue.”
The legislation also accomplished an aim of both Republican and Democratic lawmakers who wanted more independence for PURA by moving it out from under the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection for all but administrative purposes.
On Monday, legislative leaders also announced a “handshake” agreement with Lamont to fill two vacancies at PURA that have existed since the authority’s board was expanded to five members in 2019. 
The passage of S.B. 4 caps a year of widespread voter frustration over the cost of electricity in Connecticut. Republicans ran heavily on their criticisms of Democrats’ energy policies in last year’s elections — though Democrats ended up gaining seats in the legislature. During this week’s debate, several lawmakers read letters from their constituents complaining about the costs of their electric bills. 
Earlier in the session, lawmakers also fought over the re-appointment of PURA Chairwoman Marissa Gillet, who was ultimately confirmed largely along party lines. 
That debate followed a lawsuit brought by both of the state’s utilities in January, accusing Gillett of wielding unilateral control over the authority and issuing hundreds of decisions without the input of her fellow commissioners. Gillett refuted those charges and the case remains pending. 
“Frankly, in the past year, the rhetoric has gone way overboard,” said state Rep. Jonathan Steinberg, D-Westport, who serves as co-chair of the Energy and Technology Committee and was one of the principal authors of the legislation.

(File/Travis Bell/STATEHOUSE CAROLINA/Specia to the SC Daily Gazette)A 24-year-old Bishopville City Council member will be the newest legislator at the Statehouse.
Democrat Keishan Scott cruised to victory Tuesday over former Sumter County GOP chair Bill Oden.
Scott received almost 71% of less than 3,700 votes cast in a special election for a state House seat representing all of Lee County and parts of Kershaw and Sumter counties, according to unofficial results from the state Election Commission.

“This victory is not mine alone, but it belongs to all of the people … that got out and exercised their right to vote,” Scott said to cheers at a victory speech broadcast on his Facebook speech.
Scott is the youngest person to be elected to the Statehouse since Rep. Brandon Newton, a Lancaster Republican, won as a 22-year-old in 2016.
But the youngest person in at least modern times to be elected to the Legislature is former Sen. Sherry Shealy Martschink. The Mount Pleasant Republican was elected to the House in 1970 during her junior year at the University of South Carolina, only 14 days after her 21st birthday.
Scott, who won his first election to city council in 2023, will take over the seat vacated by Rep. Will Wheeler, a Bishopville Democrat who announced his resignation in January, just three days into this year’s legislative session.
His surprising resignation left the rural district without a representative for the entirety of this year’s session.
“I can promise you that every day I go into the Statehouse, I will carry the people with me,” Scott, a preacher, said to the crowd moments before leading a prayer. “Because certainly, it’s about people more than politics.”
The election means nothing changes with the Republicans’ supermajority advantage in the House.
But it does restore the number of Democrats in the 124-member chamber to 36.
Wheeler ran unopposed in four of his five elections. The only time he faced GOP opposition was in 2022, when Republicans gained supermajority status in the chamber. The 2024 elections gave Republicans a supermajority in the Senate too.
Oden, who recently concluded four years as head of the Sumter County Republican Party, said in a text to the Daily Gazette he “lost tonight” but “had a ball running.”
“God has something better in store for me,” he added.
Scott’s victory ensured the Democratic Party didn’t lose another seat in the Statehouse.
In an endorsement video posted on Scott’s Facebook, U.S. Rep. Jim Clyburn emphasized Tuesday’s election was a must win for Democrats.
Electing Scott “will be the beginning of a Democratic comeback here in South Carolina.” Clyburn said. “Irrespective of where you live, how old you may be, whatever gender you may be, this is about the future of Democrats in South Carolina.”
Lee County had issues with counting votes in November’s election and recount for a state Senate race that ousted Hartsville Democrat Gerald Malloy, who ultimately conceded ahead of his scheduled challenge.
The state Election Commission sent staff to Lee County to help during the primary, as well as Tuesday’s special election, commission spokesperson John Catalano told the SC Daily Gazette.
In April’s primary, Scott defeated Carl Whetsel, a retired chiropractor and Bishopville City Council member, by 11 votes after a recount.
In the unofficial count done days before, Scott only won by 10 votes. An automatic recount was required under state law since the winning margin was less than 1%.
With Tuesday’s landslide victory, he can officially focus on making a difference in Columbia next year.

MAYSVILLE — On a sun-splashed Tuesday morning, former Kentucky Democratic Party Chair Jerry Lundergan, along with his wife, Charlotte, and several others, heaved shovelfuls of dirt heavenward to break ground for a multimillion-dollar religious garden and 70-foot cross at Saint Patrick Cemetery.
Lundergan, a well-known Lexington entrepreneur who owns several companies in the food services and  hospitality industry and emergency disaster services, wants to turn six acres in the front of the historic cemetery in the village of Washington in his hometown of Maysville into a religious site that he thinks may attract tens of thousands of people each year.
The project will feature a replication of the Garden of Gethsemane near Jerusalem where the New Testament says Jesus prayed the night before his crucifixion. It will contain life-size bronze statues of Christ and the main characters in the 14 Stations of the Cross. They are representations of events in Jesus’ life on his way to his crucifixion. The planned cross will stand seven stories high.

Lundergan is aiming at a completion date of early next April for Easter services and envisions tens of thousands of visitors each year. A minimal fee may be charged but nothing  like the admission prices at the Creation Museum and Ark Encounter in Northern Kentucky that sometimes go over $100, he said.
Lundergan noted that any proceeds would go to maintain the garden and cemetery and support Saint Patrick Church.
Lundergan acknowledged Tuesday that the project will cost several million dollars. No tax dollars are to be used, he said, but the state may sell to the church at appraised value 2 ½ acres of surplus land in front of the cemetery — on what is known as old U.S. 68— to be used for parking.
The bishop of Covington, the Rev. John Curtis Iffert, has leased land to Lundergan, who plans to give the entire garden to Saint Patrick Church once it is completed.
Lundergan unveiled the first Station of the garden at the groundbreaking ceremony that attracted about 120 people. It shows Jesus speaking to Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor who presided over the trial of Jesus and ultimately ordered his crucifixion.
Reto Demetz, an Italian sculptor who designed the statues, was on hand to talk about his work.
Other professionals involved in the project are Lexington landscape designer John Carman of the CARMAN firm and Betty Vento of Mentor, Ohio, who is an expert on religious statues.

But the day belonged to Lundergan, who thanked his wife and their five daughters for their support and said they were fulfilling a dream. Daughter Alissa Lundergan Tibe moderated the hourlong ceremony.
He recalled how he visited the cemetery as a boy with his parents, who attended St. Patrick’s Church, and where he was baptized, married and someday will be buried in its cemetery.
He spoke of his love for the church and Maysville.
His comments received a standing ovation.
The Rev. Augustine Aidoo of Saint Patrick Parish prayed that the project becomes “a beacon of hope” while several public officials touted its potential economic development effects as well as its religious message.
Maysville Mayor Debra Cotterill said the project’s “economic implications are enormous” with many visitors. It is to have a welcome center with a gift and snack shop that will be on the site where the groundbreaking was held.
Mason County Judge Executive Owen McNeil predicted the project “will attract visitors from around the globe,” and state Rep. William “Buddy” Lawrence, R-Maysville, said it will attract national and global attention.
David Cartmell, mayor of Maysville for 20 years and now a city commissioner, said the project will become “iconic” for the region.  “This is a big, big day in Maysville,” he said.
Lundergan plans to post a website soon keeping interested people informed of the development of the project. He said it could be reached by searching for Gethsemane Garden Maysville.

Kennedy Jr. in April to detail the tribal nation’s priorities to improve access to health care and clean water. They also advocated for the preservation and reestablishment of U.S. government programs that have far-reaching impacts for their nation. (Katheryn Houghton/KFF Health News)WINDOW ROCK, Ariz. — Navajo Nation leaders took turns talking with the U.S. government’s top health official as they hiked along a sandstone ridge overlooking their rural, high-desert town before the morning sun grew too hot.
Buu Nygren, president of the Navajo Nation, paused at the edge with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Below them, tribal government buildings, homes, and juniper trees dotted the tan and deep-red landscape.
Nygren said he wanted Kennedy to look at the capital for the nation of about 400,000 enrolled members. The tribal president pointed toward an antiquated health center that he hoped federal funding would help replace and described life for the thousands of locals without running water due to delayed government projects.
Nygren said Kennedy had already done a lot, primarily saving the Indian Health Service from a round of staffing cuts rippling through the federal government.
“When we started hearing about the layoffs and the freezes, you were the first one to stand up for Indian Country,” he told Kennedy, of his move to spare the federal agency charged with providing health care to Native Americans and Alaska Natives.

But Nygren and other Navajo leaders said cuts to federal health programs outside the Indian Health Service are hurting Native Americans.
“You’re disrupting real lives,” Cherilyn Yazzie, a Navajo council delegate, told KFF Health News as she described recent changes.
Kennedy has repeatedly promised to prioritize Native Americans’ health care. But Native Americans and health officials across tribal nations say those overtures are overshadowed by the collateral harm from massive cuts to federal health programs.
The sweeping reductions have resulted in cuts to funding directed toward or disproportionately relied on by Native Americans. Staffing cuts, tribal health leaders say, have led to missing data and poor communication.
The Indian Health Service provides free health care at its hospitals and clinics to Native Americans, who, as a group, face higher rates of chronic diseases and die younger than other populations. Those inequities are attributable to centuries of systemic discrimination. But many tribal members don’t live near an agency clinic or hospital. And those who do may face limited services, chronic underfunding, and staffing shortages. To work around those gaps, health organizations lean on other federally funded programs.
“There may be a misconception among some of the administration that Indian Country is only impacted by changes to the Indian Health Service,” said Liz Malerba, a tribal policy expert and citizen of the Mohegan Tribe. “That’s simply not true.”
Tribes have lost more than $6 million in grants from other HHS agencies, the National Indian Health Board wrote in a May letter to Kennedy.
Janet Alkire, chairperson of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe in the Dakotas, said at a May 14 Senate committee hearing that those grants paid for community health workers, vaccinations, data modernization, and other public health efforts.
The government also canceled funding for programs it said violated President Donald Trump’s ban on “diversity, equity, and inclusion,” including one aimed at Native American youth interested in science and medicine and another that helps several tribes increase access to healthy food — something Kennedy has said he wants to prioritize.
Tribal health officials say slashed federal staffing has made it harder to get technical support and money for federally funded health projects they run.
The firings have cut or eliminated staff at programs related to preventing overdoses in tribal communities, using traditional food and medicine to fight chronic disease, and helping low-income people afford to heat and cool their homes through the Low Income Home Energy Program.
The Oglala Sioux Tribe is in South Dakota, where Native Americans who struggle to heat their homes have died of hypothermia. Through mid-May the tribe hadn’t been able to access its latest funding installment from the energy program, said John Long, the tribe’s chief of staff.
Abigail Echo-Hawk, director of the Urban Indian Health Institute at the Seattle Indian Health Board, said the government has sent her organization incomplete health data. That includes statistics about Native Americans at risk for suicide and substance use disorders, which the center uses to shape public health policy and programs.
“People are going to die because we don’t have access to the data,” Echo-Hawk said.
Her organization is also having trouble administering a $2.2 million federal grant, she said, because the agency handling the money fired staffers she worked with. The grant pays for public health initiatives such as smoking cessation and vaccinations.
“It is very confusing to say chronic disease prevention is the No. 1 priority and then to eradicate the support needed to address chronic disease prevention in Indian Country,” Echo-Hawk said.
HHS spokesperson Emily Hilliard said Kennedy aims to combat chronic diseases and improve well-being among Native Americans “through culturally relevant, community-driven solutions.”
Hilliard did not respond to questions about Kennedy’s specific plans for Native American health or concerns about existing and proposed funding and staffing changes.
As Kennedy hiked alongside Navajo Nation leaders, KFF Health News asked how he would improve and protect access to care for tribal communities amid rollbacks within his department.
“That’s exactly what I’m doing,” Kennedy responded. “Making sure that all the cuts do not affect these communities.”

Kennedy has said his focus on Native American health stems from personal and family experience, something he repeated to Navajo leadership. As an attorney, he worked with tribes on environmental health lawsuits. He also served as an editor at ICT, a major Native American news outlet.
The secretary said he was also influenced by his uncle, President John F. Kennedy, and his father, U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, who were both assassinated when Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was a child.
“They thought that America would never live up to its moral authority and its role as an exemplary nation around the world if we didn’t first look back and remediate or mitigate the original sin of the American experience — the genocide of the Native people,” Kennedy said during his visit.
Some tribal leaders say the recent cuts, and the way the administration made them, violate treaties in which the U.S. promised to provide for the health and welfare of tribes in return for taking their land.
“We have not been consulted with meaningfully on any of these actions,” said Malerba, director of policy and legislative affairs for the United South and Eastern Tribes Sovereignty Protection Fund, which advocates for tribes from Texas to Maine.
Alkire said at the congressional hearing that many Native American health organizations sent letters to the health department asking for consultations but none has received a response.
Tribal consultation is legally required when federal agencies pursue changes that would have a significant impact on tribal nations.
“This is not just a moral question of what we owe Native people,” Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) said at the hearing. “It is also a question of the law.”
Tribal leaders are worried about additional proposed changes, including funding cuts to the Indian Health Service and a reorganization of the federal health department.
Esther Lucero, president and CEO of the Seattle Indian Health Board, said the maneuvers remind her of the level of daily uncertainty she felt working through the covid-19 pandemic — only with fewer resources.
“Our ability to serve those who are desperately in need feels at risk,” Lucero said.

Kennedy Jr. speaks to Navajo Nation leaders and community members after hiking with officials to hear about their health priorities. “I’m going to give you my commitment today that I am available and listening to you,” Kennedy said. (Katheryn Houghton/KFF Health News)
Among the most pressing concerns are congressional Republicans’ proposed cuts to Medicaid, the primary government health insurance program for people with low incomes or disabilities.
About 30% of Native American and Alaska Native people younger than 65 are enrolled in Medicaid, and the program helps keep Indian Health Service and other tribal health facilities afloat.
Native American adults would be exempt from Medicaid work requirements approved by House Republicans last month.
After Kennedy summited Window Rock with Navajo Nation leaders, the tribe held a prayer ceremony in which they blessed him in Diné Bizaad, the Navajo language. President Nygren stressed how meaningful it was for the country’s health secretary to walk alongside them. He also reminded Kennedy of the list of priorities they’d discussed. That included maintaining the federal low-income energy assistance program.
“We look forward to reestablishing and protecting some of the services that your department provides,” Nygren said.
As of mid-May, the Trump administration had proposed eliminating the energy program, which remains unstaffed.

(Photo courtesy of University of Florida)In a stunning move, the panel that oversees Florida’s state university system voted against hiring Santa Ono as the next president for the University of Florida during an extended special meeting Tuesday.
The State University System Board of Governors voted against Ono in a 6-10 vote that followed hours of contentious questioning and debate where Ono was grilled over his past positions on diversity equity and inclusion.
The vote comes a week after UF trustees approved Ono, the immediate past-president of the University of Michigan and sole finalist for the job, which would have paid him a $3 million annual package that included $1.5 million base salary
After conducting a months-long search, UF remains without a permanent president. Former UF President Kent Fuchs has been serving as interim president since former President Ben Sasse resigned last year.
Approving Ono was the only item discussed during the board meeting, which ran nearly two hours longer than originally scheduled. Some members compared the vetting to a court interrogation.
Members mainly asked about Ono’s changing stance on diversity, equity, and inclusion, and how he could carry out Florida’s agenda denouncing DEI, but delved into other topics, like a Christian’s interpretation of original sin and Gov. Ron DeSantis’ COVID-19 response.
“It’s insidious that it feels like pushing a rope uphill when we establish these policies, if a president doesn’t really believe in those policies,” Board of Governors Vice Chair Alan Levine said during the meeting in Orlando. “And it’s a powerful position, you can be an inhibitor, or you can help advance. And so I guess so much of your record reflects your deeply held beliefs, that you have been an advocate of DEI up until recently.”

Ono supported diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives at the University of Michigan, one of the top-ranked public institutions in the country, guiding its “DEI 2.0” initiative and touting benefits of such programs but ultimately closed DEI offices earlier this year.
“It looks to me like you got rid of the program because you needed to do what you had to do with the president’s orders and the funding issues. But you didn’t really push to get rid of DEI,” Levine said.
Ono replied with an answer he uttered several times, that he began looking at DEI when he took office at Michigan, rather than an immediate decision after Trump’s executive order.
Ono told UF trustees last week that he developed his new stance on DEI in the last year and a half after talking with students and other members of the university community. Before, he wasn’t an expert on the topic, which had been universal in higher education, he said, and told trustees his conviction is “rock solid.”
Ono said he mirrors Florida’s evolution with accepting, and then rejecting, DEI.
“For anyone who believes Dr. Ono’s earlier views on DEI, views that many university leaders and civic organizations once shared, are disqualifying despite his evolution and the changes made under his leadership at Michigan, I would remind you that this body adopted DEI strategic priorities as recently as 2020. Like Michigan, the Board of Governors has evolved since,” BOG member Charles Lydecker said, adding that Ono’s previous positions on the topics governors were concerned about “are not meaningfully different from those previously held by this board.”
“The real question is this: Should we punish someone for evolving beyond a view this very body once held, especially when that person has already led one of the nation’s most prominent universities to a different course, a course that mirrors our own?” Lydecker said.
Lydecker added that “There is something fundamentally unjust about cancel culture, and to cancel Dr. Ono would not only be unjust, it would be a setback for the University of Florida.”
‘Forum to interrogate’
The degree of vetting from governors Tuesday was not typical, and is the first time the Board of Governors has rejected a president, the Orlando Sentinel reported.
“I’ve been on this board for five, six years, and we have never used this as a forum to interrogate. And in this case, it feels to me patently unfair,” Lydecker said after former House Speaker and now-BOG member Paul Renner put documents in front of Ono about his past.
At one point, BOG member Eric Silagy asked if any of the governors had expressed interest in the UF presidency.

  UF Board of Trustees Chair Mori Hosseini (Photo via UF)
Mori Hosseini, the chair of the UF Board of Trustees, said yes.
He acknowledged Renner reached out to him asking about the job.  Renner insisted that he reached out to to Hosseini before he was on the BOG. Renner said he would not take the UF job if offered now that he’s on the BOG.
Renner did not recuse himself, although, and voted against Ono.
Ono told the BOG he had made 12 commitments, which include ideological neutrality, solely merit-based hiring and admissions, keeping the university aligned with state government, and upholding state laws and university regulations. He said he asked for those provisions to be included in his contract.
“Doctor, your recent reversal on an entire architecture of ideology is nothing short of incredible,” BOG member and former House Speaker Jose Oliva said. Oliva also voted against Ono.
Hosseini, stood by Ono’s candidacy, and sat next to him during the “interrogation.”
“The bottom line is that Dr. Ono is globally recognized as one of the most respected leaders in higher education, and we are lucky to have him,” Hosseini said.
Ono was previously president of the University of British Columbia and the University of Cincinnati.
GOP pushback
The GOP pushback mounted high enough to reject Ono, who had already stepped down as Michigan’s president.
U.S. Rep. and GOP gubernatorial candidate Byron Donalds posted to X questions related to DEI that he encouraged BOG members to ask, and Rick Scott did the same, Monday evening releasing a statement and questions concerning Ono’s commitment to protecting Jewish students.
After the vote, Scott called the vote “the right decision,” and U.S. Rep. Jimmy Patronis said “I’m happy to see the system work.”
Donald Trump Jr. posted to X “WTF! Have the decision makers at @UF lost their minds!???” calling on BOG members to vote against Ono.
U.S. Rep. Greg Steube sent a letter to BOG members, asking them to reject Ono, “and find a suitable replacement who truly represents Florida values.” After the UF trustees’ meeting last week, Steube said “I’m not sold” on Ono “walking back his woke past.”
The governor’s office appoints six of 13 of the university trustees at each institution and 14 of the 17 BOG members.
“The Board of Governors has a strong history of affirming presidential nominees who received unanimous approval from their university boards to continue this practice sends a message that the Board of Governors values the opinion of their colleagues with the state university system and does not yield to outsiders who post out of context sound bites on social media,” Hosseini said.

Duff could not say why the Mystic Aquarium in Stonington would be getting $795,000 over the next two years, but he knew exactly why the Maritime Aquarium at Norwalk would be getting $1.6 million.
He asked for it.
The $55.8 billion budget for the biennium that begins on July 1 is both a statement of priorities for Connecticut and an exercise as old as the definition of politics: It’s the art of determining who gets what, when and how.
The money for the two aquariums, which sit 88 miles apart at opposite ends of I-95, were line items in a $35 million appropriation for tourism over the next two years. 
“I do think it’s not equitable,” said Sen. Heather Somers, R-Groton, whose district includes Stonington, home of the Mystic Aquarium. “I’m not trying to put one against the other in any way, shape or form.”
Duff said in an interview he would have “no beef” with Mystic getting as much money as the aquarium in Norwalk, but he does not apologize for his success in getting more money for the one in his district.
“I advocate for the aquarium in Norwalk, and that’s my job,” Duff said.
Other attractions getting significant funding included $546,626 in each of the next two years for the Connecticut Science Center in Hartford and $400,000 annually for Beardsley Zoo in Bridgeport.
Somers, the ranking Republican on the Appropriations Committee, quizzed the committee’s co-chair, Sen. Cathy Osten, D-Sprague, about the criteria for the tourism grants and hundreds of other types of grants earmarked for local youth sports leagues, community organizations, theaters, clubs and social groups.
The United Way of Greenwich is getting $40,000; the YMCA of Northern Middlesex County, $142,000; the Boys & Girls Club of Waterbury, $80,000; the Hispanic Coalition of Greater Waterbury, $20,000.
How do groups get on the list?
“That was something that’s been repeatedly asked of me,” Somers said. ”They had to get on there somehow. What’s the best way to be included in Sec. 33 in the future?”
Sec. 33 of the budget is a list of 204 one-year “youth services prevention” grants that range from $2,500 for the Yellow Farmhouse Education Center, Inc., a culinary program in Stonington, to $1 million for youth justice reentry services. They are sprinkled around the state.
Some have a regional or even statewide footprint. Others have a local impact, like the $10,000  grants for the Little League, Babe Ruth League and a soccer club in New London or the $50,000 grants for the Police Athletic League and Hartford Stage in the capital city, whose delegation includes the speaker of the House.
They were the only two senators in the chamber for their colloquy about how earmarks get in the budget.
“It’s a good word,” House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said of “earmark.” 
It conveys the ability of individual legislators to put their mark on a small piece of the budget.
“I think a lot of those organizations are what people see as key to the life and the vibrancy of their individual communities,” said House Majority Leader Jason Rojas, D-East Hartford. “And what seems like a small amount of money for a very small organization is probably a lot to them to allow them to continue to develop services or to offer services.”
There is $30,000 for the Connecticut chapter of the Association of Physicians of Pakistani Descent of North America, Inc., $60,000 for the Milan Cultural Association and $35,000 for the Asian Pacific American Cultural Coalition. All are related to services for and by South Asian and Asian Pacific communities.
“Do doctors really need $30,000 to have an association? They don’t make enough money? They can’t support their own organization without tax dollars?” asked House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford. “So I really scratch my head with that vetting process.”
Sen. Saud Anwar, D-South Windsor, a physician born in Pakistan and trained in the U.S., said in an interview he was behind those earmarks, which will help the recipients expand suicide prevention services among minorities with high rates of suicide.
On the Senate floor, Sen. Rob Sampson, R-Wolcott, said the groups might be providing valuable services, but the process for awarding the grants is ad hoc and seemingly primarily driven by knowing a lawmaker.
He noted that one organization in Bridgeport was the recipient of two grants.
“How was this number determined?” he asked.
“It was determined by the people who applied for it, not by the organizations,” Osten replied.
“I assume we mean lawmakers,” Sampson said.

Chandler, who tried to hide from photographers, was sentenced to consecutive life sentences without a chance for parole for 50 years. (Pool photo Evert Nelson/Topeka Capital-Journal)WESTMORELAND — Family and friends of the late Mike Sisco and Karen Harkness sat in a courtroom gallery Tuesday for sentencing of Dana Chandler to consecutive life sentences without an opportunity for parole for 50 years for shooting the couple to death while they slept.
It was an emotional closure to a legal odyssey that began July 7, 2002, with the murder of Chandler’s ex-husband, Sisco, and his fiancee, Harkness, in Topeka. The murders fractured the respective families and frustrated investigators until Chandler was charged in 2011 after detectives built a case anchored in circumstantial evidence.
Chandler’s first conviction in the double-homicide was overturned by the Kansas Supreme Court due to prosecutor misconduct that culminated with disbarment of an attorney. A second trial ended in a hung jury. The third — moved to Pottawatomie County in search of an objective jury pool — led to a conviction in March on two counts of first-degree murder.
Chandler’s daughter Hailey Seel, who was 17 at the time of her father’s death, faced her mother in court to offer a personal accounting of the torment she endured for a majority of her life.
“I truly see her now as the evil killer,” Seel said. “I hate it. I don’t want to call you evil killer, but I can’t live in a fairy tale.”
She urged Shawnee County District Court Judge Cheryl Rios to have mercy on Chandler if the defendant expressed remorse after decades of denying responsibility for the deaths.
Chandler, who held a handful of papers against the left side of her face throughout the proceeding in an attempt to block the view of photographers, delivered about two hours of combative and bombastic remarks after condemned in victim impact statements by Seel and her brother, Dustin Sisco, and others who knew the deceased couple well.
Chandler’s minutia-filled presentation, which featured a series of comments denying guilt and revealed her intent to appeal, included allegations Judge Rios as well as Topeka prosecutors and police investigators, witnesses at trial and even a court reporter engaged in unethical behavior to bring about the convictions.
“I have always maintained my innocence,” Chandler said. “I continue to maintain my innocence. I was not in Topeka, Kansas, on July 7. I never owned or possessed a 9 millimeter firearm. What is happening in this courtroom is a grave injustice.”
Rios ordered exactly what Deputy District Attorney Charles Kitt requested — a pair of consecutive life sentences with a minimum of 25 years in prison on each count before eligible for parole.
Rios said she didn’t personally know the victims, but said she saw them through the eyes of witnesses who took part in the sentencing hearing.
“I understand that there are no words that this court can say to change what happened, to bring back Mike and Karen, to be able to live all those missed moments,” Rios said. “I understand that there is no justice in that sense.”
The murders without a clear perpetrator and the resulting courtroom drama was presented to a national audience by “48 Hours.” Lack of physicial evidence connected Chandler to the crimes raised doubts, but Chandler’s behavior did raise suspicions.
Shawnee County prosecutor Jacqie Spradling nevertheless won the initial 2012 trial, but did so by lying to the jury about nonexistent evidence. The state Supreme Court overturned that conviction and disbarred Spradling from the practice of law.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Hailey-Seel-daughter-to-chandler-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-03 21:03:14.611521

(Photo by Lauren Harrison, Colorado State University)On the morning of July 23, 2024, visitors to Biscuit Basin, about 2 miles northeast of Old Faithful Geyser, had to scramble for safety as a hydrothermal explosion occurred from Black Diamond Pool. The plume from the explosion rose 400–600 feet into the air, was visible for miles, and threw rocks that destroyed the nearby boardwalk and littered the landscape with debris.
The rock ejected by the explosion was made up of glacial debris, sandstone and siltstone, all of which are part of the geological deposit that makes up the immediate subsurface. None of the rhyolite bedrock was found, indicating that the explosion was rooted at very shallow levels (probably within 100 feet of the surface).

Also present in the debris was impermeable silica that was probably lining the hot water conduits feeding Black Diamond Pool. Silica is dissolved in much of the water that feeds Yellowstone hot springs and geysers, and as that water nears the surface and cools, the silica precipitates out as a solid. It can coat the conduits and, because it is impermeable, can seal the system.
This can cause pressure to build and might eventually lead to an explosion, like the one that occurred on July 23, 2024.
In the weeks and months following the explosion, scientists from several institutions collaborated to install temporary monitoring stations around Black Diamond Pool, including trail cameras, seismometers, acoustic sensors and electromagnetic instruments. The cameras often recorded changes — for example, that new rocks had been ejected from the pool — and the seismometers and acoustic sensors detected several dozen eruptions from the pool.
Some of the eruptions were associated with surges of water that knocked over seismic nodes and moved them from their original locations or partially buried them in silt.
At least two small eruptions, expelling water, mud and small rocks 20–30 feet into the air, were witnessed since the July 23, 2024, explosion. One occurred on Nov. 5, 2024, while scientists were collecting gas samples. Another took place on Jan. 3, 2025, and was observed by a tour group that was passing by the area.

Since the July 23, 2024, explosion, Biscuit Basin has been closed to public visitation as Yellowstone National Park assesses damage and the potential for future hazardous events. To aid with the assessment, on May 14, 2025, Yellowstone Volcano Observatory scientists installed a new webcam in Biscuit Basin. Static images from the camera are publicly available at https://www.usgs.gov/media/webcams/biscuit-basin-webcam, with images updated every 15 minutes.
The camera is a temporary deployment installed on the damaged boardwalk, so the picture is somewhat tilted due to the slope of the boardwalk itself. Nevertheless, the view of Black Diamond Pool is clear, and the camera has pan, tilt and zoom capabilities that allow the frame to be adjusted if activity warrants.
Because the deployment is not intended to be permanent, the camera might fail due to problems with power or telemetry systems. If this happens, we will work to get the camera back online as soon as possible. The camera is intended to operate at least throughout the summer of 2025, and if warranted may be hardened to last throughout the winter months.
Bandwidth at the site is not sufficient at this time to support live streaming, but video is being recorded on site. If the static images document the occurrence of an event (based on the appearance of new rocks or wet ground, for example), video can be downloaded for analysis. If any such events are captured, we’ll be sure to post video clips to the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory website.
We hope that this new view is of interest to the public, and we are confident it will provide a new perspective on activity at Black Diamond Pool that will be useful for the ongoing assessment of hazards from the area. Many thanks to Yellowstone National Park for supporting this deployment, which was completed under research permit YELL-2025-SCI-5842.
Biscuit Basin remains closed due to the damaged caused on July 23, 2024, as well as hazards posed by potential future hazardous hydrothermal events. So for those who would like a current close-up view of Black Diamond Pool, check out the observatory’s new camera! And stay tuned for more details about the July 23 explosion and subsequent activity as research efforts continue.

(Photo by Travel South Dakota)Hunters bagged more pheasants last fall in South Dakota than they have for 13 years, the state department of Game, Fish and Parks said Thursday.
More than 1.3 million roosters were harvested during the 2024 pheasant hunting season, the department said, with another 380,000 harvested within defined shooting preserves.
“The 2024 South Dakota pheasant season was absolutely spectacular,” South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden said in a press release.
South Dakota, the governor said, is “truly the greatest state to pheasant hunt.” The state saw more roosters harvested in two weeks of October 2024 than any other state during their entire season, the release says.
South Dakota’s postseason pheasant harvest figures come from 15,000 random surveys of resident hunters and 13,000 nonresident hunters, the Mitchell Daily Republic reported Tuesday. Questions include the number of days hunted, areas hunted and how many birds were harvested are all part of the survey.
Pheasants Forever launches new initiative to expand outdoor access in South Dakota

More than a million birds have been harvested in each of the past five years in South Dakota, but Upland Game Biologist Alex Solem of the parks department told the Republic that 2024 stood out.
“Our over-winter survival was absolutely phenomenal,” Solem told the Mitchell publication. “It was certainly evident just driving around this spring, tons of roosters crowing everywhere, lots of hens selecting those roosters for mating purposes.
Pheasant hunting is an economic engine for South Dakota. Pheasants Forever, a private conservation organization, put the financial impact of the 2023 pheasant season on the state’s economy at $281 million.
The release from Game, Fish and Parks on Tuesday did not include a financial impact estimate of the 2024 pheasant season, instead focusing on bird harvest numbers. Hunters averaged approximately nine birds per hunter, said Kevin Robling, secretary for the parks department.
“Habitat and access have been a top priority for the department, and that has played a key role in both abundant bird numbers and ample locations for hunters to target them,” Robling said in the press release.
Landowners and farmers partner through habitat programs to open conservation land, using programs offered by the State of South Dakota, the federal government, and multiple conservation groups.
Pheasants Forever partnered with the state in 2023 to pay landowners additional stipends for enrolling land in conservation programs, with the goal of adding 10,000 acres a year.
In the press release on the 2024 pheasant harvest, Robling pointed specifically to the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP) on the James River and Big Sioux River valleys, which provides the benefits of the long-standing Conservation Reserve Program, but also ensures access for hunters. 
“These CREP lands are directly in the primary pheasant range and provide high quality grassland habitat and access as well,” added Robling.
The 2025 pheasant season in South Dakota will take place Oct. 18 to Jan. 31, 2026.

But the amended version passed with bipartisan support.,"A bill that increases consumer protections for mobile home residents was stripped of any references to rent caps or fee limits and passed the House of Representatives on Tuesday evening.
Lawmakers spent hours discussing House Bill 5428 last week, only to end debate without a vote after Republicans opposed limits to annual rent increases. After Democrats amended the bill, it passed with bipartisan support 132-16.
“This bill will still deliver critical consumer protections to some of our most vulnerable residents in Connecticut, so I urge my colleagues to support this bill and stand up for Connecticut’s manufactured home communities,” said Rep. Rebecca Martinez, D-Plainville, the bill’s proponent.
The House proposal would require park owners to disclose any ancillary fees, such as extra costs to own a pet or have a washer and dryer, ahead of time, and increase relocation payments for residents from $10,000 to $20,000 if the owner sells the park with the intent to turn it into something else, among other measures.
It would also require that park owners test the power of fire hydrants on their properties and report the results to fire marshals, a measure added in the wake of two fires at parks in East Hartford that were difficult to control because the hydrants didn’t have enough water pressure.
In recent years there has been a push from homeowners to get legislation passed that would limit rent increases and address other quality of life and safety concerns at mobile home parks.
The parks are typically occupied by people 55 years and older and are a lower-cost way to buy a home.
“The revised version, as I understand it, eliminates many of the concerning pieces,” said Rep. Steve Weir, R-Hebron. Weir was one of the most vocal opponents of the bill last week, but Tuesday voted in favor.
In its earlier form, the bill would have limited annual rent increases to 2% of rent plus any increases in the annual consumer price index and provide a process for park owners to appeal that limit in particular cases. It also would have limited ancillary fees to $15 annually.
As debate went on last week, Democrats decided to pull the bill from consideration, and leadership said they realized it was going to be talked about for a long time. As the session draws to its Wednesday close, the minority party has more power by talking longer and limiting the number of bills that get passed or killing bills entirely with the promise of a filibuster.
The bill is part of a larger push over the past few years to improve the quality of life and limit housing cost growth at mobile and manufactured home parks, which are typically occupied by seniors. In most mobile home parks, the resident owns the actual structure but not the land it sits on.
Land rents have risen for Connecticut residents over the past few years as more investor-owned and large companies purchase the parks.
In 2023, Connecticut lawmakers passed a law that aimed to make it easier for residents to buy their parks. If a property goes up for sale, resident associations must be offered the chance to match any offers and purchase their park.
But residents have said owners have found ways around that law by creating complicated purchasing structures or selling the parks as part of a package of several properties.
The bill next heads to the Senate for a vote.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_4443-2-1024x665.jpg,,,2025-06-03 21:03:14.611521

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)EXIRA — “We did run out of water at our house … and that’s not the first time we’ve had dry pipes,” Emmy Benton said to State Auditor Rob Sand at the Exira Public Library during a discussion about recent water system shortages and boil advisories. 
Sand listened to the concerns as part of a gubernatorial campaign swing through rural Iowa, but problems for Exira, and other customers on Regional Water Rural Water Association’s system, have been ongoing for several years.

Tom Kallman, the association’s general manager, said since the flood of 2019 water tables in the region have been 10-12 inches below average, and the persistent drought conditions have meant no replenishment for groundwater stores.
Customers in the system have been on water conservation advisories during most of this time, and since May 14 have been on advisories to boil all drinking water after shortages created a loss of pressure from the systems. The recent advisory has led to frustration with the system, especially in Exira. 
Boil advisories for almost all of the system have been lifted following negative sampling results, and Regional Water is now looking to a nearly completed pipeline connection to Council Bluffs to adequately supply water to the system.  Exira officials and residents, however, are skeptical that this will be the end of their water-related problems. 
Hindsight on a stressed water supply
Exira officials allege Regional Water oversold the system, which has led to their perennial water issues. 
Kellman said “that was not the case” but that drought conditions in eight of the last 10 years have created a situation which no one predicted.
“If they had known (then) what you know now, 20 years later, they would have probably made a different decision,” said Kellman, who has been with the association for nearly four years, referring to previous management.

Regional Water Rural Water Association has 2,600 connections and serves around 750 square miles in Shelby, Pottawattamie, Audubon, Cass and Harrison Counties.
 Exira is the newest addition to the system, according to Kellman, and came on in 2005 after an engineering study revealed it would be more cost effective for the town to join the rural water district than to rehabilitate its failing water treatment system. 
Meg Andersen, Exira’s city clerk, said the city of 763 people could not fund a solution without the help of funds from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Rural Development office which were only available if the city decided to join Regional Water, to which they signed a 40-year agreement. 
“You have no option,” Andersen said. “And now all of a sudden, we’re realizing this is an unsustainable source.”
But the past three years, especially, have left the town frustrated with their perennial water issues.
“We’re not trying to fight — we want to make sure that the people in this town have water,” Andersen said. “It’s a right and a basic human need.” 
Connecting to Council Bluffs
Kellman said the system has relied almost entirely on its shallow well field, which has made the most sense, given that the region does not have a surface-water source sufficient enough to tap. The association explored drilling a deep well, but found it would require drilling down between 2,000 and 3,000 feet, with just a 40% chance of striking water.
The other option, which the system decided to pursue, involves an 18-mile pipeline to connect with the system in Council Bluffs and pump water into Regional Water’s system. 
Kellman said the pipeline project was approved for federal funding and construction began last October. A temporary pump for the station is projected to be completed on or about June 11th and will bring some respite to the wells and customers in the system. The permanent pump for the system should be completed by October 2025. 
“We’ll be able to serve everybody without having to be in any kind of water restrictions,” Kellman said of the expected result of the pipeline project. 


Kellman said drought was the primary reason the wells are no longer able to meet demand, but he also pointed to the consistent use and installation of drainage tile to agricultural fields as part of the problem. 
He said tile is great for farmers, as it drains excess water from their fields, but in doing so, it stops the natural process of water filtering through the soil to replenish the stores from which utilities can draw water. 


Council Bluffs has an abundance of water, as its source is the Missouri River. 
Andersen said that while the town of Exira hopes the Council Bluffs project will be successful in alleviating their water problems, she is skeptical. 
“The questions we’ve asked in the past three years — we have never been given transparent, clear, concise answers to, and they change,” Andersen said. 
Her mistrust of the association has been exacerbated by a lack of clear, or consistent communication between Regional Water and the city.
“We’re told ‘you have to communicate,’ but they don’t even give us a call when we get put into a boil advisory,” Andersen said. 
She said the association has also given conflicting answers on how Exira rates would be impacted by the pipeline expansion, which makes it difficult for a city with slim margins to plan its budgets. 
“We’ve said we want to work towards a solution, to negotiate these things, but it doesn’t seem like much is coming to the table from the other side,” Andersen said. 
Since the town is locked into a 40-year contract with Regional Water, and its own water treatment facility has been sold, Exira is left with few options. The city sent a demand letter to Regional Water and is exploring legal options to leave the contract. 
Sand says “Exira matters” 
In the meantime, some residents, like Benton, who lives west of the city limits, have decided to reactivate their own wells. 
Other residents, like Claire and Blake Asberry, wonder whether they’ll be able to realize their plans of opening a coffee shop and mercantile in town, or if they’ll be able to find tenants for the adjoining apartments when potable water is a question.

Sand, a Democrat from Decorah, listened to the experiences of the Exira residents and said it should be a crisis to which state leaders pay more attention. 
“Exira matters,” Sand said. “I think anyone in Iowa that’s facing problems like this should have their problems fixed. Government is supposed to work for everybody.” 
Sand took issue with the expensive steps city officials said they would have to complete in order to change the current situation. 
“Instead of prioritizing the process, prioritize the people,” Sand said. 
Kellman said customers have been under water restrictions for the “better part of three years” and he understands the frustration. 
“It gets old after a while, and I get that because I’m on this system,” Kellman said. “It’s not our intention to try and deny people water. On the contrary, we want everybody to have as much water as they need, as much water as they would like.” 
The towns impacted by the May 14 boil advisory included Avoca, Persia, Panama, Portsmouth, Westphalia, Kirkman, Tennant, Earling, Exira and Brayton.
While boil advisories for all of the impacted towns aside from Panama and Portsmouth had been lifted as of Tuesday afternoon, the customers are still under “level yellow” water-use restrictions which means they are asked to avoid watering lawns, washing cars, filling pools, cleaning streets or sidewalks, and school physical education activities that require showering. 
Kellman said the system is “almost there.” 
“I’d love for people to be able to fill their pools in their backyard for their kids,” Kellman said. “At some point we’re going to be able to do that, and it’s a lot closer now than it was two years ago.” 
Andersen said the Council Bluffs pipeline would be a “best-case scenario.” 
“We haven’t had a best-case scenario in over three years,” Andersen said. “We’re not opposed to it working — we’re looking for a solution that ensures sustainability and longevity of a safe water source for the city.”
