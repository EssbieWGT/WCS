But when we arrived as political refugees fleeing the Cuban revolution in December 1967, Latinos were hard to find, Cubans in particular. If we heard someone speaking Spanish at the grocery store, we ran in their direction and dragged them back to the house for a cafecito.  
How we ended up in Nu Hamcher, rather than Miami or New Jersey, where so many Cuban refugees had settled by then, is an odd yet typical immigrant tale. That we ended up here turned out to be gift, a stroke of luck that delivered us into a community where we would thrive and remain for five decades and counting. My new memoir, “Property of the Revolution: From a Cuban Barrio to a New Hampshire Mill Town” celebrates our immigrant journey, the strength required to uproot yourself from one world and persevere in a foreign land. Luckily, for us that was Nu Hamcher.

Like many immigrants, we followed the trail blazed by another family from home. That family, two parents and six children, neighbors from our Havana barrio, had been sponsored at a refugee processing center by a Baptist church in New Hampshire a few years earlier. When they heard through the Cuban grapevine that we’d made it out, they found us and encouraged us to come north. Lots of good factory jobs — they said — good schools, room for the kids to play, and nice people. The snow is a problem, though. And it was. The day after we arrived a blizzard dropped 18 inches of snow on Nashua, terrifying the adults and thrilling us kids.
For my parents, grandmother, and aunt and uncle, New Hampshire’s Live Free or Die felt more like a prayer than a motto. Our working-class family had just faced that moral dilemma in Cuba and had found another option — an excruciating one for a multigenerational family that lived doors away from each other. They would flee the revolution that had flipped Cuba the hell over.
Like most Cubans, the viejos, elders, had initially supported the 1959 revolution. Fidel Castro had denied any communist ties, promised free elections, and the restoration of Cuba’s 1940 democratic constitution. Instead, he ushered in a military dictatorship that turned out to be more brutal than Batista’s.
Life stopped being about living; it became about politics and proving your revolutionary fervor at work, in school, on the street. Neighbor denounced neighbor. Depuraciones, cleansings, became routine, instructing wayward revolutionaries to return to the fold by “volunteering,” working harder, sacrificing more, demonstrating their loyalty to Fidel and la patria, homeland. Food disappeared from shelves. Ration cards were issued. For the first time in the republic’s history, Cubans needed permisos, exit visas, to leave the island.
Gusanos, worms, the government’s term for people like us who opposed the revolution, were persecuted with impunity. They lost their jobs, were expelled from schools, faced angry mobs outside their homes, lived in fear.
The viejos had found a snowy haven from that political storm. Not only was New Hampshire’s motto spot on, they felt safer knowing the Canadian border was just a short drive away. If America erupted into violence and revolution, they’d be able to escape quickly. 
And a revolution looked imminent in late 1967. Vietnam War protestors seemed to revere Fidel and Che Guevara, were evidently unfazed by the lack of free speech in Cuba they would never tolerate here, and silent about the extrajudicial executions still underway back home. Many said they were Marxist-Leninists. And America’s longstanding racism had sparked race riots across the country and a Black political movement that proposed revolution as the solution. 
The months after we arrived brought us the Tet Offensive, increasing political unrest, the assassinations of Martin Luther King and Robert F. Kennedy. The viejos watched Walter Cronkite warily and came up with their own motto: keep the Studebaker’s tank full.
But we’d been lucky so far. Maybe it would hold. After years of waiting for their exit papers — without jobs, jobs were for revolutionaries, not gusanos — the regime had granted eight members of our family exit visas. We’d flown to the U.S. on one of the Johnson administration’s Freedom Flights, the largest refugee airlift in American history. Two Pan American flights a day flew almost 300,000 Cubans to new lives in the U.S. from 1965 to 1973. My father’s nightmare of having to put us on a boat and head to sea had not come true.
Gusanos of our era knew they’d have to leave everything behind. We could take only a change of clothes for each member of the family when we left. Our family of factory workers never had much material wealth. The true cost of leaving was breaking four generations of our family apart, knowing we’d never be able to return, that they’d probably never get out. That we’d never see them again.
But we were free. We lived in Libertad now. We were making our way at work, at school. We faced some racism and bigotry, but the overwhelming majority of Nashuans were curious about us, friendly, helpful. 
A man named Ray Flanders let us rent a house he owned without putting down a deposit. He was a foreman at the rubber boot factory and offered jobs to all the adults. “Pay me the rent after you get your first paychecks,” he said. The four viejos were working the assembly lines in no time. 
One of their co-workers, Terri, taught my mother how to drive and filled the house with laughter each time she visited. Another co-worker, Thelma, took us on epic outings to the White Mountains and showed us how to roast marshmallows and swim in freezing water. Thelma usually let me ride in her blue Volkswagen Bug, a Cuban caravan trailing behind us.
When the Studebaker my father had borrowed from the other Cuban family broke, he couldn’t afford to pay the mechanic’s bill. Peter, a first-generation Lithuanian immigrant, told him not to worry. “Pay me something each month. We’ll get there.” And they did. 
We made our way, too. My grandmother held the household together while the adults worked at different factories. My aunt, who’d snuck her Ph.D. diploma out of Cuba in the lining of her bra, was soon teaching Spanish at Nashua High School, where she taught for 30 years. My mother landed a job at a small CVS on Main Street and, about five years later, became the manager of the massive CVS at the Nashua Mall. We kids held our own at school, in the town band, and in sports.
After three years, the viejos had saved enough to buy a yellow duplex on Hunt Street. The house filled with Cubans of all ages, our family and the handful of Cuban families who joined us in Nashua. There were two dogs, the hundred or so canaries my father bred in a basement aviary, Cuban music — thanks to the records our relatives brought us from Miami — and americanitos who liked the mayhem. Abuela’s pressure cooker rattled on the stove every day and she rattled with it, warning us in stressed-out Spanish it would explode if we kept running in the kitchen.
But becoming Cuban American wasn’t easy. The viejos ached for their own viejos, still in Cuba, amid growing misery and isolation. We all faced our share of racism and bigotry, especially my father at his factory jobs. But my aunt encouraged us to feel sorry for the seborucos, blockheads, who were so ignorant they didn’t understand how amazing Cubans were, our history, literature, music. Focus on the good Americans. There are plenty. 
We’re in a different world today. For people like us, who benefited from our timing as refugees — fleeing a communist dictatorship in the middle of the Cold War — and were generally welcomed, this administration’s anti-immigrant policies fill us with both gratitude for what we were spared and refugee guilt for what newcomers face. There but for the grace of U.S. immigration law go we.
We need orderly and humane immigration policies. We lost control of our borders for too many years. But what’s happening now is sweeping up the innocent with the guilty.
Former Cuban political prisoners, dissidents, and activists who came to the U.S. in recent years legally, through a temporary parole program, have been deported to Cuba. Tens of thousands of Cubans — and Haitian, Venezuelan, and Nicaraguan — parolees are still facing imminent, sweeping deportations.
The plight of immigrants today makes me even more grateful for the New Hampshire welcome we received 58 years ago. I believe most Americans are more than capable of that welcome. Some may not know it. But when they meet an immigrant family, live near them, work with them, see them as a mother, father, grandmother, and children — just like theirs — I believe New Hampshire’s Rays, Terries, Thelmas, and Peters will surface in them, and show them the way.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/anacolumn-1024x767.jpg,,,2025-04-23 05:01:07.898536

Front Street, Columbus, Ohio. (Photo by Graham Stokes for Ohio Capital Journal. Republish photo only with original article.)The Ohio Supreme Court heard arguments Tuesday in a case that centers around whether a same-sex couple shares parenting rights to children born through artificial insemination while they were in a relationship in the same way a heterosexual couple would.
The court is taking up a challenge to a First District Appeals Court decision in which the appellate court ordered a legal “would-have-been-married” test to decide whether things would have been different if the couple’s potential marriage had been recognized in Ohio.
Priya Shahani and Carmen Edmonds were in an 11-year relationship, and three kids carried the hyphenated last names of the two when they were together. Attorneys say marriage was discussed, Edmonds’ lawyer said she proposed and Shahani said yes. But a trip to Boston that could have ended in marriage did not, and their home state didn’t recognize same-sex marriage. Ohio also doesn’t recognize common-law marriages that occurred after 1991.
The U.S. Supreme Court decision in the 2015 Obergefell decision legalized same-sex marriage nationwide, and it required all states to them regardless of where they were performed. But it came after the couple went to Boston, and Shahani and Edmonds were never legally married.
When their relationship ended, however, they entered into a shared custody agreement for the three children, an agreement that is in dispute by the couple. The hyphenated names for the children were removed by Shahani after the agreement was already in place.
Attorneys want the Ohio Supreme Court to decide whether to apply parental rights to Edmonds in a way that presumes the couple would have been married had it been legal.

Paul Kerridge, attorney for Shahani, called the “would-have-been-married” standard proposed by the appellate court “unworkably speculative,” with the potential to cause a ripple effect in the legal world “because every part, every factor in that standard, would also apply to relationships that didn’t include marriage.”
“Really what the First District did here is create common-law marriage without saying that there was a creation of common-law marriage, and creating an exception to a statute without ever saying that’s what they were doing,” Kerridge told the court on Tuesday.
Obergefell recognizes marriages and allows that same-sex couples should have access to the full “constellation” of rights under marriage, including parental rights. But does not extend that right to unmarried couples, Kerridge argued.
“Marriages have licenses and they have signatures, and it’s a known entity of what kind of relationship and the change in your personal rights and obligations, that’s a known entity that you’re entering into,” he said.
While the case is based on a custody battle, Edmonds’ attorney, Jonathan L. Hilton, called custody “a poor-man’s version of parentage.”
He said Edmonds struggles to obtain medical records or school records for the children she once shared with Shahani, and didn’t receive notice or have legal standing when her last name was removed from the children’s surnames.
“So you have children who have hyphenated names — their very identity — being changed, and my client has no more rights in that situation than a babysitter,” Hilton said.
The shared custody agreement allows Edmonds to see the kids about 30% of the time, Hilton said. But if a partner of Shahani wanted to enter into the adoption process for the children, Edmonds would have limited rights.
Justices went back and forth with the attorneys about whether Obergefell applied to two people who never were legally married, and whether the shared custody agreement was equivalent to a marriage document in terms of giving parental rights.
“It seems like you’re advocating for a really impossible standard,” Justice Patrick DeWine said to Hilton. “You have one parent who says ‘I wouldn’t have got married,’ you’ve got one parent who says ‘I would’ve gotten married.’ How can a court really sort that out? Because no one actually knows what someone would have done, and if they would have been married, the rights would have been different.”
Justice Jennifer Brunner pointed to the history of the Obergefell case, in which Ohioan Jim Obergefell’s husband was terminally ill, and the two got married on a Maryland tarmac before flying back to Ohio, even though it was not recognized in their state.
“There was that issue of consent there, that both parties wanted it regardless,” Brunner said. “And what proof do we have of that consent to marry when they didn’t get married?”
Hilton argues the children’s hyphenated names, the shared custody agreement, and the engagement prove a plan was in place for Edmonds and Shahani.
“We have (Shahani’s) consent here to shared parentage, and the only way that they could’ve gotten shared parentage would be to have this kind of union,” Hilton said.
Justice Patrick Fischer pushed back, saying the supreme court was not facing a question on the custody agreement, but rather on whether parental rights should extend despite the lack of a marriage license.
“If the shared custody agreement continues, as a matter of fact, I know as a matter of law there may be a difference, but as a matter of fact, day-to-day, for the best interests of the children, anything we decide here doesn’t change a thing,” Fischer said.

(Courtesy of Sumuri LLC)Steve Whalen loves his home state of Delaware and he’s proud to manufacture computers there that police officers use to “catch bad guys.” He said tariffs on imports from China and other countries, along with sharp cuts to government spending and the winding down of a program for small manufacturers, will make it harder for him to do that.
“We got into business to keep costs low for the ‘good guys,’ but tariffs or anything else that raises prices keeps us from doing that,” said Whalen, co-founder of Sumuri LLC in Magnolia, Delaware, which makes computer workstations for police and government investigations. Whalen has to buy materials overseas, often from China, and he said the tariffs could force him to triple his price on some workstations to $12,000.
Tariffs are the main tool President Donald Trump is wielding to try to boost manufacturing in the United States, calling the achievement of that goal “an economic and national security priority.” But the higher levies have led to retaliation and suspended shipments, and Whalen said they are just one of several Trump administration actions squeezing his small manufacturing business.
The wave of federal spending cuts, which has affected grants to state and local governments, could make his customers put off purchases. And the administration has moved to cut off funding for a $175 million state-based program that provides expert advice to smaller factories like his.
The Delaware version of that program, the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, helped Sumuri fit expanded product lines into the limited space in its small-town factory.
“We were really having a tough time trying to figure out how to utilize our space efficiently,” Whalen said. “They came here and helped us organize and optimize, and it made a huge difference.”
On April 1, the Trump administration cut off funding for 10 such manufacturing programs that were up for renewal in Delaware, Hawaii, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, and Wyoming. Other state MEP programs will expire over the next year.
The administration gave a reprieve to those 10 states until the end of the fiscal year after objections from Democrats in the U.S. House and Senate. The National Institute of Standards and Technology, which manages the program, extended funding for the 10 states “after further review and consideration” and will “continue to evaluate plans for the program,” said agency spokesperson Chad Boutin.
The program has come under fire from Republicans since the George W. Bush administration first tried to end it in 2009, and again during the first Trump administration, but Congress has continued to fund it. The conservative Heritage Foundation said in a 2023 book that MEP’s functions “would be more properly carried out by the private sector.”
‘Dots don’t quite connect’
Buckley Brinkman, executive director of the Wisconsin Center for Manufacturing and Productivity, which works with his state’s MEP program, said it didn’t make much sense for the administration to shutter the program as it seeks to boost the number of U.S. manufacturing jobs.
“It’s one of those things where the dots don’t quite connect,” Brinkman said. “I mean, jeez, here’s a part of government that doesn’t cost a whole lot, in the grand scheme of things — less than $200 million a year — that’s returning 10-to-1 to the national treasury, working on a priority for the president.”
A 2024 Upjohn report found an even higher return: 17-to-1 on $175 million in the 2023 fiscal year, creating $3 billion in new federal tax revenue.


In Wisconsin, which has lost more than 138,000 manufacturing jobs since 2000, some parts makers report that business is booming as manufacturers seek to avoid tariffs by finding U.S. alternatives to Chinese manufacturers, Brinkman said. But more broadly, he doubts that the tariffs will spark a manufacturing boom in the state.
“Do we want all this manufacturing back? Do we have the will to get it back? The answer to both those questions is ‘no,’” Brinkman said. “Even without the tariffs we don’t really want Americans doing a lot of those jobs that are in Chinese factories right now.”
In Delaware, the MEP helped Sumuri manage its expansion, but unpredictable tariffs and budgets are now a bigger danger, said Jason Roslewicz, Sumuri’s vice president of business development. He’s had to devote two employees to monitoring supply lines, tariff news and competitor pricing to stay afloat.
“We went from putting things together in a basement to a 19,000-square-foot facility, doing exactly what we’re supposed to do here in the U.S., and it’s all in danger of coming apart because of this problem,” Roslewicz said.
Other small manufacturers express similar concerns. TJ Semanchin, who owns Wonderstate Coffee in Madison, Wisconsin, said his business roasting and distributing coffee is in crisis because of the tariffs.
Wonderstate’s costs have almost doubled between tariffs on imported coffee and packaging materials from China, plus a cyclical rise in coffee prices. “I’m borrowing money to pay for this and at some point we’ll have to raise prices. We’ll have no choice,” Semanchin said.

But many Republican state officials, and even some Democrats, have backed Trump’s tariff push, including Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who credited the Trump administration with “reshoring manufacturing and restoring this middle class which has been eviscerated over the last 20 years.”
“There’s dislocation in the short term, there’s long-term opportunity,” Youngkin said in an April 15 interview on CNBC. He said his state is hearing more interest from manufacturers looking to build or expand local factories since Trump took office. For instance, Delta Star recently announced a plan to add 300 jobs building power transformers in Lynchburg.
“The president has been clear that there will be some level of tariffs, and folks are coming, and that’s good for Virginia,” Youngkin said in the CNBC interview.
Virginia’s MEP program, called Genedge, claims successes in streamlining production and quality control for local factory products including TreeDiaper, an automated tree watering device made in Ashland, and for advising EDM, a Lynchburg plastic product assembler that needed more efficient production to keep overseas competition at bay. But Virginia’s MEP is one of the state programs slated to expire in the next year.
Long-term trend
The slide in U.S. manufacturing jobs has continued on and off since 1979, and many experts say tariffs will not bring them back. Despite a modest bounce back under the Biden administration, the number of manufacturing jobs has declined from nearly 20 million in 1979 to less than 13 million today, even as the total U.S. workforce has grown from 89 million to 159 million during that period.
Manufacturing faces labor shortages, with many factories operating below capacity because they can’t find enough workers, according to Jason Miller, a professor of supply chain management at Michigan State University.
That doesn’t bode well for a mass reshoring of factories from China and other countries, but Miller doesn’t expect that to happen anyway.
“Firms are not planning on reshoring much of the work that was offshored 20 to 25 years ago,” Miller said. “I’m not concerned about having enough workers for manufacturing jobs that would be reshored because this isn’t going to happen.”
In a 2024 survey by the libertarian Cato Institute, 80% of Americans said America would be better off if more people worked in manufacturing, but only 25% said they personally would be better off working in a factory. The Chinese government has poked fun at the idea with memes of American workers struggling to make Nike sneakers with sewing machines.
Joseph McCartin, a labor historian at Georgetown University, said the idea of a manufacturing rebirth is a “mirage being conjured to attract the support of workers who have been underpaid in an increasingly unequal economy for the last 40 years, and are desperate for some hope of renewed upward mobility.”
Manufacturing “isn’t the magic wand to make that happen,” McCartin said.
“What we need is to raise workers’ wages and make the economy less prone to producing inequality,” McCartin said. “That mission is not at all what Trump is about. He is dealing in stale nostalgia.”

(Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)Early voting is underway in this year’s May 6 primary election. An odd-year election on the heels of a presidential race doesn’t generate a lot of attention, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t important questions on the ballot. Around Ohio, voters will weigh in on local races for township trustee, city council, and mayor, as well as tax levies and liquor options.
Additionally, voters will decide whether to allow to the state to borrow $2.5 billion to fund public infrastructure.
State Capital Improvement Program
The ballot measure, known as Issue 2, is not controversial. It funds the State Capital Improvement Program which has been around since the 1980s. Money borrowed by the state helps cover municipal projects like roads, bridges, and sewers. The idea goes back before voters every 10 years to renew state authority to issue bonds. Three renewals have been approved.
If voters do so again, the state will borrow money — in this case $2.5 billion — and task the Ohio Public Works Commission with funding local projects. The commission hands out grants and no-interest loans through a competitive process.
The program is popular and bipartisan. Lawmakers from both chambers and both parties drafted the argument in favor of the issue.
“Every Ohio county has benefited from this program,” the group wrote, “which has produced more than 19,000 grants and loans for essential, locally selected projects.”

They added that projects funded through the program create construction work and don’t increase taxes.
In committee testimony, Clermont County Commissioner David Painter explained the funding process “encourages deliberation, compromise, and the development of a regional perspective on infrastructure needs.” He noted his own four-county district received $14 million in the last ten-year funding round.
“Without state support, it would be much more difficult, and sometimes impossible, for local governments to undertake these projects.”
No one spoke against the measure, so the state ballot board had to write the argument against Issue 2.
Nuts and bolts
Early voting is available every weekday from 8:00 am to 5:00 pm this week and from 7:30 am to at least 7:30 pm next week as well. Voters who want to cast a ballot early will also be able to do so the following weekend, May 3 and 4.
If you’d rather vote by mail, there’s still time to request a ballot. They must be in by April 29. Ballots returned by mail must be postmarked by May 5, and have to be received at the board by May 10.
Looking around the Ohio, several big city mayors are up for reelection this year.
In Cleveland, Mayor Justin Bibb is seeking a second term, but the primary isn’t until September. In Dayton, Mayor Jeffrey Mims, Jr. won’t appear on the primary ballot because he has only one challenger, City Commissioner Shenise Turner-Sloss. They’ll face off in November.
Cincinnati and Toledo, however, will see the incumbents go before voters in the primary. In both cases, the mayors have drawn multiple challengers in a nonpartisan race. The primary will whittle the field ahead of November’s general election.
Cincinnati’s Aftab Pureval, a Democrat, is running against Cory Bowman and Brian Frank, both Republicans. Bowman is a local pastor and half-brother of Vice President J.D. Vance, and Frank is a Navy vet who spent more than two decades working for Procter & Gamble.
In Toledo, Democrat Wade Kapszukiewicz is running for a third term after the city approved a charter amendment extending mayoral term limits. He’s facing independent candidates Roberto Torres, who served on the staff of two previous mayoral administrations, and Harold Harris, a community activist and Air Force veteran.
Columbus has several people running for school board and a three-way race for a city council seat, but no mayoral election. Incumbent Andrew Ginther’s term runs through 2027.

(Photo by Troy Bennett/ Maine Morning Star)Driven by increasing reports of student misbehavior, some teachers and administrators want to make it easier for staff to physically restrain students, a practice which is only supposed to be used in emergency situations under current state law.
Most states have some limitations on when schools can use restraints and seclusion, temporarily immobilizing students and putting them in empty rooms until they can calm down. 
Before Maine passed its current law in 2021, the state was restraining students at the highest rate in the country per capita, and secluding them at the second highest rate per capita, according to federal data cited by Disability Rights Maine at the time.
These incidents disproportionately involved students with disabilities, leading disability rights advocates to push for the current law, which requires school staff to justify the use of restraint, only rely on them in cases where there was “imminent danger of serious physical injury,” use the least amount of force necessary and end interventions as soon as the danger has passed. 
But in light of increasing behavioral challenges, some administrators and teachers want the lower the legal threshold for restraint and seclusion. On Wednesday, the Maine Legislature’s Education and Cultural Affairs Committee is holding a public hearing on legislation, introduced by Rep. Holly Sargent (D-York), that would make several changes to state law.
Specifically, the proposal would broaden the definition of “physical escort,” striking the word “voluntary” from descriptions of how staff can move or touch a student. The bill, LD 1248, would also decrease the level of danger posed from “serious physical injury” to just “injury.”
Restraint and seclusion practices across the country have been linked to trauma, serious injuries, and even death. Disability rights advocates are warning that any changes must prioritize student safety and mental health, and that the use of restraint and seclusion generally goes against both.
Before the law was passed, schools would sometimes drag students to seclusion rooms without classifying the action as a restraint, said Ben Jones, a former lawyer for Disability Rights Maine who now serves as director of legal and policy initiatives for Lives in the Balance, a nonprofit that advocates against punitive, exclusionary disciplinary practices in schools.
Research suggests state not doing enough to help Maine districts manage student behavior

The push for relaxing the rules is coming from districts like MSAD 11 in Gardiner, where administrators say frequent behavioral incidents, especially among younger students, have left them without the tools to respond. 
Principal Victoria Duguay of River View Community School said that under the current law, educators aren’t allowed to escort students to safe spaces unless they consent — something that doesn’t always happen in the midst of a behavioral crisis.
“When a student is dysregulated to the point where they’re clearing a classroom and potentially shutting a building down, we didn’t have any tools available to escort a student to a safe room if the student didn’t want to go on their own,” Duguay said. 
She also pointed to the aspect of current law that requires a threat of “serious physical injury.”
“Not having that ability to be able to get that child to a safe place is that piece in the law that we’re struggling with, because they’re not presenting that serious physical harm,” she said.
Attorneys consulted by the district said that because most of the third to fifth graders the community school serves are young, they do not present a serious risk of injury to adults even when they lash out. 
Because of educator feedback, Maine’s largest teachers union, the Maine Education Association, is supporting this legislation, along with a few other bills intended to offer de-escalation training and mental health support in schools, said MEA President Jesse Hargrove.
“We want to make sure that we are following least restrictive interventions, but we also want to make sure that other students and staff are safe,” he said.
“The state law is an effort to sort of create some space so that the folks at the local level have a bit more flexibility to address the concerns that they are seeing within their districts and school sites.”
When asked if they are worried about the use of restraints increasing under a more relaxed law, MEA and Gardiner administrators, Duguay and Superintendent Patricia Hopkins, said they trusted educators to use the least restrictive processes possible.
However, Atlee Reilly, managing attorney of Disability Rights Maine’s educational advocacy, said he’s concerned about the potential impacts of the bill. For example, because the proposal would remove the word “voluntary” from the text that covers how a student could be physically moved, the law would no longer count involuntary movements as a restraint. 
Reilly argued that while the number of reported incidents would likely decrease, that “doesn’t mean that people are going to be putting their hands on kids less.” He added, “I think that is almost certainly going to go up.”

(Photo by David DeWitt, Ohio Capital Journal.)A group of Youngstown State University faculty who are trying to get a referendum on the Nov. 4 ballot to stop a controversial higher education law from taking effect completed a major first step. 
Members of the Youngstown State University’s chapter of the Ohio Education Association submitted 4,500 signatures to Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose and a petition summary to Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost Monday. The first step to getting a referendum on the ballot is to get an initial written petition signed by 1,000 registered Ohio voters.

LaRose must verify the number of valid signatures within 10 business days of receiving the petition. Yost must also certify if he believes the petition summary is a “fair and truthful statement” of the law.
The referendum is an attempt to stop Ohio Senate Bill 1 from going into effect, which is set to become law at the end of June. 
S.B. 1 bans diversity efforts, regulates classroom discussion, prohibits faculty strikes, creates post-tenure reviews, puts diversity scholarships at risk, and creates a retrenchment provision that blocks unions from negotiating on tenure, among other things. The law affects Ohio’s public universities and community colleges. 
A referendum petition can be filed before the law takes effect and the legislation would be paused. 
S.B. 1 moved quickly through the legislature, but there was much opposition from college students, faculty, and staff. State Sen. Jerry Cirino, R-Kirtland, introduced the bill on Jan. 22, it passed in both chambers and Gov. Mike DeWine signed it into law March 28.  
“S.B. 1 is yet another nail in the coffins of unions and freedom of speech in Ohio,” YSU-OEA President Mark Vopat said in a statement. “This is a watered-down federal approach to D.E.I. that leaves universities vulnerable because there is no clear guidance on ‘controversial topics,’ while it also attacks union rights. We expect that other public unions will be next.”
What are the next steps in the referendum process?  
If LaRose and Yost approve the signatures and summary, then the signature gathering to get the referendum on the ballot begins. 
The petitioners would need about 248,092 signatures — 6% of the total vote cast for governor during the last gubernatorial election. The signatures must be from at least 44 of Ohio’s 88 counties. The signatures would likely be due at the end of June. 
It would then be up to LaRose to verify the signatures. If it passes those hurdles, the referendum would be referred to the Ohio Ballot Board to determine the language that would appear on the November ballot. 
The last time a referendum passed in Ohio was 2011 when voters overturned an anti-collective bargaining law.

(Photo by Morgan Trau, WEWS.)The Ohio teachers’ pension fund board has voted to increase the money in the monthly checks given to their retirees, as well as reduce the number of years active educators need to work before retiring with full benefits.
With the cost of everyday essentials going up, every dollar counts.
“We’re all trying to keep up with inflation, right?” retired educator Melissa Cropper, who is also the president of the Ohio Federation of Teachers, said.
The education system’s retirees will get some relief this summer.
Cropper cheered that the majority of the State Teachers Retirement System (STRS) board voted to increase the cost-of-living adjustments, or COLA, from 1% to 1.5% for eligible pensioners.
“Having a COLA means that there’s more money in your pockets to be able to keep up with inflation, when paying your everyday bills, buying your everyday groceries, all those types of things,” she said. “It’s a move in the right direction.”
Due to a new funding policy adopted in 2024, roughly $2 billion was able to be allotted under the board’s sustainable benefit plan.
In a board meeting last week, the board’s advisor informed them of the available money, but also explained how a temporary option could include a future increase in retirement eligibility requirements.
Former STRS Chief Actuary Brian Grinnell, who handled risk management, warned that this could put the nearly $100 billion fund in jeopardy.
“They’ve gone ahead and committed to spending this $2 billion on enhanced short-term benefits, and they’re doing this in the face of financial markets that are looking very, very challenging for this year,” Grinnell said.
Since January, the state’s pension funds have lost a significant amount of money due to the volatility in the global economy, he said.
He doesn’t trust the STRS board to handle this situation carefully.
“It’s reasonable to question how much faith you should put in this board at this point in time,” he said.
For the past year, we have dug into — and exposed — the controversy swirling inside STRS, which is the fund for more than 500,000 active and retired public educators in Ohio.
In summary, there has been constant fighting, two board resignations, and allegations of both a public corruption scheme and the mishandling of funds. There has been a senior staff dismissal and at least two senior staff resignations.
Attorney General Dave Yost is currently suing to remove the board chair for allegedly colluding with an investment firm startup attempting to “contract steer” billions in a scheme that would benefit him.
“I don’t think this board has inspired a lot of confidence that they are thinking about the long term and are taking their fiduciary responsibilities to all of the pension members seriously,” Grinnell continued.
He also argued that this move by the board won’t truly benefit educators, since it only gives an additional $50 per month for each retiree.
“There needs to be a COLA for these retirees in some form,” he said. “That COLA needs to be funded, though.”
The board is setting a precedent of raising benefits while losing money, he said, which will actually hurt the majority of the pensioners.
“There is an imbalance where the funding to pay the retiree benefits is, in part, coming at the expense of the active teachers,” he said.
Cropper argued that the active teachers are getting a fair deal, since the board also voted to reduce the number of years to get full retirement benefits from 33 to 32.
“We have board members who are looking to still keep the system stable, but to find a way that they can restore benefits among both actives and retirees, so that they’re equally sharing the loss and equally sharing the gain in this process,” she said.
The STRS board is also trying to lobby the state lawmakers to increase the contribution rates from employers.
But with the controversy, and with the board’s choices lately, several Republican legislative leaders say they don’t trust the board to use the proposed additional money wisely.
“I think that the state needs to make sure that the funds are valid or sustainable and that they’re not just blowing money — if there’s any indication that they’re making bad decisions right now,” Ohio Senate Education Chair Andrew Brenner, R-Delaware, said.
State Rep. Adam Bird, R-New Richmond, is the chair of the Ohio Retirement Study Council, and doesn’t think any request to the legislature will be fruitful.
“I feel pretty confident in saying that an employer contribution rate doesn’t have any support in the General Assembly — or enough support,” Bird said.
He continues to monitor the STRS situation closely, he added.
“I think it’s important for my colleagues and I to remember that we established a pension system and we are in charge of it — and if we decide there needs to be changes, as a body, we should make changes,” Bird said. “I think it’s important for the General Assembly to always keep a close eye on what the five pension systems are doing.”
In previous reports, Brenner and other Statehouse leaders suggested changing the STRS board structure.
Asked whether he has any interest in reforming the pension systems and how they function as a board, Ohio House Speaker Matt Huffman, R-Lima, said in March, “The short answer to that question is yes.”
He proceeded to explain that the G.A. did pension reform in the early 2010s, and it is likely the time for another fix.
“The question is, are the folks who are serving on those boards, are they truly experts in pensions?” Huffman said. “I think those are all things that need to be reviewed on those five pension boards.”
Asked if he was looking at changing the STRS board, Bird responded, “No comment.”
Previously, the state’s other pension funds rejected any change within their structure. Officers within the Ohio Police and Fire Pension Fund (OP&F) told the lawmakers to leave them out of STRS’ chaos.

Renee Erickson chats on the Senate floor during the April 10, 2025, veto session. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)Since the 1980s, the Kansas Open Records Act has mandated that all public agencies, including the Legislature, produce public records either within three business days or “as soon as possible” in response to requests for records.
But the current Legislature seems to believe those words mean “whenever we feel like it.”
And for almost 20 years, KORA has allowed public agencies to redact information from public records that, if disclosed, would amount to a “clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.” Such information includes Social Security numbers, dates of birth or other information that could enable identify theft.
But this iteration of the Legislature seems to think it is entitled to redact information that could traditionally be found in a phonebook, and that it may do so in a futile attempt to shield the identity of a handful of powerful Kansans but not the rest of us.
Isn’t it time the Legislature follows its own laws for the benefit of everyone and not just a select few?
 
Rule of law shudders
Wichita Sen. Renee Erickson, chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Government Efficiency and a member of the Republican supermajority, viewed timely KORA compliance as optional this legislative session when she was faced the prospect of disclosing information submitted to the supermajority’s online “government efficiency portal.”
The portal itself makes clear that “submissions are public records that are subject to the Kansas Open Records Act.” But when Kansas Reflector made a KORA request in February for submissions to the portal, Erickson said the Reflector would have to wait, not three business days, but rather two months for a response.
Such a long timeline could, potentially, be permissible under KORA if Erickson had offered a “detailed explanation of the cause for further delay,” as the law requires.
But by Erickson’s own admission, the delay was necessitated not by the Legislature’s inability to produce the records in a timely way, but because it preferred not to. In response to Reflector’s request on March 7, Erickson wrote that the requested submissions should be kept under wraps until May 1 because they were to be discussed “during meetings to be called during the 2025 interim” before next session “as a basis for possible legislation to be considered during the 2026 legislative session.”
Erickson would later amend the timeline, indicating that the records would be disclosed April 9. But Erickson proved even that date was not “as soon as possible,” as she allowed the records to be disclosed to members of her committee in mid-March — well before April 9.
Ultimately, Kansas Reflector received leaked copies of the requested records, and their authenticity was corroborated by Erickson’s tardy disclosure. In due course, the real reason for her delay became clear: the portal was a repository for criticism of the supermajority’s legislative agenda, and it was in the supermajority’s interest to keep that fact from the public for as long as possible.
 
Consistently arbitrary
Kansas Reflector’s request yielded disclosures of more than 1,600 submissions that Kansans had made to the portal. The names and contact information for just 55 submitters were redacted, while the names and contact information for the other 1,500-plus Kansans were disclosed.
Comparing the leaked records to Erickson’s disclosure shows that Senate President Ty Masterson’s submission is one of the 55 from which the name and contact information were redacted.
Redacting the identities of anyone, a potential gubernatorial candidate such as Masterson or not, violates KORA. Redactions due to privacy concerns are authorized under KORA only when disclosure of such information poses a serious risk to the person identified and is not “of legitimate concern to the public.”
There can be no doubt that the submissions to the politically charged government efficiency portal are of legitimate concern to the public, negating application of KORA’s privacy provision on that basis alone. Moreover, disclosure of someone’s name, address and email address does not put them at undue risk when that information is most likely available through a Google search.
Additionally, every person who submitted information to the portal was required to check a box acknowledging that submissions would be subject to KORA. That means each submitter effectively waived any application of KORA’s privacy provision.
Even so, in the April 9 email in which the Erickson disclosed the requested records to Kansas Reflector, she claimed that redactions were made for “the portions of records containing information of a personal nature where the public disclosure thereof would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.”
Simply put, it is not credible to claim that KORA’s privacy provision applied to Kansas Reflector’s request. Moreover, the Legislature’s attempt to shield information about certain submissions and not others is evidence that it is willing to play favorites at the expense of being fair and complying with KORA in a timely manner.

There’s a vicious downward cycle that’s been at work in North Carolina state government in recent years. And here’s how it worked:
First, conservative politicians blast quote “government bureaucracy” and enact big tax and spending cuts in response.
Next, core services like schools, mental health, transportation, and public safety – plagued by funding cuts and staff reductions — all struggle mightily to keep up with rising demands in a fast-growing state.
Next, besieged by constituent complaints, the same politicians who imposed the big cuts decry the decline in services and move to turn agencies over to private interests and/or lower standards – so that for example, class sizes can rise, or driver’s licenses have to be renewed less frequently.
Finally, claiming to be motivated to improve quote “efficiency,” the same politicians impose more tax cuts and start the whole process over again.
The bottom line: slashing funding for basic public services does no more to improve outcomes than scrimping on the upkeep of your car or home. And it’s long past time for our state to break this vicious cycle.

Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) appears Sunday on CBS' ""Face the Nation,"" one stop on his ""full Ginsburg"" tour of all five network Sunday talk shows in one day. (Screenshot)Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Maryland) achieved a rare feat on Easter, when he appeared on all five network Sunday talk shows: “Face the Nation,” “State of the Union,” “Meet the Press,” “Fox News Sunday” and “This Week” on the same day.
It’s known as doing a “full Ginsburg,” named for William H. Ginsburg, who was serving as the attorney for then-White House intern Monica Lewinsky when he became the first person known to have completed the circuit on a single day.
Van Hollen’s TV appearances came just days after his return from El Salvador, where he met with Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an undocumented immigrant from Beltsville who was erroneously deported last month and sent to a notorious Salvadoran prison.
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Abrego Garcia was wrongfully deported, and ordered federal officials to “facilitate” his return. But Trump administration officials, who claim Abrego Garcia is an MS-13 gang member, have not made any effort to bring Abrego Garcia stateside. They argue that the U.S., which is paying El Salvador $6 milllion to old deportees, does not have the authority to do so since he’s in Salvadoran custody; Salvadorans have said they don’t have the authority to return him to the U.S.
During his appearances Sunday, Van Hollen challenged Trump officials to “put up or shut up” in court, bringing Abrego Garcia back to face charge here instead of spreading allegations about him on social media. Van Hollen said there is no evidence that Abrego Garcia committed any crime, and that the discussion about possible gang ties is merely a distraction.
“I am not defending the man. I’m defending the rights of this man to due process,” Van Hollen said on ABC’s “This Week.”

In their brief meeting Thursday, Abrego Garcia said he has been traumatized by the experience, Van Hollen said, and that he misses his family, including his 5-year-old son who has autism, and was in the car with his father at the time of his arrest.
Several hosts asked Van Hollen whether he’d walked into a trap by visiting Abrego Garcia, who appeared in plain clothes at a hotel to meet with the senator, with cold drinks on the table. As the meeting was taking place, Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele was posting photos on social media claiming that Abrego Garcia was “now sipping margaritas with Sen. Van Hollen in the tropical paradise of El Salvador.”
“All of that was a setup. Their people ordered the waiters to bring these things that look like margaritas,” Van Hollen said on ABC. “It just goes to show the lengths that Bukele and Trump will go to try to deceive people about what this case is all about.”
Greetings from El Salvador
While he was in El Salvador for several days last week, trying to see Abrego Garcis, Van Hollen warned repeatedly that it didn’t matter if the Bukele administration denied him a visit because while he might have been the first member of Congress to visit the country, he would not be the last.
It appears he was right about that.
Van Hollen’s trip appears to have opened the flood gates. Four House Democrats said they made the trip this week: freshmen Reps. Yassamin Ansari of Arizona and Maxine Dexter of Oregon, and second-term Reps. Robert Garcia of California and Maxwell Frost of Florida.
They had returned to the U.S. by Tuesday, but while in El Salvador had written U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio demanding regular check-ins with Abrego Garcia, as well as access to an attorney for him and a renewed effort to bring him back to the U.S. They also demanded access to another U.S. deportee being held in El Salvador, Venezuelan refugee Andry José Hernández Romero.
The trip, which they were careful to note was not taxpayer-funded, came after Rep. James Comer (R-Ky.), the chair of the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability, rejected a request from Frost and Garcia for an official congressional delegation to visit CECOT, the Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo where Abrego Garcia was being held until his transfer last week.
Comer called the request “absurd.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
But those four may not be the last to make the El Salvador run: Rep. Glenn Ivey (D-4th), whose district includes Beltsville, where Abrego Garcia lived, has said he plans to travel to the Central American nation as well. Ivey, who wrote on X that he intends to take his trip in early May, also led a letter last week from 150 Democrats to President Donald Trump asking for updates on the efforts to bring Abrego Garcia back to the U.S.
It’s not just Democrats. House Ways and Means Committee Chair Jason Smith (R-Mo.) visited CECOT last week to take a swipe at Democrats. And the National Republican Congressional Committee, seeing what it believes is a winning strategy for the GOP, offered — tongue in cheek, presumably — to pay for any Democrats who wanted to make the trip.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-23-at-2.23.25 AM-1024x571.png,,,2025-04-23 05:01:07.898536

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)Earlier this month, the Ohio House passed its version of the biennial budget, setting priorities for the state with tens of billions of dollars of spending.
The House version of the budget had many significant changes from the governor’s original budget. The House axed tax hikes on cannabis, gaming, and tobacco, the latter of which could have saved tens of thousands of lives by reducing smoking rates in the state. They also cut the state library fund by $90 million, child care subsidies by $180 million, and removed a child tax credit for families with young children that could have directly supported half a million children and grown the economy.
One provision the House preserved from the executive budget, however, was a law that would immediately revoke health insurance for 770,000 Ohioans if the federal government reduced its contribution to Medicaid at the state level.
When the Affordable Care Act was passed in 2010, the Obama Administration and Democrats in Congress had a goal to ensure everyone in the United States had access to affordable health insurance. The Affordable Care Act did this in a number of ways: covering children with their parents’ health insurance until age 26, creating subsidies for lower- and middle-class families to purchase individual insurance, requiring employers to provide health insurance to full-time workers, prohibiting denials of coverage due to preexisting conditions.
One of the biggest elements of this strategy was expanding Medicaid coverage to all Americans  with incomes under 138% of the federal poverty level, with the federal government paying 90% of the health costs for this new “Medicaid Expansion” population. This provision was challenged in courts and the Supreme Court ultimately made this optional for states. To date, 40 states have accepted the federal dollars to provide health insurance to low-income residents, including Ohio.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Today, 94% of Ohio residents are covered by health insurance, one of the state’s strongest health metrics. According to the Ohio Department of Medicaid, 770,000 Ohio residents are covered by Medicaid Expansion, about 6.5% of the state population. If these people lost their health insurance immediately, the number of people without health insurance in the state would double in an instant.
That is exactly what the Medicaid provision introduced by the governor and as passed by the House will do if the federal government reduces its share of the Medicaid expansion support by as little as a dollar. Ohio is likely to join twelve other states by adopting language that would automatically cut the Medicaid expansion population from health insurance rolls if the federal government reduces its match rate.
If this happened in Ohio, 770,000 Ohio residents would automatically lose health insurance. This would also have ripple effects through the state economy. The Kaiser Family Foundation estimates this would lead to a $72 billion reduction in federal Medicaid spending over the next ten years. That’s about $7.2 billion a year in health care spending that would evaporate from the state, roughly equal to 30% of Ohio’s economic growth over the past year, gone overnight.
These costs would compound over time. People without health insurance are less likely to get preventative screenings, leading them to more frequent emergency room use and more costly treatments. Evidence shows Medicaid expansion improved financial security, promoted tobacco cessation, and reduced rates of heart disease and premature death.
Medicaid is not cheap. But the evidence we have on it suggests it pays dividends to society. Legislators should think hard about the consequences of kicking 770,000 Ohio residents back into the ranks of the uninsured.

States worry that an executive order and federal funding cuts could weaken their cybersecurity efforts. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images).For the first half of his career in law enforcement, working as a police officer in South Florida, Chase Fopiano did not think cyberattacks on police agencies were a serious threat.
Many of his law enforcement colleagues were under the same impression — that since they were the most likely to investigate the attacks, there was no way cybercriminals would go after them.
By about 2015, as technology advanced and hackers became more creative, that changed, Fopiano said. Now, from the U.S. Secret Service to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, there are thousands of attempts to compromise networks or organizations every day, he said.
“A lot of those [attempts] are toward government or even police, especially because they know that we’re not as prepared as we should be,” said Fopiano, who now oversees cybersecurity as part of a regional task force.
Spanning health care facilities to court systems, states and local communities are facing a rise in cyberthreats. They include threats to critical infrastructure, increased activity from foreign actors, continued ransomware attacks and more, according to a recent report from the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center.
Budget restrictions, staff issues and AI are threats to states’ cybersecurity

But President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order shifting some of the responsibility from the federal government to states and localities to improve their infrastructure to address risks, including cybercrimes. And federal cuts have reduced resources for state and local officials, including a cybersecurity grant program and a key cybersecurity agency.
States and localities are taking steps to address the problems, such as establishing new penalties for tampering with critical infrastructure, centralizing state IT personnel and setting standards in areas from elections to health care.
But the Trump order and federal funding cuts, a shortage of IT experts at the local level and an overall lack of preparedness could weaken their efforts.
In December, a major cyberattack forced Rhode Island to take down its online portal used by residents to obtain Medicaid benefits and SNAP, commonly known as food stamps. The personal data stolen from Rhode Island’s public benefits network — including Social Security numbers and banking information — was later found on the dark web.
In February, a “sophisticated cyberattack” hit the office of Virginia Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares, which led agency officials to shut down computer systems and resort to paper court filings.
Last week, hackers also breached the computer network of the Fall River School District in Massachusetts. The school district is working with third-party experts and law enforcement to determine if anyone’s personal information was targeted, according to MassLive.
In 2023, of the 48 states that participated in the Nationwide Cybersecurity Review, a voluntary self-assessment conducted by federal agencies that examines how well governments are prepared to respond to cyberattacks, only 22 states reached or surpassed the recommended levels of security in their systems.










The notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.


– Samir Jain, Vice President of Policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology


Cybersecurity has become increasingly important over time because more government services and data are digitized, said Samir Jain, the vice president of policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology, a nonprofit that advocates for digital rights and freedom of expression.
But a national shortage of people with that expertise — especially at the local level — creates a challenge.
“The federal government has traditionally played at least some role in trying to fill some of those gaps,” Jain said. “And so the notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.”
Local governments and law enforcement agencies also have other priorities, Fopiano said. The police need cars, guns, shields and other resources that generally take precedence over cybersecurity.
Today, Fopiano is the cybersecurity chair of the Southeast Regional Domestic Security Task Force in Florida, overseeing cyber activity from South Florida to the Florida Keys. The attacks continue to rise, he said.
“Terrorist groups are getting into cybercrime, cartels are getting into cybercrime, you have kids just learning about hacking and just fooling around,” he said. “The audience of who’s doing it has definitely expanded and led to that rise in overall cybercrime.”
 Cuts to federal resources

In 2022, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced a first-of-its-kind cybersecurity grant program, providing more than $1 billion in funding for states, localities, tribes and territories to address cybersecurity risks and threats.
The State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program, created under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, awarded $279 million to states and localities in fiscal year 2024. The Tribal Cybersecurity Grant Program awarded another $18 million for tribes in its first year.
But the grant program is set to expire in September, with no current plans to renew it. At a hearing this month, several state and local officials urged Congress to reauthorize the program. But U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who refused the federal aid during her tenure as governor of South Dakota, questioned the program’s efficacy.
The Trump administration is also cutting as many as 1,300 employees from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, which administers the grants alongside the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Governments often struggle with massive new IT projects

The program has allowed states to assess the security of their networks, develop cybersecurity training, implement multi-factor authentication features — which requires users to provide more than one form of verification to access a site or service — and much more, said Alex Whitaker, the director of government affairs at the National Association of State Chief Information Officers.
“This has been a really great program because we’re seeing a lot of great evidence for how states and their counterparts in local government are improving their cyber defenses,” Whitaker said.
Counties also rely on a number of federal resources to strengthen their defenses, including services provided by CISA, said Rita Reynolds, the chief information officer at the National Association of Counties and managing director for County Tech Xchange. NACo is an organization that represents county governments across the United States.
The Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center, for instance — a key collaboration between CISA and the Center for Internet Security to help state and local governments with cybersecurity operations — lost some of its federal funding for certain programs last month, Reynolds said.
In trying to keep up with emerging threats, counties are still trying to find resources to help them implement multi-factor authentication, convert government pages to “.gov” domains and other methods of protecting their infrastructure, she said.
“Are counties prepared?” Reynolds asked. “I would say they’re not as prepared as they’d like to be. And in some cases, they are looking at how to strategically approach this now that resources are disappearing.”
In a statement, CISA spokesperson Jared Auchey said Trump’s executive order empowers state and local governments “to make risk-informed decisions and investments to improve their preparedness.” The agency will work with state and local officials to ensure they have the information and support they need, Auchey added.
 Lawmakers step up

In 2024, 33 states adopted resolutions or enacted legislation regarding cybersecurity, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan public officials’ association.
Many of those measures sought to protect states’ critical infrastructure, including water systems, government services, health care and more. Florida, Louisiana, West Virginia and other states created new criminal and civil penalties for people who attempt to tamper with critical infrastructure.
In Minnesota and Washington state, lawmakers passed measures allowing or requiring state and local governments to invest in cybersecurity protections related to election administration. Connecticut and Florida also passed legislation to secure health care facilities from cyberattacks by having hospitals create plans or by supporting investments in new technologies.
Other states are looking for solutions from outside vendors. South Dakota has set aside $7 million for a company to examine local governments for vulnerabilities to hackers.
Rhode Island state government hit by major cyberattack

With attacks occurring at every level of government, New Mexico Democratic state Sen. Michael Padilla, the Senate majority whip, sponsored legislation in 2023 to create the state’s office of cybersecurity. As chair of the Senate Science, Technology and Telecommunications Committee for 10 years, he plays a significant role in most of the state’s cybersecurity legislation.
Through the committee’s work, Padilla says New Mexico is in good shape to fend off cyberattacks — and the state’s cities and counties are joining in.
“I think New Mexico is in a very good position because what we decided to do by creating that office is to ensure that any transactions that occur with state government here [in New Mexico] have to meet a minimum set of security standards,” he said.
In Indiana, Republican state Sen. Liz Brown filed legislation that would encourage state agencies and groups to develop cybersecurity policies. The bill was approved by both chambers, with the Senate agreeing to changes sent from the House.
“You have to protect your infrastructure,” Brown said. “We don’t want utility systems to be shut down. We don’t want wastewater or freshwater treatment plants or even the water supply being contaminated or harmed in some way. Our systems all have backups, but even so, we know there are bad actors.”
Some states are also preparing to reshuffle their offices or create new ones to centralize their cybersecurity efforts. Arkansas, for example, enacted legislation this month to create a new state cybersecurity office, which will monitor the state’s computer networks and respond to cyberthreats.
In Alabama, rather than having information technology people scattered throughout the government, Republican state Rep. Mike Shaw wants cybersecurity personnel centrally managed.
Shaw’s legislation, which passed the House and is currently in the Senate, would give the Alabama Office of Information Technology central authority to maintain the needs of all of the state’s departments.
The centralization would make it easier to pursue cybersecurity initiatives in the future, Shaw said.
“The federal government is really big, and it’s really hard to come up with a one-size-fits-all solution for things like cybersecurity, data privacy and technology in general,” Shaw said. “So, in some sense, it’s good that the states are coming up with their own.”

,California,2025-04-23 07:01:00+00:00,CalMatters,"Given its failures, can California manage a transition to a carbon-free future?",Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/04/california-carbon-free-transition/,"The mileposts on the road to a carbon-free California are beginning to appear, but the state is already falling behind. The just announced closure of another refinery isn't reassuring.","It’s become painfully obvious in recent years that California officialdom lacks the ability to plan and deliver major projects.
While examples abound, the state’s woebegone bullet train project, its tortuous efforts to implement information technology and the financial and managerial meltdown of its unemployment insurance program are among the most egregious.
Given that sorry record, why should we believe the state’s plans to completely overhaul California’s economy by eliminating hydrocarbon-based energy will be any more successful?
Over the next 20 years, California wants to replace nearly 30 million gasoline and diesel-powered cars and light trucks with those using batteries or hydrogen. Simultaneously  California is supposed to wean itself from natural-gas-fired electric power generation and increase power output, to recharge many millions of car batteries and service houses and commercial buildings that will no longer use gas.
The mileposts on the road to a carbon-free California are beginning to appear, and the state is already falling behind.
One of the biggest elements of the transition is Gov. Gavin Newsom’s decree that by 2035 all cars sold in California must be zero-emission vehicles, or ZEVs for short, with an interim goal of 35% this year.
It’s not happening.
While there had been a surge in ZEV purchases in earlier years, they have leveled off at about 25%, well short of the 2025 expectation, and show no signs of increasing. The cost of battery-powered vehicles in an inflation-conscious era, fears of mileage limitations, and shortages of functioning recharging stations are among the reasons for the sales plateau.
California can’t force consumers to buy ZEVs. Its decrees are aimed at manufacturers, including fines for failing to meet sales quotas. Brian Mass, president of the California New Car Dealers Association, said in a statement, “It’s time to admit that the state has hit a wall amid a lack of confidence in ZEV adoption, as well as a statewide shortage of EV charging stations.”
Dealers and their allies released a poll indicating that most Californians are unhappy with the 2035 cutoff of petroleum-powered car sales. 
Other aspects of California’s carbon-free conversion are also lagging. Blackout fears compelled Newsom and other state officials to delay the phaseout of gas-fired power plants in Southern California and to insist that the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant near San Luis Obispo remain in service indefinitely, setting aside plans for decommissioning.
Implicitly the state’s efforts to eliminate petrofuels would require the eventual closure of California’s refineries, but it must also maintain supplies of gasoline and diesel fuel until the makeover is complete, which is a tricky balancing act.
Two refineries are already being closed, raising the spectre of fuel shortages that would drive California’s gas prices, already among the nation’s highest, upward.

Commentary 
If zero-emission cars cut gasoline sales and tax revenue, how will California replace them? 

by Dan Walters 





Valero is the latest to announce a shutdown, declaring its “current intent to idle, restructure, or cease refining operations” at its Benicia refinery by the end of April 2026. The announcement followed last year’s decision by Phillips 66 to close its Southern California refinery, two days after Newsom signed a bill requiring refiners to maintain minimum gasoline supplies.
California is a petroleum fuel island, lacking pipelines that could bring in supplies from other states. In fact, motorists in Nevada and Arizona depend on California for their fuel. If refineries continue to close, California could be forced to bring in fuel from other nations via tanker or acquire the in-state refineries by purchase or seizure and operate them itself during the transition.
Asked about Valero’s announcement, Newsom replied that the state would address “any anxiety that may be created or any market disruption that may be created by that announcement.”
That’s not reassuring, given the state’s paper-thin record of successfully managing big projects and big emergencies.

Taylor. (Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)Supreme Court justices appeared to side Tuesday with Montgomery County parents who say the county’s refusal to let them opt their children out of classes with LGBTQ-themed books violates their right to raise their children according to their faith.
The case, Mahmoud v. Taylor, stemmed from a 2023 lawsuit filed by a group of Muslim, Jewish and Christian parents after the school board after it introduced books for classes as early as pre-kindergarten that had stories featuring transgender or same-sex characters.
When the books were introduced in the 2022-23 school year, the school system let parents who objected to the books opt their children out of classes that used the books, as they can opt children out of health education classes they find offensive. But the board reversed itself in March 2023, saying students could not get out of the language arts classes using the books, which the schools called part of an inclusive curriculum that also helps teach civility and respect.
But to the parents in the case, it’s a religious issue, and “Parents, not school boards, should have the final say on such religious matters,” said Eric S. Baxter, the attorney representing the parents.
The question before the court was whether “public schools burden parents’ religious exercise by compelling elementary school children to participate in instruction on gender and sexuality against their parents’ religious convictions and without the opportunity to opt out?”
Two lower courts have said it does not, ruling that books are not a religious burden because they do not compel students to change their beliefs. But in 2.5 hours of arguments Tuesday, the conservative majority appeared to question that, and to side with parents’ call for an opt-out.

“The plaintiffs here are not asking the school to change its curriculum,” said Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. “They’re just saying, ‘Look, we want out.’ Why isn’t that feasible? What is the big deal about allowing them to opt out of this?”
School board attorney Alan E. Schoenfeld said it could create dozens of students not being in classes, while teachers and staff would need to create additional instruction for those students and accommodate them in other places within the school.
“I think it is infeasible,” Schoenfeld said.
Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh said he was “a bit mystified, as a lifelong resident of the county, how it came to this.” He asked Schoenfeld how Montgomery County, a “beacon of that religious liberty” in a state founded on religious liberty and tolerance, had reached a point of “not respecting religious liberty, given that history.”
“I just want to give you a chance to respond to how you situate that in Maryland and Montgomery County’s history,” Kavanaugh said.
Schoenfeld said the county’s 160,000-student public school system is the most religiously diverse in the country, and the school board has a difficult job “balancing the interests of a diverse community.”
“Montgomery County did its best under these circumstances, given their curricular goals,” he said. “That seems to me a fundamentally different question, and it’s an important one, but it is a fundamentally different question about whether there’s a constitutional right to opt your child out of curriculum that you deem religiously offensive.”
Meanwhile, the liberal justices questioned whether the mere presence of the books is coercive, and where the court should draw the line if it tries to create a rule on when parents can opt their children out of a class.
Justice Sonya Sotomayor highlighted one of the books, “Uncle Bobby’s Wedding,” about a girl worried that she will lose time with her uncle once he gets married, until his boyfriend befriends her. Sotomayor said no one in that book or any others “are even kissing.”
“The most they’re doing is holding hands. That mere exposure to that is coercion?” Sotomayor asked Baxter.
“Our parents would object to that,” Baxter replied.

Justice Kentaji Brown Jackson grilled Baxter and Sarah M. Harris, principal deputy solicitor general representing the Trump administration, noting that parents are not compelled to send their children to public school. If they object to LGBTQ-themed materials, she said, they can homeschool their children or send them to a private school.
“Most parents don’t have that option,” Baxter said. “They have two working parents. They can’t afford to send [their children] to private school.”
“I guess I’m worried about … a world in which there is an option to send your kid somewhere else, it seems to me that these parents would be dictating what this school does,” Jackson said.
LGBTQ+ liberation vs. indoctrination 
The case has national implications on the tension between religious freedoms and schools’ attempt to present an inclusive curriculum.
As oral arguments went on inside the courthouse, advocates on both sides of the case held rallies outside the courthouse. The two sides kept mostly to themselves, but on the few occasions they engaged, the debate was largely civil.
On the left side of the court plaza was a sea of rainbows and pride flags, as several dozen advocates played pop hits, sang, danced, and performed spoken word poetry in support of curriculum that includes LGBTQ+ people and issues.
Lee Blinder, executive director of Trans Maryland and co-chair for the Coalition for Inclusive Schools & Communities, said that “young people do not deserve the message that they and their families are not a full and complete part of this society.”
“One cannot opt out of our existence because we are your loved ones. We are your teachers, your janitorial staff, your fellow students, the families of your fellow students. We are an inalienable part of the fabric of this society,” Blinder said.
Del. Gabriel Acevero (D-Montgomery), a member of the Legislative LGBTQ+ Caucus, stressed the importance of inclusive curriculum in schools.

“We’re here to say that we are not just going to honor our history – we are going to make sure that every single generation is aware and taught about, and our contribution is incorporated into every school instruction,” he said. “We know this country has denied the rights and dignity of a number of people, and we refuse to stand by as it erases, not just the contributions of queer folks, but it chooses to erase us as a people altogether.”
On the right side of the courthouse plaza, a few dozen supporters of parental opt-outs in education stood and sat in the shade listening in to the oral arguments being played on speakers.
Billy Moges, director of a coalition of parents called Kids First, said that it is “our constitutional right to parent and for our kids to believe in what they believe in.”
“We do believe that justices will do the right thing. We trust that their judgment will be in alignment with their rules and with the Constitution,” she said during Tuesday morning’s rally.
When arguments concluded shortly after 12:30 p.m., Baxter felt confident that the Supreme Court was more sympathetic to the plaintiff’s side.
“The court recognized that the books themselves were problematic,” he said to reporters. “Add on to that instruction from teachers – that these books were intended to encourage kids to explore different identities, to ignite their curiosity, to teach them that they can be a boy or a girl or both or neither.
“Parents aren’t asking to stop educating their children about the world around them,” Baxter said. “What they’re asking is to stop having them be indoctrinated on things that violate their religious beliefs.”

region. John McCosh/Georgia Recorder (file)The American Lung Association’s 2025 annual air quality index gives failing grades to Georgia’s population center for smog and air pollution.
The American Lung Association’s “State of the Air” report released Wednesday ranks Atlanta third worse in ozone pollution and fourth worse in year-round counts for particle pollution in the Southeast. The association’s 28th annual report examines data during a three year window from  2021 to 2023, a period during the transition out of a pandemic that kept the roads clearer due to more people working from home.  
Atlanta’s grade also slips from a C to F for ground-level ozone pollution after recording 5.5 unhealthy days per year compared to 1.8 days in the 2024 report. 
Atlanta’s ozone emissions ranks 48th worst out of 228 cities across the country, which is the third worst metro area in Southeast. Atlanta ranked 67th worst nationally in the Lung Association’s 2024 findings.
The 2025 report issued Atlanta a failing grade for short term spikes in particle pollution levels recorded above the federal standard. 
Atlanta, which received a failing grade in 2024, was ranked 34th worst out of 204 nationally and tied for fourth worst metro area in Southeast. 
The report measures levels of ozone, which is one of the components of smog that becomes worse during the summer as Georgia’s dog days set in. The program also tracks the amount of particle pollution emitted from industrial sources such as power plants.
Nearly half of the U.S. population live in areas with unhealthy levels of air pollution, the report says.
Danna Thompson, advocacy director for the Lung Association in Georgia, said that poor air quality, particularly caused by  ozone, poses a health risk to children and the elderly, as well as people suffering with pre-existing conditions like asthma or heart disease.
She said it’s important that commuters help reduce emissions, especially in metropolitan areas where the amount of smog is affected by the number of cars and trucks traveling along roads and highways.
“When heading into higher temperatures in the summer in the South, we certainly really encourage people to consider taking and using other forms of transportation, whether it’s biking, walking, taking trains because  cars and the trucking industry do impact air quality,” Thompson said.
According to the Atlanta Regional Commission, there has been a significant reduction in air pollution emissions since 2010. ARC publishes online transportation-related emissions data, which has included Environmental Protection Agency data since 2020.
According to the regional commission, transportation contributes about 10% of air pollution in the region, while power generation and manufacturing are also major sources of air pollution
Thompson said the lung association is concerned about the potential rollback to Clean Air Act regulations that are designed to protect the public and environment.
Last week, President Donald Trump administration’s EpA granted a two-year exemption  allowing several power plants across the nation, including Georgia Power’s coal-firing Plant Bowen and Plant Scherer bypass federal emission regulations for mercury and other air pollutants.
Thompson said it’s tough to determine what is the largest factor that changes the levels of pollution recorded on a year to year basis.  
Thompson said the report highlights the need for the EPA to set up more air quality monitors in Georgia since only 27 of 159 counties currently have the equipment used to measure how safe air is.
“It’s hard to pinpoint one factor that causes the air quality to to be worse,” she said. “ The ozone is like a  powerful oxidant. It’s like household bleach. When it’s inhaled, ozone damages the tissues in our respiratory tract.”
The 2025  American Lung Association report  other notable findings for Georgia include Augusta ranking among cleanest in the nation for ozone smog while also tying for fourth worst in the Southeast for year-round level of particle pollution.
Savannah was dinged from an “A” to a “B” because of higher levels of ozone smog.

(Photo by Nathaniel Herz/Northern Journal)Five weeks before Election Day, at an evening ceremony at the office of the U.S. Department of State, America’s first-ever Arctic ambassador was sworn into his new job.
Barely 100 days later, on Jan. 20, Mike Sfraga resigned — departing his post, like other ambassadors, as Donald Trump took power.
 
America’s first Arctic ambassador was just confirmed weeks ago. Now he could be out of a job.

	Now, Sfraga’s position remains unfilled. And Alaskans and others tracking America’s stance toward the Arctic are waiting to see when, or if, the new administration will offer a clear vision or plans for the region that the U.S., its allies and rivals are increasingly eying as a zone for commerce and military activity.
“It’s feeling very quiet,” said Diane Hirshberg, who leads a research institute at University of Alaska Anchorage and is academic vice president at an international network of schools called University of the Arctic. “We’re just in this weird land of uncertainty.”
At a recent working group meeting of an international commission called the Arctic Council, Hirshberg said, the American government representative shared nothing, “other than that the U.S. reserves the right to comment at a later date.”
Experts say that Trump’s outspoken desire to annex Greenland makes clear that he’s aware of the Arctic’s growing strategic value. But they also say that his distrust of traditional European alliances and his targeting of research institutions risk undermining the nation’s interests in the region.

	“There are other nations questioning us,” Sfraga said at an Alaska legislative hearing this month. “Every one of our allies in the North and elsewhere, they’re questioning how committed we are.”
Republican U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who’s long prodded the federal government to develop its Arctic policy, said she thinks the new administration appreciates the significance of the region for its natural resources and importance to American national security. 
But she said she’s pushing for that awareness to be backed up with qualified personnel — new appointees to Arctic-focused positions like the ambassador job.
“At some of these Arctic conferences, I’m there,” she said in an interview. “But the U.S. delegation has to be more than just Lisa Murkowski.”
Former President Joe Biden created the Arctic ambassador position through an executive action, and it’s not set out in law — a fact that Murkowski, via legislation she introduced earlier this year, hopes to change.

	She said she’s also submitted names to the Trump administration to consider for the post and is concerned that if the decision is delayed, the new ambassador nominee could end up being a campaign donor chosen “as, kind of, a political favor.” 
Murkowski said she’d love to see Sfraga reappointed to the position.
Biden originally nominated Sfraga, an Alaskan geographer who’d worked at a think tank and in Alaska’s university system, to the ambassadorship in early 2023. 
Murkowski recommended Sfraga for the post and lobbied for his confirmation.
But it took more than 18 months for the U.S. Senate to take an up or down vote. Some Republican senators, led by Idaho Republican James Risch, criticized Sfraga’s relationships with officials and institutions from China and Russia.
Sfraga said in an email that filling his old post is in America’s best interest. 
“The United States requires a Senate-confirmed ambassador so we can inform, influence and appropriately lead Arctic-related issues and policies throughout the region, clearly articulate U.S. Arctic goals and objectives, and ensure our policies and efforts are coordinated and advanced at home,” he said.
Asked whether he’d take the job back if chosen by Trump — as suggested by Murkowski — Sfraga thanked the senator for her “unwavering support.”
“It is now time to consider other opportunities to advance U.S. and allied partners’ interests in the Arctic, and Alaska’s unique role in the region’s future,” he said.
Alaska’s sole member of the U.S. House, Republican Nick Begich III, said in an emailed statement that an Arctic ambassador supports a strong presence in the region, “which is vital for national security.”
“I will continue to work with the executive branch and members of the Alaska delegation to advocate for an Arctic policy that includes leadership staffing as a component of our national security strategy,” Begich said.
The State Department, in an emailed statement to Northern Journal, did not directly answer a question about if and when the new administration plans to replace Sfraga. But it did say that the Office of the Ambassador-at-Large for Arctic Affairs “remains funded and operational.”
That’s in contrast to the Wilson Center — a 55-year-old think tank that once employed Sfraga when he was the founding director of the center’s Polar Institute. 
The center, which focuses on foreign policy, has been almost entirely shut down by the new administration, with more than 100 employees placed on leave and just a handful of congressionally mandated positions remaining, according to the New York Times. The Polar Institute’s current director did not respond to a request for comment.
At the U.S. Department of Defense, meanwhile, the administration has filled one top Arctic-focused position. Last month, Steven Schleien, a longtime department official, was named deputy assistant secretary for Arctic and global resilience — with responsibilities that include Arctic security, ocean issues and critical minerals.
One other person that experts see as a potentially influential voice on the administration’s Arctic policy is Julia Nesheiwat. 
Nesheiwat currently has no formal role in the administration. But she’s a former homeland security adviser to Trump and a former member of the U.S. Arctic Research Commission, and her husband, Mike Waltz, is Trump’s national security advisor.
Nesheiwat recently traveled with Waltz, Vice President J.D. Vance and other top administration officials to Greenland. She also held a meeting with Republican Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy at an energy conference in Texas last month.
Murkowski said she’s spoken about Arctic policy with Marco Rubio, the secretary of state and her former U.S. Senate colleague. 
She also sent the president and other top administration officials a letter last month outlining her Arctic-related priorities — including the appointment of a special presidential assistant focused on the region, and the creation of a new deputy assistant secretary for Arctic affairs at the State Department.
Murkowski, who’s publicly clashed with Trump at times, acknowledged that some in the new administration “would love to deep-six anything that I might suggest.”
“But I know that you have people who are genuinely interested in advancing good policy,” she said. “I think they’re looking for suggestions.”

Andy Barr confirmed his run for U.S. Senate Tuesday by unveiling a video.

Entering his first statewide race, the six-term congressman from Lexington stressed his bona fides as both a Kentuckian and Trump loyalist.
After his announcement speech, Barr told reporters he had asked Trump for his endorsement. “I have, and I’d be honored to have it, and I continue to work to earn it. That’s what I said to the president,” Barr said.
“I’m in a unique position as a member of the U.S. House to actually advance the agenda, to defend the president, to fight for … these America First policies.” 
Kentuckians will send someone new to the U.S. Senate in November 2026 to fill the seat that Republican U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell will be leaving after 42 years.
Barr already faces former state Attorney General Daniel Cameron in the Republican primary to succeed McConnell. Cameron, who has twice run statewide — winning the attorney general race in 2019 and losing the 2023 governor’s race to Democratic incumbent Andy Beshear — announced his candidacy in February moments after McConnell announced he was retiring. Also mulling entering the Republican primary is Lexington businessman Nate Morris.
Barr starts his race with a fundraising edge. He reported raising $1.8 million in the first quarter of 2025 and has $5.3 million on hand, according to federal campaign finance reports. Cameron reported having raised $508,000 for his Senate run as of March 31.

On the Democratic side, state House Minority Floor Leader Rep. Pamela Stevenson, of Louisville, has announced. Frequently mentioned as a possible candidate is Rocky Adkins, a senior adviser to Beshear and former state House Democratic floor leader.
Barr told reporters he had spent the first few months of this year assessing his statewide support “and everywhere we turned it was a green light.”
“We’re not looking past the primary, but ultimately, the general election electorate is going to select the next senator from Kentucky.  … I know that this Commonwealth of Kentucky overwhelmingly elected President Trump and Kentucky deserves a United States senator who will support President Trump and his agenda, and he knows that I am with him.” 
In announcing, Barr echoed some familiar Trump themes. He denounced “insane DEI initiatives,” referring to diversity, equity and inclusion programs that Trump has banned in the federal government and is moving to end elsewhere. Barr also picked up on Trump’s presidential campaign’s emphasis on transgender issues, vowing to “lock up the sickos who allow biological men to share locker rooms with our daughters.”

Describing  himself as “an eighth-generation Kentuckian, the grandson of World War II veterans,” Barr said he is “a man who loves my family and friends, who lives and breathes everything Kentucky, bourbon, horses and Kentucky basketball.”
Republican legislators attending Barr’s announcement included Sen. Phillip Wheeler of Pikeville, Sen. Scott Madon of Pineville, Rep. Kim King of Harrodsburg and Sen. Amanda Mays Bledsoe of Lexington.
Barr said he was holding the event in Madison County because conservative voters there “always have been and always will be the firewall of our campaigns.”
Barr was first elected to the U.S. House in 2012, defeating Democratic incumbent Ben Chandler. Currently, he is a senior member of the House Financial Services Committee and chairman of the Financial Institutions and Monetary Policy Subcommittee. He also serves on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. 
In December Barr lost a Republican caucus vote to be chairman of the powerful Financial Services Committee, which oversees U.S. banking  and monetary policy. He had earlier said a House committee chairmanship would preclude his running for the Senate, McClatchy reported.
In the weeks leading up to Barr’s announcement, the congressman was among Republicans facing pressure from their constituents to have an in-person town hall over growing frustrations with Trump’s agenda. Last month, more than 900 people gathered for a town hall at the Kentucky Theatre in Lexington, but Barr declined to attend. He did have a telephone town hall days later. 
The Republican primary looks to be contentious between Barr and Cameron, particularly as they seek a coveted endorsement from Trump. Cameron had Trump’s backing for his failed 2023 race. Barr has consistently emphasized his support for the president’s agenda and for his billionaire adviser Elon Musk. At a White House event earlier this month, Trump said while acknowledging Barr’s attendance: “Good luck with everything. I hear good things.”  
A possible third GOP candidate, Morris, the Lexington businessman, has gained the eye of Trump allies, including the president’s son, Donald Trump Jr. Morris’ support for the president’s tariff plans was included in a recent White House press release. 
Kentucky Democratic Party Chair Colmon Elridge in a statement said Barr in Congress has done “absolutely nothing” while the Trump administration “cripples our economy, sends prices skyrocketing, targets Kentucky’s signature industries and threatens to gut health care that 1.5 million Kentuckians rely on.”
“Today, he managed to launch his U.S. Senate campaign with a two-minute video that grovels for Trump’s endorsement and ignores the very real problems Kentuckians face every day,” Elridge said.
Barr’s Senate candidacy now opens the race for Kentucky’s 6th Congressional District — a seat in central Kentucky that Democrats are hoping to flip. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) previously listed Barr’s current seat as one of the districts it views as in play heading into midterm elections in 2026. 
On Tuesday, the DCCC said Barr’s decision creating an open seat makes Kentucky’s 6th District “even more winnable,” noting that Democrat Beshear carried the district 60-40. “Kentuckians deserve a representative who will put their interests first — fighting to lower costs, create good jobs, and protect their health care, not another rubberstamp for their D.C. party boss’s agenda of tax breaks for billionaires,” said the DCCC statement.

(Nathaniel Bailey for the Daily Montanan)A controversial bill to support arts programs but that left more than a dozen without expected funds passed a near-final hurdle in the Senate on Monday.
On a 29-21 vote, the Senate approved House Bill 9, with a reminder from Sen. Ellie Boldman, D-Missoula, of the source of the funds for the programs.
“These projects are powered by coal,” said Boldman, who carried the bill in the Senate.
HB 9 appropriates $953,500 for cultural and aesthetic grants, including money for museums, at least one library, a history project, dance company and other arts groups.
Originally, around 75 groups asked for grants of $12,500 to $13,000 each, but that’s not how legislators allocated the dollars.
Earlier this session, sponsor Rep. John Fitzpatrick, R-Anaconda, sparked criticism from people in the arts community after he suggested groups whose representatives didn’t testify at the Capitol about their programs were “slackers” and shouldn’t get funding.
“They’re running a business, and they can’t even take five minutes for a ‘give-me’ check?” Fitzpatrick, chairperson of the subcommittee, said earlier.
Some arts leaders said they didn’t know their appearance was mandatory.
Staff from the Montana Arts Council, which administers the program for the state, told lawmakers that they had mistakenly communicated to the groups that their attendance was not required, and attendance would not impact funding.
Nonetheless, legislators in the subcommittee unanimously agreed to cut funding from groups that didn’t show up in person to testify and reduce funds for groups that submitted only written testimony.
Lawmakers subsequently made only slight adjustments to the bill, and on the Senate floor Tuesday, Boldman stressed that the funding allocations are up to legislators, who are not a rubber stamp.
“It’s not a lot of money, but it’s still public money, so we do take that seriously,” Boldman said.
She said if groups didn’t appear either remotely or in person, then their applications weren’t funded, and 17 fell into that category.
However, Boldman described the funded projects as “awesome” and representing counties across Montana.
She described the process in response to a question from Sen. Jacinda Morigeau, D-Arlee, about how funding decisions were made.
Morigeau said some of her constituents had reached out to tell her the process wasn’t clear this year.
“I just wanted to stand up on their behalf and say that it is a real detriment to some of these small rural, rural, rural programs, that they weren’t funded,” Morigeau said.
However, Morigeau also said she would encourage them to apply again in two years.
Sen. Bob Phalen, R-Lindsay, wanted to know if some of the establishments that received funding were “still displaying obscenities.”
Phalen said he wasn’t referring to any specific project but to a bill he sponsored in 2023 to curb obscenity.
In response, Boldman said she wasn’t aware of any establishments showcasing obscene material.
Earlier reporting by the Daily Montanan found the applicant for one group requesting money was Fitzpatrick’s wife, and it was among those that received more money than originally proposed, and the only one to receive more than twice its original request.
Fitzpatrick, though, earlier told the Daily Montanan that he didn’t have a conflict of interest to disclose, at least not any more than he could be seen to have one with any other number of groups in his district.
On the Senate floor, Boldman said she too is connected with some of the groups, such as a children’s theater in which her son participates.
Sen. Christopher Pope, D-Bozeman, said he supported the bill, but he also didn’t want to see arts organizations stricken from the bill in the future, having seen “quality organizations being crossed off.”
However, Sen. Denley Loge, R-St. Regis, said the grants help small communities such as his, and he appreciates the idea that those who want support show up.
“It shows that they have to have a little skin in the game of time and involvement,” Loge said.
The bill earlier passed the House on a 58-39 vote, and it needs to pass another vote in the Senate.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250212_MTLeg-292-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-23 00:01:14.978552

Dunleavy vetoed House Bill 69 last week, citing cost concerns and the lack of policy measures he endorsed. With the House and Senate meeting in joint session, the vote to override Dunleavy was 33-27, sustaining the veto. Forty of the Legislature’s 60 members were needed for an override. 
In its final version, HB 69 would have increased the state’s base student allocation, core of the K-12 funding formula, by $1,000 per student. That would have resulted in $253 million more per year for public schools, if fully funded.
Last year, the Legislature voted overwhelmingly in favor of a smaller, $174 million formula increase. Dunleavy vetoed that bill as well. Lawmakers then failed by a single vote to override the governor’s decision.
Unlike in 2024, when education supporters packed the Capitol to urge an override, there was no major protest accompanying the override vote. A single pro-override sign-waver stood outside the Capitol for about 30 minutes during lunchtime, then departed amid a light drizzle.
As the joint session got underway, Sen. Lyman Hoffman, D-Bethel and co-chair of the Senate Finance Committee, spoke first. 
“It is with great reluctance that I stand here today to support the governor’s veto,” he said. “As everyone is well aware we have a major budget deficit. Not only in the current year that we are in, some $150 million, but we also have a substantial amount for the coming fiscal year.”
Hoffman said that while he supports a $1,000 BSA increase, lawmakers must address raising new revenues first. The Senate is currently considering revenue measures, including changes to the state’s oil tax and corporate taxes. 
Hoffman said revenue measures could make a $1,000 BSA increase affordable.
“If we truly say that education is our No. 1 priority, we should stand behind it fiscally,” he said.
Rep. Andrew Gray, D-Anchorage, spoke in support of overriding the veto to provide much-needed school funding.

“Year after year of flat funding is resulting in harm to our children. We are punishing them for the mistakes that we as a Legislature have made, and it is not fair,” he said.
Many lawmakers spoke of school districts facing severe budget deficits, staff and program cuts, and school closures. 
“The consequences of underfunding are being felt deeply. A meaningful increase to the BSA would help prevent the devastating cuts our districts are now being forced to make,” said Sen. Elvi Gray-Jackson, D-Anchorage, who supported the veto override. “Funding public education is not a game.”
Other lawmakers objected to the lack of education policy reforms in the bill, as Dunleavy pressed for during a news conference announcing the veto on Thursday. 
“I’m objecting to forcing people to contribute more without any discussion of performance measures,” said Rep. Mike Prax, R-North Pole, who voted to sustain the veto. 
Rep. Nellie Jimmie, D-Toksook Bay, spoke in support of overriding the veto, protecting the Permanent Fund dividend, and raising new state revenue. 
“This bill is expensive, and it still isn’t enough. With the frozen funding and grants running dry, the future is uncertain, but we can’t build our future on deficit spending either,” she said. “We can’t take the PFD, which is often a matter of life and death in rural Alaska. When our savings run out of money, Alaska, lights go dark. It is time to stop hoping for high oil prices or more visitors on cruise ships who will save us. We are out of options. It is time to ask without fear, how will we pay for this? And it’s time to clearly say, we need to raise new revenues, and we shouldn’t be scared of that.” 
During his speech against the override, Hoffman said that the state’s Constitutional Budget Reserve — the largest remaining state savings account — was not intended to pay for recurring expenses.
Rep. Andy Josephson, D-Anchorage and co-chair of the House Finance Committee, argued against Hoffman’s statement a few minutes later.
“There’s been esteemed members of the Legislature who’ve noted that this is an affordability question, and I don’t agree with that,” he said.
The House’s version of the operating budget — including a $1,000 BSA increase — has a deficit of $67 million, Josephson said. In contrast, the CBR has a balance of $2.8 billion.
“That’s 2.4%. So I can’t go to my constituents and say, this is just unaffordable. Because it’s not. It’s just a question of will, that’s all,” Josephson said, arguing that savings can be used to pay for education.
The deficit in the House’s draft budget may be larger than Josephson stated, because it contains a cut whose constitutionality has been questioned, and it does not include deficits in the capital budget or the supplemental budget, two separate documents.
After more than an hour of speeches, members of the House and Senate voted 33-27 to sustain the governor’s veto of House Bill 69. 
The override vote was almost identical to the votes on the original bill, which passed the House and Senate by a combined vote of 32-25. 
Reps. Elexie Moore, R-Wasilla; Will Stapp, R-Fairbanks; and Mike Prax, R-North Pole, were absent from the original House vote and acted to sustain the veto. Sen. Donny Olson, D-Golovin, voted against the original bill but in favor of the override.
Afterward, he walked past reporters and did not answer questions about why he changed his vote.
The tally fell along caucus lines for members of the House, with members of the House’s multipartisan majority — two Republicans, five independents and 14 Democrats — voting to override and all 19 members of the House’s all-Republican minority voting to sustain.
Among members of the Senate, Sens. Lyman Hoffman, D-Bethel, and Bert Stedman, R-Sitka, voted to sustain the veto alongside all six members of the Senate’s minority caucus. The remaining 12 members of the Senate’s bipartisan majority voted to override.
After the vote, the bill’s sponsor, Rep. Rebecca Himschoot, I-Sitka, spoke with reporters and expressed her disappointment with the Legislature’s failure to override the governor’s veto for the second year in a row. 
“Previously, when we had the funds, we lacked the political will,” she said. “I believe that there is great political will at this point to try to do something about how we’re funding our schools, or failing to fund our schools, and we lack the funds. So I think this outcome was somewhat predictable, but that doesn’t make it any less disappointing.”
In a statement on social media, Dunleavy thanked lawmakers for voting to sustain his veto.

“Their action shows a clear understanding of our fiscal situation and the fact that the bill had zero policy to create a better educational outcome for our students,” he wrote.
He added that legislators now have “a clear path” to consider an alternative bill he proposed on Friday.
The governor’s bill includes a smaller funding increase and policy provisions he prefers.
“We’ve got 30 days to get the job done. Let’s finish it. We can do this,” said Senate Minority Leader Mike Shower, R-Wasilla.
Members of the House minority also offered comments in support of the governor’s alternative.
“We still have a lot of airstrip left,” said Rep. Bill Elam, R-Nikiski and a vote to sustain the veto. “We haven’t completely landed all of this. We can continue. We have some opportunities.”
But Sen. Bill Wielechowski, D-Anchorage and the Senate majority’s lead negotiator with the governor, said that at least some of the governor’s ideas are nonstarters.
Speaking to reporters, he offered an example: a section of the bill that would allow first-come, first-served open enrollment at public schools. That doesn’t make sense, Wielechowski said, because it could keep local students from enrolling at the school closest to them.
More broadly and significantly, Wielechowski said there appears to be a fundamental disagreement in multiple sections of the bill about the amount of control the executive branch should have over local schools.
“I don’t know how we can get over that,” he said.
Last week, Speaker of the House Bryce Edgmon, I-Dillingham, told reporters that in his view, it’s significant that school districts are not requesting the kinds of policy changes that the governor is seeking.
“There are some things in there that we can coalesce around, but we still have a ways to go and be able to reconcile policy differences,” he said.
If the failed override does mean no permanent funding increase this year, a one-year funding bonus remains possible. The House’s draft operating budget includes a one-time, $253 million funding bonus equivalent to the vetoed formula.
That would be $79 million more than last year’s budget, which contained a $174 million one-time bonus, but the House’s proposed amount is subject to approval by the Senate and Dunleavy, who has line-item veto power. Senate budget leaders have said they plan to pass a budget without a deficit.
In a news conference last week, the governor said that if lawmakers present a deficit-free budget with one-time funding, he’d be willing to discuss the issue.

Bennett Raglin/Getty Images for BETThe 2025 Georgia legislative session has concluded, so it is time to take a moment and reflect on a bill that should have passed but did not: House Bill 237.
Within the first 30 seconds of Young Thug’s 2018 song “Anybody” he raps, “I never killed anybody, but I got something to do with that body.” Later in the song Thug continues, “Getting all types of cash, I’m a general true…” This was just one of the lyrics that the Fulton County prosecution presented, arguing that “general”  demonstrated Thug’s leadership role in the YSL gang. During Georgia’s longest trial, Judge Ural Glanville allowed 17 sets of lyrics from Young Thug and other co-defendants to enter the trial.  
It’s a troubling trend. Prosecutors around the country have used rap lyrics as evidence in criminal trials, despite the fact that rap lyrics—like movies, books, and lyrics from other musical genres—are often fictionalized. Yet, rap lyrics—often written and performed by Black artists—continue to be weaponized by prosecutors as criminal evidence in court.
A solution is House Bill 237, which didn’t pass the 2025 General Assembly session but remains alive for the 2026 session. With Democratic and Republican sponsors (one being the chairman of the Creative Arts and Entertainment Committee), the bill would limit the use of creative expression as evidence, ensuring fairer court proceedings and reducing potential bias. If Georgia can offer tax incentives to the entertainment industry, it is surely time for the state to safeguard the creative expression it seeks to attract. Indeed, California passed a similar law and Louisiana amended its evidence codes regarding admissibility of character evidence. In Louisiana, this means that artistic expressions, such as rap lyrics, cannot be used to demonstrate that the defendant is violent or capable of committing a particular crime but can instead be used to establish intent, knowledge, or motive.  
Georgia lawmakers should pass HB 237 or similar legislation in 2026 to protect free speech, limit the prejudicial use of creative expression in courtrooms, and ensure fairer trials.  
The Young Thug trial demonstrated that rap lyrics, often unrelated to the facts of the criminal case at issue, create juror bias when they’re used as evidence. The injustice extends beyond just trials: Lyrics also may be used as evidence in probation violation parole revocation proceedings in Georgia’s courts. 
HB 237 takes a necessary step toward limiting the prejudicial use of creative expression in criminal proceedings. First, it applies to several forms of creative expression—not just music but also poetry, performance art, and symbols. Second, it establishes a reasonable balance of interests by preliminarily marking creative expression as inadmissible unless prosecutors can demonstrate a direct connection between the creative expression and the crime or violation at issue. This prevents jurors from unfairly associating an artist’s fictional words with actual unlawful activity. This is particularly important with rap lyrics because rap is a genre that often references violence and various types of crime, as well as using expletives and racial epithets. Allowing such prejudicial content in the courtroom risks causing a jury to view the defendant in a less favorable or more stereotypical light than they otherwise would.
Critics argue that HB 237 will prevent prosecutors from using crucial evidence. However, the bill does not impose a blanket ban on lyrics or creative works in court. Instead, it ensures that creative expression is used only when it is directly relevant to a case. This distinction matters. Without it, courts are allowing lyrics to be introduced essentially as character evidence—which is generally disfavored in legal proceedings because it unfairly influences jurors. Importantly, HB 237 also does not add unnecessary steps to the criminal process. Judges already regularly receive and rule on pretrial motions to determine admissibility of evidence before trial. This bill simply uses an already existing judicial procedure to ensure that rulings are focused on facts—not biased stereotypes. 
Georgia is positioning itself as a national entertainment hub, reporting $8.55 billion in entertainment-related economic output in fiscal year 2022 alone. But if the state values this economic impact, it must also protect the rights of artists who are the backbone of the entertainment industry. Whether it’s music, literature, or film, art is not a confession. Georgia should recognize that. HB 237 should make a much needed re-appearance in the next legislative session.

More than 50 members of United Campus Workers of Kentucky, West KY NOW, Murray State Alliance and the Murray State University College Democrats participated in the event.
Brian Bourke, a professor and program coordinator in the Higher Education and Student Affairs master’s program at Murray and a member of United Campus Workers, said he hopes the university community realizes the potential dangers that international students are facing under the Trump administration. 
“During the rally, I did hear some people who stopped by the table expressing shock and dismay that a member of our community had their visa revoked,” Bourke said. “It also demonstrates that Murray State is part of a broader world of higher education in the United States, and that the bad things don’t only happen at the bigger name institutions we tend to hear about in the news.”
Murray State University College Democrats wrote an open letter last week calling on the university administration “to make public statements about their commitment to the safety of all members of the MSU community.” 
Katelyn Gardner, a junior and secretary of the campus Democrats, said, “International students and workers provide so much good to our university, and they deserve to be advocated for. It’s up to us to provide our support and call on university officials to commit publicly to offer their support as well.”
She said it’s important for organizations to advocate for international students because the political climate can make it risky for the students to advocate for themselves. 
“With both the letter and the rally, we hope that university administration will take more responsibility for student and staff safety and wellbeing,” Gardner said. “We hope for more information and guidelines to be given to students and staff so that they have a better understanding of their rights, and they feel safer and better supported at a school that they worked incredibly hard to be at.”
Student Government Association President Ali Khatib, a Palestinian-American, told the rally that international students are being punished for voicing their opinions, including opposition to Israel’s war in Gaza. “I really think we’re in for some scary times, and I hope that more and more people can be aware of what’s going on.”
Inside Higher Ed reports that more than 1,500 students from nearly 250 colleges have had their visas revoked by the Trump administration, but their identities and why they’ve been targeted are still largely unknown.
Earlier this month, the University of Kentucky reported a “small number” of graduate students had their visas revoked by the Department of Homeland Security. Officials from private Campbellsville University told Inside Higher Ed that some of its international students had their visas revoked but declined to say how many.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_5258.heic,,,2025-04-22 22:05:29.552500

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)As Alaska continues to grapple with fiscal uncertainty, the Alaska Permanent Fund remains at the heart of the conversation. Its performance and structure profoundly affect our state’s budget, the future of the Permanent Fund dividend, and the long-term economic health of Alaska. Yet its structure — specifically the division between the Earnings Reserve Account and the principal — is no longer serving us well. In fact, it’s creating a slow bleed of our spendable savings. Proposals to merge the two accounts into a single constitutionally protected fund are not just about simplifying accounting. They are about correcting a dangerous flaw in how we draw money from the Permanent Fund and effectively creating a spending limit on the fund.
To understand why, we need to briefly unpack how the fund works today.
The fund is divided into two accounts: the principal, which is constitutionally protected and cannot be spent without a vote of the people, and the Earnings Reserve Account, which holds realized investment earnings and is fully spendable with a simple majority vote of the Legislature.
Since 2018, Alaska has followed a Percent of Market Value draw system to sustainably use fund earnings. The formula allows for a 5% annual draw based on the average total market value of the entire fund — both the principal and the ERA. However, there’s a fundamental problem: While the draw is calculated using the full value of the fund, the money can only be taken from the ERA. The Legislature is legally prohibited from touching the principal, which means the full value of the fund is theoretical when it comes to actual cash available.
This creates an imbalance that threatens the very sustainability the Percent of Market Value system was designed to protect. Here’s why: Realized gains from investments, like selling a stock at profit, flow into the ERA, where they become available to spend. But unrealized gains — paper increases in asset values — primarily remain in the principal. The problem is that most of the fund’s growth has been in unrealized gains, which are locked away. Meanwhile, the Legislature continues to draw 5% of the average total fund value every year — but only from the ERA.
This means the ERA is being drawn down faster than it can be replenished. In years of market volatility or lower realized returns, this pressure becomes even more acute. And because the ERA is fully spendable with a simple majority vote, it’s vulnerable to political pressure. The temptation to overdraw is always there.
Merging the ERA with the principal into a single, constitutionally protected fund fixes this flaw. It doesn’t just simplify fund management; it changes how the Fund can be accessed. All earnings – realized and unrealized – would remain in the unified fund. The only way money could be withdrawn would be through a constitutional Percent of Market Value draw.
This is not a minor shift. It would be the most significant fiscal reform in Alaska in a generation. It creates a hard cap on spending from the fund, one tied directly to its performance and sustainability. No more treating realized gains as a checking account. Instead, the entire fund is protected, and spending from it is limited to what is sustainable over the long term.
In the end, this reform is about protecting the Permanent Fund, the PFD, and Alaska’s fiscal future. The fund was created to turn a temporary resource boom into a permanent financial legacy. But that legacy only survives if we guard it against political pressure and short-term thinking.
This is more than a fiscal policy debate. It’s about protecting the fund for future generations, ensuring the PFD survives, and building a system that supports long-term stability. Merging the accounts creates the discipline Alaska needs — and the legacy Alaskans deserve.

It was the monitor’s 22nd visit to the prisons, and revealed both signs of improvement and lingering or worsening problems for the two facilities. The monitor noted that the populations at Lincoln Hills and Copper Lake were “significantly higher” compared to the last visit in October 2024. As of April 18, there are 78 boys at Lincoln Hills, 34 youth at Mendota, six girls at Copper Lake, and four at the Grow Academy, according to weekly population reports. The total on-grounds juvenile population is currently 122, up from the 95 who were in custody in early January. 
Average staffing vacancies which typically hovered around 16%-40% were lower, and the monitor stressed the need to address youth on administrative confinement, particularly those waiting to be transferred to another facility. 
Despite the issues, the report found that the Department of Corrections (DOC) is in substantial compliance with 45 (or 90%) of the 50 provisions identified in a court-ordered consent decree that resulted from a 2017 lawsuit over conditions at the youth prison. With the new monitoring report, four more provisions of the consent decree were brought into substantial compliance.
“This report showcases the hard work and commitment of our staff at Lincoln Hills and Copper Lake,” said DOC secretary Jared Hoy in a statement. “Tremendous progress has been made over the past seven plus years and we are looking forward to realizing a new model for juvenile corrections in Wisconsin.” The Mendota Juvenile Treatment Center began accepting girls for the first time, allowing the population at Copper Lake to be cut in half. Transfer times for boys were also reduced, and treatment teams have helped youth understand the root causes for anti-social behavior.
  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
The report noted that physical improvements, such as replacing heat exchangers and deck upgrades to training facilities, were made since the last visit. Wifi strength has increased in the school and other living units, making it easier for youth to access recreation and learning programs.
Youth in confinement are provided with a special education teacher, as well as a general education teacher. New classrooms have been added to the Skills Development Programs, and teachers are attending youth growth team meetings and other activities. Some incarcerated youth did complain about teachers not being on the units most of the time, and only receiving paper packet work or chromebooks. A random viewing of video by the monitor showed teachers in the units. Youth also played kickball and were in the music lab during the monitoring visit. The facility still lacks a welding instructor, a program which youth appear to enjoy. The monitor was also concerned about vacancy rates in light of the growing population at Lincoln Hills. 
Living units were clean, and youth interacted with the monitor respectfully. Some housing units weren’t visited because the youth were rambunctious, but all units appeared clean and organized. Youth were calm and talkative with monitoring team members and one another, according to the report. Some played cards, ate lunch, made phone calls or watched television. When interviewed by the monitor, the youth were largely positive. They said they enjoyed new menu items, the music lab, but complained about food portion sizes. They also wished there were more jobs for them to do around the facility, and wanted the kickball unit to be switched to basketball. 
“Some youth stated that staff were abusive, and some youth really liked the staff and said they treated them well,” the monitor wrote. “Youth took pride in how clean their rooms and units were.” There were also complaints about restraints, including  waist belts, that have been used when they are out of their rooms. Youth felt the use of restraints was unfair, and that sometimes they weren’t told when violations were received. 
In 2022, DOC received funding to move forward with a state-run juvenile facility in Milwaukee County. Land was approved on West Clinton Avenue and the design has been  finalized and work began in the summer of 2024. The 32-bed facility is scheduled to be completed in late 2026. Another Type 1 facility is being designed in Dane County. Opening the new facilities will be a major step towards the Legislature’s goal of closing Lincoln Hills and Copper Lake, which have had troubled reputations for abuse and violence against youth housed there as well as staff members.

Wes Moore (D) on Tuesday. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Lawyers representing men and women who were abused as children while in state custody said newly signed legislation will lead to court challenges and a wave of lawsuits over the next five weeks.
Gov. Wes Moore (D) and legislative leaders on Tuesday signed House Bill 1378 into law, which will cut in half potential awards to victims that were promised just two years ago in legislation that was hailed for giving survivors another chance to have their day in court.
But that led to claims by thousands of men and women who were sexually abused while in state custody, opening the door to potentially budget-crushing financial awards and sparking the rush to pass HB1378, which takes effect June 1.
D. Todd Mathews, an attorney with Bailey & Glasser, said his firm would be part of a challenge to the new law.
“We will vigorously oppose this clearly unconstitutional bill, in order to protect the Survivors, as the State and Governor Moore have clearly failed them,” Mathews said in an email.
Washington, D.C.-based Bailey & Glasser is one of nearly two dozen firms representing more than 4,500 plaintiffs. The coalition of firms has been in active negotiations with the Maryland Attorney General’s office since 2023.
Mathews and Ryan S. Perlin, an attorney at Baltimore-based Bekman, Marder, Hopper, Malarkey & Perlin, said the newly signed law could face several potential constitutional challenges.
“It’s all but a certainty that this will be challenged,” Perlin said Tuesday morning.
With a June 1 effective date, survivors have until May 31 to file a lawsuit under the old law, which caps damages at $1.5 million per occurrence for private institutions and $890,000 per occurrence against government entities. On June 1, those caps fall to $700,000 and $400,000, respectively.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Perlin said those reductions, as well as the five-week filing window, will likely be challenged, along with the difference in how the law treats lawsuits against private and public institutions.
The bill also caps the fees that can be paid to attorneys representing survivors.
“That will have a chilling effect, making it harder for survivors to find a lawyer who will represent them,” said Perlin, whose firm announced last week that it had filed a new group of lawsuits against Towson-based Calvert Hall College High School under the current law
The bill was one of 142 signed into law at the second ceremony following the 2025 session. That second tranche of new laws included bills affecting expungement of criminal records, the Second Look Act and legislation to aid federal workers whose jobs have been eliminated by President Donald Trump.
Moore did not comment on the Child Victims Act changes during remarks delivered before the bill signing. When asked for comment, a spokesperson for the office repeated a statement from last week, that “acknowledged the trauma” survivors have faced, but said the bill would “continue to allow the survivors to seek justice while preserving the long-term fiscal stability of the state.””
Lisae Jordan, executive director and counsel at Maryland Coalition Against Sexual Assault, said she hoped the state would make more services available to people who were abused in state facilities.
“House Bill 1378 will save the state a lot of money, but it remains to be seen whether some of the savings will be used to help prevent future abuse or to provide services for survivors who can’t prove their case in court,” Jordan said in an email. “Helping people who were sexually abused while in state custody doesn’t require a lawsuit, but it will require more resources.”
The muted comment at Tuesday’s signing was a vastly different affair than two years ago when Moore praised passage of the Child Victims Act and throngs of survivors traveled to Annapolis for the bill signing.
That 2023 law eliminated time restrictions during which survivors of institutional sexual abuse had to file lawsuits. It also set the $1.5 million and $890,000 caps on awards per “occurrence” of abuse — a term over which plaintiff’s attorneys and some lawmakers disagree.
At the time, the focus was on the substantial number of cases expected to arise out of the Catholic church sex abuse scandal, and the Archdiocese of Baltimore filed for bankruptcy protection in advance of the 2023 law taking effect.
At the same time, hundreds of cases against the state, including the Department of Juvenile Services, began to surface. Lawmakers were warned in January of billions in potential liabilities from an estimated 3,500 cases. Those alone would have dire budgetary consequences.
Since then, a coalition of attorneys has said they have nearly 6,000 cases. And those cases are believed to be just the start.
Two weeks ago, Levy Konigsberg, a New York-based law firm that is part of the coalition, filed lawsuits on behalf of 221 men and women in connection with sexual abuse allegations at 15 state juvenile detention facilities. The lawsuits bring the number of claims handled by Levy Konigsberg alone to roughly 2,000, according to the firm.
Del. C.T. Wilson (D-Charles), who sponsored the 2023 bill, stepped in to author the changes in HB1378, which he called an attempt to ease the potential financial burden to the state while giving survivors the opportunity to seek justice.
“This bill does nothing to change the amounts [government] is going to pay out,” said Perlin, who said lawyers will rush “thousands of cases” to the courthouses in the next five weeks in order to come in under the current, higher caps.
That rush of cases could potentially slow the judicial system and its existing workload of criminal and civil cases to a crawl.
It is likely that victims’ claims and legal challenges to the new law will move simultaneously.
Lawyers could seek a temporary injunction before the end of May, to put the law on hold while courts determine its constitutionality; or attorneys representing the survivors could hold off on a challenge until June 1, when the new law takes effect.
A third scenario would bring a challenge to the law after survivors start appealing the resolution of individual cases, according to Perlin. Mathews agreed, adding that scenario could take years to resolve.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DSC_0318-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-22 22:05:29.552500

U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Stacey Jernigan approved Prospect Medical Holdings’ plan to begin turning new patients away in Delaware County on Wednesday and to stop providing most services by Friday. 
The emergency departments at Crozer Chester Medical Center in Upland and Taylor Hospital in Ridley Park will stop receiving patients by ambulance but walk-in patients will be accepted for up to a week.
In a hearing on the request, lawyers for a nurses union asked for assurance that the company would pay wages and pension contributions owed since Prospect filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January.
Another lawyer representing several Delaware County municipalities and the school district where one of the hospitals is located argued that the company had not given the required notice that it would stop providing emergency medical and ambulance services. 
“Closing a hospital system of this size is an absolute massive undertaking, and as you would expect, there is chaos, especially given that staff and patients in the community really believed that there would be a hero … stepping up,” Patient Safety Ombudsman Suzanne Koenig testified, adding that the staff remain dedicated to ensuring an orderly transfer of longer-term patients to other facilities.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Prospect has owned Crozer Health System since 2016 and closed two of its four hospitals in recent years as the California-based parent company faced financial peril. On Monday, it notified more than 2,600 employees that it would close its remaining two hospitals. It is one of the largest employers in the county. 
Attorney William Curtin, who represents Prospect in the bankruptcy case, said company officials worked tirelessly with the assistance of the Pennsylvania attorney general’s office to work out a deal to give the hospitals to a new owner in exchange for assuming their liabilities. 
“At the end of the day, your honor, it came down to funding, and there just wasn’t funding there to support a transition or to support a long term future for these hospitals,” Curtin said.
Pennsylvania and the philanthropic organization The Foundation for Delaware County provided more than $40 million in funding to allow the hospitals to continue operations as Prospect negotiated with the University of Pennsylvania to acquire the hospitals.
While Penn offered to inject an additional $5 million for the purchase of certain assets and assumption of leases, it would have also added to Prospect’s debt and the money would not be available until the deal was closed, Curtin said.
“So essentially, the $5 million was going to be too late, and it was unfortunately going to be a bridge to nowhere, because there was … nowhere to go,” he said.
In response to Prospect’s announcement Monday, Delaware County issued an emergency declaration that provides greater flexibility in hiring, procurement, emergency medical services dispatch, and in tracking and potentially recouping expenses related to the ongoing hospital closures. The county filed a motion opposing approval of the closure plan.

“To be clear, Delaware County is extremely disappointed in this outcome, and in the actions of Prospect in every step of this process,” county officials said in a statement. 
Previously owned by Los Angeles-based private equity firm Leonard Green & Partners, Prospect was saddled with $1.3 billion debt as its owners took more than $645 million in dividends and fees, according to ProPublica.
Nicole Stallings, president and CEO of the Hospital + Health System Association of Pennsylvania, said that while it is unfortunate that no agreement was reached to allow Crozer to continue operating, hospitals are “consistently called upon to help when access to care is in crisis” and “will undoubtedly step up and take care of those in need regardless of ability to pay.”
She noted that half of the commonwealth’s acute care hospitals operate at a loss, according to the Pennsylvania Health Care Cost Cost Containment Council. Crozer Health System was losing $12 million a month, according to Prospect.
Stallings said the association is ready to work with policymakers and payors to address the underlying challenges pressuring hospitals and protect Pennsylvanians’ access to care.
The closures will leave Delaware County, with 576,000 people, only two hospitals. It is the fifth most populous county in the commonwealth.
Andrew Costa Kelser, who represents the Philadelphia area health care pension fund and the local affiliate of the National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees, questioned Chief Restructuring Officer Paul Rundell about wages and pension payments.
“I think our first priority right now is patient safety, and we’re focusing on that. And so as I sit here today, I can’t answer anything other than focusing on patient safety issues,” Rundell said.
While Judge Jernigan denied the union’s motion for additional language in the closure plan to assure the payments, she said the question remains a “giant issue” in the resolution of the bankruptcy.
“There’s going to be hell to pay if people don’t get paid their post-petition wages and pension obligations,” Jernigan said. “I’ve gotten assurances from the debtor that these employees will get paid their wages or their salaries as long as they continue to work.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1483938846-gavel-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-22 21:00:19.030062

Earlier, the group visited the Central Louisiana ICE Processing Center, in Jena, where Mahmoud Khalil, a Syrian-born Palestinian and a permanent legal resident of the United States, was sent after ICE agents arrested him inside the lobby of his apartment in New York City.

Khalil and Öztürk’s arrests and detentions have drawn international outcry, with critics accusing the Trump administration of trampling on immigrants’ free speech rights and ignoring the rule of law. Khalil missed the birth of his first child Monday after being denied a temporary release.
Both were in the country legally. Neither has been accused of any crime. But they are now locked up and facing removal. Their arrests are in response only to their political activity. Khalil was involved in pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia, and Öztürk co-authored a critical op-ed in the Tufts student newspaper.
In the past two months, the Trump administration has targeted several other international students and academics who have participated in pro-Palestinian activities at American universities. Last week, the Louisiana Illuminator reported that the administration has canceled international student visas of more than a dozen people studying at colleges and universities in the state.
“They are setting the foundational floor to violate the due process and free speech of every person who calls this country home, whatever your status is,” Pressley said. “It is shameful and it is a sham … It will not go unchecked.”
This is a developing story.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-23 00:39:23+00:00,CT Mirror,Finance panel backs bill to shrink CT transportation debt,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/22/finance-panel-backs-bill-to-shrink-ct-transportation-debt/,A key committee OK'd bills that would reduce CT transportation construction debt and phase out property taxes on vehicles — in the 2030s.,"The legislature’s Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee approved bills Tuesday that would reduce Connecticut transportation construction debt and would gradually phase out property taxes on motor vehicles — in the 2030s.
But even with that long-range strategy, the property tax phase-out faces an uphill struggle, having sparked objections from Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration and from the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities.
The Democratic-controlled finance panel, which must complete action on all its bills by the close of business Thursday, is expected to take up several revenue proposals Wednesday, including a new measure to create a state income tax credit for low- and middle-income families with children.
Those revenue bills, along with a spending plan adopted Tuesday by the Appropriations Committee, will form a blueprint to guide final negotiations with legislative leaders and Lamont on a new state budget for the next two fiscal years.
Capping transportation reserves and paying down debt
One bill, enacted with bipartisan support Tuesday, would cap reserves in the budget’s Special Transportation Fund at 18% of the STF. Any other unspent dollars would be used to pay down transportation debt.
Based on a proposal from state Treasurer Erick Russell, the measure stems from large surpluses in recent years in the transportation fund, which represents about 9% of the $26 billion overall state budget. Besides covering operating expenses for transit programs and for the Departments of Transportation and Motor Vehicles, the fund also pays the debt service — principal and interest — on the hundreds of millions of dollars Connecticut borrows annually for highway, bridge and rail construction projects.
The STF, which gets most of its funding from sales and fuel tax receipts, finished with surpluses approaching or surpassing 10% in each of the past three fiscal years, and the Lamont administration projects a $159 million or 7% surplus this fiscal year.
The STF reserve, which holds these annual surpluses, swelled beyond $970 million last June, according to the state comptroller’s annual reports, a cushion larger than 45% of last year’s entire transportation fund.
Gasoline station owners and fuel distributors began to press state officials to cut gasoline taxes or provide some other relief, given the huge unused revenues.
Legislators agreed to last spring to use $534 million of the reserve to pay down transportation borrowing early — a move Russell projects will save Connecticut $680 million in interest costs over the next decade.
Tax phase-out faces strong objections
The bill approved by the finance committee would maintain the 18% cap permanently and continue to use excess reserves to pay down construction debt.
Majority Democrats adopted a second measure Tuesday over Republican objections that would gradually phase out property taxes on motor vehicles, a levy that generates nearly $1 billion annually for cities and towns. 
But “there will be no revenue loss to the towns,” said Sen. John Fonfara, D-Hartford, co-chairman of the finance committee.
That plan to keep towns whole hinges on state government continuing to rack up the huge budget surpluses it has averaged since new fiscal caps were established in 2017. The average cushion has been $1.8. billion or 8% of the General Fund.
Legislators have used those surpluses over the past eight years to build the rainy day fund and to make more than $8.5 billion in supplemental pension payments, in addition to the more than $3 billion in required pension contributions it makes annually.
Extra pension payments generate more earnings and slow the growth of the mandatory payments. Lamont’s budget office estimates the state will save $700 million annually on required payments next fiscal year because of all the surplus dollars its dedicated to the pensions since 2020.
But what if those large surpluses and extra pension payments continue in the future? The phase-out bill says that, starting in 2028, any savings on required pension contributions should be redirected toward eliminating the property tax. 
For example, if $100 million in pension savings is achieved, and towns are still collecting $1 billion in property taxes, then the state would have communities reduce that burden to $900 million — and send cities and towns $100 million to offset their revenue loss.
Fonfara conceded this process likely would take many years, but the state has been successfully building big surpluses since 2017.
That savings system, though, has come under increasing criticism from majority Democrats in the House and Senate, who say it has left too few dollars to invest in education, health care, town aid and other core programs.
Sen. Ryan Fazio of Greenwich, ranking Senate Republican on the finance committee, said called the municipal levy on motor vehicles “a burdensome tax, an annoying tax, a stupid tax.”
But Fazio, who joined Republicans in voting against the bill, said it hinges on making payments to towns that would be outside of the normal budget process, including the spending cap.
Lamont’s budget director, Jeff Beckham, expressed similar concerns in testimony before the committee.
And the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities, which has long argued that the state relies too heavily on property taxes to fund services at the local level, said any plan to end motor vehicle taxes should be part of a more comprehensive reform that gives communities other options for raising revenue.
The municipal lobbying group also has charged, on many occasions, that state government often reneges on pledges to transfer funds to cities and towns, leaving local property taxpayers in the lurch.
“This bill does not reduce the current revenue needs of towns and cities but shifts the burden to the state and makes towns and cities more dependent,” CCM wrote in its testimony.
Other bills adopted Tuesday by the finance committee would:

Establish a 25% tax credit, capped at $500, for businesses that contribute to employees’ Connecticut Higher Education Trust account.


Create business and income tax credits for farming businesses that invest in certain machinery and buildings. The credit is equal to 20% of the amount farmers spend. The measure also would increase the exemption from municipal property taxes for farm machinery from $100,000 of assessed value to $250,000. 


Expand the types of businesses that may earn a state tax credit for making student loan payments on behalf of their employees starting in 2026. The state caps this program and does not issue more than $10 million in credits per year.


Authorize up to $30 million in borrowing in each of the next two fiscal years to create a new program to help municipal school districts renovate or repair public school buildings, grounds and other infrastructure.


Establish a $500 state income tax credit for owners of a licensed family child care home starting in 2026.


Allow cities and towns, starting in October, to expand an existing property tax abatement program for police, firefighters and emergency medical technicians killed in the line of duty. The benefit would also become available to surviving domestic partners of these first responders. The measure also creates a $2,000 state income tax deduction for certain payments to volunteer firefighters and emergency medical service providers.

Shay Shelnutt, R-Trussville (left) speaks with Sen. Lance Bell, R-Pell City, on the floor of the Alabama Senate on April 8, 2025 at the Alabama Statehouse in Montgomery, Alabama. (Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)The Alabama Senate passed a bill Tuesday that would require local school boards to develop policies allowing students to leave campus during school hours for religious instruction.
SB 278, sponsored by Sen. Shay Shelnutt, R-Trussville, would mandate that school districts establish procedures for students to attend religious classes off-site for elective credit, provided certain conditions are met. The bill passed 25-6 and moves to the House for consideration.
“We passed a law in Alabama in 2019 allowing school districts to enact policies. Since that time, very few school districts have adopted release time policies … parents are approaching superintendents and school boards throughout the state and are being told no,” Shelnutt claimed as he introduced the bill to the floor.

Under the bill, which Shelnutt framed as a “parental rights and religious freedom bill,” participation in religious instruction would be optional and require parental consent. The bill would mandate that organizations providing instruction provide transportation to and from school and that they be liable if anything happens to a child. The bill would also prohibit local funds from being used to provide religious instruction.
Sen. Bobby Singleton, D-Greensboro, asked about teacher qualifications and program accreditation for the off-site religious classes and whether instructors needed to be certified.
“If I’m Muslim, and I want to go to a mosque to get this done — so the school board has to go speak with the person who’s over the mosque to make sure that they’re accredited and certified in their program?” Singleton asked.
Shelnutt said this would be decided locally, saying “that would be up to the local school board if they want to set their policy.”
This led to further exchanges about whether local boards would vet programs across different faiths, such as instructors at a mosque or various churches. Shelnutt maintained local boards set the policy.
“I’m sure there will be differences in the local school boards and how they set them up,” Shelnutt said when pressed on potential inconsistencies across the state’s 139 districts.
Sen. Greg Albritton, R-Atmore, asked for assurance that local policies could not discriminate against specific religions.
“The policy cannot isolate whether it be the Jehovah Witnesses or whether it be the Seventh Day Adventists or be the Methodists … the policy would have to cover for each of those, is that correct?” Albritton asked. Shelnutt said the policy “cannot be restricted” and parents ultimately choose participation.
Sen. Merika Coleman, D-Pleasant Grove, asked about liability, particularly regarding child safety, referencing past issues within religious institutions. She asked who holds liability under programs if something negative happened to the child.
“A child could break his or her leg or hurt themselves? Who holds that liability? With these off-campus type entities,” Coleman asked.
Shelnutt said that the “sponsoring entity holds all the liability, and the state law already states that,” which would absolve the school system.
Sen. Vivian Davis Figures, D-Mobile, questioned the need for the bill, given existing religious education avenues and school choice laws.
“Why don’t you give the local school board the option to vote this in if they even want to do it for their particular school system?” Figures asked.
Shelnutt maintained they are giving the local school boards “local control” by “giving the local school board control of coming up with the policy.”
Shelnutt also added an amendment before the bill’s passage to ensure that school boards with pre-existing release time policies would not be required to change them, which was adopted 26-4 with one abstention.
A House committee rejected a similar bill earlier this month.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Utah public health advocates warn that the Trump administration’s proposed $40 billion cut to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services would be devastating not only for public health programs across the nation, but also to Utah and its economy. 
“These cuts, layered on top of previous reductions to research and programmatic funding, would result in the completed elimination of initiatives critical to Utah’s well-being, such as HIV/AIDS prevention, tobacco control, maternal health programs, vaccine distribution efforts, and rural health services,” the Utah Public Health Association said in a news release issued Tuesday.

Earlier this week, the Washington Post reported President Donald Trump’s administration is looking to cut one-third of the Department of Health and Human Services’ discretionary spending, or $40 billion, according to a preliminary budget document the outlet obtained. 
“The 64-page document calls not only for cuts, but also a major shuffling and restructuring of health and human service agencies,” the Washington Post reported. “Agencies are allowed to appeal to HHS for changes but have been told they cannot change the bottom line, according to a federal health official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the negotiations.”
It will ultimately be up to Congress to decide whether to implement the cuts. 
Carrie Butler, executive director of the Utah Public Health Association (a nonprofit that advocates for public health policy), expressed concerns Tuesday that if federal public health budgets are slashed, Utah would feel the impacts — which she said would reverberate beyond public health issues and threaten the state’s economic well-being.
“Utah remains one of the most economically resilient states in the nation, and that strength is directly tied to the health of our population,” Butler said. “When we stop investing in public health — particularly preventive health — we stop investing in our economy.”
Dozens of ‘public health heroes’ laid off across Utah as Trump cuts COVID-19 funds short

Long-term consequences of cutting “prevention and intervention programs are well-documented,” the Utah Public Health Association said, pointing to “untreated chronic disease, higher healthcare costs, reduced workforce productivity, and avoidable human suffering.” 
“The aftershocks of the COVID-19 pandemic have already made these patterns painfully clear,” the association said. “Data show sharp increases in late-stage cancer diagnoses, delays in diabetes detection, and rising rates of unmanaged chronic disease due to disruptions in preventive care.” 
Butler said Utah health officials are “particularly concerned” about proposed cuts to rural health programs, maternal health services, early childhood education and other “foundational supports that all Utahns rely on — directly or indirectly.” 
“Neglecting these priorities will only shift costs downstream, where we’ll pay more in ER visits, lost workdays, and worse health outcomes overall,” she said. 
The Utah Public Health Association urged state leaders and Utah’s congressional delegation to “speak out against these devastating cuts.” It also urged them to “prioritize sustained investment in the programs that keep our communities healthy and our economy strong.”

Merv Riepe of Ralston and Kathleen Kauth of the Millard area meet on the floor of the Nebraska Legislature. April 22, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — State lawmakers advanced a proposal Tuesday seeking to define “male” and “female” in state law targeted for K-12 or collegiate bathrooms, sports teams and locker rooms.
Legislative Bill 89, the “Stand With Women Act” from State Sen. Kathleen Kauth of Omaha, advanced 33-16, with all 33 Republicans in the officially nonpartisan Legislature uniting around the measure. LB 89 was introduced on behalf of Gov. Jim Pillen as one of his 2025 priorities.
Kauth said her bill was a “testament” to the ongoing fight for women’s rights and equality, including in sports, and that it was “astounding that women are having to relitigate this discussion to hold on to these hard-fought rights.”
“Women’s rights to privacy, safety and opportunity should never be considered secondary to the rights of men,” Kauth said.
  State Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha. March 31, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
State Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha, a nonpartisan progressive, led the opposition to LB 89. She said supporters had a “whole crayon box of life” yet were choosing to use only “two colors” and were acting like “gender cops.”
“Trans kids existing in a restroom in a fourth grade classroom, it doesn’t hurt anyone,” Hunt said. “But forcing them out, singling them out, humiliating them, that does cause harm. We don’t get to legislate someone’s identity just because some people feel uneasy.”
State Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston filed an amendment seeking to only focus on sports. While it did not come up Tuesday, he and Kauth said they would work together on a path forward ahead of the second-round debate.
Riepe has repeatedly said that if the bill were limited to sports, it would have his support. Thirty-three votes are needed to shut off debate and invoke “cloture” after a set amount of time.
The bill advances to the second of up to three rounds of debate. It will face up to two hours of debate during the second debate.
What the bill would require
Under a proposed committee amendment, adopted 33-11, sex would be defined as whether someone “naturally has, had, will or would have, but for a congenital anomaly or intentional or unintentional disruption, the reproductive system that at some point produces, transports and utilizes” either eggs (female, woman or girl) or sperm (male, man or boy) for fertilization.

Public schools and postsecondary institutions would be required to pass policies complying with the law if they don’t already have such language. Bathrooms and locker rooms would need to be designated as “male” or “female” only, unless they are single occupancy. Family use bathrooms would have been an additional option.
Public school sports would be restricted to students’ sex assigned at birth, for males or females only, unless coed/mixed. There would be an exception if there is no female equivalent team (such as football). Private schools competing against public institutions would need to do the same.
A doctor would need to verify a student’s sex before they could participate in single-sex sports under the amended LB 89.
State agencies would also need to generally enforce any applicable rules, regulations or duties according to someone’s sex, which Pillen already required in a 2023 executive order that he said would continue until a bill passed detailing single-sex requirements for certain services, facilities or sports — such as LB 89.
‘Mind your own business’
State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha asked the reverse question to Kauth of young trans children and their families, many of whom he said he met with and feel as though their lives could be “upended.” He said some parents are thinking of leaving Nebraska “to keep their kids alive, to keep their kids in their life, to keep them happy.”

State Sen. Dunixi Guereca of Omaha said a sign on a bathroom door would not stop someone who wants to cause harm, and State Sen. Margo Juarez of Omaha questioned the possible economic consequences of the bill.
“To me, the simple solution is to mind your own business,” said Juarez, a former school board member for Omaha Public Schools. 
Juarez quipped that after the 2025 session, she hopes she doesn’t need 40 hours of therapy, referencing Kauth’s 2023 bill that put in a requirement of “gender-identity-focused” therapy for any minor seeking gender-related care.
Multiple opponents questioned how the bill could be enforced.
‘Level playing field’
Kauth asked what the “magic number” was for how many women or girls needed to feel scared or hurt before the Legislature should act.
“There is no number of women who should be discriminated against,” Kauth said.
State Sen. Rob Dover of Norfolk said that as his daughters were growing up they weren’t comfortable undressing in the locker room with other girls or one another. He said he didn’t know “how we can say that these other things are fine.”

State Sen. Loren Lippincott of Central City said LB 89 was not about “exclusion,” which many other supporters echoed.
“It’s about ensuring our daughters, sisters and friends have a level playing field to compete, succeed and shine,” he said.
State Sen. Tanya Storer of Whitman said nothing of her support for LB 89 was “rooted in hate or discrimination,” and she walked through major milestones in women’s rights, from the first women’s rights convention in 1848 and the right to vote in 1920 to the Equal Pay Act in 1963 and the passage of the Violence Against Women Act in 1994.
“I stand in support of LB 89 not because I hate anybody,” Storer said. “But I stand here in honor of the women that came before me.”
State Sen. Dave Murman of Glenvil, the Education Committee chair, said differences between male and female student-athletes were “settled,” pointing to Nebraska high school track and field records online. He said Title IX, prohibiting sex discrimination in schools that receive federal funding, required federal action. 
‘It’s not that easy’
Riepe and Tom Brandt of Plymouth, Republicans who declined to vote for a narrower proposal limited to K-12 sports and spaces in 2024, did so this time around.
Brandt had previously voiced concern that the 2024 version did not cover parents of young children or caregivers of people with disabilities who were not the same sex. LB 89 provides an additional exception to the bathroom requirements in these cases.
Riepe, throughout the 2025 session, has swung between “leaning” for or against the bill and in January had described himself as a “doubting Thomas” for the bill.
  State Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston. April 8, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
On Tuesday, Riepe said his amendment was a “personal compromise” that addressed his shared concern of “preserving” the integrity of interscholastic K-12 sports. However, he said he didn’t think that concern justified using state law to “micromanage” bathrooms or locker rooms and that expecting beer leagues beyond interscholastic was “unreasonable.”
He said the agency section in the bill “opens a can of worms” that lawmakers needed to further understand. Kauth has said the intention is, for example, prison housing assignments.
“‘Standing with women,’ it sounds strong, it sounds so American, but it’s not that easy, and it’s much more serious and much more complicated,” Riepe said. 
Riepe added that an “attorney friend” of his last week told him: “When it comes to equal rights, your equity ends where my freedom begins.”
If the bill is not narrowed during the second-round debate, Riepe said he is “prepared” to oppose LB 89. That would likely require Kauth to substitute a placeholder amendment she has with Riepe’s language. If progressives block that process, he said he would vote for the bill without his amendment.
‘Strike a balance’
The federal landscape was also very different this time around compared to 2024, with President Donald Trump and his officials threatening to pull federal funding if schools allowed transgender students to participate in sports according to their gender identity, not sex.

In response, both the Nebraska School Activities Association and the National Collegiate Athletic Association decided to restrict sports participation to student-athletes’ sex assigned at birth.
The Nebraska association, for example, had a nearly decade-old rigorous Gender Participation Policy that would allow transgender students to apply if they could, in effect, prove their gender identity. Trans girls also had to demonstrate that they had no “physiological advantage” and had started hormone treatments or completed sex-reassignment surgery.
Fewer than 10 students had applied for participation under the NSAA policy before its “indefinite” end earlier this year, after Trump’s order. Supporters said just one student was “one too many” if it jeopardized other students’ opportunities or privacy.
Riepe was among senators who favored the NSAA route, and multiple state senators had proposed putting the requirements into law, including State Sen. Jane Raybould of Lincoln.
Kauth has repeatedly said that executive orders can be overturned and that the NSAA guidelines were not adequate.
“LB 89 aims to strike a balance between fairness, safety and equality,” Kauth said. “It’s a thoughtful and necessary measure that reaffirms the rights of women and girls in Nebraska to opportunity, privacy and safety.”

Republican Rep. Mark White of East Memphis, chairman of the House Finance Committee, said House and Senate versions approved earlier in the day were too far apart for passage.
The Tennessee Legislature adjourned for the year Tuesday evening without taking further action on the bills.
One of the key sticking points was that the Senate bill was amended to enable an advisory board to select replacements for elected Memphis board members removed by the state, a provision considered unconstitutional. It differed from the House version.
White said he wants a “strong oversight board” and that a compromise would weaken the measure. He declined to have competing House and Senate measures sent to a conference committee to work out a compromise.
Tennessee lawmakers file Memphis Shelby Schools “hostile takeover” at last minute

“We prefer we keep the bill alive,” White said, adding he would work on the legislation through the summer and bring it back next year for consideration.
The House and Senate passed separate bills Tuesday creating a management group to oversee Memphis Shelby County Schools despite complaints that setting up a “takeover” board could prove to be unconstitutional.
White’s decision came as the legislature moved toward adjournment for the year.
Earlier, White told colleagues the change is needed after decades of poor performance by the school district and board, including a billion dollars in deferred maintenance and under-used buildings despite a $1.8 billion budget.
The advisory board, which would be funded locally instead of by the state, would supersede the elected board on budgets, contracts exceeding $50,000 and some policy. Under one plan, it would be responsible for reviewing the entire system and making an improvement plan.
Separately, the legislature approved $6 million for a forensic audit of the school district. But Republicans, who hold supermajorities in the House and Senate, refused requests to complete the audit before embarking on the new format.
Later, White said waiting a year would enable the audit to move forward before an advisory board is created.
Republican Sen. Brent Taylor of Shelby County, who carried the Senate version of the bill, laid most of the blame for poor performance on school board members, saying students are “hanging in there like a crackhead’s last tooth.”
White and Taylor denied the plan is a “takeover,” with Taylor instead describing it as “a list of cascading interventions” 



Republican Sen. Brent Taylor of Shelby County, who carried the Senate version of the bill, laid most of the blame for poor performance on school board members, saying students are “hanging in there like a crackhead’s last tooth.” 


Votes in both chambers didn’t come without opposition from Memphis lawmakers who said the state should allow voters to select new school board members, instead of giving the state’s education commissioner authority to remove board members and the district director. 
Democratic Sen. London Lamar of Memphis was among numerous Shelby County lawmakers who spoke out against the measure. In response to Taylor, she said, “Memphis is not the last tooth in a crack addict’s mouth.”
Lamar and other Shelby lawmakers compared the plan to the state’s Achievement School District, which is being phased out after a decade and more than a billion dollars spent. They also accused the state of usurping local voters.
“It’s not our job to take the power away from the local school board,” Lamar said.
Lamar later called the outcome a “victory for local control.”
Democratic Rep. Antonio Parkinson of Memphis, a consistent critic of the Achievement School District for five-plus years, said the bill’s provision allowing the state to turn schools over to charter operators shows that the plan is designed to benefit hedge funds and corporations.
Shelby County school systems have gone through several stages in the last decade, including dissolution of Memphis City Schools and creation of suburban districts such as Collierville and Arlington, all of which left Memphis Shelby County Schools with a large concentration of low-income students.

The Memphis Shelby County School Board also removed its director recently, creating more conflict within the district and giving lawmakers ammunition to single out the school system, even though the bills applied to schools statewide.
Republican Rep. Kevin Vaughan of Collierville in Shelby County told colleagues he had shifted views after initially thinking lawmakers should wait until the audit is complete before taking action.
“We’ve got to turn the ship around in southwest Tennessee,” Vaughan said. “We’re doing a disservice to children who are not getting a fair shake.”
The legislation also lifted income caps on the Education Savings Account program in Shelby to enable more families to qualify for funds to enroll children in private schools. Recipients can use about $9,500 in state funds to go toward tuition.
Democratic state Sen. Jeff Yarbro predicted such a move would cause confusion and lead to a lawsuit.

The UC has grown its enrollment of California undergraduates by 16,000 in the last five years. University officials say they won’t be able to continue that growth if state funding is cut.


The University of California will enroll fewer new California students if planned state cuts are implemented, college officials told state lawmakers during a hearing today on the system’s finances.  
“University of California cannot afford to continue increasing enrollment with less funding, it just can’t,” said UC’s top academic officer, Katherine Newman, at an Assembly budget subcommittee hearing. “If the state cuts the university by 8%, we will be forced to decrease enrollment for the fall of 2026 admission cycle.” 
The comments are the strongest indication yet that the proposed budget cuts for UC and the California State University that lawmakers and Gov. Gavin Newsom agreed to last year may limit the ability of new students to enter California’s public universities. The fiscal belt-tightening  is a response to forecasted multi-billion-dollar deficits in California. For UC, the proposed state cuts add to the climate of fiscal uncertainty: The Trump administration has sought to lower the system’s federal research funding by hundreds of millions of dollars annually.

UC faces half-billion-dollar budget shortfall and increases tuition for new nonresident students 

by Mikhail Zinshteyn 





The UC has grown its enrollment of California undergraduates by 16,000 in the last five years, fueled by a swell of state cash as lawmakers grapple with voters’ demands to open more seats at the state’s marquee public higher-education system. The Legislature has also in recent years been adding $30 million annually to UC’s state support so that it enrolls fewer out-of-state students and more in-state students at its three most popular campuses, UC Berkeley, UCLA and UC San Diego. That funding is at risk of being deferred in 2025-26.“So blowing up class sizes, reducing advising, limiting opportunities for our students: This is not a recipe for the continued success at the University of California, and we would not want to go in that direction,” Newman said. If the UC ends its enrollment growth, it won’t happen until next year. That’s because the UC has already admitted students for the coming fall term.While other state agencies were cut by nearly 8% cut in last year’s budget, UC and Cal State were given a year to plan for their share of the permanent cuts. Those would total roughly $770 million annually if lawmakers and Newsom agree to them this June as part of negotiations for the 2025-26 budget. UC’s share would be about $400 million.But an Assembly legislative analysis calculated that other state agencies are experiencing much lower cuts — around 2% or 3%. As a result, the proposed cuts to UC and Cal State would represent more than half of the $1.5 billion in state spending decreases planned for 2025-26 in Newsom’s January budget proposal. About 50 members of the Assembly signed letters opposing the proposed university cuts, the meeting agenda said. Legislative budget leaders also sounded the alarm on the cuts in February in a letter to Newsom’s Department of Finance. 
“However, given numerous General Fund pressures facing the state, it is unclear whether the Legislature will have the ability to restore the cuts,” the agenda for today’s hearing said.The chair of the Assembly’s budget subcommittee on education finance, David Alvarez, a Democrat from Chula Vista, asked UC senior officials how much the state could cut and still leave student academics largely unaffected, including graduation rates and other endeavors that “ensure that student access remains the same.”
For UC San Diego Chancellor Pradeep Khosla, the answer was about $30 million, much less than the roughly $73 million in state cuts the campus would absorb under the current plan.  Systemwide, the UC’s 10 campuses could tolerate an ongoing cut of $125 million, said Seija Virtanen, a UC government relations official.

(Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)Washingtonians’ medical debt will not be included in their credit reports, under a bill signed into law on Tuesday. 
Having medical debt can create a spiraling effect and prevent people from getting approved for car or home loans or apartment rentals. Medical debt can also cause providers to deny services to patients with outstanding bills or dissuade people from seeking care. 
Senate Bill 5480, sponsored by Sen. Marcus Riccelli, D-Spokane, intends to mirror efforts at the federal level that have been thrown into question. It will prohibit collection agencies from reporting overdue medical debt to credit agencies. The bill will take effect on July 27. 
In January, the Biden administration finalized a similar federal rule before President Donald Trump took office. It was set to take effect in March, but it is currently on pause by the Trump administration and faces legal challenges. 
The new state law is intended to help people like Christopher Raymond, who was diagnosed with stage 2 Hodgkin lymphoma at age 16. 
To get the treatment Raymond needed to survive, his dad was forced to retire and cash out his pension, which amounted to $60,000. 
Originally from Everett, Raymond’s family moved to California so he could receive the treatment he needed, which lasted two years and required a stem cell transplant, which was not covered by his dad’s insurance. The move made him eligible for Medi-Cal, California’s Medicaid program, which covered his treatments. 
Despite the coverage, he and his family faced extreme hardships and had trouble paying for necessities such as food and utilities. 
“There was a point where it got really bad that I was eating those quarter chicken legs you would get from the grocery store and it would be my only meal I could have for the day,” Raymond said. 
Raymond is now 28 and has been cancer-free for the past 10 years, but says his family could’ve been pushed into extreme debt for his treatments, which cost upward of $6 million before accounting for insurance payments. 
“I shouldn’t be punished for having cancer,” Raymond said. 
His experience is shared by many who have undergone similar health issues. 
When this happens, people might stop or delay treatments because they can’t afford them or because their insurance companies don’t approve the care. People, at times, also lose everything they own to continue their treatments, or they end up dying of cancer. 
Roughly six in 10 Washington adults say they could not pay an unexpected $500 medical bill, and about 30% say they live in a household with medical debt, even with health insurance, according to a report done by the Northwest Health Law Advocates. 
Audrey Miller García, government relations director at the American Cancer Society, explained that families can still have to pay debt they accrued from treatments if their child dies of cancer.
Even when someone survives cancer, they may still need treatment for the rest of their lives. These follow-up treatments are expensive, and depending on the insurance coverage a person has, the care can land them in thousands of dollars worth of debt. 
Raymond still gets billed.
“My lifelong care after cancer is always going to be met with more insurance bills,” he said. 
He says he’s been due for a CT scan for over six years, but is worried about going into debt because he cannot afford the scan even after his co-pay. 
“You shouldn’t be punished for having cancer, you should get through it and be able to not worry about having to live, because it’s not enough to just survive, you need to live too,” Raymond said.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_1724-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-22 20:05:36.969953

(Courtesy of Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council)A 600-foot-long rock wall built without permission along the shoreline of Quidnessett Country Club became the signature criticism of the Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council last year.
But as environmental advocates hammered the coastal agency for contemplating the country club’s retroactive request for forgiveness — which the council eventually denied — a Warwick property owner’s own illegal seawall escaped similar public outrage.
A hearing Tuesday before the CRMC thrust the spotlight onto Sali Siharaj, who built a shoreline retaining wall along his property overlooking Greenwich Bay two years ago, without permission from coastal regulators. Despite multiple written warnings, two separate threats of fines totaling $18,000, and multiple meetings with CRMC staff, the illegal stone wall still stands.

Which is how what has been an administrative enforcement case till now has risen to the attention by the 10-member, politically appointed council. 
The council voted Tuesday to require Siharaj, and his real estate company, ODI Realty LLC, to bring his property in compliance with state coastal regulations. The enforcement order offers a 45-day window for Siharaj to submit a restoration plan that would tear down the existing stone wall and restore vegetation, or else face financial penalties.  
The council’s unanimous vote doesn’t actually preclude Siharaj from having any kind of protection against shoreline erosion on his property. After removing the existing, illegal wall, Siharaj can opt to proceed with what coastal regulators have determined is an appropriate protection against shoreline erosion: a “hybrid” wall with stone on the bottom and vegetation on top.
Unlike the Quidnessett property, which borders the most environmentally sensitive type of state waters where any permanent structures on the shoreline are prohibited, regulations governing the shoreline abutting Siharaj’s property near Buttonwoods Beach are not so stringent. Some development is allowed, but it must first be reviewed and approved to meet with state coastal requirements.
CRMC staff originally suggested the hybrid alternative when Siharaj first applied in 2022 for a permit for shoreline work at his Budlong Farm Road property. But before Brian Harrington, CRMC senior environmental scientist, finished reviewing the application, Siharaj hired contractors to begin clearing vegetation, landscaping, excavating, and building a stone wall.
Enforcing state coastal regulations more broadly has been a pain point for the state coastal agency, highlighted in an April 10 report by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). NOAA’s report blamed agency staffing shortages for the “varied” enforcement success over a five-year review period. It recommended additional hires — an agency request which has gone unanswered in recent state budget years — as well as developing an online permitting system to streamline and track enforcement.
“It takes the agency a long time to work these cases through the process,” Jed Thorp, advocacy director for Save the Bay, said in an interview prior to the hearing Tuesday. “I think more than anything, it speaks to lack of enforcement capacity at the CRMC.”
According to letters to the CRMC from his attorney, Siharaj was unaware he needed CRMC approval before work could begin, and was out of the country when construction was happening. 
Thorp was skeptical of the plea of ignorance.
“Even if coastal property owners don’t know coastal rules, most contractors doing the work are pretty well aware,” Thorp said. 
Council member Kevin Flynn questioned why CRMC staff had not taken enforcement measures against the contractor, who continued to excavate and build the stone wall on Siharaj’s property, along with a separate, also illegal wall on his neighbor’s section of shoreline, despite being told to stop.
“A contractor who willingly ignores cease and desist orders is part of the problem to me,” Flynn said during the meeting.
Anthony DeSisto, the outside counsel for the CRMC, responded that the property owner, not the contractor, is responsible for violations of state coastal regulations.

Missed deadlines
Siharaj was allegedly brought up-to-speed on the infraction by November 2023, when his former attorney, Paul DeMarco, met with Harrington to work out a resolution, Harrington told the council during a Feb. 11 hearing on the case. They agreed to have Siharaj and his contractors submit a new restoration plan for the shoreline to coastal regulators by April 2024, with work to be completed the following month. Extended deadlines went unanswered. Siharaj’s engineer finally submitted a plan on Feb. 7, 2025, days before a Feb. 11 hearing on the case before the full council.
The council agreed to postpone any enforcement action by 60 days to give agency staff time to review the recently submitted engineering documents.
The plan by Warwick-based Joe Casali Engineering Inc. did not meet the agreed-upon terms of restoring the shoreline and revising the rock wall to a hybrid stone-vegetation mix. Instead, the engineering proposal sought an after-the-fact approval for the stone wall as-is, according to an April 22 written addendum from Harrington.
Subsequent requests by coastal regulators to submit an appropriate restoration plan went unanswered, according to Harrington’s report.

“The staff gives applicants the benefit of the doubt,” Thorp said. “Oftentimes, they try to be accommodating, to work with applicants and their attorneys as best they can to resolve things without having to go to enforcement. Unfortunately, that sometimes results in more back and forth, in hindsight, than should have been allowed.”
Mary Shekarchi, a Warwick attorney and sister of House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi, is now representing Siharaj. She told the council at its hearing Tuesday that she was unable to reach Siharaj for weeks despite multiple attempts and forms of communication. She finally made contact with his son last week, and learned Siharaj was out of the country. Another, unnamed representative from ODI Realty signaled willingness to comply with state coastal regulations and instead build an environmentally appropriate hybrid retaining wall, Shekarchi said.
 Joe Casali, principal of the engineering firm with his name, will be submitting a plan for the alternative shortly, Casali told the council Tuesday.
The “deconstruction” proposal is being coordinated with the engineer for Siharaj’s neighbors, who must similarly restore the shoreline and take down their own illegal stone wall. Because the two barriers are connected, built by the same contractor, it makes sense to coordinate restoration efforts, Shekarchi said. 
Siharaj did not attend the meeting, and could not be reached for comment. City tax records show he bought the three-bedroom, two-and-a-half bath house for $365,000 in November 2010, transferring it to his real estate company, ODI Realty LLC, for $0 in December of the same year. The property was valued at $744,700 as of 2024.
Three miles south at Quidnessett, the rock wall remains, despite the council’s January denial of its attempt to reclassify the waters — a workaround which could have allowed for a permanent barrier. Coastal regulators are still reviewing the required restoration plan to return the shoreline to its original state.
Thorp remained adamant that the best solution to inadequate and protracted enforcement action was to overhaul the agency completely, getting rid of the politically appointed council and empowering the staff with final decision-making power.
“The council would have been justified in starting enforcement action tonight,” Thorp said in an interview after the meeting. “They already gave an extension back in February. The more enforcement actions like this get delayed and delayed, it takes away some of the deterrent effect of enforcement.”
Various pieces of legislation to this effect have been introduced in both chambers of the Rhode Island State House, but remain under review by committee.
Council member Patricia Reynolds did not attend the meeting Tuesday.

,DC,2025-04-22 23:40:53+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,FDA seeks to phase out 8 common food dyes,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/fda-seeks-phase-out-8-common-food-dyes,,"WASHINGTON — Trump administration health officials announced Tuesday they hope to eliminate eight petroleum-based synthetic dyes from the nation’s food supply before the end of next year, though they haven’t received guarantees or written agreement from food companies.Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary detailed efforts to phase out the dyes during a press conference alongside Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. at the department’s Washington, D.C., headquarters.“Let's be honest, taking petroleum-based food dyes out of the food supply is not a silver bullet that will instantly make America's children healthy, but it is one important step,” Makary said.The FDA’s proposal would revoke authorization for Citrus Red No. 2 and Orange B while setting up the agency to work ""with industry to eliminate"" Green No. 3, Red No. 40, Yellow No. 5, Yellow No. 6, Blue No. 1 and Blue No. 2.FDA will also authorize new, natural food dyes in the months ahead.Kennedy said the Trump administration has an “understanding,” but not an “agreement” with food companies that use the dyes, before deferring to Makary, who said that “you win more bees with honey than fire.”“There are a number of tools at our disposal. And so I believe in love, and let's start in a friendly way and see if we can do this without any statutory or regulatory changes,” Makary said. “But we are exploring every tool in the toolbox to make sure this gets done very quickly. And they want to do it. They want to do it.“So why go down a complicated road with Congress when they want to do this? They don't want to deal with the patchwork of 30 different state plans.”Christopher Gindlesperger, senior vice president of public affairs and communications at the National Confectioners Association, released a written statement that didn’t appear to agree entirely with the FDA’s proposed phase-out, however. “FDA and regulatory bodies around the world have deemed our products and ingredients safe, and we look forward to working with the Trump Administration and Congress on this issue,” Gindlesperger wrote. “We are in firm agreement that science-based evaluation of food additives will help eliminate consumer confusion and rebuild trust in our national food safety system.”Removing additivesDuring the press conference, Makary held up watermelon, beet and carrot juices in clear containers, encouraging food companies to use those as dye, instead of the ones that may be removed from the market.“We are simply asking American food companies to replace petroleum-based food dyes with natural ingredients for American children, just as they already do for children in other countries,” he said. “American children deserve good health.”Makary said he believes there are several health conditions associated with petroleum-based synthetic dyes in food, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, obesity, diabetes, insulin resistance, cancer, genomic disruption, gastrointestinal issues, and allergic reactions.Kennedy said his goal as HHS secretary is to remove all additives in food served in schools “that we can legally address.”The department, Kenedy said, will also work with Congress and President Donald Trump to increase labeling for food ingredients that Kennedy called addictive, including sugar.“There's things that we'll never be able to eliminate, like sugar. And sugar is poison and Americans need to know that,” Kennedy said. ""It is poisoning us. Is giving us a diabetes crisis.”Health effects unclearMartin Bucknavage, senior food safety extension associate at Penn State University, said during an interview with States Newsroom that petroleum-based synthetic food dyes are derived just to get the color.“It's not like it's just a nasty chemical that they're putting in there,” he said. “It's something that's been taken, it's been chemically made, modified and then purified, so that it is just that chemical that provides that color. And then those colors have been studied.”Similar to the complicated nature of nutrition studies — which can have a challenging time separating out a person’s genetics, exercise and environmental factors from one specific part of their diet — research on food dyes hasn’t been conclusive, Bucknavage said.“In some cases, it does have an impact on hypersensitivity, but not in all cases,” he said. “And not all studies are basically showing the same thing. So there's a lot of variability that exists out there.""And I'm not saying, 'Listen, we shouldn't go through and study these things more and get better information on them.' We certainly should. But again, it's not an easy thing to do. Some of these studies take time and take a lot of money and sometimes the results are kind ... more variable in terms of the results.”States regulating dyesThe FDA’s announcement wasn’t the first time the federal government or state lawmakers have sought to ban food additives or synthetic dyes.The Biden administration announced in January that the federal government would ban Red No. 3 in food beginning in 2027 and from medicines in 2028. Makary said during the press conference Tuesday the current administration plans to ask companies to phase out that dye sooner.California lawmakers approved a bill in 2023 that will ban Red No. 3, propylparaben, brominated vegetable oil and potassium bromate from food starting in 2027.The following year, legislators in the Golden State approved another measure that, starting in 2028, will ban six food dyes — Blue 1, Blue 2, Green 3, Red 40, Yellow 5 and Yellow 6 — from being sold in schools.Those two state laws followed the California Environmental Protection Agency’s Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment releasing a report in 2021 that concluded “scientific literature indicates that synthetic food dyes can impact neurobehavior in some children.”Virginia lawmakers approved legislation earlier this year that Gov. Glenn Youngkin signed in March to ban some artificial food dyes in public schools, starting in July 2027.In deeply red West Virginia, Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey signed a bill a few days later that will prevent seven artificial dyes from being sold in grocery stores starting in 2028 or included in school lunches starting in August.Arizona and Utah have implemented laws of their own addressing food dyes.The Environmental Working Group, an advocacy organization focused on strengthening health standards, reports that legislators in several states, including Arkansas, Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Washington have introduced bills that could ban certain food dyes or chemicals.Melanie Benesh, EWG vice president for government affairs, wrote in a statement about the FDA announcement that the federal agency “has known for decades that synthetic food dyes are linked to health problems, particularly in children, but has failed to act.”“We’re pleased the administration is following the lead of states like California and West Virginia by finally announcing their intent to ban dyes,” Benesh wrote. “We’re grateful that states like California and West Virginia have forced the FDA to make food safety a bigger priority.”Peter Lurie, president and executive director of the self-described food and health watchdog group Center for Science in the Public Interest, wrote in a statement released Monday that Americans ""don’t need synthetic dyes in the food supply, and no one will be harmed by their absence.""“The most important thing to know about food dyes is that their only purpose is to make food companies money,” Lurie wrote. “They are purely cosmetic, serving no nutritional function. In other words, food dyes help make ultra-processed foods more attractive, especially to children, often by masking the absence of a colorful ingredient, like fruit.”Ashley Murray contributed to this report.",,,,2025-04-22 20:05:36.969953

A national investment firm has pledged to open a $2.8 billion computing center in South Carolina’s Upstate.
NorthMark Strategies inked a deal with Spartanburg County to bring its supercomputing operations to a former Kohler manufacturing plant and warehouse.
“Of the more than 100 locations across the country we considered, Spartanburg stood out for its strong community, skilled workforce, dynamic economy and strategic advantages,” NorthMark Strategies President Jen Byrne said in a statement. “Our investment in this high-performance computing center solidifies our commitment to building for future growth and being prepared to meet the growing demand for (high performance computing) capabilities.”
The company plans to transform the facility into “one of the most advanced (high performance computing) facilities in the world, leveraging cutting-edge technology to support complex computational tasks in machine learning, data analytics, and complex systems modeling.”
A $2.8B computing center proposed in the Upstate would generate its own electricity

The project, previously referred to publicly as “Project Moc-1” while the deal was negotiated, comes as South Carolina grapples with how to meet the energy needs of a growing population, manufacturing base and an influx of power heavy data centers.
These data centers, housing rows of servers, are focused on the storage of vast amount of data. High performance computing, on the other hand, is about analyzing large amounts of data, which would cause a typical computer to freeze up, at high speeds.
It can do this multiple ways, either with the use of a custom-built supercomputer or a cluster of individual computers all working together, to give the user more computing power than a standard, single computer. North Carolina State University, for example, offers one such cluster.
NorthMark’s clients turn to the company with their complex engineering problems. NorthMark’s computing centers power the company’s various simulation and artificial intelligence tools that its clients can use to design and troubleshoot whatever they need.
“We don’t just fund ideas — we help test, refine, and improve them,” according to NorthMark’s website.
“With NorthMark Strategies establishing operations in Spartanburg County, South Carolina continues to add to its already impressive technology industry. We celebrate this remarkable investment in the Upstate and all it will mean for our state and our people,” Secretary of Commerce Harry Lightsey said in a statement.
NorthMark’s center will be different from massive centers under construction by Google and Facebook parent company Meta in a second way.
Those centers each require hundreds of megawatts to operate.
But NorthMark will connect to a nearby natural gas pipeline and use the fuel to make its own power, County Councilman David Britt previously told the SC Daily Gazette. The center is not expected to use more energy than the site’s former tenant, Kohler, which closed in 2024 after 66 years.
While the reported investment figure is immense — the second largest single investment in state history — the company will employ just 27 full-time workers. NorthMark has not disclosed what these jobs will be or the potential salary for these positions.

To lure in the company, Spartanburg County offered a reduced property tax rate of 4% for 40 years.
By state law, manufacturers without such an arrangement pay a 6% rate. (Industrial property owners previously paid a 10.5% rate, but state laws passed in 2017 and 2022 effectively lowered it to 6%.)
The county also is offering special credits allowing the company to further buy down its tax bill — a $1.5 million annual credit for the first 20 years and $2 million for the 20 years after that.
NorthMark is not seeking any tax incentives or grants from the state, according to a company spokeswoman.

They were hunting for garlic mustard, a fast-growing invasive species, as part of an Earth Day trash bash organized by Iowa Natural Heritage Foundation.
Erica Place, communications and outreach manager for the foundation, said instead of human-generated trash, the group was hunting for “garbage plants.” 
The invasive species has been reported in almost all states and across Canada, but was originally introduced to North America as an herbal antiseptic and erosion controlling plant, according to The Nature Conservancy. 
Garlic mustard, sometimes called poor man’s mustard or hedge garlic, emerges early in the spring, which allows it to outcompete other plant species. 
This leads to a loss of plant biodiversity and the destruction of forest ecosystems, not only from the plant’s above-ground growth, but also from a toxin in its roots that can inhibit soil fungi.

Areas with garlic mustard invasion had not been identified at Brenton Slough, a more than 1,100-acre property purchased by INHF in partnership with Polk County Conservation, which meant volunteers were also on a scavenger hunt for the plants. 
“You would be hard-pressed to enter any Iowa woodlands and not find garlic mustard,” Place said to volunteers before they hiked further into the slough to begin their hunt.
Garlic mustard has round, somewhat crinkly leaves with lots of veins and, per its name, a pungent garlic aroma. In the first year of its life cycle, the plants are small “rosettes” on the ground, but in the second year, they send up a tall stalk with white flowers and prolific seeds. 
The plant looks similar to common blue violets and stinging nettle, which volunteers found plenty of on their first pass through a forested area. 
 
It’s edible
Many foragers will pull garlic mustard and use it to make things like pesto, pastas, or stir fries.


“This is one of those things where you want to find some to feel accomplished, but it’s a good thing not to find any,” Place said and led the group to a different area of the slough to keep looking. 
Most of the volunteers chose to participate because their workplaces incentivized volunteer hours, and they decided to cash in on an opportunity that brought them outdoors on a pleasant Tuesday afternoon.
Kate Davies, a volunteer from Des Moines, has participated in several “trash bash” events put on by the City of Des Moines, and said she enjoys being involved in conservation work. As a mother to two children, she said she wants to make sure the nature she enjoys will “still be around” when her children are older. 
Joe Jayjack, the external affairs director for INHF, said volunteer events like this accomplish two main goals. Practically, it takes a big group of people to do the work of pulling and identifying invasive plants like garlic mustard or honeysuckle. He said the events also bring people out to the natural spaces around them.

“And it helps people care,” Jayjack said. “I think the more that people learn about these things, the more they’re likely to care about protecting special spaces like this.” 
Most of the volunteers were at Brenton Slough for the first time. Iowa Natural Heritage Foundation is finishing raising a total of $8 million in order to transfer the land over to Polk County Conservation. INHF bought the property from the Brenton family with the intention of holding it until it could raise enough money to transfer the property to the county conservation group, who will maintain and open the reserve to the public. 
“It’s a really really interesting place,” Jayjack said. “The slough is kind of a wetland ecosystem. It backwaters off of Beaver Creek and it’s just amazing for water quality … and for wildlife habitat.” 
Jayjack said the plan is to keep the area pretty wild, with minimal infrastructure of a parking lot and some mown trails. 
Walking around the slough, volunteers found garlic mustard beginning to carpet the forest floor. They pulled what was possible, making sure to bring up the roots as well to fully kill the plant, and Place noted the areas with garlic mustard infestation. 
“That’ll be really helpful for Polk County Conservation to concentrate their efforts when they take control of the property,” Place said to volunteers.

More clean up events
Iowa Natural Heritage Foundation has volunteer events throughout the year, but several upcoming events will remove garlic mustard and other “garbage plants” from wildlife areas near Pella and Waukon. 
Central Iowans can also participate in trash bash events, organized by the City of Des Moines, through the end of the week in areas around the metro. 
The Iowa Department of Natural Resources encourages Iowans to celebrate Arbor Day on Friday by planting trees or learning about the tree species around them. 
DNR has a registry of some of the biggest trees in the state and resources on identifying the most common trees in Iowa. 
Additionally, the department has residential tree distribution events in Greenfield, Iowa Falls and DeWitt, where Iowans can purchase landscape-sized trees at an extreme discount.

(Photo by Darren Cooper/Getty Images)The legislative-mandated search for efficiency in Utah universities is already changing how campuses are conducting work and the faces in their staff and faculty rosters. 
The budget cuts have also led one institution to part ways with programs that have lately been controversial in academia, including ethnic studies, women and gender studies, and queer studies.
Gearing up for a May deadline to present “strategic reinvestment” plans, Weber State University shared in a town hall on Monday with faculty and staff a preliminary path to cut the necessary $6.6 million to comply with HB265, a recent law requiring Utah universities to cut 10% of their instructional budget to later invest in other high-demand areas.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The Weber State plans are still unofficial, but are contemplating terminating 11 administrative positions, 10 staff roles, and 28 faculty in addition to closing its West Center, which offered testing services, tutoring and computer labs. 
The plans also entail eliminating 89 courses to save about $285,000.
With tight deadline, Utah universities scramble to cut 10% of budget for courses

Early on, when HB265 was just a proposal, Weber State University president Brad Mortensen formed a committee to develop quantitative and qualitative criteria to assess programs, Bryan Magaña, a spokesperson for the institution, said on Tuesday. 
“Data sets looked at a variety of factors: number of majors, number of graduates, retention outcomes, faculty-to-student ratio, median income of graduates in each field, projected job growth in each field, and much more,” Magaña wrote in an email. 
Majors to be eliminated include different language programs, like French, German, and a professional and technical emphasis of the school’s bachelor in English. Also some science programs will be cut, according to the plans, including applied environmental geosciences, applied physics and mathematics. 
There are also seven certificates that may be discontinued, including biotechnician, ethics, facilities management, jazz studies and music entrepreneurship. 
Meanwhile, eight minors are set to be eliminated — ethnic studies, French for the professions, German for the professions, linguistics, public administration, queer studies, Spanish for the professions, and women and gender studies. 
The ultimate decision is up to the university president, Magaña said. “However, he sought insight and worked closely with the deans of each college, who looked at their own efficiencies and assessed programs based on the detailed models provided by the HB 265 Committee.”
Some other majors and departments are to be consolidated — the school is planning on having six economics majors instead of four, combining the elementary education and special education programs.
Utah is planning on cutting inefficient college programs — some Republicans are not fully on board

Weber State is also creating three secondary teaching majors to consolidate what were previously 31 separate programs — the new secondary science education major would encompass physics, chemistry, physical science, biology composite and Earth science teaching programs; a new social science composite education major would consolidate political science, sociology, geography, psychology and history teaching; and the new world languages education major would include French, German and Spanish teaching. 
According to the presentation, the funds cut in this effort may later be used to partner with technical colleges, collaborate in academic programs “that respond to workforce and societal needs,” develop new credential programs, and create additional systems to increase online course offerings. Also, to hire new faculty for “high-yield” programs and other student success initiatives.
14 programs at USU may face the same fate
Utah State University has to make a reallocation plan for $12.6 million of its budget for courses, a task the institution has been aggressively pursuing. 
The university declined to speak about the cuts until the plans are final. However, on a strategic reinvestment website, the institution made a list of the first 14 programs that may be affected in the reallocation process.



Let us know what you think...


 


Most of the programs on the list are part of the university’s EEJ College of Education and Human Services, including programs on ASL interpretation or teaching programs, as well as community and public health, family life studies, rehabilitation transition, and psychology data science and research methodology. 
Other programs include environmental engineering, theater, national environmental policy act and agriculture communication. 
“Decisions to discontinue educational activities have been based on an iterative, data-informed process with specific focus on the criteria in HB 265, contextual information offered through the deans and USU community feedback, and USU’s anticipated strategic direction for reinvestment,” the website reads.

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)Summit Carbon Solutions’ pipeline route as proposed in its permit application is “not viable,” South Dakota regulators determined Tuesday in Pierre. The Public Utilities Commission voted 2-1 to deny the company’s application, but Summit immediately pledged to reapply with a “reduced scope.”
It was the second South Dakota denial for Summit, which has been seeking a permit to build a portion of its proposed $9 billion pipeline through South Dakota since 2022. The commission denied the company’s first application in 2023, after which the company modified its route and reapplied.

Pipeline news in Iowa
Why hasn’t a pipeline bill come to Senate floor? Lawmakers blame opposing parties

The pipeline would carry carbon dioxide emissions captured from ethanol plants in five states to an underground storage site in North Dakota, where a Summit official has acknowledged some carbon could also be used to extract oil from old wells. The project seeks to capitalize on a broader federal push to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and could qualify for federal tax credits tied to carbon sequestration.
Its path forward was complicated by the South Dakota Legislature’s passage of a carbon pipeline eminent domain ban, which was signed into law by Gov. Larry Rhoden in March. Eminent domain is a legal process that allows qualifying entities to acquire access to private land for projects in the public interest, with compensation for landowners determined by a court.
Summit had relied on that authority to survey land and secure access from property owners unwilling to sign voluntary easements.
A spokeswoman with the company vowed Tuesday in a prepared statement to refile an application for the project that “reflects a reduced scope and continued engagement with landowners and plant partners.”
The move further delays the pipeline in Iowa, where regulators have granted a permit to Summit Carbon Solutions but stipulated that the company needs permits in the Dakotas before construction can begin.
Opposing landowners celebrate
Too many landowners at key points along the proposed route vowed to never sign an easement agreement for the project, rendering the application incomplete and ill-prepared for the permitting process to continue, said Commissioner Kristie Fiegen during the meeting.
“Summit’s route is uncertain at this point,” Fiegen said. “We really don’t know the route. We don’t know the timeframes. We don’t know their plan.”
PUC staff said the permit could be denied because “substantive changes” will be needed to the application if the company can’t move forward with the route it has on file. Denying the application would then be “the cleanest path forward,” according to the staff’s filed recommendation.
Attorney Brian Jorde, representing landowners opposed to the project, said the application is impossible because “there’s nothing they can do to change these folks’ minds.” Seventy-nine South Dakota landowners declared they would never sign an easement, according to one of the commissioners.

“Is there another route?” Jorde said. “Yes, but not in this application.”
Property owners opposed to the pipeline applauded the commission’s decision. Ed Fischbach, a vocal critic of the project, said in a news release that the decision acknowledges “the company has run out of road to build” and frees landowners “to get on with their lives and businesses.”
But Canton Republican Rep. Karla Lems, who carried the successful eminent domain ban during the legislative session, said she has “a hard time believing” the project is over, especially if federal tax credits remain available.
The decision affirms that South Dakota is “open for business, but not for sale,” she said.
“If you have a great project and want to get it done in South Dakota, you should come in and do it the South Dakota way and people should be able to say yes or no to your project,” Lems said.
Summit officials ‘remain committed’ to state
The Public Utilities Commission instructed Summit earlier this month to present a plan to illustrate how the company can move forward – or not – under the new state law barring its use of eminent domain. At its previous meeting, the commission denied Summit’s request for a pause in permit proceedings.
Summit has permits in North Dakota, Minnesota and Iowa, but some of the permits are being challenged in court. Nebraska does not have a permitting process for the project. A bill to ban eminent domain for carbon dioxide pipelines is being considered in the Iowa Statehouse.
Summit attorney Brett Koenecke opposed South Dakota regulators’ decision Tuesday, calling it “a prejudice” to the company pushed by opponents.
“You should ask yourselves why they’re fighting so hard to have this application denied and sent back,” Koenecke told commissioners. “I’d submit to you that the answer is likely they know it’s harder to restart.”
Commissioner Chris Nelson dissented from his colleagues Fiegen and Gary Hanson, arguing that Summit’s declaration that “they’re not going to challenge” the eminent domain ban, in addition to minor changes to the pipeline’s planned route, are enough for the project to move forward.
Summit filed paperwork with the commission this month stating that it would rather work with its current application and route than seek court orders or refer the ban to the voters, adding that “threatening legal action is counter-productive to attempting to do business in good faith in the state.”
In a prepared statement, the Summit spokeswoman said company officials are “disappointed” in the commission’s decision but “remain committed” to South Dakota and the project.
“Without it the ethanol industry, farmers and land values in the state will all suffer,” she said.

House Bill 75, from Rep. Jeremy Bynum, R-Ketchikan, is the first piece of legislation from a freshman lawmaker to pass either the House or Senate this year.
If approved by the Senate and signed by Gov. Mike Dunleavy, it would create new exceptions to the requirement that Alaskans be within the state in order to receive the dividend.
HB 75 would keep college students’ spring breaks and fall breaks from counting against their allowable absences from the state, and members of the “uniformed services,” rather than just the U.S. military, would receive exceptions as well.
That changed definition would allow members of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Corps, which operates the federal government’s fleet of mapping ships and conducts other scientific missions, to continue receiving dividends even if deployed away from the state.
HB 75 also allows the Permanent Fund Dividend Division to fingerprint its employees for federal criminal background checks and allows the general public to opt out of paper mailers for notices.
The House passed the bill 35-5, with five members of the Republican House minority opposed. None explained their reason during an eight-minute-long bill debate. It advances to the Senate for consideration.

“Earlier this year, we had a farm loans webinar. That same webinar last year had 17 attendees. This year it had 107 and I think that is an indication of the financial stress and uncertainty out there,” Perdue said. “I think it also is an indication of how important FSA (Farm Service Agency) farm loans are for producers when times get tough.”

Rollins, who held a roundtable discussion with farm groups in Fargo on Tuesday, said she understands the concerns as USDA shrinks its workforce but she tried to offer some reassurances. 
She said USDA workers were told last week, “If you are FSA or frontline or with the farmers, you are not eligible to take early retirement.” 
Rollins, invited by Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., listened to the discussion from ag groups, state officials and North Dakota State University representatives at a gathering on the NDSU campus. She said it was her first visit to a land grant university.
Rollins announced during the event that USDA was releasing $340 million in disaster assistance for farmers and rural communities impacted by natural disasters. 
The aid includes $5 million for North Dakota rural electric co-ops affected by wildfires during drought conditions last fall. 
President Joe Biden had approved a major disaster declaration for North Dakota in December. 
Rollins also repeated an announcement from last week of a new sugar tariff. She said that through Sept. 30, products with more than 65% sugar content will face an additional tariff of 33%. 
“President Trump loves to deploy tariffs,” Rollins said.

Rollins planned to visit a processing plant for sugar beets, a key specialty crop in the Red River Valley. 
Tariffs, trade and how specialty crops might be treated in farm bill were among the topics covered. Specialty crops such as potatoes, dry beans and sunflowers are a big part of agriculture in North Dakota. 
Congress has not been able to reach an agreement on a new farm bill, last year extending the previous version. 
Gary Shields, executive director of the Northland Potato Growers Association, relayed a message from the National Potato Council about the possibility of specialty crops being left out of the next stopgap farm legislation.
“The big message is that specialty crop funding needs to be included,” Shields said. 
On trade, North Dakota Agriculture Secretary Doug Goehring said the last four years have been disappointing for ag trade and the United States should “reengage with the world.”
Rollins said she could not believe how “stunningly bad” the United States was treated on the world stage. 
Participants also emphasized the importance of decreasing regulation on farmers. 
Ryan Ellis, a farmer and president of the North Dakota Grain Growers, described the Environmental Protection Agency’s enforcement of the Endangered Species Act to be “terrifying.” 
Rollins was scheduled to get a closeup look at ag research at Grand Farm, a public-private collaboration west of Fargo near Casselton.

Jim Pillen-pushed proposal to merge two Nebraska state agencies into a unified department in charge of water resources has moved on to its final lawmaking stage.
On Tuesday, Nebraska lawmakers advanced Legislative Bill 317 on a voice vote. It calls for combining the Department of Natural Resources and the Department of Environment and Energy into the new Department of Water, Energy and Environment.
  State Sen. Tom Brandt of Plymouth.  (Zach Wendling/Nebraska News Service)
Introduced by State Sen. Tom Brandt of Plymouth, LB 317 would rename the current DEE director as the new DWEE director. The current DNR director would be renamed “Chief Water Officer” under the new department.
Pillen earlier this year named the merger as one of his legislative priorities, saying his changes would help the state be more proactive instead of reactive with water policy. 
Upon clearing the second round of debate, Pillen on Tuesday praised LB 317 as a “commonsense” piece of legislation that “reduces the scope of state government operations.”
 A ‘rebranding’ 

The bill was selected as a priority bill of the Legislature’s Natural Resources Committee, though it has not been smooth sailing. Some people testifying at a February committee hearing argued the merger could divide rather than increase attention on water. 
Tuesday, questions continued.
State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha said she was not inherently opposed but did not have enough information to determine if the idea was good or not. She said the merger was billed as a means to be more efficient but that she did not see efficiencies spelled out.
“So it’s a little difficult to say, ‘Oh yeah, this makes sense,’” Cavanaugh said.
State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln said it would be more accurate to call the bill a “rebranding.” She said the bill lacked a clear account of cost savings.
Pillen plan to merge two agencies hits rough waters at legislative hearing

Said State Sen. Wendy DeBoer of Omaha: “Why are we doing this if it doesn’t save money?”
State Sen. Jane Raybould of Lincoln, a supporter, said she was optimistic that cost savings would come as administrative roles are clarified.
An updated financial impact statement attached to the bill said that costs — including a new website, letterhead and placards — could be absorbed into the current budget (an earlier estimate projected a $200,000 cost).
Currently for fiscal year 2024-25, state and federal appropriations for the two departments total about $203 million, according to the impact statement. It said that over time, efficiencies of a merger are expected to result in a savings. 
 Amendments

The bill advanced with two amendments, LB 1124 by Conrad and FA 116 by State Sen. Tanya Storer of Whitman. Brandt described them as neutral or friendly. 
State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha used the debate to push lawmakers to reconsider the size of the proposed Perkins County Canal in western Nebraska through two amendments, to the cost savings of $61 million on the first and $150 million on the other.
Both amendments were defeated.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)A bill that would repeal state law governing the day labor industry in Florida was approved in a House committee on Tuesday and now will move to the full chamber for consideration.
The proposal (HB 6033), sponsored by North Florida Republican Rep. Shane Abbott, is necessary, he says, because Florida’s Labor Pool Act, passed in 1995, is duplicative of federal labor law.
A Senate staff analysis says the state law “provides for the health, safety and well-being of day laborers throughout the state and outlines uniform standards of conduct and practice for labor pools.”
Abbott has said that Florida day labor employees (including those working in construction, hospitality, janitorial, and agriculture) are protected because Florida has its own version of OSHA, the federal Occupational Safety Health Administration.
There is one problem with that, Rich Templin of the Florida AFL-CIO told the House Commerce Committee.
“There is no state OSHA,” he said, referencing to the situation in 2021 when Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis called upon the Legislature to set up a state-run agency to supersede the federal OSHA because of COVID-19 restrictions imposed by the Joe Biden administration.
The Legislature passed such a bill, and DeSantis signed it in November 2021, but as WTSP reported at the time, the whole process of creating a plan “could take anywhere from two to five years,” and the law does not appear to have ever been implemented.
“A vote for this bill is literally taking away rights and protections of over a million workers in the state of Florida, including people in your district,” Templin said Tuesday. “When these labor pools realize that they’re not governed by state law anymore, bad things are gong to happen. And those workers are going to wonder how did this happen, and they’re going to look to you.”
Violations
One of the groups registered to lobby in support of the legislation is Pacesetter Personnel Services,which was the subject of a federal class action alleging labor violations in Florida, including failing to provide water and bathrooms on the job, overcharging for transportation, and failure to pay for time spent waiting for assignments. A federal judge in the fall of 2023 dismissed the plaintiffs’ complaints but said they could refile later..
“They’ve been sued for denying workers access to water, bathrooms, and fair pay, and now they want use to legalize that abuse,” said Jackson Oberlink of the progressive group Florida For All. “If you vote yes on this bill, you are siding with them, and I don’t think that’s who you want to be.”
“These workers already face low wages, unsafe conditions, and a high risk of wage theft,” added Jonathan Webber of the Southern Poverty Law Center. “The Labor Pool Act fills key gaps where federal law is silent or inefficient.”
Miami-Dade County Democratic Rep. Kevin Chambliss said that he has encouraged young men he knows who need work to participate in day labor pools. “If you’re there at 5:00 in the morning, if you’re there all week, I promise you at some point you’re going to be able to go out for work and at some point hopefully you’ll be able to be picked up by a company.”
Whether the bill will pass into law this year is in question, however, after the Senate bill (SB 1672) was temporarily postponed in the Senate Fiscal Policy Committee on Tuesday. There are no longer any committee meetings scheduled before the 60-day session is slated to end on May 2.

(Getty Images)Louisiana lawmakers will take up legislation for the second year in a row that would limit the amount of money nursing home residents and their families receive from lawsuits over injuries, neglect and wrongful deaths.

Sens. Thomas Pressly and Alan Seabaugh, Republicans from Shreveport, sponsored Senate Bill 134, which would make it more difficult to sue nursing home management companies and obtain large monetary judgments for negligence and inadequate staffing. 

The legislation is a response to a flurry of lawsuits brought against Louisiana nursing homes, whose owners are prolific donors to legislators and other state elected officials, over the last two years. 
Just one California-based law firm, Garcia & Artigliere, has 66 lawsuits pending against nursing homes across the state. They would be curbed if the legislation becomes law, said Matthew Coman, the firm’s attorney in New Orleans who handles its local cases. 
In addition to sponsoring the bill, Seabaugh was hired as an attorney to defend a Bossier Parish nursing home operator against a Garcia & Artigliere lawsuit the legislation could restrict.  
“The fact is, unlike trial lawyers, I actually try to pass bills that cost me business,” Seabaugh said when asked to comment on his involvement in one of the lawsuits. 
“If the bill passes, people in the future don’t hire me,”  he said. “I’m perfectly happy to pass bills that cost me business.”

Advocates for senior citizens are opposed to the legislation, saying it will prevent improvements to Louisiana’s already poorly-rated nursing home industry. 
“What this means is, if your loved one is in a nursing home and is injured due to abuse or neglect, you and your family might be paying for their injuries instead of being able to properly seek legal restitution,” said Andrew Muhl, state advocacy director for AARP Louisiana. 
The Louisiana Nursing Home Association, a trade group that represents nursing home owners, did not respond to multiple calls and emails with questions for this report. 
Medical malpractice
Pressly, the co-author of the bill, said the state needs to rein in health care lawsuits that are circumventing the state’s existing medical malpractice restrictions. 

In Louisiana, most lawsuits brought against a health care provider for injury or death have an award cap of $500,000 outside of costs related to future medical care. Of the $500,000, only $100,000 has to come directly from the health care provider. The remaining $400,000 comes from a state fund set up to cover those expenses. 

Coman and his law firm get around this medical malpractice cap and have won multimillion dollar verdicts for their clients by suing nursing homes management companies alongiside the nursing homes themselves. 

Coman contends the management companies are not direct health care providers and therefore not covered by the medical malpractice cap. The Pressly and Seabaugh legislation would make it explicit in the law that management organizations are health care providers covered by malpractice limits. 
“I think it’s important that we shore up the medical malpractice act,” Pressly said. 
Bob Dean Protection Act
A similar bill was derailed in the legislature last year after it became known as the “Bob Dean Protection Act,” a reference to the disgraced nursing home owner who moved approximately 840 residents from his nursing homes to an ill-equipped, former pesticide warehouse for shelter during Hurricane Ida in 2021. 

Dean’s shelter in Tangipahoa Parish was without air conditioning and unsanitary. Residents were not provided with adequate food, toilets, bedding and showers, according to the Louisiana Department of Health, which performed an emergency evacuation from the warehouse. 
Some of the residents’ deaths and declines in health have been attributed to the site’s atrocious conditions. About half of the residents sent to the warehouse joined a class-action lawsuit to obtain financial damages from Dean. 

Coman, who worked on the lawsuit from Dean’s residents, maintains this year’s legislation, like last year’s version, would make such court actions impossible. Dean’s residents and their surviving family members, who are already upset about the sizes of their awards, would have seen far less compensation, he said. 
“It would eviscerate a cause of action and an ability to sue for a claim of damages across the board,” Coman said of the Pressly and Seabaugh bill. 

Pressly disagrees. The limits his legislation would place on nursing home lawsuits would not have applied in the Dean case because Dean’s behavior was so egregious, it is considered “intentional” and “criminal,”  he said. 
Bed sore lawsuits

Since last year’s legislation was scuttled, Coman’s clients have won two verdicts from Louisiana juries against nursing homes. 

One awarded $3.5 million to the surviving relatives of nursing home patients who died after living at Chateau St. James Rehab and Retirement in Lutcher. A separate $2.1 million award was given to Bonnie Bennett, whose father, Raymond Davidson, died after living at Heritage Manor West in Shreveport. 
Bennett’s lawsuit and the one that Seabaugh is defending against a nursing home are similar. 

Bennett alleged her father developed bed sores on lower back, buttocks and groin because his Shreveport nursing home did not have enough nurses on staff at the facility. Those conditions allegedly led to his death, according to her lawsuit. 

Seabaugh is one of a handful of lawyers defending the Old Brownlee Community Care Center in Bossier City against another lawsuit from Kimberly Remedies.  

Remedies’ father, Frank Hooper, was transferred to a hospital after a two-week stay at the nursing home. She alleges he developed bed sores and “severe sepsis”  during his time at the home, which contributed to his death a few months later, according to her lawsuit. The care center has denied the accusations. 
Seabaugh has said there is a risk of several nursing homes in Louisiana closing if the state doesn’t try to limit damages from such lawsuits. The facilities don’t have adequate insurance to fight these types of legal actions, he said. 

“It will bankrupt every nursing home in the state,” Seabaugh said. 

Strong political connections 

Nursing home owners are largely dependent on public the state Medicaid program, which is overseen by the Louisiana Department of Health. As a result, the owners are very active in politics and among the most generous political donors to legislators and governors alike. 

A WVUE-TV Fox 8 investigation found the nursing home industry spent $3.2 million on political contributions to  state elected officials over four years from 2017-20. Facility owners are also paying lobbyists who work during the legislative session more than $375,000 this year, according to state records. 
The Bossier City nursing home Seabaugh is defending is also part of CommCare Corp., a statewide nursing home network former Louisiana House Speaker Jim Tucker leads.

Coman’s law firm is pushing back, however. State records show Garcia & Artigliere donated $25,000 to Cajun PAC II, a political committee benefitting Gov. Jeff Landry. The contribution came on June 25, 2024, less than a month after the legislature adjourned its regular session last year without passing the nursing home protection legislation. 

The California law firm also hired four Louisiana-based lobbyists ahead of the legislative session this year. They include Alton Ashy, who is close to the governor, for at least $100,000, and former state Sen. Rick Ward for at least $25,000, according to state records.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/nursing-home-1024x577.png,,,2025-04-22 19:07:21.395925

Tariffs meant to encourage U.S. manufacturing could have the opposite effect because many materials are imported from China. (Sumuri LLC)Steve Whalen loves his home state of Delaware and he’s proud to manufacture computers there that police officers use to “catch bad guys.” He said tariffs on imports from China and other countries, along with sharp cuts to government spending and the winding down of a program for small manufacturers, will make it harder for him to do that.
“We got into business to keep costs low for the ‘good guys,’ but tariffs or anything else that raises prices keeps us from doing that,” said Whalen, co-founder of Sumuri LLC in Magnolia, Delaware, which makes computer workstations for police and government investigations. Whalen has to buy materials overseas, often from China, and he said the tariffs could force him to triple his price on some workstations to $12,000.
Tariffs are the main tool President Donald Trump is wielding to try to boost manufacturing in the United States, calling the achievement of that goal “an economic and national security priority.” But the higher levies have led to retaliation and suspended shipments, and Whalen said they are just one of several Trump administration actions squeezing his small manufacturing business.
The wave of federal spending cuts, which has affected grants to state and local governments, could make his customers put off purchases. And the administration has moved to cut off funding for a $175 million state-based program that provides expert advice to smaller factories like his.
The Delaware version of that program, the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, helped Sumuri fit expanded product lines into the limited space in its small-town factory.
“We were really having a tough time trying to figure out how to utilize our space efficiently,” Whalen said. “They came here and helped us organize and optimize, and it made a huge difference.”
On April 1, the Trump administration cut off funding for 10 such manufacturing programs that were up for renewal in Delaware, Hawaii, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota and Wyoming. Other state MEP programs will expire over the next year.
The administration gave a reprieve to those 10 states until the end of the fiscal year after objections from Democrats in the U.S. House and Senate. The National Institute of Standards and Technology, which manages the program, extended funding for the 10 states “after further review and consideration” and will “continue to evaluate plans for the program,” said agency spokesperson Chad Boutin.
The program has come under fire from Republicans since the George W. Bush administration first tried to end it in 2009, and again during the first Trump administration, but Congress has continued to fund it. The conservative Heritage Foundation said in a 2023 book that MEP’s functions “would be more properly carried out by the private sector.”
 
‘Dots don’t quite connect’
Buckley Brinkman, executive director of the Wisconsin Center for Manufacturing and Productivity, which works with his state’s MEP program, said it didn’t make much sense for the administration to shutter the program as it seeks to boost the number of U.S. manufacturing jobs.
“It’s one of those things where the dots don’t quite connect,” Brinkman said. “I mean, jeez, here’s a part of government that doesn’t cost a whole lot, in the grand scheme of things — less than $200 million a year — that’s returning 10-to-1 to the national treasury, working on a priority for the president.”
A 2024 Upjohn report found an even higher return: 17-to-1 on $175 million in the 2023 fiscal year, creating $3 billion in new federal tax revenue.


In Wisconsin, which has lost more than 138,000 manufacturing jobs since 2000, some parts makers report that business is booming as manufacturers seek to avoid tariffs by finding U.S. alternatives to Chinese manufacturers, Brinkman said. But more broadly, he doubts that the tariffs will spark a manufacturing boom in the state.
“Do we want all this manufacturing back? Do we have the will to get it back? The answer to both those questions is ‘no,’” Brinkman said. “Even without the tariffs we don’t really want Americans doing a lot of those jobs that are in Chinese factories right now.”
In Delaware, the MEP helped Sumuri manage its expansion, but unpredictable tariffs and budgets are now a bigger danger, said Jason Roslewicz, Sumuri’s vice president of business development. He’s had to devote two employees to monitoring supply lines, tariff news and competitor pricing to stay afloat.
“We went from putting things together in a basement to a 19,000-square-foot facility, doing exactly what we’re supposed to do here in the U.S., and it’s all in danger of coming apart because of this problem,” Roslewicz said.
Other small manufacturers express similar concerns. TJ Semanchin, who owns Wonderstate Coffee in Madison, Wisconsin, said his business roasting and distributing coffee is in crisis because of the tariffs.
Wonderstate’s costs have almost doubled between tariffs on imported coffee and packaging materials from China, plus a cyclical rise in coffee prices. “I’m borrowing money to pay for this and at some point we’ll have to raise prices. We’ll have no choice,” Semanchin said.

But many Republican state officials, and even some Democrats, have backed Trump’s tariff push, including Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who credited the Trump administration with “reshoring manufacturing and restoring this middle class which has been eviscerated over the last 20 years.”
“There’s dislocation in the short term, there’s long-term opportunity,” Youngkin said in an April 15 interview on CNBC. He said his state is hearing more interest from manufacturers looking to build or expand local factories since Trump took office. For instance, Delta Star recently announced a plan to add 300 jobs building power transformers in Lynchburg.
“The president has been clear that there will be some level of tariffs, and folks are coming, and that’s good for Virginia,” Youngkin said in the CNBC interview.
Virginia’s MEP program, called Genedge, claims successes in streamlining production and quality control for local factory products including TreeDiaper, an automated tree watering device made in Ashland, and for advising EDM, a Lynchburg plastic product assembler that needed more efficient production to keep overseas competition at bay. But Virginia’s MEP is one of the state programs slated to expire in the next year.
 
Long-term trend
The slide in U.S. manufacturing jobs has continued on and off since 1979, and many experts say tariffs will not bring them back. Despite a modest bounce back under the Biden administration, the number of manufacturing jobs has declined from nearly 20 million in 1979 to less than 13 million today, even as the total U.S. workforce has grown from 89 million to 159 million during that period.
Manufacturing faces labor shortages, with many factories operating below capacity because they can’t find enough workers, according to Jason Miller, a professor of supply chain management at Michigan State University.
That doesn’t bode well for a mass reshoring of factories from China and other countries, but Miller doesn’t expect that to happen anyway.
“Firms are not planning on reshoring much of the work that was offshored 20 to 25 years ago,” Miller said. “I’m not concerned about having enough workers for manufacturing jobs that would be reshored because this isn’t going to happen.”
In a 2024 survey by the libertarian Cato Institute, 80% of Americans said America would be better off if more people worked in manufacturing, but only 25% said they personally would be better off working in a factory. The Chinese government has poked fun at the idea with memes of American workers struggling to make Nike sneakers with sewing machines.
Joseph McCartin, a labor historian at Georgetown University, said the idea of a manufacturing rebirth is a “mirage being conjured to attract the support of workers who have been underpaid in an increasingly unequal economy for the last 40 years, and are desperate for some hope of renewed upward mobility.”
Manufacturing “isn’t the magic wand to make that happen,” McCartin said.
“What we need is to raise workers’ wages and make the economy less prone to producing inequality,” McCartin said. “That mission is not at all what Trump is about. He is dealing in stale nostalgia.”

(Photo courtesy of Drake University)An organization involved in litigation with universities across the U.S. has filed a federal complaint against Drake University in Des Moines, alleging one of its scholarship programs violates federal anti-discrimination law.
The Equal Protection Project, a branch of the Legal Insurrection Foundation, submitted a civil rights complaint Tuesday to the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights against the private university. The organization, which  says it is “devoted to the fair treatment of all persons without regard to race or ethnicity,” claims in the complaint Drake is violating Title IV by limiting eligibility of one of its scholarship programs, the Crew Scholars Program, to students of color.
“Drake is expanding DEI activities at a time when the State of Iowa and the federal government are scaling back,” said William Jacobson, founder of the Equal Protection Project, in an emailed statement. “Regardless of where one stands on the DEI debate, discrimination based on race violates the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Iowa state law, and Drake’s own non-discrimination rules. Drake should open up the scholarship to all students without regard to race.”

Drake University spokesperson Ashton Hockman said in an email the university cannot comment at this time, as it has not received any communication from the U.S. Department of Education.
The Crew Scholars Program is described online as an “academic excellence and leadership development program for incoming students with a passion for diversity” that provides $500 annual scholarships to participating students.
According to the civil rights complaint, the scholarship program limits participation to students of color. The complaint cites as evidence a university website link and screenshots showing the program description including the language “The Crew Scholars Program at Drake University is open to incoming domestic students of color in any major.”
A different website describing the scholars program eliminates references to race in who is allowed to apply.
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act forbids “intentional discrimination on the basis of race, color or national origin” in any program that receives federal support, the complaint stated, and as Drake University receives federal funding, it is in violation of the law. Referencing the U.S. Department of Education’s Feb. 14 “Dear Colleague” letter, the complaint stated that regardless of its reasons for offering a “discriminatory program,” Drake is still violating the law.
“Accordingly, we respectfully ask that the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights promptly open a formal investigation, impose such remedial relief as the law permits for the benefit of those who have been illegally excluded from Drake’s various programs based on discriminatory criteria, and ensure that all ongoing and future programming at Drake comports with the federal civil rights laws,” the complaint stated.
Drake has reiterated its commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion multiple times as state and federal actions have required universities to pull back on such programming, including implementing new programming to ensure all students feel like they belong and speaking out against decisions that negatively impact campus and Drake students.
Drake President Marty Martin published a letter in early March telling students they are all welcome at the university despite contrary messages such as legislation to repeal the inclusion of transgender and nonbinary people in civil rights protections. Martin called the law “one among many current state and federal efforts that seek to turn our differences into division.”
“This is a moral failure against which we stand in opposition,” Martin said in the letter. “It is our duty to respect, support, and affirm anyone in our community targeted by these actions.”

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Mary-Murphy Walsh shouted into a megaphone across Blackstone Boulevard, her voice gradually rising to a roar as a chorus echoed back in her direction.
“Out here on the picket line/Butler must have lost its mind,” Walsh and Butler Hospital workers sang as they marched in single file on opposite sides of the boulevard in Providence’s East Side.  
Walsh, a labor organizer with SEIU-1199, led about 200 unionized employees of Butler Hospital in an informational picket Monday, with workers arriving and departing in waves as they finished or started their shifts at Rhode Island’s only private, nonprofit psychiatric and substance abuse hospital. 
On a walking path situated in between the boulevard’s opposite lanes, passersbys including dog walkers, a pack of Brown University runners, and other amblers turned their heads toward the picket’s noise. The busy road’s passing cars honked often. A kid on his bike stopped to watch and tap along with the drumbeat played by picketers.
Contrasting the workers’ almost celebratory sense of solidarity were their sobering complaints. According to the union, incidents of violence against staff have risen 41% since 2022. A union survey suggests that 95% of Butler caregivers think Care New England, the hospital’s parent company, “is not doing enough to keep them safe at work.”
Catherine Maynard, a registered nurse in the hospital’s geriatric unit, said in a statement ahead of the picket that a 2023 injury acquired while restraining a patient herniated discs in her back. 
“Two years later, I still work with pain and, at 29, I may be dealing with back problems for the rest of my life,” Maynard wrote.
SEIU 1119 has four contracts with Butler which cover professional and clerical staff, registered nurses, mental health workers, and housekeeping and dietary staff. All four contracts expired on March 31.
Workplace violence, union members say, is exacerbated by staffing shortages and low wages. Butler employs a little over 1,000 people annually, according to reports filed with the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in 2023. Right now, the hospital has about 116 open positions. 
Workers are also dissatisfied with their wages. Under the recently expired contract, mental health workers started at $18.27 an hour. Housekeeping and dietary staff started at $16.08, clerical workers started at $19.76, and professional staff and registered nurses started at $32.50.

6.2% wage hikes offered
Starting wages could increase about 6.2% under Butler’s recent proposals depending on employee classification. A mental health worker’s initial wage could rise to $19.40 by 2028, under a proposal illustrated in hospital documents released April 2. Existing mental health workers could see incremental increases over the course of the four-year contract, from around 13% to 16%, for a total of about $23 or $24 hourly. 
Under Butler’s April 2 proposal, starting wages would rise as follows by April 1, 2028:

Housekeeping and dietary staff would start at $17.06 an hour.  
Clerical workers would start at $20.97 an hour.
Professional staff and registered nurses would start at $34.49 an hour.

The proposed starting wages, according to the hospital, “represent the highest opening wage increase offer from Butler in over 10 years of negotiations.”
Mary E. Marran, Butler’s president and chief operating officer, said the six-hour picket occurred despite the hospital’s “ongoing commitment to open and constructive negotiations,” in a statement Monday.
“From the start, Butler’s leadership has been fully engaged in the bargaining process,” Marran said. “We recognize the importance of wages, benefits, and workplace safety, and we have worked diligently and in good faith to address these issues. Our goal remains a fair and equitable agreement that supports our employees while upholding the exceptional care our patients deserve.”
Part of the hospital’s initiative to be transparent in negotiating included a website, ButlerInfoForYou.org, expressly designed to share information on the negotiation process. The domain was registered on Jan. 30, shortly before contract negotiations were to begin. It includes the hospital’s proposed terms and revisions for each of the four contracts. According to a site calendar which lists meeting dates, the most bargaining talks were on April 15.










Our goal remains a fair and equitable agreement that supports our employees while upholding the exceptional care our patients deserve.


– Mary E. Marran, Butler Hospital president and chief operating officer


The website also includes a question and answer section in which the hospital responded to questions, such as “Why can’t Butler Hospital retain staff to work the inpatient units?” and “Why is it that when a nurse manager gets assaulted, the cops are called and patient gets arrested but when an mhw [mental health worker] is assaulted, no one bats an eye?”
Ian Lacombe, a registered nurse in Butler’s emergency department who has been with the hospital for over two decades, described the union’s next steps in an emailed statement Tuesday. 
“Our goal is to reach a fair contract agreement and we look forward to returning to the bargaining table on April 29,” Lacombe said. “But we refuse to settle if we are unable to make concrete gains that significantly improve staffing and safety concerns that continue to put us in harm’s way. Our patients come to Butler in need of mental health and substance abuse support but we can’t adequately meet their needs due to short staffing. We do not want to strike but are prepared to take that step to protect our patients from the current environment.”

Punched, pushed, kicked and headbutted
Problems with inpatient violence are not new at Butler or psychiatric institutions elsewhere. An OSHA filing recounts a Jan. 29, 2021, incident in which a patient flipped a table, “began wielding colored pencils as weapons,” and spit bloody phlegm in one employee’s eyes.
During 2024, OSHA logs show that Butler workers were punched in the groin, struck in the chest, pushed against walls, and kicked in various body parts. Another employee received three headbutts to the nose. A patient flung a dinner plate at an intake coordinator. A staff nurse was grabbed from behind and choked by a patient. One patient tried to attack another, and when an employee intervened, the aggressor bit down on the worker’s tricep, destroying his diabetes monitoring device.   
Many recorded incidents occurred during attempts to restrain patients, but not all. The OSHA logs relay an incident from Feb. 24, 2024, when an “unprovoked” patient “repeatedly punched [an employee] in the face, nose, mouth and right eye.”
Marran wrote in her statement that “safety is non-negotiable” at Butler. 
“Like all Care New England hospitals, we have comprehensive protocols in place to protect staff and patients from workplace violence,” Marran stated. “Our nurses, clinical teams, and security personnel are trained in de-escalation techniques, and high-risk behavioral health areas receive enhanced support and staffing. We do not tolerate violence in any form. Our staff are committed professionals who work tirelessly under challenging circumstances, and we will continue to advocate for their safety and well-being.”
Patient violence toward staff, a common occupational hazard in psychiatric settings, intensified during the pandemic. A 2022 article in the journal AIMS Public Health noted that, during the pandemic’s heights in June 2020, psychiatric hospitals workers reported the highest rates of inpatient violence, with 57% of workers having experienced it. The authors’ analysis of previous research noted that the more beds were occupied in health care settings, the more likely it was that patient aggression would occur. 
“Although the clinician’s right to refuse treatment of violent patients is allowed by law, many practitioners still treat all patients who need our help, regardless of their actions or abusive potential,” the article noted in its conclusions. “Unfortunately, no matter what data are presented, medical and psychiatric facilities consistently stand out as some of the most dangerous workplaces in the United States.”
Documents shared by the union give even more specific details on incidents, including 111 assaults recorded thus far in 2025. These workplace incident reports include dialogue, actions taken by staff, and at times, hint at patients’ struggles, like on Jan. 27, when a patient packed her bags and headed for the door, yelling that she didn’t need to be at the hospital. Two staff members closed the door to prevent her escape, and the patient pushed them both. The workers were not injured.
According to the log, after the patient had been dosed with the strong tranquilizer thorazine and her parent notified of the incident, she came up to the worker she had pushed into a wall, and apologized.

With an unemployment rate of 2.7% in March, down from 2.8% last month, Montana has now seen six straight months of rates under 3%.
The governor’s office and Department of Labor and Industry continue to praise the low seasonally adjusted unemployment rate, the third stint below 3% since the Federal Reserve began measuring the rate in the 1970s.
Coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic, Montana saw an unemployment rate below 3% for two full years from October 2021 to October 2023.
It ticked up slightly from then to 3.1% in December of that year, before slowly ticking down. March marked the 45th consecutive month of unemployment at or below 3.4%.
“For six months, Montana’s unemployment rate has remained below 3%, with nearly two job openings for every unemployed worker,” Gov. Greg Gianforte said in a press release. “Through our efforts to lower taxes and remove red tape, we’ve have created an environment that empowers entrepreneurs and businesses to invest and create good-paying jobs for Montanans across our state.”
The unemployment was 1.5% lower than the national rate, which came in at 4.2% in March. The state’s unadjusted unemployment rate of 3.0% ranks 5th in the U.S. 
The state said the labor force in Montana decreased by 572 workers last month. Data shows the state has added 1,500 payroll jobs over the last month.
﻿﻿
Forty-four of the state’s counties currently have unemployment rates below 4%, and 19 of them have seen net job gains over the last year year, according to data from the Department of Labor and Industry.
Gallatin County has seen the largest drop in employment over the last year with 348 fewer people employed this year compared to last. Missoula county, however, has seen the most growth with 860 additional people becoming employed.
Unemployment rates remain higher on the state’s seven Native American reservations – ranging from a non-seasonally adjusted rate of 4.7% on the Flathead Indian Reservation up to 13.1% on Rocky Boy’s reservation. All seven reservations have seen net job decreases in the last year.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HS1A0114-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-22 19:07:21.395925

(Daniella Heminghaus for New Jersey Monitor)Five international Rutgers University students and a recent graduate of the state school are suing the federal government for abruptly terminating their records in student visa status database, saying it has upended their lives and left in doubt whether they can remain in the United States. 
In a federal lawsuit filed Tuesday, the students say the effective termination of their F-1 student status bars them from working, stops them from continuing their studies and immediately makes them vulnerable to arrest, detention and deportation.
“I am afraid to leave my home out of fear that I will be detained. I feel that I am in a home prison,” one of the students said, according to Tuesday’s filing (it does not identify them by name).
At the center of the dispute is the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System, or SEVIS, a federal database that colleges and universities use to track students’ compliance with their immigration status and share that information, like address and educational progress, with federal officials.
The 42-page complaint claims the federal government purged more than 1,000 SEVIS records since Jan. 20 — the day President Donald Trump took office for his second term — effectively putting an end to the student status and the benefits that come with it. The complaint names U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials as defendants.
The students are seeking a temporary restraining order that would prohibit the government from arresting, detaining or deporting them while the case is active. The risk these students face of detention is “currently very serious,” the attorneys wrote, pointing to others whose F-1 visas were revoked and were subsequently arrested by ICE. 
Jessica Rofé, director of the Constitutional Rights Clinic at Rutgers and an assistant law professor, is one of the plaintiffs’ attorneys.
“The abrupt termination of their SEVIS records and status without meaningful process or justification in an attempt to coerce them to hastily depart upends their academic and career trajectories, disrupts our communities, and is an affront to due process,” Rofé said in a statement.
More than 23,000 international students attended New Jersey colleges in the 2023-24 school year, according to the Institute of International Education. New Jersey ranks 17th in the country for accepting international students, who spent nearly $1 billion last year.
Getting a visa or protected status is a complicated process, with confusing forms to fill out and several requirements to fulfill to remain in good standing. An F-1 visa grants a student the status to remain in the United States as long as they’re studying or on a temporary work assignment, and are compliant with the law. Students can lose their status by failing classes or doing unauthorized work.
When ICE terminates a record in the system, that student is no longer protected. People can apply for reinstatement, but there is no way to appeal the SEVIS status change. 
Rutgers, Rowan, and Montclair State universities have seen roughly two dozen students notified of their visa status termination, according to NJ Spotlight News. Inside Higher Ed reported that more than 1,680 students nationwide have been notified of their SEVIS termination. 
U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in March that he began revoking the visas of students and visitors if “they’re taking activities that are counter to our foreign, to our national interest, to our foreign policy.” He said visa holders charged with a crime should automatically lose their status. It’s part of the Trump administration’s overarching plan to mass detain and deport undocumented residents and some people with legal status, particularly going after those connected to pro-Palestinian protests at universities. 
The attorneys representing the Rutgers plaintiffs  — the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey Foundation, the Rutgers Immigrant Community Assistance Project and Gibbons P.C. —noted they haven’t been charged with crimes or done anything to fall out of standing when ICE closed their records.
They charge that the misuse of SEVIS is key to the Trump administration’s plan to circumvent the law and “drive international students out of the country without due process and in violation of DHS regulations.” And if the government believes that students are deportable, the proceedings should take place in immigration court, the complaint states. 
The lawsuit describes a sweeping task force created within the Department of Homeland Security using data-mining tools to analyze the social media of 1.5 million students in attempts to deport them on charges that ordinarily would not be justified. It also alleges that students from China and India are being disproportionately targeted.
Without work authorization, the plaintiffs say they are unable to pay their expenses and face losing their homes. One student said they’d run out of money within two months, and another said they have a family abroad that relies on them for financial support.
Tuesday’s filing is the latest in a flood of lawsuits from students fighting the termination of their status. In New Hampshire, a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order to reverse the status of a Dartmouth student from China whose status was revoked.

Emilio M. Puente is suing the City of Iowa City in U.S. District Court for the Southern District or Iowa, claiming violations of the federal Civil Rights Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act.
Puente worked for the city as a police officer from April 2019 through February 2022 and was awarded a number of commendations for bravery and high-quality performance, according to his lawsuit.
The lawsuit alleges that in November 2019, a fellow officer sent a department-wide email from Puente’s police email account that mocked Puente’s own Latino ethnicity in some way. The content of the email is not described in the lawsuit, but the lawsuit claims Puente’s superiors declined to investigate the matter.
When a similar incident occurred involving the unauthorized use of a Caucasian officer’s email account, the police chief sent out a memo indicating such behavior would not be tolerated, the lawsuit claims.
In July 2020, Puente and another officer pursued a fleeing suspect through a grassy area in their vehicles, according to the lawsuit. Puente alleges he was disciplined for driving through the grass while the other officer, a Caucasian, was not.
In November 2021, the lawsuit claims, Puente participated in the arrest of a suspect who was being “assaultive and resistant” which resulted in Puente delivering “two controlled strikes to the suspect.” Later, the suspect’s mother drew the department’s attention to a video, circulating on social media, of the arrest.
That led to an internal affairs investigation and Puente’s use of force was allegedly deemed reasonable by an instructor on the use of force and by an instructor on how to deescalate conflicts. Despite that, Puente alleges, he was told in February 2022 that the chief of police would be firing him and that “he would never again work in law enforcement unless he resigned.”
Puente claims he followed the advice of his union representatives and submitted a letter of resignation, but that at the time he made the decision, he was under the influence of pain medications for a leg injury.
“Because of his forced resignation,” the lawsuit asserts, Puente’s “disability pay was discontinued immediately and he was left without income.”
The lawsuit alleges that after a May 2022 Civil Service Commission hearing on his discipline, police department management made a statement to the press that Puente had committed misconduct by violating the city’s use-of-force policy, publicly impugning his character.
A month later, Puente claims, another video surfaced on social media showing one of Iowa City’s Caucasian officers striking a handcuffed female “more than seven times with his closed fist.” That officer, Puente argues, “was never disciplined” for the actions depicted in the video, nor did the department open an internal investigation.
That same Caucasian officer, the lawsuit claims, is depicted in yet another video that shows him beating an individual who posed no threat. Again, the lawsuit alleges, that officer was not subject to discipline or any sort of an investigation.
While Puente “was forced to resign and lost his disability income, the other officer was publicly defended by the ICPD,” the lawsuit claims. The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages for racial or ethnic discrimination and disability discrimination.
Puente’s attorney filed a similar claim against the city in July 2024. That lawsuit was challenged by the city, which noted that the suit was filed almost six months before Puente had obtained the necessary right-to-sue letter from the U.S. Department of Justice. Technically, that lawsuit remains open and active, although the new lawsuit states that it is “intended to cure any possible defect” in the 2024 filing.
Lawyers for the city have declined to comment on Puente’s allegations.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/police-sheriff-law-enforcement-squad-car-light-bar-getty-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-22 19:07:21.395925

“I found out later on that a bill had been drafted. I talked to the Legislative Reference Service and asked them to look it up because I did not do this,” he said.

The legislation makes drafting a bill without a lawmaker’s permission and advertising the legislation a Class A misdemeanor, punishable by one year in jail and a fine of up to $6,000.
The bill passed 94-1 with a floor amendment by Rep. Ben Robbins, R-Sylacauga, that clarified that the person publishing the bill was requested to do so by a legislator.
“I got recommendations from the county commission association to add this,” he said.
Rep. Chris England, D-Tuscaloosa, was the only vote against the bill. He said he could not support it because of confusing language.
“I can’t support it the way it is written because you may catch somebody that’s trying to do the right thing and help you out,” England said.
The bill goes to the Senate.

Ron DeSantis' appointee to the University of West Florida Board of Trustees. (Photos via UWF website)Senators have made clear their hesitation to confirm some gubernatorial appointments this session, particularly for higher education institutions in Pensacola. 
Tuesday, the Ethics and Election Committee rejected one University of West Florida trustee, Adam Kissel, and questioned five others who appeared before the committee before being approved, while advancing another 120+ appointees for various boards across the state in one vote with no discussion or public appearances. 
Two other UWF trustees resigned from that board after intense public pushback. 
Also in Pensacola, former state Rep. Joel Rudman resigned Tuesday morning from his governor-appointed spot on the Pensacola State College board of trustees. 
Sen. Don Gaetz, chair of the committee, invited Rudman to appear Tuesday but was informed by Rudman the day of the meeting that he was resigning, despite previously saying he would be there.
Senators on the Appropriations Committee on Higher Education voted unfavorably on Rudman’s appointment last week. 
Rudman previously indicated he had a list of lawmakers who he said were violating drug laws and would release the names depending on how senators behaved in his confirmation hearings, according to Gaetz. Rudman posted from Barcelona on X over the weekend. 
Gaetz said he asked Florida Department of Law Enforcement officers to be prepared to take evidence and names from Rudman during the Tuesday morning meeting, “but Dr. Rudman has not favored us with his appearance.”

DeSantis’ controversial nominees
Much of the pushback stems around DeSantis’ stated desire to steer UWF in a more conservative direction. The eight appointees to the board by DeSantis and the Board of Governors in the span of a month helped elect Idaho professor Scott Yenor to chair the board. 
Senators have also complained about appointees who live outside of Florida — including Yenor in Idaho and Kissel in West Virginia.
Yenor faced backlash for advocating for fewer women in higher education and said that if only men won the Nobel Prize, “that’s not a failure. It’s kind of a cause for celebration,” The Associated Press reported.
Yenor resigned earlier this month, as has Gates Garcia, a private equity CEO from Tampa, while Sen. Gayle Harrell told the remaining trustees that the Senate would “be carefully watching the board of trustees at the University of West Florida.”
Senators had told Garcia he should come to the next committee hearing prepared to further defend his vote to make Yenor chair of the board. That chance never came. 
DeSantis said last week that UWF would see “big changes,” after boasting about the political overhaul of New College of Florida. 
UWF trustees Paul Bailey, Rebecca Matthews, Rachel Moya, Ashley Ross, and Chris Young were approved Tuesday and their nominations will head to the Senate floor, while Kissel’s will not.  
DeSantis has until 30 days after the legislative session to reappoint Kissel before he would have to vacate his seat. If reappointed, he must be confirmed next session. If not confirmed next session, he would have to leave the board.
During the committee meeting, senators asked UWF trustees whether they were concerned about “woke” administrators or teachings on campus — Sen. Tina Polsky, for example, asked whether UWF is “an indoctrination camp with marxist professors,” as DeSantis has alleged.
Ross called UWF “a tremendous diamond in the rough,” but also said, “I’m not here to ever disagree with the governor.” 
Bailey, Matthews, Moya, and Young said they saw no need for major changes in regards to administrative or political problems. 
“He has said he wants to take it over like he did New College, so the people who are on the board have to be willing to do that or have had conversations to be chosen to say, ‘I am willing to do that kind of takeover and change the whole atmosphere of a school,’” Polsky said, referring to the governor, asking Ross if he was part of the “overhaul.”
“My understanding of what I’m here to do today is to answer the questions that you have about my ability to serve as a university trustee,” Ross responded without directly answering the question.
Kissel faced questions in Higher Education Appropriations committee last month about his published writings expressing a desire to privatize public universities and grievances with the GI bill.

(McKenzie Romero/Utah News Dispatch)Planned Parenthood of Utah announced on Tuesday that thanks to “ongoing attacks from the Trump administration,” it’s been forced to restructure its operations, which includes closing two clinics — one in northern and one in southern Utah. 
On May 2, Planned Parenthood said it would be closing its Logan and St. George centers, which served about 4,500 patients last year. Plus, it said it would be cutting staff and increasing prices. 
“The painful decisions to close Logan and St. George health centers, reduce PPAU’s staff, and increase service fees are forced on us by the Trump administration,” said Sarah Stoesz, interim CEO of Planned Parenthood Association of Utah. 
The nonprofit — which offers affordable sexual and reproductive health care, especially for low-income Utahns — said in a news release Tuesday that it had to make “several difficult operational decisions,” including the clinic closures, “to preserve the organization’s long-term sustainability and access to care for as many patients as possible.” 
Planned Parenthood of Utah officials said President Donald Trump’s administration’s withholding of $2.8 million in Title X funds forced them to take action. In addition to the closures, they said they also had to reduce “clinical and education staff” and up their prices.

“Unfortunately, without Title X funding, PPAU must also increase the sliding-fee scale for self-pay patients,” the news release said. “Simultaneously, PPAU will expand telehealth services to help connect patients in remote or rural areas to timely care.” 
Since 1985, Planned Parenthood of Utah has been the only recipient of Title X funding in the state. More than 26,000 low-income Utahns received low or no-cost services from Planned Parenthood thanks to that grant, according to the nonprofit. 
Last month, on March 31, the federal Health and Human Services’ Office of Population Affairs notified almost one in five Title X grantees across the country that their fourth year of funding (for a five-year period) would be “temporarily withheld,” according to KFF, a health policy research outlet. That freeze impacted all nine of Planned Parenthood’s grantees, plus seven other nonprofits. It’s not clear when or if that funding will be unfrozen. 
As part of that decision, all of Utah’s Title X funding was frozen. Planned Parenthood of Utah has eight clinics throughout the state.
The Trump administration said the funding freeze was aimed at enforcing executive orders on diversity and immigration. Federal officials gave Utah and the other impacted affiliates “10 days to submit detailed reports showing they don’t discriminate in hiring or patient care, but those who did so by the deadline said they have not received a response,” Politico reported Tuesday. The outlet also said the Trump administration did not respond to questions about the status of the funds. 
“It’s been radio silence,” Stoesz told Politico. “For some inexplicable reason, they are taking a meat axe to the healthcare system in America.”
Since Title X, the nation’s only federally-funded family planning program, was enacted in 1970 with bipartisan support, it has helped millions across the country access preventative health care, including birth control, sexually transmitted infection testing and treatment, and cancer screenings. The program’s money cannot be used to fund abortions, according to Congress. 
“By withholding Title X funding from PPAU, the Trump administration is taking away essential health care from Utahns,” Stoesz said. 
Utah House passes bill to ban Planned Parenthood educators from schools

Still, Stoesz said in a prepared statement Tuesday that the nonprofit is “committed to making sure that everyone gets the health care they need when they need it, despite efforts by politicians to take it away.” 
“We know that we cannot show up for the communities who rely on us without making some challenging decisions now,” she said. 
By “consolidating our health care delivery and expanding telehealth, we will be in a better position to continue serving those who rely on us for health care,” Stoesz added. “While politicians in Washington are taking away people’s health care, Planned Parenthood is working tirelessly to keep our patients, families, and communities healthy.” 
Shireen Ghorbani, interim president of Planned Parenthood Association of Utah, said the organization has spent decades — 55 years — supporting Utahns and “future generations.” 
“This decision is heartbreaking and extremely difficult but necessary right now, so we can operate a sustainable organization that can continue to provide our community with essential health care and education,” said Ghorbani, who ran an unsuccessful Democratic bid to represent Utah in Congress in 2018. 
Despite the funding freeze, Ghorbani said Planned Parenthood of Utah will continue to provide services. 
“Our mission, coupled with the challenges of this moment — federal dismantling of health care, inflation, stagnant reimbursement rates — requires us to take serious and immediate cost-saving measures to protect the people we serve,” she said. “During this transition, our clinical staff will ensure our patients continue to get the same high-quality, trusted care they have come to expect.”

The Public Utilities Commission voted 2-1 to deny the company’s application, but Summit immediately pledged to reapply with a “reduced scope.”
It was the second South Dakota denial for Summit, which has been seeking a permit to build a portion of its proposed $9 billion pipeline through South Dakota since 2022. The commission denied the company’s first application in 2023, after which the company modified its route and reapplied.


Pipeline news in Iowa
Why hasn’t a pipeline bill come to Senate floor? Lawmakers blame opposing parties


The pipeline would carry carbon dioxide emissions captured from ethanol plants in five states to an underground storage site in North Dakota, where a Summit official has acknowledged some carbon could also be used to extract oil from old wells. The project seeks to capitalize on a broader federal push to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and could qualify for federal tax credits tied to carbon sequestration.
Its path forward was complicated by the South Dakota Legislature’s passage of a carbon pipeline eminent domain ban, which was signed into law by Gov. Larry Rhoden in March. Eminent domain is a legal process that allows qualifying entities to acquire access to private land for projects in the public interest, with compensation for landowners determined by a court.
Summit had relied on that authority to survey land and secure access from property owners unwilling to sign voluntary easements.
A spokeswoman with the company vowed Tuesday in a prepared statement to refile an application for the project that “reflects a reduced scope and continued engagement with landowners and plant partners.”
Opposing landowners celebrate
Too many landowners at key points along the proposed route vowed to never sign an easement agreement for the project, rendering the application incomplete and ill prepared for the permitting process to continue, said Commissioner Kristie Fiegen during the meeting.
“Summit’s route is uncertain at this point,” Fiegen said. “We really don’t know the route. We don’t know the timeframes. We don’t know their plan.”
PUC staff said the permit could be denied because “substantive changes” will be needed to the application if the company can’t move forward with the route it has on file. Denying the application would then be “the cleanest path forward,” according to the staff’s filed recommendation.
Attorney Brian Jorde, representing landowners opposed to the project, said the application is impossible because “there’s nothing they can do to change these folks’ minds.” Seventy-nine South Dakota landowners declared they would never sign an easement, according to one of the commissioners.

“Is there another route?” Jorde said. “Yes, but not in this application.”
Property owners opposed to the pipeline applauded the commission’s decision. Ed Fischbach, a vocal critic of the project, said in a news release that the decision acknowledges “the company has run out of road to build” and frees landowners “to get on with their lives and businesses.”
But Canton Republican Rep. Karla Lems, who carried the successful eminent domain ban during the legislative session, said she has “a hard time believing” the project is over, especially if federal tax credits remain available.
The decision affirms that South Dakota is “open for business, but not for sale,” she said.
“If you have a great project and want to get it done in South Dakota, you should come in and do it the South Dakota way and people should be able to say yes or no to your project,” Lems said.
Summit officials ‘remain committed’ to state
The Public Utilities Commission instructed Summit earlier this month to present a plan to illustrate how the company can move forward – or not – under the new state law barring its use of eminent domain. At its previous meeting, the commission denied Summit’s request for a pause in permit proceedings.
Summit has permits in North Dakota, Minnesota and Iowa, but some of the permits are being challenged in court. Nebraska does not have a permitting process for the project. A bill to ban eminent domain for carbon dioxide pipelines is being considered in the Iowa statehouse.
Summit attorney Brett Koenecke opposed South Dakota regulators’ decision Tuesday, calling it “a prejudice” to the company pushed by opponents.
“You should ask yourselves why they’re fighting so hard to have this application denied and sent back,” Koenecke told commissioners. “I’d submit to you that the answer is likely they know it’s harder to restart.”
Commissioner Chris Nelson dissented from his colleagues Fiegen and Gary Hanson, arguing that Summit’s declaration that “they’re not going to challenge” the eminent domain ban, in addition to minor changes to the pipeline’s planned route, are enough for the project to move forward. 
Summit filed paperwork with the commission this month stating that it would rather work with its current application and route than seek court orders or refer the ban to the voters, adding that “threatening legal action is counter-productive to attempting to do business in good faith in the state.”
In a prepared statement, the Summit spokeswoman said company officials are “disappointed” in the commission’s decision but “remain committed” to South Dakota and the project.
“Without it the ethanol industry, farmers and land values in the state will all suffer,” she said.

(iStock / Getty Images Plus)New Mexico health officials on Tuesday reported two new cases of measles, both in Lea County, bringing the state’s total to 65 measles cases this year spread across four counties.
Just over half of the cases in Lea, Eddy, Chavez and Doña Ana counties have been among children: with 18 cases in very young children aged 0 to four; 19 cases in school aged children; and 28 adult cases. The majority of cases, 61, are in Lea County, which neighbors Gaines County, Texas, the source of the outbreak that has infected more than 800 people as of Tuesday.
Texas health officials reported 624 cases Tuesday, an increase of 27 since last Friday.
The New Mexico Department of Health continues to urge vaccination, the most effective method to prevent contracting measles.
“Measles spread easily from person to person, which is why, despite small increases in positive case numbers as we saw in the past few days, we continue to encourage New Mexicans to get the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination – the best tool to protect yourself and those you love,” said NMDOH Communications Director Robert Nott.
Since Feb. 1, about 20,300 New Mexicans have received a vaccine, nearly double the 10,860 vaccinated in the same time frame last year.
Measles, a highly contagious respiratory virus, spreads through contact with airborne droplets from an infected person. Symptoms such as a cough, runny nose, eye redness, fever and spotty red rash, may take weeks to develop. Approximately one in five measles cases becomes serious enough to require hospitalization, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Infection can cause serious complications including brain swelling, blindness or death.
Six hospitalizations have transpired over the course of the outbreak: five in Lea County and one in Doña Ana county, which reported its first case last week. The case may have exposed other people to measles in a Las Cruces daycare and hospital waiting rooms in early April, according to health officials.
NMDOH requests that anyone exposed or showing symptoms call the state’s measles helpline at 1-833-796-8773 for further vaccine information or measles testing available in  English or Spanish.
The department and hospitals are urging any exposed patients to contact doctor’s offices or emergency rooms before coming in.
In the early days of the measles outbreak, Nor-Lea Hospital in Lea County instituted procedures to prevent measles spread in the hospital, including requiring patients to mask up if experiencing symptoms or any exposures, minimizing spread and continuously disinfecting shared spaces.
Troy Clark, the CEO for the New Mexico Hospital Association, praised Nor-Lea for sharing the protocol with other hospitals, though he couldn’t say how many had adopted the same protocols.
“I think the collective efforts of our hospitals across the state provide high-quality care to protect our communities, keep them safe and healthy,” Clark told Source NM. “The means of collaboration one with another to learn from others’ experiences and to provide best practices, is intact, much like it was through the coronavirus pandemic.”
Amanda Schoenberg, a spokesperson for New Mexico Presbyterian Healthcare Services, which has nine hospitals across the state, said the hospitals were following guidance from state officials in a written statement.
“At Presbyterian, we follow guidance from the New Mexico Department of Health regarding highly contagious diseases and ask that any patients who suspect they may have measles contact their health care provider before visiting a clinic or hospital setting,” Schoenberg  wrote, “If a patient arrives at a facility and measles is suspected, they would be asked to mask and be placed in an isolated area. Vaccines are highly effective in protecting against measles and we encourage community members to access MMR vaccines if they have not yet been vaccinated”

Kim Reynolds signed Senate File 619 into law Tuesday, the bill providing funds for the state’s recovery efforts for 2024 floods and tornadoes as well as making changes to Iowa’s response system for future disasters.
The bill provides $13.6 million from the Iowa Economic Emergency Fund retroactively for fiscal year 2025 for response efforts to severe flooding and tornadoes. Reynolds said in a statement the bill will help Iowans and communities recovering from the major disasters in the past year that impacted more than 5,000 homes across the state.
“The tenacity of Iowans has been tested over the past year,” Reynolds said in a statement. “Our state faced devastating natural disasters in the spring of 2024—strong tornadoes and widespread flooding affected tens of thousands of Iowa families. To put it in perspective, our state was granted three Presidential disaster declarations in just two months. During this time of recovery, our relief programs have proven vital for Iowa families and communities to regain their footing and restart their lives.”

The legislation, introduced by the governor, was highlighted as one of her top priorities for the 2025 legislative session during her Condition of the State address in January.
A majority of funding from the bill, $11.6 million, goes to the Disaster Recovery Housing Assistance Program launched by the state in July. The other $2 million goes to the Nuisance Property and Abandoned Building Fund, which helps tear down buildings that damaged beyond repair by natural disasters. The law also will extend tax exclusions for developers building new housing in areas impacted by recent natural disasters.
The measure includes other components that Reynolds and lawmakers have said will help Iowa better respond to future natural disasters, including allowing the Iowa Department of Management to access 10% of the state’s Economic Emergency Fund each fiscal year for disaster recovery efforts when the governor issues a disaster proclamation.
The legislation also establishes the Natural Hazard Mitigation Financing program, a new loan program through the Iowa Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management and the Iowa Finance Authority, to provide funding for “ongoing risk mitigation” projects that can help Iowa communities reduce damage in future severe weather events.
There was some pushback in subcommittee meetings on a component of the bill requiring appraisers, independent adjusters and umpires to be licensed to assess property damages. Advocates representing parties involved in the industry said most states do not have licensure in this field and could lead to fewer independent adjusters and umpires — the professionals who serve as a neutral party assessing damages and property value during insurance claim processes — practicing in Iowa. The measure was not changed by lawmakers.
The law is effective immediately.

Tax breaks could soon be coming to Montanans, but not in the form of property tax relief — at least not yet. Instead, the Montana Legislature on Friday passed a bill cutting income taxes and increasing the earned income tax credit, sending the measure to the governor’s desk. 
House Bill 337, sponsored by Speaker of the House Rep. Brandon Ler, R-Savage, ended up as a compromise between the governor’s preferred plan for the largest tax cut in state history and a middle-class tax cut preferred by a more conservative wing of the GOP and some Democrats.
Under current Montana income tax laws, there are two tax brackets for regular income — a 4.7% bracket and a 5.9% bracket — which splits at $21,100 for single filers and $42,200 for joint filers. 
The new system would increase the threshold for the lower tax rate during the next two tax years so that single filers would pay the 4.7% rate on their first $47,500 in 2026, and $65,000 in 2027. For joint filers, they would pay 4.7% on their first $95,000 of income in 2026 and on the first $130,000 in 2027. 
Above those thresholds, taxpayers would pay a top tax rate of 5.65% in 2026 and 5.4% in 2027.
The increased income threshold would also apply to long-term capital gains income, which is taxed at 3.1% and 4% rates. 
“Montanans work hard for their money, and HB 337, ensures they keep more of it—now and in the future. HB 337 delivers real, meaningful income tax relief for working families across our state,” Ler said in a press release following the Senate vote. 
The bill also increases the Earned Income Tax Credit from 10% of the federal EITC to 20%. 
The Senate passed the bill without any amendments from the upper chamber on Friday to expedite its path to the governor’s desk. All Senate Republicans supported the bill, while all Democrats opposed it due to the cost of lowering the top tax rate. 
Sen. Dave Fern, D-Whitefish, said he wants to see taxes as low as possible. However, while he was campaigning for office, he said he didn’t hear anyone asking for income tax cuts. 
With property tax relief still left to be hammered out by the Legislature — which Fern said he was expecting to be a costly endeavor — spending more money on income tax cuts is not the direction he wants the chambers to take. 
According to the bill’s fiscal note, the income tax breaks will decrease the state’s general fund collections by $20 million during the 2026 fiscal year; $190 million during 2027 and increasing to $277 million by 2029.
“$277 million is a little bit too much,” Fern said. “I’m going to oppose this bill because I think that it’s well meaning, but it’s just too expensive.” 
The compromise bill costs roughly $40 million per year less than the governor’s preferred plan starting in 2027. 
Gov. Greg Gianforte has long touted his plan to bring about the largest income tax cut in state history by cutting the top income rate — which most Montanans are subject to — by a full percentage point over the biennium, and pairing that with an increase of the EITC to 15% to target lower-income residents. 
However, his plan met resistance in the Legislature. 
A plan backed by Senate President Matt Regier, R-Kalispell, and more conservative Republicans in the Senate, would have kept the top rate in place, but greatly expand the threshold where the top rate would kick in — by more than twice what Ler’s bill did. 
Another bill, introduced by Democrats, would have created an income-based tax credit targeting exclusively the lower and middle-income taxpayers. 
Both bills were tabled in the House Taxation Committee earlier this month. 
Sen. Greg Hertz, chairman of the Senate Taxation Committee, previously criticized the governor’s plan because it “started at the top.” But he called HB 337, as a compromise, “a good bill for everyone.” 
The final income tax package seems to appease all factions in the government — by reducing the top rate and increasing the EITC as the governor wanted, while targeting middle-class Montanans, as was the target of Democrats and conservative Republicans. 
But the governor, who has spoken extensively about the desire to deliver a larger tax cut for Montanans, still has the final say.   
“I still believe our income tax cut is the most conservative proposal before the Legislature, reducing the tax that most Montanans pay, benefiting Montanans at every single income level,” Gianforte said at a press conference last Thursday, before HB 337 had passed the Senate. “While I know there’s a lot of different ideas out there, we must keep this principle at the top of our minds. The money belongs to the people of Montana and not the government.”
The governor’s office did not respond to questions about whether Gianforte supports the compromise bill or will sign it.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/incometaxpressconference-1024x746.jpg,,,2025-04-22 18:09:33.590956

Mike Harris (R-Waterford) and Rep. Alabas Farhat (D-Dearborn). Michigan House photo.In a nearly unanimous vote, Michigan lawmakers in the state House passed a $115 million annual public safety fund aimed to decrease violent crime in communities.
One of the sponsors for the bills to implement a Public Safety and Violence Prevention Fund to fund local law enforcement agencies and community violence intervention groups around the state, Rep. Alabas Farhat (D-Dearborn) told media after the 104-4 vote on HBs 4260 and 4261 that preventing crime looks a lot different today than it did 30 years ago.
In having conversations with his partner in the effort to secure the fund, co-sponsor Rep. Mike Harris (R-Waterford), Farhat said it’s clear that the expectations and public demand for law enforcement to work in prevention, not just focusing on enforcement of law has made policing more and more expensive.

“Go visit these departments. You will not see desk officers like you used to anymore. You’re seeing everybody out on patrol. You’re seeing people walking in neighborhoods… you’re also seeing a demand for officers to do more than just drive a car around and pull somebody over for speeding. You’re seeing investigative units, forensics units, that are doing online human trafficking cases… really sophisticated, really expensive stuff,” Farhat said. “There’s some cruel people out there in this world that we have to get to and we have to prevent them from preying on, whether it’s young children or our seniors, and that’s expensive.”
Harris and Farhat have been urging their colleagues in Michigan’s partisanly split legislature to put people over politics and approve the Public Safety and Violence Prevention Fund which law enforcement leaders from around the state have said will allow them to hire more staff and strengthen gun violence prevention programs like some in Detroit which have reduced violent crime in some neighborhoods by up to 70%, according to the city.

Laura Kelly, Sen. Bill Clifford and KDHE's chief medical officer ask southwest Kansas residents to get measles vaccinations to counter spread of virus.","Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly joined Republican Sen. Bill Clifford of Garden City to urge residents of southwest Kansas, especially children, to be vaccinated for measles amid spread of the virus to eight counties. The Kansas Department of Health and Environment has confirmed 37 cases of measles, but the total could be higher. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Gov. Laura Kelly said three-dozen confirmed cases of measles in southwest Kansas necessitated a plea Tuesday for children and adults to get vaccinated and for people with symptoms to avoid spreading the virus by staying away from public places.
The Kansas Department of Health and Environment announced March 13 the first confirmed case of measles in the state since 2008. The number of confirmed cases climbed to 37 within a cluster of eight counties, state officials said, but the expectation was the number of higher because not everyone who contracted measles visited a health department, clinic or hospital.
“This measles outbreak is serious,” Kelly said during a news conference in Garden City. “It reminds us that the health of our communities, and especially of our children, depends on all of us to recognize our collective responsibility to each other.”
She recalled that during her youth it wasn’t uncommon for children to get measles. Some became quite ill and were hospitalized, suffered permanent health complications or died, she said. Widespread acceptance of the measles, mumps and rubella or MMR vaccine for children and adults served the public good by providing immunity in communities, she said.
Vaccine hesitancy, a phenomenon driven by misinformation, undercut adherence to important public health recommendations, the governor said.
“Measles spreads to our classrooms, our churches, our recreation centers and our grocery stores,” Kelly said. “It lingers in the air and it causes real harm. Yet, no parent wants their child in the hospital over something we know how to prevent.”
She said the vaccine was 93% effective in preventing measles with one dose and 97% effective with the recommended second dose. In some regions of the state, the governor said, vaccination rates have fallen below 90%.
Symptoms of measles typically began with a high fever, cough, runny nose as well as red, watery eyes. Three to five days after symptoms began, a skin rash could develop starting on the face and spreading to the neck, trunk, arms and legs.
 
The doctors
Physician Dereck Totten, who serves as chief medical officer for the Kansas Department of Health and Environment, said the outbreak expanded primarily among unvaccinated individuals. He said 37 confirmed cases were confined to Finney County and seven other counties in southwest Kansas. Thirty confirmed cases involved unvaccinated patients, he said.
“The vaccine is absolutely our bests defense against this outbreak,” Totten said. “Measles is an extremely contagious disease, and it spreads very rapidly.”
Totten said the virus could be spread when an infected person coughed, sneezed or talked. When a person with measles exposed others, the doctor said, nine of 10 people without immunity could be expected to catch the virus. Immunity also could be acquired by having measles in the past, he said.
He recommended children typically get the first vaccination at 12 months to 15 months of age and the second dose at 4 years to 6 years of age.
However, he said KDHE was recommending an early extra dose at 6 months of age for babies in the eight affected counties of Finney, Ford, Grant, Gray, Haskell, Kiowa, Morton and Stevens. KDHE extended this recommendation to the 14 counties bordering the eight-county cluster tied to the measles outbreak.
“I can’t stress enough how important it is to receive that MMR vaccine to protect yourself, your family and loved ones and those in your community against this outbreak,” Totten said.
Sen. Bill Clifford, a Garden City Republican and ophthalmologist, said the official total of measles in Kansas underestimated the threat. He urged children and adults not yet vaccinated for measles to get MMR shots.
“I view this as the tip of the iceberg,” he said. “We do report 37 cases, but if you talk to anyone in health care there are several people sitting at home with red spots, while one person who’s sick is coming to the emergency room. Realize that it’s out there. It is very contagious. If you’re not vaccinated, you ought to be.”
Clifford said Kansans should model their appreciation of public health through the eyes of Samuel Crumbine, a physician who practiced in Garden City. Crumbine sought to restrain communicable diseases such as tuberculosis by improving hygiene, ending the practice of sharing towels in restrooms and by deterring reliance on common drinking cups.
“Many haven’t heard of him,” Clifford said. “He’s viewed as the father of public health.”
 
Misinformation
The governor attributed reemergence of measles in Kansas to spread of misinformation that convinced some people to avoid vaccines. The anti-vaccination movement undermined the ability of communities to fight off infectious disease, she said.
Organizations opposed to public vaccination campaigns convinced Kansas legislators to support laws exempting people from COVID-19 vaccines. On April 11, the Legislature voted to send the governor a bill that included a religious exemption for vaccination mandates. House Bill 2045 was formally presented to the governor April 18, and she could veto it without consequence because the House and Senate adjourned for the year.
“In recent years,” Kelly said, “the Legislature has chipped away at the public health tools communities rely on. They have made it harder for schools and local health departments to act quickly when outbreaks occur. We need those tools back. But even without them, we’re not powerless.”
The governor said the first town in the United States to line up in 1955 for the polio vaccine was Protection, Kansas.
“Those families trusted science,” Kelly said. “They trusted one another. And, they took action to keep their children and their neighbors safe. They didn’t ask who the president was or who got credit. They just wanted to protect their kids in their community. We need that same kind of response now.”
She said mothers, fathers, grandparents and other caregivers might have questions about the measles vaccine. Caution was a normal instinct, she said.
“You do not have to do this alone. Talk to your doctor. Ask questions. Get the facts and then make a plan,” the governor said. “This is not political. It is not about ideology. It is about protecting the kids at your kitchen table in your community.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/P1142520-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-22 18:09:33.590956

Rep. Heather Matson, D-Ankeny, expressed concerns that language in the amended bill requiring the UI to report to the General Assembly why certain students weren’t accepted is a legislative overreach, but added she understands how “reasonable people can have disagreements on this policy.”

Rep. Ann Meyer, R-Fort Dodge, said language in the bill is based on similar legislation in Minnesota, Georgia, Texas and South Dakota.
“The public institution should be required to provide public information regarding policies,” Meyer said. “This is a part of a package of growing our own training physicians and retaining them.”
National Guard scholarships
House File 117, which would establish a professional qualification scholarship program for members of the National Guard, also awaits Reynolds’ signature after receiving unanimous votes in the House and Senate.
Sen. Sandy Salmon, R-Janesville, said during closing remarks on the bill more and more prospective National Guard members are seeking certifications rather than four-year degrees in areas like technology and health care, and the new program will give the Guard a new tool for recruitment.
“Offering this program will help our National Guard to be able to better recruit individuals and assist them with an education that will help meet the needs of the Guard as well as the desires of the service members,” Salmon said.
Accommodations for pregnant students
Senate File 288 would require state universities and community colleges to provide reasonable accommodations for pregnant students or those who have recently given birth, including allowing students to reschedule tests and assignments as well as take a leave of absence without penalty.
Pregnant students and new parents would also be allowed extra time to complete tests and degree programs if needed, according to the legislation.
An amendment introduced by Rep. Tracy Ehlert, D-Cedar Rapids, to include students with chronic illnesses and other qualifications to the bill failed to pass. She said the bill without the amendment was a good step in recognizing the diversity of Iowa university students, but it doesn’t go far enough.
“Let’s ensure that all students are successful during … their college career,” Ehlert said.
Floor manager Rep. Bob Henderson, R-Sioux City, also introduced an amendment defining qualifying students as “biologically female” and removing language setting a 12-month timeframe for some of the listed accommodations and replacing it with a reasonable amount of time decided upon by the student and institution.
The amendment passed and the legislation was sent back to the Senate with a unanimous vote.
“We have the opportunity to pass a bill here that provides an opportunity for everybody, both the institution for academic integrity, as well as obviously, for students who are pregnant or with children,” Henderson said.
Data reporting and employee contracts
House File 890 would shift program-level data reporting by community colleges to the Iowa Department of Education and have the Iowa Department of Administrative Services and Department of Education develop an annual compensation schedule and set employee benefits for all employees of the Iowa Educational Services for the Blind and Visually Impaired and Iowa School for the Deaf.
An amendment introduced by floor manager Sen. Jeff Taylor and adopted by the Senate clarified the applicability of community college instructor contract terms, Taylor said. The amendment and legislation passed unanimously and the bill returns to the House for consideration of the Senate amendment.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-22 21:34:55+00:00,CT Mirror,New England power demand fell to an all-time low on Easter,John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/22/ne-iso-easter-new-england-power-demand/,Officials say the proliferation of energy-efficient devices and rooftop solar panels is driving down the demand on the electric grid.,"Demand on New England’s power grid fell to an all-time low on Sunday afternoon as sunny skies and mild temperatures zapped residents’ need for electricity.
According to preliminary data from the region’s grid operator, ISO New England, power system demand across the six-state region fell to 5,318 megawatts between roughly 1 and 2 p.m. as temperatures across much of the area reached into the 60s.
That beat the region’s previous record low of 6,596 megawatts, which was set last April.  
It’s not uncommon for demand on the grid to wane during the spring and fall — often referred to as the “shoulder” months — when milder temperatures lessen the need for energy-intensive heating and cooling. Grid operators attributed Sunday’s record to favorable weather as well as the Easter holiday
“This is the fourth year that we’ve seen a record low, but the difference between last year’s record low and this one was a pretty good jump,” said Mary Cate Colapietro, a spokeswoman for ISO New England. 
By contrast, demand on the the grid reached its all-time high on Aug. 2, 2006 with 28,130 megawatts of power needed.
The proliferation of energy-efficient technologies and rooftop solar panels is also helping to drive down the need to pull electricity off the grid.
On Sunday afternoon, for example, grid operators estimated that behind-the-meter solar panels generated a peak of roughly 6,600 megawatts of electricity — more power than the entire system was drawing from power plants.
As the sun set that evening and solar panels stopped producing electricity, the demand for power in New England more than doubled, reaching of peak of around 11,800 megawatts.
“Such days are not disruptive from a grid operations perspective,” ISO New England said in a statement Tuesday, adding that the grid’s “sophisticated modeling and forecasting methods allow system operators to anticipate and prepare for low demand levels.” 
Lower demand on the grid also allows the owners of larger power plants to relax production and perform maintenance, with renewable sources available to pick up the slack. 
In March, for the first time, renewable sources of electricity surpassed fossil fuels to supply more than half of the U.S.’ electricity demands, according to the energy think tank Ember.
On Sunday, power production from nuclear, hydroelectric and other renewable sources in New England briefly accounted for more than two-thirds of the region’s power, supplanting natural gas. 
Despite the strides of the last several years in reducing power demand, ISO New England predicts that electricity use across the region will increase more than 17% by 2033, driven by the electrification of cars and home heating systems, along with the growth of data centers and artificial intelligence projects.
Peak demand during the winter and summer months is also expected to grow over the next decade, according to operators.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Millstone-from-The-Day.jpg,,,2025-04-22 18:09:33.590956

(Photo: John Partipilo)More than a dozen current and former lawmakers could be called to testify in the corruption trial of former Tennessee House Speaker Glen Casada, who rejected a plea deal in the case, and ex-chief of staff Cade Cothren, federal prosecutors revealed at Tuesday’s trial opening. 
Current House Speaker Cameron Sexton of Crossville tops the list of potential witnesses, along with House Republican Whip Johnny Garrett of Goodlettsville. 
Sexton confirmed early in the investigation that he has been cooperating with prosecutors from the U.S. Attorney’s office. In March, the defense team alleged the government was withholding information about the identity of people who secretly gathered information and that Sexton wore a wire to record conversations between him, Casada and Cothren.
Other House Republicans on the list of witnesses who could be called are Reps. Justin Lafferty of Knoxville, Jay Reedy of Erin, Jason Zachary of Knoxville, Dennis Powers of LaFollette, Scott Cepicky of Culleoka, Tim Rudd and Charlie Baum of Murfreesboro and Esther Helton-Haynes of East Ridge.

Casada and Cothren were indicted in August 2022 on 20 counts of conspiracy, fraud, money laundering, bribery and kickbacks after funneling contracts for political consulting services for House members to a company founded by Cothren called Phoenix Solutions. 
Former Chattanooga Rep. Robin Smith, whose home and office were raided by the FBI in 2021 — along with those of Casada and several other lawmakers — pleaded guilty to charges in the case and is expected to testify after agreeing to cooperate with federal prosecutors.
 Casada turned down plea deal
Most of Tuesday was devoted to jury selection, but U.S. District Court Judge Eli Richardson asked Casada about his understanding of a plea deal offering from the U.S. Attorney’s office. 
“Did (Casada’s attorneys) communicate they received a plea offer from the government?” Richardson asked Casada. 
The former House speaker said he was aware of the deal offering and declined to accept it. No mention was made of a similar plea offer to Cothren.
Prosecutors say Casada and former Rep. Smith knew Cothren was operating the firm under the alias “Matthew Phoenix” but withheld that information from state lawmakers and – in return for kickbacks – directed them to enlist the bogus firm to provide direct mail services. 
Cothren resigned from Casada’s office following 2019 media reports of his involvement in a racist and sexist texting scandal. Casada later stepped down as House Speaker — his eight months in the position marked the shortest tenure for a Tennessee Speaker of the House — after a ‘no confidence’ vote from members of the House Republican Caucus. 
Richardson clarified with both sets of lawyers the need to conceal Cothren’s identity stemmed from the scandal, which enveloped Casada’s speakership and led to his resignation along with complaints about heavy-handed management.

“The witnesses wouldn’t have done business if they’d known” Cothren was behind the firm, said Taylor Phillips, assistant U.S. attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee.
“What (House members) cared about was that it was Cade Cothren who was the subject of this enormous scandal,” Phillips said.
Cynthia Sherwood, attorney for Cothren, said Casada and Smith were the driving forces behind the firm’s ability to secure business from elected officials. 
“None of these witnesses did business with Phoenix Solutions,” Sherwood said. “They hired Robin Smith, they hired Glen Casada because they were friends.”
Opening arguments in the case are expected to begin Wednesday after jury selection is concluded.

Gretchen Whitmer speaks at a gun safety rally at the state Capitol Building on April 22, 2025 | Photo: Anna Liz NicholsThoughts and prayers didn’t save lives in Michigan, but a slate of gun safety measures that became law after the state suffered two mass shootings will continue to reduce gun violence, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer told a crowd of gun violence prevention advocates and survivors at a rally at the Capitol in Lansing Tuesday.
The pain of the 2021 shooting at Oxford High School, where four students were killed, and the 2023 shooting at Michigan State University, where three students were killed, will not soon be forgotten, Whitmer said, especially as other states and schools continue to experience the same tragic sting. 
After taking a moment of silence for the individuals wounded and killed last week in a shooting at Florida State University, Whitmer thanked the advocates present, some of whom are survivors of Oxford and MSU, for being the driving force behind Michigan implementing sweeping gun safety reforms that went into action in February of last year.

Those measures included requirements to lock up unattended firearms when a minor could reasonably access it, the implementation of universal background checks for all gun sales in Michigan, extending temporary bans on firearm possession for those convicted of domestic violence offenses and creating “red flag” laws to allow judges to issue extreme risk protection orders, or ERPOs, to temporarily remove firearms from the possession of individuals who pose a threat to themselves or others.
“This movement was powered by people, by students, by those of us who are fed up and tired of watching gun violence ravage our communities and our homes and our school districts and our neighborhoods. We owe it to victims, survivors, parents, teachers and students to end this epidemic,” Whitmer said.

At least 31 individuals who had an ERPO issued against them were charged with criminal offenses within 30 days of the entry for the ERPO, with the most common offense they were charged with being domestic violence.
Researchers have long called attention to the lethal combination access to firearms and domestic violence make, with several medical experts and researchers asserting that domestic violence victims are five times more likely to be killed by their abuser if there is a gun accessible to them.
And as many domestic violence service providers in Michigan have witnessed intimate partner violence become more violent and more lethal since the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a particular focus at the rally Tuesday on the impact of gun violence in domestic violence.
A survivor of domestic violence, Faith Brown, said she gathered up the courage to leave her husband who had been abusing her and her four children and served him with divorce papers and was looking forward to getting her life back. But on September 21, 2016 she came home to find her husband waiting for her with a gun.
He killed Brown’s four children, Chadney, 19; Kara, 17; Koi, 5, and Kaleigh, 4 and then shot her, leaving her for dead.

Eight years later and Brown is now an advocate for other women who have experienced intimate partner violence, which so often involves gun violence, crediting First Step Domestic & Sexual Violence Services in Wayne County for providing counseling and support as she fought to continue with her life.
“At some point, I decided that I needed to live again. It was what my children would have wanted,” Brown said. “Nothing can bring back my children, but I can do everything in my power to make sure no other woman, no other family, has to go through what I did, no one else should have to lose what I lost.”
As the Michigan Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, established through an executive order by Whitmer, released recommendations Tuesday to decrease firearm-related deaths and injuries, Whitmer told the crowd she looks forward to reviewing the policies and pursuing elected leaders and advocates in implementing more gun safety policies in Michigan.
“Every shooting, every life lost, every community grieving demands not just our attention and thoughts and prayers, but our action,” Whitmer said. “I’m ready to work with you and anyone who wants to protect public safety, reduce gun violence, because this is about partnership, not partisanship.”

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — A House bill inspired by frustrations with state Superintendent Ryan Walters’ leadership of the Oklahoma State Board of Education now is at risk of failing as it approaches a crucial deadline without yet passing through its assigned Senate committee.
The Senate Education Committee met Tuesday for the final time before a Thursday deadline to advance House bills to the full Senate. The committee did so without considering House Bill 1491, which would allow members of school boards, including the state Board of Education, to place topics on their meeting agendas by submitting a written request.
The committee’s leader, Sen. Adam Pugh, R-Edmond, was critical of the bill, saying it would treat the state Board of Education differently from all other statewide boards and commissions. Pugh, as chairperson, decides which bills the committee will consider for a vote.
“I want to treat that state board like we would any other government agency,” Pugh said after Tuesday’s meeting. “And so, we have to ensure a fairly applied law, and I’m not sure that that’s what that bill achieved.”

House lawmakers drafted the bill after some of the governor’s recent appointees to the state Board of Education said they were frustrated that only Walters controlled what agenda items the board could discuss during its meetings. 
The state superintendent, who is elected, leads the board and the Oklahoma State Department of Education, both of which oversee the state’s public schools system.
Gov. Kevin Stitt and top Republican leaders in the House and Senate endorsed the measure, and it passed a vote by the full House with overwhelming bipartisan support. At the time the bill was filed, Stitt said one member shouldn’t have unilateral control over the whole board.
The Governor’s Office did not immediately return a request for comment Tuesday. 
House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, and Senate President Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton, R-Tuttle, declined to comment on the stalled bill. 
HB 1491 from Rep. Ronny Johns, R-Ada, would have allowed two members on the state board or any local school board with five or more positions to place an item on an upcoming meeting agenda with a written request. It would have taken only one member to request an agenda item on school boards with four or fewer members.
Current state law doesn’t outline any method for state Board of Education officials to have input on their meeting agendas. School boards that have an at-large board chair position, found in districts with at least 30,000 students, can add agenda items with a request from a majority of board members.
  Oklahoma State Board of Education member Chris Vandenhende, pictured Feb. 27, requested the board schedule a future meeting to consider suspending “all activity related to immigration. (Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)
State Board of Education member Chris Vandenhende proposed during a February meeting that the panel schedule a future vote to “suspend all activity related to immigration.” His request referred to a rule the board had approved the month before that would require schools to collect and report students’ immigration status.
But, Walters has the final say on what topics the board will discuss. An agenda for its March meeting didn’t include Vandenhende’s request or any reference to immigration. 
The board ultimately canceled its March meeting because the agenda was posted online 19 minutes after a legally required deadline.
Pugh said he is supportive of board members expressing dissent but questioned whether lawmakers had considered the possibility of “unintended consequences” and disruption from HB 1491.
“You could just be creating gridlock and chaos on that board, and that’s not healthy for the state either because they have a really important role to play,” Pugh said.

Bill Pluecker (I-Warren) said it's critical to test for PFAS, which have been linked to health concerns including cancer, liver damage, pregnancy complications, increased cholesterol levels and more. (Photo by Getty Images)The Legislature’s Health and Human Services Committee held a public hearing Tuesday afternoon for three bills seeking to better identify forever chemicals in private wells and address their presence in certain public water systems. 
“No family should be left in the dark about what’s in their water,” said Rep. Bill Pluecker (I-Warren), when introducing LD 500. 
Pluecker’s proposal would add perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, commonly called PFAS, to the list of contaminants the Department of Health and Human Services recommends testing for in private wells. Additionally, it seeks to use money from the department’s Health and Environmental Testing Laboratory account to provide free well water testing for low-income residents. 
A similar proposal died last year due to concerns over that proposal’s use of general funds to support the program, but Pluecker said he believed the department’s dedicated fund should be sufficient to avoid the need for other state dollars. 
More than half of Mainers get drinking water from private, residential wells, so Pluecker said it’s critical to test for PFAS, which have been linked to health concerns including cancer, liver damage, pregnancy complications, increased cholesterol levels and more.
Rep. Laurie Osher (D-Orono) also introduced a similar proposal to expand testing for PFAS substances in private drinking wells, which aren’t regulated under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act. 
Landlords are already required to test for arsenic in wells that provide drinking water and share the test results with tenants within 10 days of being notified of the results. LD 493 would build upon that by requiring landlords to also test the water for PFAS, lead, uranium and other potentially harmful contaminants. 
While the landlord would not be required to treat any contamination, they would have to disclose it to tenants and potential tenants within 10 days of receiving results. Similarly, the bill would require residential owners to disclose any water tests that indicate the presence of PFAS when selling the property. 
The version of this bill introduced last session died on the special appropriations table, where bills are chosen by the budget committee for funding, with a fiscal note of a little more than $100,000 per year. 
The health committee also heard a proposal from Rep. Daniel Shagoury (D-Hallowell) that targets forever chemicals in public water systems throughout the state. LD 1326 would establish maximum PFAS levels in the drinking water of certain public water systems that serve settings such as schools, factories, industrial parks or office buildings.
The Department of Health and Human Services is currently in the process of adopting rules that align with the National Primary Drinking Water Regulation announced by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in April 2024. Those new federal standards create enforceable limits for six PFAS in drinking water that can have adverse health effects. 
Shagoury acknowledged that the department is opposed to his bill for being duplicative, but he argued it would  underscore the Legislature’s belief that standards for PFAS in drinking water are important. 
The Maine Water Utilities Association also opposed the bill because it said Maine has adopted federal water standards rather than creating its own statute to make compliance with federal standards less burdensome. Changing that and adopting LD 1326 would create complexity and confusion for water systems, said Mike Cummons, who works for the Maine Water Company in Saco.

The bills (HB 7027 & 7029), sponsored by Panhandle Republican Michelle Salzman, are different in some respects to the Senate version that passed unanimously in that chamber two weeks ago — most significantly in that it puts a 15% excise tax on the sale of all such products.
Another difference with the Senate version is that it doesn’t ban consumption of Delta-8, the hemp-derived THC product that has grown in popularity since hemp was legalized in the United States through the 2018 U.S. farm bill.
The House bill would limit the amount of THC in derived products. Regarding hemp-infused drinks, beverages cannot contain more than 5 milligrams of THC hemp per 6-ounce contains. The bill limits “inhalables” (such as joints and vaping machines) and edibles to 5 milligrams per serving (an increase of 2.5 milligrams from last week’s version).
Another provision would prohibit anyone from receiving more than 100 milligrams of hemp-derived THC in a single 24-hour period.
The bill  would prohibit any individual from ingesting hemp consumable THC products within 1,000 feet of a public or private elementary, middle, or secondary school between 6 a.m. and midnight. A violator would be subjected to a $25 fine or 50 hours of community service.
Rep. Salzman amended her bill from last week in two key respects: It would now allow places like gas stations to sell hemp-infused THC drinks and it would not place any limitations on non-intoxicating CBD products.
Three-year attempt
This is the third year in a row in which lawmakers have spent considerable time and energy attempting to regulate intoxicating hemp-derived THC products, which have grown in popularity since the state legalized the product in 2019.
Regulations passed during last year’s session but were vetoed by Gov. Ron DeSantis after heavy lobbying by members of the hemp industry. As a way to show their appreciation, a number of hemp entrepreneurs sent funds to the Republican Party of Florida and other groups organized to oppose Amendment 3, the constitutional amendment that, if passed, would have legalized recreational cannabis for all adults 21 and over.
For whatever reason, many of those same hemp entrepreneurs who regularly testified in opposition to those proposals filed in the 2023 and 2024 legislative sessions have been absent from the public debate as the bills have moved through their respective chambers this spring. But that détente ended on Tuesday, as people who work in the hemp industry testified before the House Commerce Committee that the proposal would severely affect their bottom lines.
JJ Coombs, who operates three hemp businesses based out of Fort Lauderdale, said a problem with the House legislation is that  it would put the same limits on the amount of THC in both edibles and inhalables.
“They are completely different products,’ he said. “Edibles are consumed in a single serving while inhalabales are consumed over a period of time, often going weeks without having to purchase another device.”
Patrick Shatzer of Sunmed/Your CBD Store summarized the letter accompanying DeSantis’ veto; the governor wrote that that bill would “impose debilitating regulatory burdens on small businesses and almost certainly fail to achieve its purposes.”
“The intent is to stop intoxicating [elements] and to stop bad actors,” Shatzer said. “These laws are not going to allow the good actors to operate.”
Lobbyists for alcohol interests expressed disappointment that the legislation does not allow for individuals to drink hemp-infused THC beverages at the establishment where they buy such products.  Scott Difford, with Delta Beverages, said his products are sold in more than 570 restaurants and bars in Florida, and he asked Salzman to amend the bill to allow for on-premise consumption by adults 21 and over.
Rep. Salzman insisted that provision was important, citing the absence of any mechanism to test for intoxication by such products.
Second Amendment angle
A couple of hemp business officials tried a new argument —that it’s limitations on THC in hemp-infused products would compel military veterans to sign up as a medical marijuana patient in Florida.
That, they said, would violate their Second Amendment rights because federal law classifies marijuana as a Schedule I controlled substance, causing complications for medical marijuana patients who want to own firearms. (Former Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried lost a federal lawsuit in 2022 challenging federal prohibitions on medical-marijuana patients buying and possessing guns).
J.J. McCormick, chairman of American Healthy Alternatives Association, described a conservation he had with a military veteran who uses hemp-derived THC products.
“He said as someone who held clearances and often had to be nimble in their employment, both stateside and overseas, he would never get a medical marijuana license because he would be forced to lie and perjure himself on background checks to obtain firearms and sign contracts,” he said.
“This is a one-two punch that displaces thousands of Florida families,” added Shai Ortiz, CEO of Siesta G, based in eastern Hillsborough County. “This stifles innovation. This stifles Florida-first values.”
The regulations passed unanimously in committee, however, and now go to the floor for a vote — where they will have to be reconciled with the Senate version to get to DeSantis desk this year.
“This is a common-sense bill built on collaboration,” Salzman said, resulting in a measure that is unified around a single goal: “protecting Floridians while preserving opportunities.”

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Rather than punting the responsibility to the governor, a bill moving through the legislative process would require the Legislature to proactively approve changes to state agencies’ rules. 
Oklahoma’s current administrative rules process requires all submitted rules to be reviewed by the Legislature, but if lawmakers take no action, they are sent to the governor. If the governor also declines to act, the rules automatically go into effect.
Senate Bill 995, authored by Rep. Gerrid Kendrix, R-Altus, would require the Legislature to approve all rules through a joint resolution. Any that are not explicitly approved would be considered disapproved. 
Proactive approval used to be required for the Legislature, Kendrix said, but the process was changed over a decade ago. 
Usually a dry topic, administrative rules have the force of law and are designed to build upon the statutes legislators create. 
“Myself, as an elected legislator, if I run legislation and I can’t get it taken up on the floor, what happens to it? It dies,” he said. “But that’s not what happens with the rules. So we have granted a little more authority to unelected bureaucrats, agency directors. I don’t want to be mean, but we’ve allowed that more authority to them than to the elected legislator.”
The measure is an attempt to add more light and transparency to the process and to involve more people in conversations, he said. 
Last year, lawmakers faced criticism for refusing to vote on a controversial set of 20 rules proposed by the Oklahoma State Department of Education. One of the more controversial rules tied a school’s state test scores to its accreditation. Lawmakers sent the rules to Gov. Kevin Stitt, who approved them all. 
Kendrix, who chairs the House Administrative Rules Committee, said the full Legislature hasn’t taken action on administrative rules since he was elected in 2020. He said this year there are over 5,000 pages of rule packets riddled with mistakes. 
“I’m trying to bring transparency to it, which in turn creates accountability,” Kendrix said. “It creates more structure and attention to the rules. I mean, we have rules coming in that have incomplete sentences, that have words that are misspelled, and being a (certified public accountant), I’m a detailed guy. And so if we have things like that that are happening, what else is happening?”
SB995 is a “piece of the puzzle” to bring more transparency since there has been increased interest from Republicans and Democrats on the issue in recent years, he said.
The legislation has had strong bipartisan support, he said. The bill unanimously cleared the state Senate and a House committee. It awaits a hearing before the full House.
Kendrix and Sen. Micheal Bergstrom, R-Adair, the Senate author, held an interim study in October to explore the idea for the measure. 
As a House committee made changes to the bill, the Senate will reconsider the amended version if it passes off the House floor.

Jared Polis will veto the policy, arguing that it erodes First Amendment rights to freedom of speech.
Senate Bill 25-86 passed both chambers of the Legislature with a widely bipartisan vote. But in a statement last week, Polis said he has concerns over the bill’s impact on “freedom, innovation, and privacy.” His office of information technology testified against the bill as it went through the legislative process.
The bill was sent to his office on April 14, and he has until Thursday to sign or veto it. If it is vetoed, the Legislature would have time to vote on an override, which would require two-thirds of the body in support.

Opponents of the bill primarily worry about having private companies, such as Meta and X, act as law enforcement over speech on the platforms.
“While we share the intent of keeping kids safe online, the reality is that when we begin to consciously erode the First Amendment rights of some, we start to erode the rights of all,” said Anaya Robinson, a policy strategist at ACLU Colorado, during a Tuesday press conference. The comments come after the bill’s sponsors and supporters held their own press conference to urge Polis’ signature.
Robinson referenced the 2017 U.S. Supreme Court case Packingham v. North Carolina, a decision that determined a North Carolina law banning registered sex offenders from accessing some social media sites was unconstitutional. A regulation on speech, justices decided, needs to be narrowly tailored and serve a significant government interest.










This bill actually gives tech companies more power and makes them an extension of law enforcement.


– Hazel Gibson, political director at ProgressNow Colorado


The Colorado bill concerns social media users who attempt to sell guns, drugs or sex traffic minors on the platform. Companies would be required to determine within 10 days of notification if the user violated their policy on the topic, and kick them off the platform within 24 hours if they decided a violation occurred. Additionally, companies would need to comply with search warrants from law enforcement within three days.
Sponsors and backers of the bill say it reflects the growing reality of how minors and young people access drugs and firearms today, as well as the danger of sexual exploitation on social media platforms.
Hazel Gibson, the political director at ProgressNow Colorado, a left-leaning advocacy organization, said the bill is an example of government overreach into a private company by mandating that they police speech.
“This bill actually gives tech companies more power and makes them an extension of law enforcement. I don’t think giving them more power is the solution to those problems,” she said. “We know that kids of color are already over-policed in real life, and now we’re expanding that into the digital world.”
Gibson and Robinson said they worry about the ripple effect of the bill to embolden other states to pass similar laws.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-22 20:56:45+00:00,CT Mirror,"Big demand for this CT ag grant, but no money for it next year",Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/22/ct-earth-day-lamont-farm-tour/,Gov. Ned Lamont toured a farm to celebrate Earth Day and a grant program that illustrated the reach and limits of spending cap constraints.,"The rows of hanging flower baskets stretched towards the back of an automated Kurtz Farms greenhouse in Cheshire that seemed to have no end. Beneath them sat colorful flats of impatiens, pansies, petunias and marigolds.
Watering booms pass over the flats, Bluetooth sensors directing how long a drink they require. Above, the baskets move on an automated line, briefly pausing at a device that weighs and waters them by need.
Gov. Ned Lamont toured the farm Tuesday to celebrate Earth Day and a one-shot Climate Smart Ag and Forestry grant program that illustrated the reach — and limits — of a state government constrained by spending caps.
With $7 million in available in carry-forward dollars that are outside the spending cap — money unspent in one fiscal year and carried over to the next — the state Department of Agriculture quickly fashioned a grant program aimed at helping the Connecticut farming industry become more sustainable.
“We’ve got over 5,000 farms in the state of Connecticut, 370,000 acres of land being worked, 30,000-plus employees that all generate $4 billion to the state’s economy,” said Bryan Hurlburt, the state commissioner of agriculture. “The greenhouse industry is the largest sector of Connecticut’s agricultural economy.”
The Climate Smart grants went directly to some recipients. Others went to organizations like the Connecticut Greenhouse Growers Association, which evaluated applications and made awards. The greenhouse growers had at least $1.7 million to award.
It’s a one-shot program. No funding for another round of grant is in the budget Lamont  proposed in February or the revisions made Tuesday by the legislature’s Appropriations Committee.
Hurlburt noted that demand far outstripped the available dollars: About 70 applicants made proposals totaling $55 million, nearly eight times the appropriated dollars.
“Connecticut farmers want to participate in a climate-smart future. They want to be able to implement this technology,” he said. “They want to be able to make these investments. But it’s hard in a low-margin industry to be able to find the available capital to put in place these pieces of equipment or these investments.”
In most cases, the state grants leveraged investments from the farms, he said.
A $257,000 grant enabled Kurtz Farms to accelerate modernization, said Earl “E.J.” Kurtz, the third generation of siblings and cousins operating a wholesale nursery business founded in 1941 by their grandparents, Earl and Ruth Kurtz. The family grows plants in 25 acres of covered greenhouses.
Cheshire long has been a center of growing bedding plants, supplying retail nurseries across Connecticut, New York, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and beyond. Kurtz farms has a catalog offering 10,000 varieties, including vegetables and tropical plants in a year-round operation.
Kurtz said the family already had invested in automation that watered plants on timers and opened greenhouse louvers, allowing greater circulation based on inputs from an on-site weather station that measurers sunlight, temperature and humidity. The grant allowed the installation of a computerized system that precisely measures and applies water, fertilization and fungicides.
He led Lamont on a tour of a greenhouse where 26,000 hanging flower baskets were growing, watered and fed by the new system.
“I love your office,” Lamont said. “So beautiful. It’s amazing, and it brings to life for me what sustainable farming, sustainable agriculture? Words we throw around a lot.”
The operation is year-round, but the demand peaks once the weather breaks in spring and backyard gardeners buy bedding plants. They grow three or four crops — turnovers, in industry parlance — of the spring standards like the Delta Cotton Mix pansies that are almost sold out, Bonanza Orange marigolds or Blue Pearl impatiens.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_7353-3-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-04-22 17:08:14.124179

Brad Little issued an executive order Tuesday directing the Idaho Department of Lands to increase forest management activities on federal national forests in Idaho and reduce the risk of wildfire.
“(The Idaho Department of Lands) will work with the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) wherever possible to utilize all federal and state authorities to expedite active forest management and mitigate the risk of catastrophic wildfires,” Little wrote in Executive Order 2005-04, which he called the Make Forests Healthy Again Act.

In a press release announcing the executive order, Little said his action complements the March 1 Freeing our Forests Act signed by President Donald Trump and a memo issued this month by United States Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins that aim to minimize wildfire risk and increase management of federal forests, Little said. 
  Idaho governor calls for timber harvests, prescribed burns, thinning to reduce wildfire risk 

Forest management activities included timber harvests, prescribed burns, mechanical thinning and an aggressive initial attack during the peak of wildfire season, Little said. 
In Tuesday’s press release, Little said that under the previous administration of President Joe Biden, the Idaho Department of Lands was limited to two small areas where it could help the federal government with expanded forest management activities.
Little said that has changed and expanded under the new Trump administration.

“For too long, millions of acres of national forests in Idaho have remained totally untouched, creating a tinderbox of fuel that threatens communities, air quality and the environment,” Little said in a written statement Tuesday. “The State of Idaho has led the country in standing up programs to help our federal partners increase the pace and scale of active management on federal ground. The work we’ve done is making a difference.”
In conjunction with Little’s press release, Idaho Farm Bureau CEO Zak Miller issued a statement praising Little and Trump’s actions.

“Farm Bureau strongly supports President Trump’s and Gov. Little’s emphasis on returning active management to federal lands in Idaho,” Miller wrote. “Our members have been personally devastated by the negative effects of reduced federal management over the years. We fully support Gov. Little’s executive order and look forward to cooperatively increasing the level of management of federal lands in Idaho so they will be as productive and healthy as our state lands.”
Rollins, the United States secretary of agriculture, also issued a statement released by Little’s office Tuesday saying the move will strengthen the timber industry.
“I commend Gov. Little for acting quickly to fix our national forest emergency,” Rollins wrote. “Americans rely on Idaho’s productive and abundant forests, and this executive order will go a long way towards strengthening the timber industry in the state and minimizing harmful pests, disease and risk of fire.”
Utah Gov. Spencer Cox issued a similar executive order on Monday to encourage wildfire preparedness across the Beehive State, according to the Utah News Dispatch. 
The order, according to Cox’s office, is meant to “improve coordination among state, local, and federal partners ahead of the 2025 fire season,” the news organization reported.

Lynn Evans, R-Aurelia, urged his colleagues Tuesday in the Iowa Senate to voice their support for bringing up legislation for debate on carbon capture pipelines.
His statement prompted both Republicans and Democrats to blame the opposing party for why the Senate has not moved on the issue for several years.
Evans said on the Senate floor that lawmakers, both Republicans and Democrats, should voice their support for debating House File 639, the legislation passed by the House in March addressing several issues related to pipelines — or any bill related to the use of eminent domain in building carbon sequestration pipelines. He made his statement as part of a “point of personal privilege” after Senate debate ended Tuesday.
Evans said lawmakers have sworn an oath to the U.S. Constitution when they took office, and his colleagues have an obligation to publicly vote about the use of eminent domain in building private carbon capture pipelines, as the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution deals with the use of eminent domain in taking private property for public use.
“This is not only a constitutional issue,” Evans said. “It is simply the right thing to do for our property owners, as many of them who have an objection to the use of eminent domain are generational landowners. It means much more to them than just productivity. It’s part of their family, it’s part of their heritage, it’s part of their being.”
Eminent domain allows the government to force unwilling landowners to sell easements on their property for projects deemed to be a public benefit — often, projects like building roads or public utilities. The Iowa Utilities Commission has allowed the use of eminent domain for Summit Carbon Solutions’ proposed carbon sequestration pipeline over the objections of landowners and others who argue the private project is not in the public’s interest.
The House bill is the most likely to come up for discussion and a public vote by the Senate, as it has passed the Senate Commerce Committee. The measure was amended by the Senate committee, led by Sen. Mike Bousselot, R-Ankeny, to remove some portions of the House legislation while adding new components, like expanding the scope of the bill to cover other types of pipelines and allow pipeline projects to seek voluntary easements outside of the original project corridor.
Evans urged his colleagues to move on the bill because it is the first measure on pipelines to become eligible for floor debate in the Senate in several years.
Pipelines have been a high-profile issue at the Iowa Legislature for several years as the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline project is going through the approval process. Landowners who own property in the path of the proposed carbon sequestration pipeline, which would span more than 1,000 miles in Iowa, have been frequent visitors to the State Capitol, meeting with lawmakers and protesting the lack of action to limit the use of eminent domain in building the pipeline.
House lawmakers have passed bills in several previous sessions with bipartisan support that have failed to gain traction in the Senate. Evans called for lawmakers to speak with Senate Majority Whip Mike Klimesh to share their stance on the bill, “because we need to know how many people are in support of this.”
“We better all be in support of it, every one of us, doesn’t matter if you’re a Republican or Democrat — we took an oath to support the U.S. Constitution,” Evans said. “Let Sen. Klimesh know where you stand on this. He’s probably going to ask you the question, as he should, ‘What bill do you want to see move forward,’ and ‘How do you want to see it move?’ Look him in the eye and say, ‘I don’t care. Let’s get something to the floor, and let’s vote on it,’ and let’s protect the rights of our property owners in this state.”
Sen. Zach Wahls,  a Coralville Democrat, said Republicans, including Evans, voted against a Senate rule change to allow “discharge petitions” — an alternate way to bring certain bills to a vote in the Senate. Discharge petitions are used when the chair of a committee chooses not to place a certain bill on the committee’s agenda, removing it from consideration and not allowing a vote to take place.
Wahls indicated allowing this process to happen could have brought pipeline bills to a vote in the Senate. Still, Wahls added that he hoped Evans was being “earnest” when calling for lawmakers to talk to leadership about the amended legislation currently available for debate in the chamber.
“I hope that maybe this signals a willingness on the part of the majority to work with Democrats when it comes to passing legislation that’s good for Iowa,” Wahls said.
Sen. Jesse Green, R-Boone, also jumped into the discussion, asking Wahls if the Iowa Democratic Party has “made an official statement on their stance on the pipeline.” While Democrats have not made a statement as a party about their position on the pipeline, Wahls said Green was portraying the issue of eminent domain as partisan.
“You want to say, ‘Well, Democrats believe this, or all Democrats believe that,’ the same way that you want to say, ‘All Republicans believe this, or all Republicans believe that,’ and try to make this a partisan thing — when we all know that if that bill was on the floor, there’d be 26 votes for it,” Wahls said.
Green said Democrats “enjoy theatrics, the cameras, all that stuff” in bringing up amendments to legislation that he said were not discussed with Republican leaders, and he believed members of the minority party should be having “those serious conversations with a few handful of Republicans before you do that.”
He said Republicans were having private conversations about the legislation.
“We as Republicans, are having a serious conversation within our caucus, and I appreciate all Republicans that have engaged in that conversation,” Green said. “I’m sorry we’re not theatrical about it. I’m sorry we don’t make public spectacles about it. But in this chamber, I commend everybody that has been a part of this conversation. And I do hope that as the session wraps up, that we will come to an agreement.”
Sen. Tony Bisignano, D-Des Moines, said Democrats have “been sitting here for years” asking for the majority party to bring the issue to a vote in the Senate. Bisignano said the Senate majority leader and Senate president have the ability to bring the bill to the floor at any time, and called for the Republican leaders to bring the bill up for debate Tuesday.
“Let’s frame this the way it is: it’s a property rights bill of taking people’s property for the private sector,” Bisignano said. “… I’d be more than happy to take that vote this afternoon. Madam President, Mr. Majority Leader, bring the bill up, and let’s debate it, and let’s vote.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Iowa-Senate-1.13.25-_-Kathie-Obradovich-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-22 17:08:14.124179

(Photo by Darrell Ehrlick of the Daily Montanan)Four years ago, a young woman, Chloe Worl, was killed shortly before 8 a.m. outside of Dillon by a distracted driver.
The other driver, texting on her phone and using Snapchat, slammed Worl’s pickup at 60 mph. Worl, who was 25 and working at Barrett Hospital at the time, was killed instantly. 
The driver who killed Worl avoided jail time for the death. 
Montana does not have laws making distracted driving illegal, something some lawmakers this session sought to change with Senate Bill 359.
Some municipalities, like Helena and Billings, already have distracted driving laws. Signs dot the towns, reminding motorists to look up at the road, not down at their phones.
But efforts to bring distracted driving laws statewide have stalled.
“She was an amazing young lady whose life was cut too short, but she’s one of many,” said Sen. Sara Novak, an Anaconda Democrat who pushed distracted driving legislation this session. “This keeps happening.”
There were 203 traffic fatalities in 2024, according to the Montana Department of Transportation. That number was less than 200 in 2023. Many of the fatal crashes have been clustered in the southwestern portion of the state.
Nationally, fatalities are more common in rural areas than urban, and more than 3,200 people died in crashes caused by distracted driving in 2023.
Worl held a degree from the University of Montana Western in molecular biology and had planned to attend the University of Montana’s pharmacy school. She was a hunter, an avid horseback rider, a National Honors Society member and musically gifted.
Her death shocked not only the Dillon community, but north in Anaconda as well. Worl was a Copperhead, a graduate of Anaconda High School and a four-year softball player.
Worl’s memory still lives — her family has spoken in favor of legislation seeking to penalize distracted driving and there’s even an annual scholarship in her name.
“We’ve learned a lot since this tragedy has happened to us,” Keith Worl, Chloe’s father, said during a Senate Transportation hearing for SB 359 in late February. “I guess it’s also fueled our fire to not have this tragedy happen to anybody else we know.”
Chloe Worl’s memory lives in Novak’s mind too. Novak’s Senate Bill 359 would have added penalties for distracted driving.
While the session is not over quite yet, the effort has stalled. The legislation passed the Senate, but was tabled in the House Judiciary Committee.
Two attempts to blast SB 359, both by legislators from nearby districts, failed during the last two weeks. The first motion to move it to the House floor, by Rep. Jennifer Lynch, a Butte Democrat, failed by one vote with one member, a Democrat, voting remotely.
Blast motions can only be voted on by members who are present in the chamber at the time of the vote, and if they would have had that vote on the first motion to reconsider, the legislation likely would have seen the House floor. Rep. Scott DeMarois, a Democrat from Anaconda, brought the second blast motion to move the bill to the floor. It failed by four votes.
“For whatever reason, the stars didn’t align,” Novak said. “It’s emotional, it’s frustrating.”
Novak was Worl’s driving instructor, teaching her siblings as well. She was carrying SB 359 for the family and said last week it was her most important piece of legislation this session.
“She was a ray of sunshine,” Novak said.
It frustrated Novak, who felt “politics” played a part in the bill’s struggles, but for her the bill not going cuts even deeper.
Law enforcement and the state Department of Transportation supported the bill in its committee hearings, but trouble began in the Senate. Asking municipal courts to prosecute the charges was one issue.
There was a sense by some legislators it was an attempt by the transportation department to increase revenue by adding penalties.
“I do value life, but this bill usually goes through judiciary,” Sen. Barry Usher, R-Billings, said March 2 on the Senate floor. “But it seems to me, based on the discussion, that this is about money, because this was pushed, I guess, by the Department of Transportation, because we’re losing money.”
Comments on her intent were also lambasted by Sen. Pat Flowers, D-Belgrade, as a point of decorum during Senate floor discussion. Novak recently said the MDT trying to get more funding wasn’t the driver of the bill and made a similar comment on the floor in March.
“In terms of the attacks on MDT and my reasons for bringing this bill, I take exception to that,” Novak said on March 2. “As this bill sponsor, I did a lot of homework, and I reached out to who I thought would be of interest in this bill.”
Novak said there was some conversation about amending the bill to specifically ban texting. But this doesn’t go far enough, she said.
“It’s more than just texting,” Novak said.
A car can travel the length of a football field while glancing at a phone for five seconds at 55 mph. Other messaging apps like Snapchat can be a pull, as can social media, taking photos and changing a song.
There has been some appetite in the Legislature to regulate motorists this session, and Bobby’s Law, House Bill 267, would create a mandatory minimum for some fatal DUIs in the state.
Novak’s bill would have made it a $75 ticket on first offense for distracted driving and $150 for subsequent infractions.
The intention of Novak’s legislation wasn’t fully punitive, she said. It’s more of creating reminders, so that fewer families will be shattered by a preventable crash, she added.
“We weren’t trying to hammer anything with a bunch of heavy fines or create more work for law enforcement,” Novak said in an interview. “It was more educational and being a deterrent.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Texting-driving-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-22 17:08:14.124179

(Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor) The League of Women Voters of North Dakota is asking Gov. Kelly Armstrong to veto a bill that would shorten the window for North Dakotans to submit mail-in absentee ballots.
Mail-in ballots are counted in North Dakota so long as they’re postmarked by the day before Election Day and are delivered within 13 days of the election. 
House Bill 1165 would amend this to require mail-in ballots to be received by an election officer by the time the polls close — a change the League in a Tuesday email to members called an “overreach and overreaction.”
“Eligible North Dakota voters should be able to mail their absentee ballot without fear that their ballot will be tossed out,” Barbara Headrick, the organization’s president, said in a statement to the North Dakota Monitor. She said the bill would create obstacles for groups like rural and Native voters, seniors and people with disabilities.
The amendment was made to comply with a March 25 executive order issued by President Donald Trump that forbids states from counting mail-in ballots received after Election Day.
North Dakota counties report absentee ballots with missing postmarks

The bill was originally intended to clean up state law governing elections procedures. The main purpose of the bill is to make ballots easier for voters to understand and make election practices more uniform across the state. It addresses things like write-in candidate deadlines, what counts as a valid residential address and who can remove election judges, for example.
“What’s in this bill is what I would refer to as the ‘no-brainer’ stuff,” Rep. Scott Louser, R-Minot, the bill’s primary sponsor, said at its first hearing before the House Political Subdivisions Committee in January.
The Senate State and Local Government Committee during committee discussion earlier this month added the deadline change for mail-in ballots. The amendment was brought by the Secretary of State’s Office, according to Deputy Secretary of State Sandra McMerty.
McMerty in a Tuesday statement to the North Dakota Monitor said the change was suggested to comply with the executive order and to “remove uncertainty and inconsistencies surrounding postmarking requirements of the USPS.” 
Since the amendment was introduced after the bill’s public hearing in the Senate, the public did not have an opportunity to comment on the proposed changes.
States neighboring North Dakota — Minnesota, Montana, South Dakota and Nebraska — already have similar requirements on the books, she noted.
Sen. Kristin Roers, R-Fargo, chair of the Senate State and Local Government Committee, said during the hearing the Legislature had weighed adopting the policy before and that she feels it is “best practice” for elections. 
The state has been reluctant to change the law in case ballot delivery is delayed by the postal service, Roers said. She said this shouldn’t be an issue since the post office treats the election-related mail with extra care.
McMerty said the Secretary of State’s Office doesn’t anticipate the change causing any problems either.
“We don’t foresee significant barriers to voters as 0.1% of absentee ballots in the general election were postmarked prior to Election Day and delivered to the county after Election Day,” she told the Monitor.
Military overseas ballots wouldn’t have to observe the same deadline, they would just have to be mailed by the time polls close on Election Day, the bill indicates. Ballots would have to be received by the time the county canvassing board meets. Voters also would be able to personally hand in their ballots to their county auditor on Election Day before polls close. 
Voting by mail? Election workers are worried about issues at the Postal Service.

The Senate last week voted 43-4 to pass the bill. The House on Monday approved the amended bill by a vote of 85-7.
The Legislature in March approved a resolution earlier this session, House Concurrent Resolution 3006, calling on the postmaster general of the United States Postal Service to address problems with mail. 
“During testimony, we heard instance after instance of non-delivered or late delivered mail that caused harm to our citizens,” said Sen. Mike Wobemma, R-Valley City, said of the measure on the Senate floor last month.
After last June’s primary election, at least five North Dakota counties reported receiving absentee ballots by mail with no postmarks.
Trump’s executive order remains in effect, though a group of 19 states earlier this month filed a federal lawsuit over the directive, arguing that it violates states rights and will make it harder for some Americans to vote. North Dakota is not a party to the lawsuit.

Brian Seitz, a Branson Republican, speaks during House debate in March 2025 (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications).Legislation that would void non-disclosure agreements in child sexual abuse cases received unanimous approval from Missouri’s House on Tuesday afternoon.
The bill, sponsored by Republican state Rep. Brian Seitz from Branson, now heads to the Missouri Senate.
Non-disclosure agreements are “legal mechanisms that were created to protect trade secrets, not trauma secrets,” Seitz said last week during House debate.
“We must clarify the law on use of the NDAs in civil child sexual abuse settlements, so that survivors of such horrors who already feel shamed and silenced are also not legally silenced and intimidated,” Seitz said.
Seitz called NDAs “an injustice and a wrong that we can make right now.” 
The legislation applies to any legal action starting Aug. 28 of this year, when the law would take effect. It makes NDAs in childhood sexual abuse cases unenforceable. 
Seitz said while the bill “cannot fix the horrific events leading up to signing an NDA, it can prevent the silencing of child crime victims in the future, and would certainly make Missouri safer for all.” 
State Rep. Raychel Proudie, a Democrat from Ferguson, said Tuesday: “We should not be protecting the business interests of perverts, of people who hurt children.”
The bill has been called “Trey’s Law,” referring to the late Trey Carlock, who died by suicide in 2019 after being sexually abused by Pete Newman at the Branson-based Kanakuk Kamps.
Trey’s sister, Elizabeth Carlock, said at a hearing on the bill in February that he had to agree to an NDA as a condition of his settlement with the camp.
“Trey told someone just before his death that they’ll always control me and I’ll never be free,” Carlock said in February, “…A lot of truth dies with people because of NDAs, and that only protects bad actors, which is contrary to public interest.” 
Texas is also aiming to ban NDAs in child sexual abuse cases this session. Tennessee enacted similar legislation in 2018. 
“Silence actually kills, as my family knows,” Carlock told lawmakers. “It endangers the public. This practice is nothing short of evil, and it only protects darkness.” 
Kanakuk director Pete Newman pleaded guilty in 2010 to seven counts of sexual abuse, and the prosecutor said Newman’s victim count might be in the hundreds. Newman is currently serving two life sentences plus 30 years in prison. 
Kanakuk leadership maintains that they had no advanced knowledge of his behavior, and Newman was a “master of deception.”
Keith Dygert, who was also abused by Newman, reached a settlement with a non-disclosure agreement, he testified in February. But only after signing it did he learn more from news articles about the extent of Newman’s abuse and Kanakuk’s potential knowledge, he said. 
Dygert said NDAs have “undeniably prevented proper and timely healing…by silencing victims when sharing their stories in their own time, in their own way.”
He said it was worth his taking the risk of breaking his NDA to speak out.
“When victims are silenced, the truth is also silenced, and the institutions that helped enable child sexual abuse are protected,” Dygert said. 
No one testified in opposition.
State Rep. Rudy Veit, a Republican from Wardsville, said in February’s hearing: “I believe that NDAs serve a very useful purpose in some situations, but in this situation, I can see that there’s really no advantage other than to the perpetrator.”
Similar legislation in the Missouri Senate passed out of committee earlier this month but hasn’t been debated by the full chamber. No one testified in opposition in the Senate hearing, and only state Sen. Steve Roberts, a Democrat from St. Louis, voted against the measure. 
Seitz is also pushing legislation to extend the statute of limitations for survivors of childhood sex abuse. That legislation, attached to a broader bill about statutes of limitations, passed out of the House in February and Senate committee this month. It is awaiting consideration by the full Senate.

(Photo by Eddie Moore / Albuquerque Journal)Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham pocket vetoed a bill introduced this session to establish Native cultural schools through a pilot program, the second time such a bill failed to make it through a recent session.
Sen. Benny Shendo Jr. (D-Jemez Pueblo) originally introduced the State-Tribal Education Compact Schools Act in 2023 to allow pueblos, tribes and nations to enter into compacts with the New Mexico Public Education Department and establish Native language and cultural schools. The 2023 bill died in committee, but this year, Senate Bill 13 found a lot of support.
SB13 was amended to limit the compacts to five schools under five-year pilot programs. It passed unanimously by both the House of Representatives and the Senate, but Lujan Grisham failed to act on it by the April 11 deadline.
“The governor supports innovative approaches to Indigenous education; however, there were concerns about the bill exempting compact schools from accountability requirements without adequate implementation structure,” a spokesperson for the governor’s office told Source NM in an email. “The governor has directed PED to work closely with tribal governments, including Jemez Pueblo, to develop solutions that honor tribal sovereignty while ensuring quality education for all New Mexico students.”
The bill would have made state-tribal compact schools exempt from state statutes and rules pertaining to curriculum and school evaluation requirements and would instead have required the schools to rely on the terms of the compact as determined between the petitioning tribe, nation or pueblo and the PED.
Shendo told Source NM that he was disappointed with the outcome, but said he was notified the pocket veto might occur. He added that he thought the concern was over the compact schools receiving state funds based on the public school funding formula — the method of calculating how much money each public school district receives based on how many students they have, the needs of the students and other factors.
“Our schools are going to be very small because we only have so many tribes,” Shendo told Source.
He said he plans to work with the governor’s office and the PED during the interim to streamline the language in the bill and address concerns so it might be one of the governor’s priorities for the 2026 30-day legislative session.
“Us as Indian tribes, we’re not going anywhere. We can wait another year, we’ve been here a long time,” Shendo said. “We’re in it for the longhaul.”

Ron Sorvaag, R-Fargo, and Brad Bekkedahl, R-Williston. (Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota senators on Tuesday narrowly rejected a proposal to add $1 million for a “life education committee” in the Office of Management and Budget budget to teach people about abortion alternatives.
The amendment was brought by Sen. Janne Myrdal, R-Edinburg, who pitched the program as a way to help pregnant women.
The committee established by the amendment would have administered a campaign to teach the public about state abortion laws, policies “supporting life and family values,” and resources available for pregnant mothers, families and children. The campaign would have been carried out by a third party contractor.
The amendment was added by the Senate Appropriations Committee, but split from the rest of the budget bill so the Senate could vote on it separately.
North Dakota lawmakers look to add $1 million to state budget for anti-abortion campaign

Sen. David Clemens, who made the motion to split the bill, said he is not opposed to the idea of the program but takes issue with the fact that the proposal was never heard by a policy committee.
“I feel this is in violation of our own rules,” he said. Clemens, R-West Fargo, noted that members of the public were not provided the opportunity to speak for or against the funding.
Sen. Brad Bekkedahl, a Williston Republican and chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said he agreed with Clemens that the public did not get proper notice about the amendment.
“Had this been a standalone bill with its own title and its own placement into a policy committee, it would have had people interested in listening to the discussion,” he said.
Sen. Judy Lee, R-West Fargo, said the $1 million would be put to better use for guardianship grants. The request for the budget was about $9 million, but the OMB budget as currently written sets aside $8 million for the program, she said.
Myrdal said a procedural technicality should not stand in the way of something that will help women and children. She also pointed out that the committees routinely amend bills after their public hearings.
“Nothing was hidden, nothing was strange about it,” Myrdal said. 
The North Dakota Supreme Court in 2023 warned the Legislature against lumping issues into budget bills when it found that the state’s previous OMB budget violated the state constitution’s single-subject rule.
The amendment failed by a 23-24 vote.
Prairie Public supporters urge North Dakota Senate to restore state funding

The Senate approved other changes to the OMB budget, which included grant funding for Prairie Public.
The House had stripped Prairie Public’s $1.2 million base funding after it passed House Bill 1255, which sought to bar the state from spending state money to support public broadcasting. House Bill 1255 was subsequently defeated in the Senate.
The Senate Appropriations Committee added $850,000 to Prairie Public’s budget for broadcast tower infrastructure, but did not restore its $1.2 million base funding.
The Senate also reduced funding for a proposed state hospital in Jamestown by $45 million.
The amended funding includes $200 million from the strategic investment and improvements fund and $85 million from a Bank of North Dakota line of credit, for a total of $285 million. The funding was shifted to the OMB budget because that agency will oversee the construction.
The House’s version of the budget included $330 million for the hospital in the state’s Department of Health and Human Services budget. 
The budget also includes $2.3 million for new driveway and additional fencing for the governor’s residence.
The Office of Management and Budget bill will next go back to the House for a concurrence vote.

The potential gas tax increase, the first in the state since 2016, raises nearly half of the estimated $3.2 billion the new package is expected to bring in over six years. It would up the state’s levy from 49.4 cents per gallon to 55.4 cents, then lift it by 2% each year. 
The proposal is the product of bipartisan negotiations between legislators in the House and Senate seeking a solution to soaring project costs and flagging gas tax collections as drivers transition to more efficient vehicles. 
“We’re close,” said House Transportation Committee Chair Jake Fey, D-Tacoma.
The new proposition in Senate Bill 5801 makes a sizable dent in what’s estimated to be a $1 billion shortfall over the next two years and $8 billion over the next six years. Lawmakers say more money is needed to fund highway megaprojects, the Washington State Patrol, state ferries and the removal of culverts and other barriers blocking fish migration. 
Meanwhile, the two chambers are negotiating over what the new revenue will pay for as they hash out a two-year transportation plan in the $15 billion to $16 billion range.
Initial revenue packages released last month totaled $4.4 billion in the House and $3 billion in the Senate. 
The revised gas tax proposal hews closer to what the Senate previously unveiled. The House had teased raising the tax 9 cents, then indexing it to inflation. 
The Senate’s original plan received some Republican backing, passing 31-18 in March with three Democrats opposed and four Republicans in support.
Washington’s gas tax is already one of the highest in the country, before accounting for the 18.4-cent federal rate.
On top of the gas tax hike, the latest framework includes hikes for the diesel fuel tax — 3 cents a gallon in both fiscal years 2026 and 2028, then those increases indexed to rise 2% annually for inflation.  
There are also added taxes on vehicle sales, rental cars, luxury vehicles, private jets and a $1 per attendee fee on operators of stadiums and other venues with a capacity of 17,000 or more. 
One of the bigger-ticket items is $317 million from a $30-per-ton weight fee on heavy-duty trucks that would also rise with inflation in future years. Lawmakers also pencil in $138 million from violations of the state’s new speed cameras in work zones.
The tax cornucopia also drops some controversial ideas in the earlier House and Senate proposals. 
There’s no increased fee on electric vehicle registrations. There’s no new 10% surcharge on e-bike purchases. There’s no vehicle registration fee for transit operators. And there’s no ferry fare increase.
Most notable may be the absence of a new highway use fee the House had floated. 
The creative fee, patterned after a similar approach in Virginia, would have charged drivers based on their car’s fuel economy, with more efficient vehicles paying more. Fey and other Democrats have toyed with such a road usage charge for over a decade. He was disappointed to see it not included in Tuesday’s revenue proposal.
Senate Transportation Committee Chair Marko Liias, D-Edmonds, said negotiators dropped the charge because of how late in the process it came and the resulting lack of time “to understand the impacts.”
The plan includes other policy changes, including tolling on the entire State Route 520 corridor, not just the floating bridge, mandating biodiesel fuel for state ferries and providing a sales tax exemption for zero-emission buses. 
But it doesn’t include added uses for Tacoma Narrows Bridge toll proceeds or increased enforcement for expired vehicle registration tabs, as the Senate had proposed.
The proposal, heard in the House Transportation Committee on Tuesday, is set for a vote from the panel Wednesday morning.
The legislative session is scheduled to end Sunday.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/GettyImages-1232851427-scaled-1-e1687381640866-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-22 17:08:14.124179

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Florida State University students, joined by House Democratic Leader Fentrice Driskell, are calling for policy change following a campus shooting within walking distance of the chambers where laws are made.
A group of students gathered at the Capitol Tuesday only days after they barricaded themselves in classrooms Thursday when a shooter opened fire on campus, killing two and wounding six. 
“As a leader, I carry the weight of this moment and turn it into purpose. We owe it to the victims, not just here at Florida State University, but across Florida and across our nation to make sure that this doesn’t happen again,” said Andres Perez, president of the FSU chapter of Students Demand Action. 
The suspected gunman, step-son of a Leon County sheriff’s deputy, according to law enforcement, used her retired service weapon. Leon County Sheriff Walt McNeil said it was not surprising 20-year-old Phoenix Ikner would have access to weapons. He was involved with LCSO, including training with the department and sitting on a youth board advising the sheriff.

Madalyn Propst, president of FSU College Democrats, called on FSU to put locks on classroom doors, train professors to respond to shootings, and increase financial support for mental health intervention and advocacy. She said the shooting “was both senseless and preventable.”
“Although it is not a political issue when a mass tragedy happens, it becomes political when it is enabled by poor policy,” Propst said in the Captiol rotunda. 
“Because of a lack of proactive planning and poor policy on the hands of our legislators, there are two people who are dead who shouldn’t be, six people in the hospital who shouldn’t be, thousands of students who no longer feel safe on campus, and a community that is still reeling from a senseless act of violence, and no amount of thoughts and prayers is going to fix that.”
Propst called on Congress to reinstate the Office of Gun Violence Prevention, and on the Legislature to expand safe storage laws to apply to any house that someone who cannot legally handle a gun lives in.
“Shooting after shooting, we’re told to wait, and all we hear are ‘thoughts and prayers.’ And I’m sensitive to not politicizing an issue but, year after year, we file good, common sense bills to help make our community safer and, unfortunately, they don’t even get a committee hearing,” Driskell said. 
A Senate bill, SB 814, allowing students to carry guns on Florida campuses, lost steam earlier this session, and eyes are on the same chamber to see if it will pick up the House-approved bill, HB 759, to lower the age to buy long guns to 18.

‘Disgusted’
“I’m disgusted with my Legislature and the people that I know some of my friends and my family voted for,” Propst said. “The fact that they are able to sit in this place and prioritize weapons over my life, my friends’ lives, and the lives of my community around me is deplorable.”
The House bill would reverse in part a 2018 package addressing school safety passed just weeks after a gunman killed 17 people at Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland. A response as quick as happened in 2018 does not seem so certain this year. 
“I think the only difference [between 2018 and now] is that it seems like the governor is desensitized to this. I mean, we saw the comments from President Trump, that, to me, was such a slap in the face to these students and to everyone in this community who’s been impacted by this gun violence,” Driskell.
Gov. Ron DeSantis released a video to X the day of the shooting and ordered flags flown at half-staff. President Donald Trump said, “I will always protect the Second Amendment,” and, “These things are terrible. But the gun doesn’t do the shooting, the people do,” CBS News reported.
According to FSU, following the shooting it offered mental health assistance to more than 1,300 students Thursday through Sunday, including 604 on the day of the shooting and 520 on Sunday. The university continues to provide services through this week.  
The school canceled classes on Friday and resumed classes Monday with optional attendance. The semester ends May 2.
Rep. Christine Hunchofsky, mayor of Parkland during the 2018 shooting, reflected on the FSU shooting during a media availability Monday.
“If you haven’t been through something like this, it’s very hard to understand the level of trauma that people who have been through this are experiencing and, if that doesn’t get addressed early enough, it’s something that can become debilitating in the long term. And so, it’s so important to make sure that everyone has what they need,” Hunchofsky said.
Minutes after the shooting on Thursday, Hunchofsky presented HB 1403 to the House Education and Employment Committee, a bill that would address school safety measures. It passed unanimously.

Jerry McAfee Tuesday, April 22, 2025. (Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Senate President Bobby Joe Champion, DFL-Minneapolis, denied to the ethics committee Tuesday that he did anything wrong when he spearheaded $3 million in state grants to a nonprofit run by a legal client, north Minneapolis Rev. Jerry McAfee.
Champion reiterated that his legal work for McAfee was pro-bono and concluded just prior to the start of the 2023 legislative session. Champion never disclosed his relationship with McAfee, which the Reformer first reported earlier this month. Because the work was pro-bono, he said didn’t need to tell his fellow senators about it when he authored a bill granting $3 million in public funds to McAfee’s violence prevention group 21 Days of Peace.
Following the Reformer’s first report on April 4, Champion asked the Subcommittee on Ethical Conduct to issue an advisory opinion on whether his actions represented a conflict of interest that should have been disclosed to the Senate. The committee held its first hearing in the matter on Tuesday and is scheduled to continue deliberating Thursday. Champion previously served as the chair of the ethics committee, but he stepped down following the Reformer report.
Senate Republicans have also filed an ethics complaint against Champion.
In a committee room Tuesday full of Black community leaders and Champion supporters — including McAfee — the Senate president said he represented McAfee pro-bono because he has deep connections to the north Minneapolis community. Champion and his family go to McAfee’s church, and Champion said wanted to give back to the community that raised him.
“I did nothing wrong then, and I did nothing wrong now,” Champion said.

Jerry McAfee Tuesday, April 22, 2025. (Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)
McAfee, when first contacted by the Reformer, refused to say whether he’d paid Champion for the legal work, but he has since told other media and the Senate ethics committee that it was indeed pro-bono representation.
Beginning in 2022, Champion represented McAfee and his nonprofit Salem Inc. in four cases involving nonpayment of mortgages on multiple Minneapolis properties. Champion detailed for the committee how the case ended in December 2022, but the order to dismiss the case wasn’t issued by opposing counsel until February 2023. His involvement with the case was over by that time, Champion testified.
Last month, Champion introduced a bill to provide an additional $1 million to 21 Days of Peace, but it didn’t make it into the Senate jobs bill. It could be included in a bill as the session continues, however.
Under Minnesota law, legislative conflicts of interest are narrowly defined and only exist when the official does something to benefit themselves financially. Minnesota’s part-time Legislature creates many opportunities for conflicts of interest, as most lawmakers have another job.
Outside ethics experts have said that Minnesota’s conflict of interest laws are among the weakest in the nation. A 2015 Center for Public Integrity report found that Minnesota ranked 44th in the nation on legislative accountability.
Champion, a practicing defense attorney, was also represented Tuesday by attorney David Zoll, who recently represented Rep. Brad Tabke, DFL-Shakopee, in an election contest case late last year.
The Senate president testified that he’s open to changing Minnesota’s ethics laws to ensure accountability for lawmakers in various professions.
“Right now — when you think in terms of lawyers — you can track lawyers, but we don’t track accountants and insurance brokers or real estate agents,” Champion said.
After the committee hearing, Champion told the Reformer in an interview that previous reporting about his connection with McAfee falsely jumps to the conclusion that he has a conflict of interest.
“If you look at the language of the law, it clearly says the official has to have a financial interest. When there’s a deviation from doing that and then immediately going to titles (headlines) like I ‘steered’ $3 million to a client, or ‘here are these other conflicts’ — you’re reaching a conclusion that there’s a conflict without even looking at the law,” Champion said.
Asked if he’s concerned about the appearance of a conflict of interest, regardless of whether he violated Senate rules, Champion said he’s being unfairly singled out for common legislative behavior.
“My conduct is no different from anyone else’s conduct … but it feels like you’re making my situation bigger, wider, more corrupt, more fraud, than taking a very narrow but appropriate and balanced approach. If they want to change the conflict rules, change them.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/NN250422_0180-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-04-22 17:08:14.124179

Pulling from his past as a basketball player, Gilchrist said that sometimes the best defense is a good offense, framing the fight against climate change as an opportunity for change, growth, innovation and leadership. 
As Michigan leads the nation in clean energy job growth, and more clean energy adjacent businesses are growing in the state than ever before, Gilchrist pointed to these changes as an opportunity for Michigan to do more. 
As part of that effort Gilchrist announced the MI Healthy Climate Challenge, offering several millions of dollars in grants to projects that will help the state meet its goal of carbon neutrality. 
The program will include multiple competitions through 2026, with the first competition, Solar for Savings, offering $8.875 million in grants for residential and community solar pilot projects and upgrades to equipment and energy storage. The challenge is open and will accept entries through 5 p.m. on July 30, 2025. Applications are available at Michigan.gov/MHCChallenge.
Pilot programs supported by the competition are intended to lower energy costs, improve resiliency against power outages and create the groundwork for the MI Solar For All program, a $156 million federally-funded initiative to provide low-income communities and households access to solar energy. 
According to a statement from the Department of Environment Great Lakes and Energy, which is sponsoring the conference, future competitions will focus on improving access to loans for environmental efforts, helping communities and partners leverage federal tax credits and unlocking large-scale financing for high-impact climate projects. Though eligibility will vary, the challenge aims to include a wide range of participants such as local governments, community lenders, schools, faith organizations, nonprofits and solar providers.
During last year’s MI Healthy Climate Conference, Gilchrist announced the Michigan Climate Justice Challenge, offering $11 million in grant and technical assistance to help Michigan communities in competing for federal funding. The state also announced a mobility challenge aimed at improving access to Michigan’s national parks through innovations in small-scale electric shuttles and automated driving systems, multimodal electric charging hubs and micro-mobility like scooters and e-bikes.
“All that is to say, we’ve laid a foundation… We’ve tested some things out,” Gilchrist said. 
“Now that we know when something works a little bit, we have to scale it up quickly so it can work a lot in every group, in more markets in more communities, in more circumstances,” Gilchrist said, emphasizing the importance of inviting people from all of Michigan’s communities to participate in efforts to combat climate change and build up the state’s clean energy and mobility economy. 
“We cannot get where we need to go if we don’t bring everybody along with us,” Gilchrist said, telling attendees that by building a better connected, more inspired group, the state can begin to realize the clean energy and climate future it deserves.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_0779-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-22 17:08:14.124179

Shelley Moore Capito photo)Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., has called on federal Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., to bring back employees of a local National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health office that supports the coal industry. 
At least 200 workers were affected by a reduction-in-force at the Morgantown office earlier this month as a part of a restructuring of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The changes, meant to save $1.8 billion a year, will reduce staffing from 82,000 to 62,000 full-time employees at the department. 
In a letter to Kennedy dated Monday, Capito wrote that she had talked to Kennedy about the agency and the “important work” it does to improve and monitor the health care of coal miners in West Virginia. 
The NIOSH office plays a crucial role in detecting black lung among the nation’s coal miners through its Coal Workers Health Surveillance Program. The program operated a mobile clinic that traveled between coal mines and coal communities. 
The facility’s research on rock dust has led to safety changes to prevent explosions in underground mines, Capito said. 
“I ask that the department bring back not only the functions of the NIOSH coal offices and programs, but also some of the specialized employees impacted by the April 1 HHS-wide Reduction in Force who do this important work in Morgantown, West Virginia,” Capito wrote. 
Earlier this month, Capito joined President Donald Trump at the White House as he signed executive orders meant to bolster the country’s declining coal industry. The orders allowed some older coal-fired power plants set for retirement to continue producing electricity, directed federal agencies to identify coal resources on federal lands, lifted barriers to coal mining and prioritize coal leasing on U.S. lands, according to the Associated Press. 
“The president’s executive orders are welcome news for our miners and will help ensure all Americans have access to affordable and reliable energy resources like coal,” Capito wrote. “As the president recognizes the importance of coal, we must also recognize the health of our miners and I encourage you to bring back the NIOSH coal programs and researchers that will help ensure the president’s vision to unleash American energy can be done safely.”
She added that she believes in Trump’s vision to right-size government, but she does not believe that eliminating the NIOSH coal programs and research will accomplish that goal. 
In an emailed response Tuesday, an HHS official said that “The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, along with its critical programs, will join the Administration for a Healthy America alongside multiple agencies to improve coordination of health resources for Americans.”

(Hal Brown for New Jersey Monitor)New Jersey prosecutors are asking an appeals court to overturn the dismissal of charges against George Norcross and his allies, arguing a Superior Court judge had effectively invented a new legal standard dissonant with existing law to toss charges against the Democratic power broker.
Judge Peter Warshaw in February dismissed the charges against Norcross and his co-defendants, finding the indictment against them did not state facts constituting extortion or criminal coercion and failed to prove racketeering and other charges lodged against the alleged criminal enterprise.
But prosecutors say in a new filing that Warshaw subjected the indictment to greater scrutiny than the law allows, made determinations that should be left to a jury, and dismissed the case under a standard not used in criminal law. 
“Instead, the trial court simply asked whether there was sufficient evidence cited in the Indictment itself, without reviewing the reams of testimony and exhibits the grand jury saw,” prosecutors wrote.
News of the filing was first reported by New Jersey Globe.
The state in June accused Norcross and others of leveraging threats and their control of Camden government to strongarm a developer into ceding property rights and of coercing the CEO of a Camden nonprofit to use a favored but less advantageous developer before pushing him to resign to make room for a patronage hire.
The charges, lodged against a man widely considered the most powerful unelected New Jerseyan, stunned the state’s political class but did little to diminish the influence of the power broker. Attorneys for Norcross and others have claimed the prosecution is meant to burnish Attorney General Matt Platkin’s image for a future run for political office, criticism they renewed after the case was dismissed.

Prosecutors’ new filing argues Warshaw made numerous errors in dismissing the case, including by improperly engaging in fact-finding, ruling on limited evidence, creating a new standard to review motions to dismiss on the sufficiency of evidence, and failing to properly apply that standard, among other things.
Motions to dismiss filed at such an early stage of a case are limited in their scope and can be based on procedural infirmities like a failure to provide notice, prosecutorial misconduct, or on claims that the law underlying criminal charges is unconstitutional, prosecutors argued.
They said dismissals based on the sufficiency of evidence would require the inclusion of evidence outside the four corners of an indictment and could only be granted if the facts contained in the indictment disproved the possibility of a crime, not whether they alone could prove the crime occurred.
“Nothing about the indictment introduces a ‘fatal flaw’ that more evidence — particularly the evidence that already went to the grand jury — ‘necessarily’ could not cure,” prosecutors said in their appeal.
Warshaw made the ruling without reviewing evidence provided to the grand jury that approved the charges. In their appeal, prosecutors said that evidence included more than 2,000 pages of testimony transcripts, over 6,000 wiretap recordings, and no less than 700 other audio files.
An attorney for George Norcross — who was charged alongside former Camden Mayor Dana Redd, NFI CEO Sidney Brown, Michaels Organization CEO John O’Donnell, and attorneys Philip Norcross (George Norcross’s brother) and Bill Tambussi — derided the appeal as a continuation of a prosecution the defendants have argued is politically motivated.
“The new filing is another failed legal argument by the Attorney General — the only difference is that this redux version is longer than the original. The fatal legal flaws remain. As has become obvious to everyone, Mr. Platkin’s obsession has been a political prosecution from its inception. We look forward to again rebutting his fatuous claims on the merits,” said Michael Critchley, an attorney for George Norcross.
Prosecutors argued that Warshaw erred by subjecting the prosecution’s 111-page indictment to a greater level of scrutiny than would be placed on a shorter document, noting courts have routinely rejected efforts to hold lengthier, detail-laden indictments to a stricter standard.
Even if the judge’s legal test was sound, prosecutors said, the dismissal must be overturned because he did not accept as true the indictment’s factual allegations or view them in the light most favorable to the state. They pointed to his ruling that alleged threats made by Norcross and others against Philadelphia-based developer Carl Dranoff were “hard bargaining” and “sabre-rattling.” 
“If a court has questions about what a threat means, or how a victim interprets it, the proper forum is trial testimony, or, at the least, a review of the actual evidence presented to the grand jury,” the appeal says.
The judge’s determination on the criminality of the alleged threats overstepped into improper fact-finding that ought to be left to a jury, as did his determinations about the intent of some co-defendants, all without a review of the evidence, prosecutors said.
Even if the judge’s finding that the alleged threats amounted to only hard bargaining were valid, prosecutors said, the indictment’s extortion and coercion charges should not have been dismissed because the indictment alleges Norcross and his allies controlled Camden government and used governmental power to pressure Dranoff into concessions.
“While defendants may incorrectly believe that wielding the threat of reputational and governmental harm to extract property or submission from others is permissible activity that ‘occurs every day in politics and business’ … New Jersey law, like the Hobbs Act, makes clear it is unlawful,” the appeal said.

,DC,2025-04-22 20:00:10+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Transgender troops ban, nationwide freeze argued in U.S. appeals court",Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/transgender-troops-ban-nationwide-freeze-argued-us-appeals-court,,"WASHINGTON — A three-judge panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on Tuesday grilled the Trump administration and the attorney for transgender service members who won a lower court order reversing President Donald Trump’s ban on transgender troops.One judge on the panel voiced serious concerns about the lack of evidence the Defense Department cited when instituting the ban, while another expressed skepticism that the lower court’s nationwide order — instead of applying only to the transgender individuals who brought the case — was appropriate.Administration officials appealed the case to the D.C. Circuit after district Judge Ana Reyes, appointed by former President Joe Biden, granted a broad preliminary injunction blocking Trump’s Jan. 27 executive order.Eight active-duty service members and transgender individuals who are actively pursuing enlistment in the armed forces brought the case against Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, among other officials and three branches of the U.S. military.Trump’s January order asserted the “adoption of a gender identity inconsistent with an individual's sex conflicts with a soldier's commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one's personal life.” Further, the order said that being transgender is “not consistent with the humility and selflessness required of a service member.”The Trump administration is expected to “imminently” escalate a separate case on the same issue to the Supreme Court, U.S. Department of Justice attorney Jason Manion said in court Tuesday.EvidenceJudges on the appeals bench queried both sides on whether the government has evidence to prove transgender individuals cannot fulfill military duties, and if the order bans all trans troops or only those diagnosed with gender dysphoria, a clinical diagnosis involving distress when a person’s gender identity differs from their sex at birth.“If the military said people with red hair are just too fragile and vulnerable, we are going to kick them all out of the military, and we are going to not allow any of them ever to join, and we have no evidence of that, but we think they're a threat to military preparedness, to unit cohesion, and too costly, and so we're just going to kick them out?” asked Judge Cornelia Pillard, who was appointed during President Barack Obama’s second term.Manion replied the transgender ban “policy relies on a condition that is marked by severe clinical distress.”Under military deference — meaning the courts generally defer to the president and military on national security questions — the judges should accept Trump’s and Hegseth’s word on the policy, Manion said.“If there are mental conditions that will impair someone's ability to function in the military, or that the military could rationally judge would impair that, then that's more than enough to satisfy rational basis review,” he said.Pillard pushed back: Isn’t that the case for all people wanting to join the military, not just transgender individuals? Thousands of transgender troops are already serving, she said.“If the concerns are with depression or suicidality, there already are standards that would screen someone out for those things, right?” Pillard said.Trial court ‘overreach’?Judge Neomi Rao challenged the plaintiffs’ likelihood to succeed, highlighting that the Supreme Court generally views broad orders from district judges as “overreach.”Reyes’ order covers all transgender troops and those seeking to enlist, not just the eight plaintiffs who brought the case.“The district court imposed effectively a universal injunction on this policy, going beyond any relief to these particular plaintiffs. So even putting aside the constitutional question, isn't the government likely to succeed on challenging this remedy?” asked Rao, who was appointed during Trump’s first term.Shannon Minter, civil rights attorney for the plaintiffs, said “the very nature of the injury” justifies far-reaching court protection.“This is one of those cases where the injury alleged resides directly in the categorical nature of the policy itself, which declares that transgender people as a group lack the virtues of honesty, discipline, selflessness, integrity, that as such, they have to be purged from the military because they're transgender, and because the government has this very negative view of what it means to be a transgender person,” Minter said.In a separate case, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court’s ruling that allowed transgender troops to continue serving, denying the government’s appeal.U.S. Supreme Court case upcomingJudge Gregory Katsas, appointed during Trump’s first term, asked Manion, “Can you tell us anything about the government's plans for seeking Supreme Court (review)?”“I can't give you an exact date, but it will be very, very quickly, very soon, and I think that may well be quite relevant to this court’s analysis as well,” Manion said.Lambda Legal and the Human Rights Foundation, who are representing plaintiffs in the 9th Circuit case, released a statement Tuesday afternoon saying they “stand ready to continue to zealously represent our clients as we have at every juncture.”“Transgender service members have been openly serving our country with honor and distinction for almost a decade and have met and are meeting every neutral service-based standard. The U.S. Supreme Court should reject the invitation to stay the district court’s injunction so that they can impose their discriminatory ban while the litigation proceeds,” the statement said.",,,,2025-04-22 16:10:23.762163

(Photo by Nathan Howard/Getty Images)As climate change drastically increases the frequency and severity of wildfires, power companies say they’re facing growing risk for payouts that could bankrupt them or require massive rate hikes on customers.
Across the West, electrical utilities are pushing state lawmakers to grant them legal immunity or limit damage payouts if their equipment sparks a blaze.
They’re backing bills, which have passed or been proposed in at least eight states over the past few years, that would require the utilities to follow plans to limit their risks of causing a fire, such as trimming trees or burying power lines. In exchange for taking those steps, lawmakers would give utilities protection from lawsuits that could expose them to billions of dollars in damage claims.
“We’re only one wildfire away from bankruptcy,” said Shawn Taylor, executive director of the Wyoming Rural Electric Association, a group that represents electrical cooperatives. “Even if we avoid bankruptcy, we’d have huge rate increases to cover the cost of a lawsuit.”
Already, utilities are facing soaring insurance premiums because of the magnitude of claims they would face if they caused a fire. Taylor and other industry leaders argue that power companies should be granted relief if they take actions to limit their risk.
In 2019, Pacific Gas and Electric Company in California declared bankruptcy over its roughly $30 billion liability from a series of wildfires caused by its equipment, including the devastating Camp Fire. And in Oregon, PacifiCorp is facing billions of dollars in damage claims due to its role in the state’s 2020 Labor Day fires. PacifiCorp has been a key player backing liability bills in five states, the Oregon Capital Chronicle reported.













We're only one wildfire away from bankruptcy. Even if we avoid bankruptcy, we’d have huge rate increases to cover the cost of a lawsuit.


– Shawn Taylor, executive director of the Wyoming Rural Electric Association





The proposals face strong opposition from wildfire victims, insurance companies and trial lawyers. Those groups say the bills don’t do enough to protect residents from dangerous electrical infrastructure. And insurers say their own customers could pay the price if lawmakers protect utilities.
“When you push in one side of the balloon, it comes out somewhere else,” said Greg Van Horssen, a representative for State Farm Insurance, delivering testimony before the Montana House Judiciary Committee in February. “If we have a problem with recovering costs for burnt-down houses in Montana, from an insurance company’s perspective, we only have one option, and that’s to raise the rate of homeowners’ insurance.”
 Western state legislatures consider laws to protect utilities from negligence charges

Utah became the first state to limit utilities’ liability when it passed a law in 2020. The law protects companies from negligence charges if they have a wildfire mitigation plan in place, and it puts limits on the damages victims can collect, using a fair market value figure that can fall well short of the full cost to rebuild.
This year, Idaho and Wyoming have enacted similar measures, and Montana lawmakers have sent a proposal to the governor. A bill in Arizona has cleared the House, while a North Dakota bill passed the Senate but was narrowly defeated in the House. An Oregon measure is still in committee. Alaska has also considered liability legislation in recent years.
Utah state Rep. Carl Albrecht, a Republican who sponsored that state’s liability law, said it has compelled power companies to trim trees, bury lines and take other steps to ensure they are complying with their safety plan. He said utilities are frequent targets of litigation.
“People look at the utility as deep pockets that can pay out a lot of damages,” he said. “It’s whoever has the best attorneys and can sell their case in court.”
Trump’s cuts to federal wildfire crews could have ‘scary’ consequences

Michele Beck, director of the Utah Office of Consumer Services, serves as an advocate for Utah energy customers. She said it’s difficult to protect electrical customers and wildfire victims at the same time.
“The costs for ratepayers are substantial, and it’s reasonable to try and find a balance between these extremely high jury awards,” she said. “I admit, it’s a devastating loss for people who are impacted [by wildfires], but somebody is also paying on the other side.”
In Oregon, consumer advocates are similarly torn.
“It is a difficult place to be, having utilities close to bankruptcy and unable to make investments that are necessary to provide service,” said Bob Jenks, executive director of the Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board, a nonprofit representing ratepayers. “At the same time, the principle that customers shouldn’t be bailing out utilities for bad practices is a critical standard.”
PacifiCorp says it faces more than $45 billion in liabilities, much of that driven by the 2020 Labor Day fires in Oregon. Multiple juries have found the company liable for failing to cut power to its lines. The massive costs PacifiCorp is facing have limited the company’s ability to invest in its infrastructure and clean energy, Jenks said. PacifiCorp did not grant a Stateline interview request, but the company has been involved in shaping legislation across several Western states.
 Legal immunity for wildfire liability? It may play out in court.

Oregon state Rep. Pam Marsh, a Democrat, said her bill would not give utilities legal immunity. It would establish a certification process to ensure utilities are mitigating wildfire risk.
“The utilities need somebody else to help them identify the risk they’re carrying,” she said. “We never meant that if you got a safety certification in April that you’re bulletproof over the next year for any sort of wildfire liability.”
But some legal experts told the Oregon Capital Chronicle that utilities would likely use their compliance with the certification process in a legal defense against wildfire claims.
In Arizona, a liability measure has passed the House and advanced in a Senate committee. The bill would protect companies from lawsuits if they follow mitigation plans. Utility leaders say it’s necessary to ensure they can continue providing service.

“Unlike other businesses that might stop doing business in an area where risk has grown too high, we have an obligation to serve customers,” said Joe Barrios, senior media relations specialist with Tucson Electric Power. “Wildfire liability costs and higher insurance costs are passed along to customers through the rates that they pay. [This bill] helps to maintain service affordability.”
But state Rep. Alex Kolodin, a Republican, believes the proposal violates a state constitutional provision that bars the state from limiting residents’ right to sue. And he said that limiting utilities’ liability will reduce their incentive to take safety measures.
“I wouldn’t want to be the legislator who voted for this, and then the utility causes a fire that burns down 200 houses in my district,” he said. “Then I have to explain to my constituents why they can’t recover any damages. ‘Sorry, guys, it’s because your legislator is an idiot.’”
Brandon Vick, a regional vice president with the National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies trade group, said utility groups have made a coordinated push across several Western states this session. He noted that more and more residents in fire-prone areas are going without insurance coverage, leaving them with no recourse if they can’t seek damages from a utility.
“Utilities are rightfully concerned that they’re gonna do something that causes a catastrophic wildfire,” he said. “The question we’ve been posing is, who should be responsible when that ultimately happens? [These bills] are really pushing that liability onto the people who can least afford it.”
Several states are also considering a wildfire fund similar to the one California enacted in 2019. Such measures allow utilities to set aside money, funded by a mix of rate increases and shareholder contributions, which they can later tap into to help cover damages caused by wildfires.
Marsh, the Oregon lawmaker, said her proposal would allow wildfire victims to quickly access funding to rebuild their lives. Residents would still have the option to forgo payouts from the fund and sue utilities for full damages. The bill died in committee amid opposition from wildfire victims who characterized it as a bailout for utilities.

(Photo by Getty Images)As top federal health officials are encouraging states to stop adding fluoride to public water, a Maine lawmaker introduced a bill Tuesday that would prohibit the practice in the state, drawing strong pushback from the dental community.
Introducing her bill during a public hearing with the Legislature’s Health and Human Services Committee, Rep. Jennifer Poirier (R-Skowhegan) said in written remarks that fluoridating drinking water is an outdated practice that undermines informed consent.
“Fluoridating drinking water amounts to mass medication without the ability to monitor individual dosage or gain consent,” Poirier wrote in testimony read on her behalf by Rep. Kathy Javner (R-Chester).  
Poirier’s bill, LD 1570, would repeal the law governing the process for a public water system to add fluoride, prohibit systems from adding fluoride and institute a civil penalty for intentionally violating the prohibition.
Communities have been adding fluoride to drinking water for decades to help prevent cavities by strengthening the surface of teeth and making them more resistant to decay. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website calls it “a practical, cost-effective, and equitable way for communities to improve their residents’ oral health.”
More than 60 community water systems that provide drinking water to more than 520,000 people in Maine currently add fluoride, according to information on the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention website. 
Current state law allows public water systems to decide whether to fluoridate drinking water with voter approval from the affected municipalities. Voters in Southwest Harbor, for example, decided to stop adding fluoride to their water in 2013 after more than 50 years of doing so, as reported by the Ellsworth American. 
With a shortage of dental providers in the state, multiple pediatric dentists and nonprofit dental organizations opposed the proposed ban, arguing it is the only source of oral healthcare many children in the state receive. Eliminating fluoride would cause more cavities, pain and other ramifications that come with tooth decay that they argued would be harder to treat with already long waitlists for patients to access dental care. 
Dr. Ashley Blanchfield with Augusta Pediatric Dentistry said she lived and worked in Juneau, Alaska, for several years after it stopped adding fluoride to its drinking water in 2007. She told the committee that she fears Maine could see the same negative effects she saw in children’s dental health in Alaska in the post-fluoridation years. 
Poirier’s bill comes after Utah passed a law in March becoming the first state in the nation to prohibit adding fluoride to drinking water. 
Earlier this month, U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. called on states to follow Utah’s lead by banning fluoride in drinking water and told the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention he wanted it to stop recommending it be added to public water. 
This comes after Kennedy criticized fluoride throughout his 2024 presidential campaign, saying it has been associated with negative health impacts. While ingesting too much fluoride can be harmful, those risks are associated with levels much higher than the CDC recommendation for drinking water.
Fluoride is naturally occurring in most water, but it is usually at levels too low to prevent cavities, which is why health officials have put forth suggestions for adding more. The CDC said it recommends fluoride levels equal to about three drops in a 55-gallon barrel; however, it is up to individual communities whether they adjust their levels to that recommendation. 
The CDC also named fluoridation of community drinking water one of 10 great public health interventions of the 20th century because of the decline in cavities since it started in 1945.

Barr’s announcement comes as no surprise after weeks of speculation following Sen. Mitch McConnell’s announcement in February that he would not seek reelection. McConnell has held the seat since 1984.  
In the video, Barr  denounces “insane DEI initiatives,” referring to diversity, equity and inclusion programs that Trump has banned in the federal government and is moving to end elsewhere. Barr echoes also Trump’s presidential campaign’s emphasis on transgender issues, vowing to “lock up the sickos who allow biological men to share locker rooms with our daughters.”

Republican Daniel Cameron, a former Kentucky attorney general, announced his candidacy on social media as soon as McConnell ended his announcement that he would not run. It’s Cameron’s first foray back into Kentucky politics after losing the 2023 gubernatorial election to Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear. Cameron reported having raised $508,000 for his Senate run as of March 31.
Meanwhile, Barr raised $1.8 million in the same period and has $5.3 million on hand, according to federal campaign finance reports.
Barr, of Lexington, was first elected to the House in 2013. Currently, he is a senior member of the House Financial Services Committee and chairman of the Financial Institutions and Monetary Policy Subcommittee. He also serves on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. 
Barr in December lost a Republican caucus vote to be chairman of the powerful Financial Services Committee, which oversees U.S. banking  and monetary policy. He had earlier said a House committee chairmanship would preclude his running for the Senate, McClatchy reported.
In the weeks leading up to Barr’s announcement, the congressman was among Republicans facing pressure from their constituents to have an in-person town hall over growing frustrations with President Donald Trump’s agenda. Last month, more than 900 people gathered for a town hall at the Kentucky Theatre in Lexington, but Barr declined to attend. He did have a telephone town hall days later. 
The Republican primary looks to be contentious between Barr and Cameron, particularly as they seek a coveted endorsement from Trump. Cameron had Trump’s backing for his failed 2023 race. Barr has recently emphasized his support for the president’s agenda and for his billionaire adviser Elon Musk. At a White House event earlier this month, Trump said while acknowledging Barr’s attendance: “Good luck with everything. I hear good things.”  
A possible third candidate, Lexington-based businessman Nate Morris, has also been mulling a run for Senate but has not made a formal announcement. Morris has gained the eye of Trump world allies, including the president’s son, Donald Trump Jr. Morris’ support for the president’s tariff plans was also included in a recent White House press release. 
On the Democratic side, House Minority Floor Leader Rep. Pamela Stevenson, of Louisville, has announced her candidacy for the race. Like Cameron, she was a statewide candidate in 2023, losing the attorney general race to Republican Russell Coleman. Rocky Adkins, a senior adviser to Beshear and former state House Democratic floor leader, has not ruled out a Senate run himself. 
Barr’s Senate candidacy now opens the race for Kentucky’s 6th Congressional District — a seat in central Kentucky that Democrats are hoping to flip. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee previously listed Barr’s current seat as one of the districts it views as in play heading into midterm elections in 2026.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screen-Shot-2025-04-22-at-3.37.44-PM-e1745351597737-1024x586.png,,,2025-04-22 16:10:23.762163

(Screenshot from news conference)New Mexico’s top state prosecutor says he will begin a formal investigation into what led up to the death of an Albuquerque teenager and the broader problems at the state’s beleaguered child welfare agency.
Searchlight New Mexico reports that earlier this month, 16-year-old Jaydun Garcia took his own life in a former Albuquerque halfway house built for girls transitioning out of juvenile detention.
New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez held a new conference on Tuesday morning announcing a formal investigation into Garcia’s death, but also other incidents of children who have been harmed while in Children, Youth and Families Department custody.
“The State of New Mexico failed to protect this child,” Torrez said. “The State of New Mexico has failed to honor its legal and moral obligations under a variety of legal agreements that they have entered into.”
Torrez said the public has very little information about what happened to Garcia, who was responsible for him in the days and weeks before his death and the decisions made and resources dedicated to preventing it.
“How can we expect to improve that system if we don’t know what happened, if we don’t have answers, if we don’t have transparency?” Torrez said. “I’m prepared to test the law in this space, and I’m prepared to advocate fundamentally for a change in the law, if that is what’s required.”
The investigation is not limited to Garcia’s death but will extend to state agencies charged with protecting children, Torrez said.
The Department of Justice will conduct “a comprehensive and wide-ranging investigation into various reports of children who have been referred to CYFD” as victims of abuse and neglect, placed in congregate care and other facilities, improperly housed at CYFD offices, sexually assaulted in those offices, or abused by armed guards in those offices, Torrez said.
“Enough is enough,” Torrez said. “I will not tolerate the excuses, the assurances, I think we have all grown tired of waking up and hearing about another child who’s been injured, another child who’s been hurt, another child in state custody who’s been killed, and for that reason, the New Mexico Department of Justice will initiate a formal investigation into the facts and circumstances that led up to the death Jaydun Garcia.”
New Mexico Child First Network Founder and Executive Director Maralyn Beck, a former foster parent, joined Torrez at the news conference, saying Garcia’s death was preventable.
“The signs were there, and we should not be housing our children in warehouses of neglect like congregate care,” Beck said. “One single call to Child Protective Services should have prevented this.”
She said what foster children need to heal from their trauma is homes, and excellent parenting through committed, developmentally informed relationships with adults.
“It is through transparency, it is through peeling back the layer of confidentiality to figure out what happened,” Beck said.
Disability Rights New Mexico Chief Executive Officer Gary Housepian also appeared alongside Torrez and Beck during the news conference. In a news release afterwards, Housepian said in a statement that Garcia’s death is “a devastating reminder of what happens when vulnerable children — especially those with disabilities or behavioral health needs — fall through the cracks of a broken system.”
“We’ve been raising alarms for years about placements in congregate settings, and it’s long past time for a comprehensive, independent investigation. We stand ready to coordinate our investigation of this death, monitoring of facilities and to support the Attorney General in demanding the transparency and accountability these children and youth deserve,” Housepian said.

Probe will guide new oversight office
The broader investigation into other incidents will develop a detailed record of events leading up to the deaths or great bodily injury of children under CYFD’s supervision but also the policies, procedures and people involved, the Department of Justice said in the news release.
The investigation will take several months, Torrez said. Its ultimate objective, he said, is to prepare a comprehensive report for the incoming Office of the Child Advocate, which New Mexico’s lawmakers created in the most recent legislative session and is administratively attached to Torrez’s agency.
That report will be “a blueprint of the issues that have plagued this agency and this state for decades,” Torrez said.
The Department of Justice said in a news release that the new office was created “despite Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham’s attempt to veto its funding.” Even though Lujan Grisham signed the legislation to create the office, she vetoed $1.65 million that would have covered the start-up costs to create it, and she and the AG’s office traded barbs over the bill.
Torrez said he does not yet know if CYFD will resist the investigation, and he hopes the governor’s rhetoric around the legislation and the line-item veto are “not indicative of the administration’s position moving forward.”
“I won’t be deterred in any way by the resistance of other stakeholders in this situation,” he said. “My hope is that can be avoided.”
Source NM sent emails to spokespeople for CYFD and the governor seeking comment and will update this story as necessary.
Torrez’s agency is also calling on current and former case workers, foster families, and youth impacted by the system to come forward with information by going to the “Get Help” page on its website or by calling (505) 490-4060. He also encouraged the public to sign up to become foster parents themselves.
He said he’s committed to getting the answers necessary “to move this state and this agency in a new direction.”
“It is my hope that by shining a light on the problems inside of the agency and on the problems that New Mexico has in protecting its most vulnerable children, that we will begin the necessary process of fulfilling not only our legal obligation to our most vulnerable citizens, but fulfilling our moral obligation to do right by these kids.”

(Main photo courtesy of the University of Iowa; form courtesy of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security)Four University of Iowa students and graduates from China and India, one of whom works for the state as an epidemiologist, are suing the federal government for revoking their status as students.
The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa, was filed by a UI College of Law professor on behalf of the four plaintiffs, identified in court records only as John Doe No. 1 through 4.

Named as defendants are Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, of which Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, is a part. Also named as a defendant is Acting Director of ICE Todd Lyons.
According to the lawsuit, each of the plaintiffs was admitted to the United States on an F-1 student visa. The plaintiffs claim the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has violated their due process rights by terminating their student status earlier this month without legal justification or explanation.
Since beginning their studies, the lawsuit claims, the plaintiffs have maintained their status as students, are in good academic standing and have not committed any serious criminal offenses. Three of the four are studying chemical engineering, economics or exercise science, while the fourth is working for the State of Iowa as an epidemiologist.
The lawsuit claims that on April 10, 2025, ICE abruptly canceled, without explanation, the plaintiffs’ status as students within DHS’ Student and Exchange Visitor Information Systems database. The same day, the plaintiffs each received emails from the University of Iowa’s International Students and Scholars Services informing them of the cancellation and the fact that the university was not responsible for the action.
Four days later, the lawsuit claims, three of the plaintiffs’ visas were revoked without explanation. The three each received identical messages from U.S. embassies, warning them that “remaining in the United States can result in fines, detention, and/or deportation,” and adding that “deportation can take place at a time that does not allow the person being deported to secure possessions or conclude affairs in the United States. Persons being deported may be sent to countries other than their countries of origin.”
Lawsuit alleges threats and coercion
The lawsuit is challenging what it calls the Department of Homeland Security’s “misuse of the Student and Exchange Visitor Information Systems to further unlawful ends,” alleging that DHS has initiated a policy of “coercing international students into self-deportation by leveraging ambiguous student-status revocations, coupled with visa revocation notices and threatening language.”
The lawsuit claims Homeland Security’s “lack of transparency and procedural safeguards created chaos within educational institutions and upended the lives of lawful F-1 visa holders.”
The lawsuit emphasizes that the plaintiffs are not challenging the revocation of their F-1 student visas but are instead challenging DHS’ termination of their student status to create a “pretext for future adverse immigration actions against them.”
The plaintiffs are now “experiencing intense mental and financial suffering because they cannot continue with their studies, and fear being detained and removed if they do so,” the lawsuit alleges.
The lawsuit also claims the Student and Exchange Visitor Information Systems database was created by Congress to be an administrative tool for oversight and compliance of international student visas and was never intended to be an “a weapon of immigration policy.”
Federal regulations prescribe the three specific circumstances in which DHS can terminate student status, such as unauthorized employment, providing false information, or committing a violent crime — and the plaintiffs allege none of those criteria apply to their case.
The terminations are without legal justification, have violated constitutional guarantees of procedural due process, violate DHS’s own regulations and policies, and are “far beyond DHS’ statutory authority,” the lawsuit claims.
The plaintiff’s petition describes John Doe No. 1 as an Indian national who resides in Iowa City and is a fourth-year Ph.D. student studying chemical engineering. He first came to the United States on an F-1 visa in 2021. The lawsuit alleges his only criminal history is a speeding ticket and a misdemeanor conviction for drunken driving.
John Doe No. 2 is a Chinese national and third-year undergraduate student who resides in Tiffin. His only interactions with law enforcement are alleged to be for speeding, driving without a valid driver’s license and a disorderly conduct conviction.
John Doe No. 3 is a Chinese national living in Iowa City and is both a third-year undergraduate and pre-doctorate student at the university. The lawsuit indicates he has been convicted of first-offense drunken driving, and has two speeding citations, one failure-to-yield citation, and one citation for driving without a valid driver’s license.
John Doe No. 4 is an Indian national, a master of public health graduate of the University of Iowa, and a practicing epidemiologist working for the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services. His only interaction with law enforcement is alleged to be an arrest for drunken driving that was later expunged from court records.
The plaintiffs are represented by University of Iowa law student practitioners Mikhail Acherkan, Jude Hagerman, Angela Pandit, Ian Reeves, Justin Rempe and Isabella Siragusa, under the direct supervision of Katherine Melloy Goettel, clinical associate professor at the university’s College of Law.
The Department of Homeland Security has yet to file a response to the lawsuit and, in response to a request for comment, provided only a statement “on background.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/U-of-I.jpg,,,2025-04-22 16:10:23.762163

(Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)State driver’s license offices in five Arkansas cities will be open Saturday to accommodate demand for REAL IDs, which will be required for all Americans to board flights or enter certain federal buildings starting May 7, the department announced Tuesday.
REAL IDs are signified by a gold star on a driver’s license or state-issued ID cards. The Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration has issued roughly 140,000 REAL IDs since Jan. 1, including 52,000 in March, bringing the statewide total to roughly 800,000, Secretary Jim Hudson said in a news conference.
All 134 DMVs statewide can issue REAL IDs in person, Hudson said.
The five offices open from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Saturday will be in Little Rock, Fayetteville, Jonesboro, Texarkana and Monticello, according to a news release.
“We will only be issuing REAL IDs in those offices this Saturday so we can focus on serving those customers who have the greatest need for it, particularly if you plan to travel in the coming future,” Hudson said. “…I don’t want anybody going to the airport and getting turned away and having their travel plans frustrated because you don’t have a REAL ID.”
Appointments for Saturday are recommended but not required, and people can schedule appointments on the finance department website.
REAL IDs began with a law passed by Congress in 2005 as a response to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Instituting REAL IDs statewide “will help fight terrorism and reduce identity fraud,” according to the finance department website.
Applicants for REAL IDs need to pay a $40 fee and provide the finance department with four different forms of identification:

A current driver’s license, state-issued ID, or school or work ID as proof of identity
A passport or birth certificate as proof of legal presence in the United States
A government-issued social security card
Two documents providing proof of address, such as utility bills or bank statements, issued within the last six months

The documents “all have to sync up,” making the process more secure than the one to apply for a regular driver’s license because it’s difficult to falsify all four documents, Hudson said.
Individuals who have legally changed their names will need to provide proof of doing so, such as a marriage license or divorce decree, according to the finance department.
Arkansans should remember that obtaining a social security card “may take a little bit of time” since the federal government must deliver it to the requester via snail mail, state revenue commissioner Charlie Collins said at the news conference.
Arkansas drivers can get digital licenses, but don’t get rid of your printed one yet

The federal Transportation Security Administration accepts passports in place of REAL IDs as identification to board a flight, but federal buildings under the jurisdiction of other agencies, such as courthouses and nuclear power facilities, might have different ID requirements for entry, Hudson said.
The finance department has been focused “on making the REAL ID process as smooth, convenient and accessible to Arkansans as it can possibly be made,” including by providing REAL IDs the day they are requested instead of mailing them to applicants weeks later, Collins said.
He added that about 20,000 Arkansans have opted into the finance department’s new option for a digital driver’s license, which also functions as a REAL ID if someone has provided the proper documentation.
Additionally, Arkansans can choose whether to renew their driver’s licenses for an additional fee while obtaining a REAL ID if the license has not yet expired, Hudson said.

(Photo by Getty Images)A House panel advanced a bill Tuesday that would prohibit health care providers from treating minors with sexually transmitted infections and diseases without their parents’ consent.
The proposals, HB 1505 and SB 1288, have cleared all of their committee stops in both chambers following the favorable House committee vote Tuesday, putting them closer to passage.
Under the banner of parental rights, lawmakers are pushing for the removal of exceptions entitling minors in Florida to privacy with doctors and medical providers to receive treatment for STIs, substance abuse, and mental health problems. In some cases, doctors can prescribe birth control to minors without their parents’ written consent.
“We believe that children and parents are going to be more engaged with each other. We’ve allowed the default in certain circumstances in this state to be institutions making a decision other than the family, where it should be,” said Lake Mary Republican Rep. Rachel Plakon, one of the sponsors of the bill, before the House Education and Employment Committee.
Reproductive rights advocates, Democrats, and some Republicans oppose the bill, saying it could restrict access to treatment for minors who can’t trust their parents.
The change could come at a time when Florida teens are contracting chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis at the highest rates since 2008, according to 2023 data from the Florida Department of Health. Those infections can be cured with antibiotics, but worsen if left untreated.
“I want you to remember that this is the Legislature that talks about life, and STIs that go untreated cause infertility, so that is not life,” said Michelle Grimsley Shindano, director of public policy for the Florida Alliance of Planned Parenthood Affiliates.
Although the bill originally also required parental consent for examination for STDs, the sponsors in both chambers changed the requirement to only apply to treatment and left the exception in place for minors whose parents are being investigated for a crime against them.
Plakon said that she wants to remove a “loophole” in Florida law that allows physicians to prescribe birth control to a minor if their medical opinion is that the patient would suffer health hazards otherwise.
“We just thought it was too vague,” Plakon said.
Another provision would require parents to opt into surveys at schools, including those regarding political affiliations, mental or psychological problems, sexual behavior, self-incriminating behavior, and religion.
During an emotional moment during the bill’s last committee stop in the Senate Monday, Stuart Republican Sen. Gayle Harrell teared up while she talked about her late husband’s work as an OBGYN treating young women.
“He would roll over in his grave right now. I’m a no,” she said.

(Graphic courtesy of the South Carolina Coalition Against Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault)On April 11, 2018, I received a call from Sgt. Stokes of the Louisville, Kentucky, police department’s Sex Crimes Unit. I could tell by his voice that something was wrong.
“Evelyn,” he said, “I hate to tell you this, but the evidence in your case was destroyed on June 30, 1982.”
Silence. His last words were “this never should have happened.”
The destroyed evidence was mine and my friends’ rape kits and the blindfolds used on us on Feb. 29, 1980, when we were abducted, driven to an unknown house, forced to remove our clothes and jewelry, thrown on the floor like trash, raped, sodomized and beaten by several unknown men all night long.
The next day we were driven to a place, fully expecting to be killed (and not really caring at that point), left alone, naked and badly beaten.
When the police found us, we were taken to the hospital where our wounds were treated, and a sexual assault exam was done. I still remember the cold steel of the exam table on my naked, bruised, exhausted body and the pain of having a small comb rake through my pubic and head hair.
The last thing any victim of rape wants is to be touched by anyone, and the only reason they justify the loss of dignity and discomfort of that exam is because they believe it will help identify their assailant.
Why else would an exam and sexual assault kit be so carefully collected?
After the initial shock wore off from that phone call, I felt a sense of determination that I hadn’t felt since that night when we tried to escape. I thought of my two daughters and what I would do if this happened to one of them.
I would say, “No, we are not going to accept this, we must do something to change this epic failure of our law enforcement and justice system.”
I reached out to the Julie Valentine Center in Greenville. I needed emotional support from revisiting that trauma, and I knew I had to share my story with someone who might be able to help prevent this from happening to other victims.
There had been news stories from all over the country about the backlog of rape kits. Thousands upon thousands had been sitting on shelves in warehouses, never tested, never even accounted for. Who knew how many had been destroyed like mine?
I began working with the Julie Valentine Center to gather statistics and educate legislators on the failure of local and state law enforcement’s handling of sexual assault kits.
It was astounding how many kits we discovered were A) sitting in labs across the state; 2) unaccounted for; and 3) how few had been tested compared to the number collected.
Shauna Galloway-Williams, the center’s CEO, and I made numerous trips to Columbia where I testified before House and Senate subcommittees and told my story over and over – every time with sweat rolling down my back.
Due to our efforts, the Statewide Sexual Assault Kit Tracking System (H 3309) was passed unanimously and signed into law on May 14, 2020!
It forced accountability of law enforcement, crime labs and medical facilities and most importantly, gave hope to survivors to know their kit wasn’t going to be destroyed or ignored.
Implementation of the tracking system faced delay after delay. In 2024, it finally went live across South Carolina for law enforcement agencies, medical facilities, and prosecutor’s offices.
I wish I could say that I have heard good things, but I haven’t.
A legislative audit of the State Law Enforcement Division’s implementation of the tracking system outlined many issues (which SLED disagreed with in its response to the report completed last October).
Some days I just don’t have the energy to keep fighting. Other days, I don’t want to stop pushing back.
I have to sustain hope that the identified issues will be addressed and that we all continue to push for timely testing of the evidence survivors of rape provide in the wake of such intimate violations.
I lost a huge part of my life because of what happened in 1980.
I am now stronger and proud I was a part of a major reform to empower survivors to demand accountability by those we entrust our literal DNA to.
Protect those sexual assault kits as the real evidence they are, test them, use them to prosecute and to convict those who commit these violent crimes before they hurt someone else.

(Hulton Archive/Getty Images).A significant rollback for child labor laws in Florida received approval in its third and final committee stop in the House on Tuesday. The same bill would speed up a state preemption of local living-wage laws in nearly a dozen cities and counties.
It added insult to injury to its critics via a late-filed amendment that would speed up a preemption against local-living wage laws in nearly a dozen Florida cities and counties that require their contractors to pay employees a wage that’s higher than the state’s minimum.
The original proposal (HB 1225), sponsored by Brevard freshman Republican Rep. Monique Miller, would allow employers during the school year to schedule any 16- and 17-year-old Floridian to work for unlimited hours and days without breaks. It would also allow employers to schedule 14- and 15-year-olds who have graduated from high school or are home or virtual-school students for unlimited hours and days without breaks.
Those specific provisions would repeal the existing prohibition on scheduling 16- and 17-year olds from working more than 8 hours in any day when school is scheduled for the next day, except when the day or work falls on a holiday or Sunday. It would repeal the limit for scheduling a 16- and 17-year-old to work no more than 30 hours in one week.
“Due to resurgence of apprenticeships and such, we want to reduce barriers to teenagers learning their trade and getting prepared for their careers,” Miller told the House Commerce Committee. “There are currently certain waiver programs that give government the power to decide whether or not teenagers should work. I believe that power rests with the parents.”
A similar proposal was introduced in the 2024 legislative session but was watered down, in part due to considerable pushback from the public. This year’s versions in the House and the Senate ignore that criticism — and come after the Orlando Weekly revealed that staffers within Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office emailed draft legislation to Miller and Jay Collins, sponsor of the Senate version.
Miller told lawmakers that one motivation for her bill was to eliminate “barriers” so that parents could decide what was best for their kids when it comes to early employment.
Tampa Bay area Democratic Rep. Michele Rayner asked Miller what barriers now prohibit parents of 16- and 17-year-olds in school to work more than 30 hours. Miller did not appear to directly respond to that inquiry, prompting Rayner to later say that she had been troubled that she could not get direct answers on a policy question.
“It’s disheartening and disrespectful to the process when decorum is sacrificed in the name of partisanship,” she said.
All of the Democrats on the committee and one Republican — Panhandle Rep. Michelle Salzman — voted against the proposal.
“This bill strips away any type of foundational oversight requirement for breaks, limitations of hours during school, under the guise of parental rights. Meanwhile, the bill has no requirements for parental consent, no requirements for a break,” said Orlando Democratic Rep. Anna Eskamani.
An amended version of Miller’s bill introduced on Tuesday added a provision that angered critics. It would speed up a law passed in a contentious bill a year ago to block 11 local governments in the state from requiring contractors to pay more than the state’s minimum wage. The provision would speed up the date that law will go into effect from September 2026 to September 2025.
When asked by Winter Garden Democratic Rep. Leonard Spencer why she was making that change in her bill, Miller said, “My understanding is that they were ready to move forward now,” without mentioning who “they” were.
That insertion did not go unrecognized by members of the public.
“These are working families that make currently $17.45 an hour,” said Jess McCarty, executive assistant county attorney for Miami-Dade County. “The new language on this 50th day of the session would take away health benefits. It would eliminate these living wages that are offered only on county contracts.”
“This amendment is a bombshell,” added Jackson Oberlink with the progressive group Florida For All. “This isn’t just about child labor anymore. It’s a full-scale assault on working people and local democracy. And worse, it sets a trap. This language opens up a section of law ripe for future anti-worker amendments to be slipped in at the last minute, circumventing the committee process and public testimony.”

While the measure’s passage now means it will go to the full House for a vote, its odds of ultimately getting to DeSantis desk for his signature remains uncertain. The Senate version (SB 918), sponsored by Hillsborough County Republican Collins, has only passed one of three committees to which it is assigned — and Tuesday was the last day that any committees are scheduled to convene in the Senate.
Minimum wage
Meanwhile, another controversial proposal that would allow employers to pay certain employees less than the minimum wage may also be dying in the Senate.
The legislation, sponsored by Lee County Republican Jonathan Martin (SB 676), says that if an employee is working a structured work-study, internship, pre-apprenticeship, or “other similar work” and voluntarily signs a waiver, their employer can pay them less than the state minimum wage, now set at $13 an hour. Parents and guardians must sign the wavier for employees under 18 years of age.
These “work-based learning opportunities” may not last longer than nine months or two full-time semesters in school consisting of at least 15 credit hours each.
Martin told questioning Democrats on the Senate Rules Committee on Monday night that he intends his bill to deal with what he described as a decades-long decline in the labor force for teenagers and young adults. He hopes, he said, that the bill could encourage employers to hire young people.
“I want to have more young adults or teenagers to learn basic job skills,” he said.
Floridians approved a constitutional amendment in 2020 raising the state’s minimum wage by $1 every year until it reaches $15 per hour in September 2026. The passage of that amendment immediately raised the minimum wage to $10 in 2021.
There is a no standardized definition of “internship” in Florida law, according to the Senate bill analysis.
With the clock approaching 8 p.m. on Monday night, Martin announced that he was temporarily postponing the bill — which might indicate its chances of passage are fleeting, as this was the last time the Rules Committee would meet this session.
Rich Templin of the Florida AFL-CIO said on Tuesday that the bill simply wasn’t ready for primetime.
“There was no agency authority, there was no parameters [in the bill] on how to set up an internship,” he said. “There’s no educational goals. There’s not even [a definition] of what a waiver form would look like. There would literally be no way for businesses to implement it, which would lead to failed attempts, lots of lawsuits.”
A similar proposal in the House (HB 841), sponsored by Ocala Republican Ryan Chamberlain, has cleared all of its committee stops and is awaiting a vote in the full chamber.

U.S. District Court Judge Charlotte Sweeney’s 35-page order […],"The ICE detention facility in Aurora. (Robert Davis for Colorado Newsline)A federal judge in Denver on Tuesday granted a motion for a temporary restraining order blocking the removal of detainees held in Colorado under the 1798 law that President Donald Trump’s administration has invoked to send hundreds of people to a brutal maximum-security prison in El Salvador.
U.S. District Court Judge Charlotte Sweeney’s 35-page order came one day after an initial hearing in the case, which was brought as a petition for habeas corpus and proposed class action by lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union, on behalf of two Venezuelan nationals held at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Aurora.
Sweeney’s order, which will remain in effect until at least May 6, applies to the two plaintiffs and members of the class they seek to represent — “all noncitizens in custody in the District of Colorado who were, are, or will be subject to” Trump’s March 14 proclamation invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. That could apply to more than 100 people detained at the Aurora facility, ACLU attorneys have estimated.

In addition to ordering that the Trump administration “shall not move Petitioners and members of the provisionally certified class outside the District of Colorado,” Sweeney instructed the government to begin giving at least 21 days’ notice to detainees targeted for removal under Trump’s proclamation.
“Such notice must state the government intends to remove individuals pursuant to the Act and Proclamation,” Sweeney wrote. “It must also provide notice of a right to seek judicial review, and inform individuals they may consult an attorney regarding their detainment and the government’s intent to remove them. Such notice must be written in a language the individual understands.”
Trump’s order invoking the Alien Enemies Act claims that the United States is under “invasion” by the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. It was the basis for the deportation last month of 137 migrants to El Salvador’s so-called Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT, where the U.S. government is paying for them to be held. At least 11 deportees were previously held in Colorado, attorneys for the plaintiffs said after Monday’s hearing.
Trump has pledged to begin sending American citizens to the CECOT facility, criticized by human rights groups for its crowded and abusive conditions. About 90% of the deportees sent there last month had no criminal record. At least one, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, was removed as a result of an “administrative error,” while advocates, attorneys and family members for many other deportees say that they were falsely identified as TdA members because of tattoos honoring family members or their favorite soccer team.
Other federal courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court, have ordered the Trump administration to halt Alien Enemies Act deportations and provide detainees the opportunity to contest their removal and alleged gang ties. But ACLU attorneys allege the administration is refusing to comply with that order and providing detainees with insufficient notice of 24 hours or less. Trump has also openly defied a Supreme Court order to “facilitate” the return of Abrego Garcia, leading some Democrats to declare a constitutional crisis.
Plaintiffs in the Colorado case are identified by their initials, D.B.U. and R.M.M. They both deny being members of TdA.
D.B.U. is a 32-year-old asylum seeker who has lived in Colorado with his wife and two children. R.M.M. is also a Colorado resident who is seeking asylum. He says that he fled Venezuela to escape TdA, which killed his wife’s father and uncle and which he fears will kill him and his wife and children.
Representing the Trump administration during Monday’s hearing, the office of the U.S. Attorney for Colorado argued that the court lacked jurisdiction in the case because ICE officials had determined that D.B.U. and R.M.M. are not covered by Trump’s proclamation. But the government’s attorneys could not rule out the possibility that that determination could change in the future, and Sweeney agreed with the plaintiffs that they had “shown a sufficient risk” of such a designation.
“It is not dispositive that D.B.U. and R.M.M. are not ‘currently’ designated as ‘subject’ to the Proclamation when the government may revise this designation at any time — and failed to eliminate that possibility, or the speed with which such re-designation could occur, when asked directly at oral argument,” she wrote.
“Practically speaking, a TRO would inflict little more on Respondents than ensure they adhere to the requirement the Supreme Court has already imposed on them: give Petitioners and putative class members adequate notice, with adequate time, to adequately pursue habeas relief,” Sweeney’s order added.
The U.S. Attorney’s office declined to comment Tuesday. Following the granting of the TRO, plaintiffs in the Colorado case are expected to file a motion for a longer-lasting preliminary injunction. Sweeney directed the plaintiffs to file such a motion, if they choose to do so, by Friday.
Echoing preliminary findings by other federal judges, including D.C. District Judge James Boasberg, Sweeney wrote that the ACLU’s challenge to the Alien Enemies Act removals are “likely to succeed on the merits.” The act has been invoked on only three previous occasions and only during war, most recently during World War II as the basis for the incarceration of noncitizens of Japanese, German and Italian descent.
The text of the act, passed during President John Adams’ administration at the height of an undeclared military conflict between the United States and France, refers to the “invasion” of or “predatory incursion” into U.S. territory.
“These words, fundamentally, demand military and wartime action,” Sweeney wrote. “The Proclamation makes no finding that satisfies these definitional demands. Thus, to the extent the Proclamation relies on the Act’s ‘invasion’ and ‘incursion’ provisions to justify its removal powers, it does so improperly.”

Utilities in Oregon and elsewhere are pushing lawmakers to pass liability protections, giving them legal immunity in exchange for following safety plans. (Nathan Howard/Getty Images)As climate change drastically increases the frequency and severity of wildfires, power companies say they’re facing growing risk for payouts that could bankrupt them or require massive rate hikes on customers.
Across the West, electrical utilities are pushing state lawmakers to grant them legal immunity or limit damage payouts if their equipment sparks a blaze.
They’re backing bills, which have passed or been proposed in at least eight states over the past few years, that would require the utilities to follow plans to limit their risks of causing a fire, such as trimming trees or burying power lines. In exchange for taking those steps, lawmakers would give utilities protection from lawsuits that could expose them to billions of dollars in damage claims.
“We’re only one wildfire away from bankruptcy,” said Shawn Taylor, executive director of the Wyoming Rural Electric Association, a group that represents electrical cooperatives. “Even if we avoid bankruptcy, we’d have huge rate increases to cover the cost of a lawsuit.”
Already, utilities are facing soaring insurance premiums because of the magnitude of claims they would face if they caused a fire. Taylor and other industry leaders argue that power companies should be granted relief if they take actions to limit their risk.
In 2019, Pacific Gas and Electric Company in California declared bankruptcy over its roughly $30 billion liability from a series of wildfires caused by its equipment, including the devastating Camp Fire. And in Oregon, PacifiCorp is facing billions of dollars in damage claims due to its role in the state’s 2020 Labor Day fires. PacifiCorp has been a key player backing liability bills in five states, the Oregon Capital Chronicle reported.
 










We're only one wildfire away from bankruptcy. Even if we avoid bankruptcy, we’d have huge rate increases to cover the cost of a lawsuit.


– Shawn Taylor, executive director of the Wyoming Rural Electric Association




The proposals face strong opposition from wildfire victims, insurance companies and trial lawyers. Those groups say the bills don’t do enough to protect residents from dangerous electrical infrastructure. And insurers say their own customers could pay the price if lawmakers protect utilities.
“When you push in one side of the balloon, it comes out somewhere else,” said Greg Van Horssen, a representative for State Farm Insurance, delivering testimony before the Montana House Judiciary Committee in February. “If we have a problem with recovering costs for burnt-down houses in Montana, from an insurance company’s perspective, we only have one option, and that’s to raise the rate of homeowners’ insurance.”
Utah became the first state to limit utilities’ liability when it passed a law in 2020. The law protects companies from negligence charges if they have a wildfire mitigation plan in place, and it puts limits on the damages victims can collect, using a fair market value figure that can fall well short of the full cost to rebuild.
This year, Idaho and Wyoming have enacted similar measures, and Montana lawmakers have sent a proposal to the governor. A bill in Arizona has cleared the House, while a North Dakota bill passed the Senate but was narrowly defeated in the House. An Oregon measure is still in committee. Alaska has also considered liability legislation in recent years.
Utah state Rep. Carl Albrecht, a Republican who sponsored that state’s liability law, said it has compelled power companies to trim trees, bury lines and take other steps to ensure they are complying with their safety plan. He said utilities are frequent targets of litigation.
“People look at the utility as deep pockets that can pay out a lot of damages,” he said. “It’s whoever has the best attorneys and can sell their case in court.”
Trump’s cuts to federal wildfire crews could have ‘scary’ consequences

Michele Beck, director of the Utah Office of Consumer Services, serves as an advocate for Utah energy customers. She said it’s difficult to protect electrical customers and wildfire victims at the same time.
“The costs for ratepayers are substantial, and it’s reasonable to try and find a balance between these extremely high jury awards,” she said. “I admit, it’s a devastating loss for people who are impacted [by wildfires], but somebody is also paying on the other side.”
In Oregon, consumer advocates are similarly torn.
“It is a difficult place to be, having utilities close to bankruptcy and unable to make investments that are necessary to provide service,” said Bob Jenks, executive director of the Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board, a nonprofit representing ratepayers. “At the same time, the principle that customers shouldn’t be bailing out utilities for bad practices is a critical standard.”
PacifiCorp says it faces more than $45 billion in liabilities, much of that driven by the 2020 Labor Day fires in Oregon. Multiple juries have found the company liable for failing to cut power to its lines. The massive costs PacifiCorp is facing have limited the company’s ability to invest in its infrastructure and clean energy, Jenks said. PacifiCorp did not grant a Stateline interview request, but the company has been involved in shaping legislation across several Western states.
Oregon state Rep. Pam Marsh, a Democrat, said her bill would not give utilities legal immunity. It would establish a certification process to ensure utilities are mitigating wildfire risk.
“The utilities need somebody else to help them identify the risk they’re carrying,” she said. “We never meant that if you got a safety certification in April that you’re bulletproof over the next year for any sort of wildfire liability.”
But some legal experts told the Oregon Capital Chronicle that utilities would likely use their compliance with the certification process in a legal defense against wildfire claims.
In Arizona, a liability measure has passed the House and advanced in a Senate committee. The bill would protect companies from lawsuits if they follow mitigation plans. Utility leaders say it’s necessary to ensure they can continue providing service.
“Unlike other businesses that might stop doing business in an area where risk has grown too high, we have an obligation to serve customers,” said Joe Barrios, senior media relations specialist with Tucson Electric Power. “Wildfire liability costs and higher insurance costs are passed along to customers through the rates that they pay. [This bill] helps to maintain service affordability.”
California fires show states’ ‘last resort’ insurance plans could be overwhelmed

But state Rep. Alex Kolodin, a Republican, believes the proposal violates a state constitutional provision that bars the state from limiting residents’ right to sue. And he said that limiting utilities’ liability will reduce their incentive to take safety measures.
“I wouldn’t want to be the legislator who voted for this, and then the utility causes a fire that burns down 200 houses in my district,” he said. “Then I have to explain to my constituents why they can’t recover any damages. ‘Sorry, guys, it’s because your legislator is an idiot.’”
Brandon Vick, a regional vice president with the National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies trade group, said utility groups have made a coordinated push across several Western states this session. He noted that more and more residents in fire-prone areas are going without insurance coverage, leaving them with no recourse if they can’t seek damages from a utility.
“Utilities are rightfully concerned that they’re gonna do something that causes a catastrophic wildfire,” he said. “The question we’ve been posing is, who should be responsible when that ultimately happens? [These bills] are really pushing that liability onto the people who can least afford it.”
Several states are also considering a wildfire fund similar to the one California enacted in 2019. Such measures allow utilities to set aside money, funded by a mix of rate increases and shareholder contributions, which they can later tap into to help cover damages caused by wildfires.
Marsh, the Oregon lawmaker, said her proposal would allow wildfire victims to quickly access funding to rebuild their lives. Residents would still have the option to forgo payouts from the fund and sue utilities for full damages. The bill died in committee amid opposition from wildfire victims who characterized it as a bailout for utilities.

(Photo courtesy Village Of Los Ranchos)A small team of state employees focused on solving New Mexico’s housing crisis will move from the governor’s office to the state’s workforce agency, a temporary move while the informal office seeks a permanent home. 
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has sought statutory authority for a state Office of Housing from the New Mexico Legislature for the last two years, but legislation doing so failed in both sessions. Legislation would have empowered the four-person team to create a statewide strategy to solve the housing shortage and attached it administratively to the New Mexico Department of Finance and Administration, which received more than $100 million this legislative session to spend on housing and homelessness.
In a news release Monday, the governor’s office said the move to the Department of Workforce Solutions will create a strong connection between job creation and housing, plus allow for more accountability after the state’s significant investment in solving the housing crisis here. 
Record number of housing bills introduced this session, but little to show for it, advocate says

“This move will ensure that the Office of Housing has the resources it needs to put these dollars to use solving our state’s housing shortage as we continue pursuing legislation to make the state’s housing and homelessness initiatives permanent,” Lujan Grisham said in a statement. 
The move comes a few weeks after the governor fired Daniel Werwath, her senior housing policy adviser tasked with, among other things, convincing lawmakers to approve a state Housing Office. Werwath told Source New Mexico after his departure that he tried to achieve “some systemic change around housing, which apparently there’s less appetite for than I had hoped.”
The state lacks more than 30,000 housing units, according to recent estimates. Employers in Albuquerque, where lawmakers hope the majority of new housing spending will occur, added 31,000 jobs in the last three years, but city developers added only 9,000 new housing units in that period, according to a January report from Pew Charitable Trusts. 
In the coming months, Workforce Solutions Secretary Sarita Nair will come up with a recommendation for the office’s permanent home, governor’s spokesperson Michael Coleman told Source New Mexico. 
“It could remain at DWS, move to another agency, or stand alone. There is no firm deadline for the recommendation. The governor is confident that DWS is the right place for the Office of Housing at this time,” Coleman said in an email Tuesday.
Nair, in the news release, said one of the state workforce’s biggest challenges is finding affordable housing. Merging the housing office and the workforce agency will enable “strong collaboration and accountability,” she said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/losranchos-1024x643.jpg,,,2025-04-22 15:08:12.852101

Bills become enrolled acts after passing through both chambers. All ten bills were due for governor action by Tuesday. 
Under Senate Enrolled Act 4, developers of long-haul water pipelines — defined as structures over 30 miles in length transporting more than 10 million gallons a day — must get the sign-off from the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission and seek certificates of public convenience and necessity.

It also includes strict permitting requirements for transferring water from one water basin to another. Braun’s signature comes on the heels of his Monday executive order to develop a statewide water inventory and management plan. 
Another measure, Senate Enrolled Act 143, would require courts to give deference to parental rights in disputes with government regulators. Opponents called the proposal too broad in committee while some supporters said it didn’t go far enough.
Of the ten bills signed Tuesday, only two are effective immediately. House Bill 1633 would direct the Indiana Secretary of State to study the scheduling of local elections and whether the state should require all counties to use vote centers. 
Another, Senate Enrolled Act 119, prohibits submitting applications for a certificate of public advantage after May 13, 2025, part of an ongoing effort to reduce hospital mergers. 
Just one measure signed Tuesday would be retroactive: Senate Enrolled Act 462, which would define practitioners as it relates to behavior analysts.
All other proposals would be effective on July 1, 2025, when the state’s next fiscal year starts.

Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/22/ct-appropriations-committee-budget-proposal/,"Panel to endorse new CT budget that aids schools, social services, but exceeds cap. Plan delays employee raises, big bump in Medicaid rates.","This story will be updated.
The legislature’s Appropriations Committee was poised Tuesday to adopt a $55.6 billion, two-year budget that invests in K-12 schools, higher education, child care and other social services — but would require Connecticut to legally exceed its spending cap for the first time since 2007 and reform another key savings program.
The package, released early Tuesday morning and expected to be adopted in the afternoon, also delays raises for most state employees for one year, cancels pay hikes for constitutional officers, underfunds guaranteed health care benefits for retired workers, and rejects bus and rail fare increases sought by Gov. Ned Lamont.
The Democrat-controlled committee would appropriate $27.1 billion next fiscal year, boosting spending 4.3% and exceeding the cap — which aligns spending growth with household income and inflation — by $131 million. Its budget would total $28.4 billion in 2026-27, growing spending 4.9% but falling $26.5 million under the cap in the second year.
A precursor to final budget negotiations with Lamont, the committee spending plan is more of a rough draft this year than in others. Any state budget adopted before the regular session ends on June 4 likely will be revised dramatically this summer or fall. 
By that time, Congress is expected to have completed an unprecedented plan to cut annual federal spending by $880 billion, reductions projected to cost Connecticut hundreds of millions of dollars in yearly aid at best, billions at worst.
“It’s going to be a balancing act that we still have to go forward with,” said Rep. Toni E. Walker, D-New Haven, co-chair of the Appropriations Committee. “It’s going to be painful.”
Even before reckoning with shrinking federal aid, committee leaders say they faced difficult decisions after a series of state budget caps forced Connecticut to save excessively for the past eight years, weakening many core services.
“This is a real budget for real people in real life,” said Sen. Cathy Osten, D-Sprague, the panel’s other co-chair. “We’ve heard people talk about what is important to them. This is what the people of Connecticut told us they need.”
Big investments in education
The committee identified many needs in education, particularly at the local, K-12 level.
Legislators pushed back against Lamont earlier this year, ordering $40 million in supplemental aid this fiscal year to local schools to offset what many called a crisis in special education. The School and State Finance Project, a nonpartisan education policy group, estimated districts needed $108 million.
The governor has proposed sending schools an extra $40 million annually for special education — but not for another two years. The committee budget released Tuesday maintains the extra $40 million in state payments in both the 2025-26 and 2026-27 fiscal years.
The panel also clashed with Lamont on the Education Cost Sharing grant, the main funding program to help cover local elementary and secondary school operating expenses. The committee proposed an extra $26 million in funding over the next two years combined to ensure that about 80 communities would not face a reduction in ECS as called for under the state’s statutory formula. The system weighs local wealth, enrollment totals, and past local education spending in calculating the state’s contribution.
Legislators and the governor also are expected to clash over higher education. 
The Appropriations Committee proposed adding about $15 million above current spending in each of the next two years to the Department of Higher Education, chiefly to fund scholarships.
And it added about $280 million over the coming biennium to support the University of Connecticut and its Farmington-based health center, as well as $146 million to back regional state universities and community colleges.
The governor, other moderate Democrats and Republicans have said higher ed institutions have amassed too much in reserves and should spend those down before they receive extra state funds.
The Connecticut Mirror reported in late March that the system overseeing regional universities and community colleges entered this fiscal year with $611 million in reserve, equal to more than 50% of annual operating expenses. UConn’s main branch in Storrs held a $171 million cushion equal to 10.2% while the health center had $297 million or 18%.
More funds for child care, social services – but little for Medicaid
The Appropriations Committee also took issue with Lamont’s plan to fund the hundreds of community-based, private, nonprofit agencies that deliver the bulk of state-sponsored services to people with developmental disabilities and patients struggling with mental health or addiction issues.
The industry says it loses hundreds of millions of dollars annually because state spending on social programs hasn’t kept pace with inflation for decades. 
Lamont proposed giving them an extra $31 million in traditional state funding next fiscal year, and $126 million more than current levels by 2026-27.
But part of the funding state officials used this year to pay for social services, about $50 million, involves temporary federal pandemic grants that largely have been exhausted.
Taking that hit into account, nonprofits would lose $19 million next fiscal year under the governor’s proposal. The committee would add $19 million in extra state funds to ensure there is no loss.
The committee did agree with a proposal from Lamont to take $300 million from this fiscal year’s projected surplus and create an off-budget account to fund investments in early childhood care and education for many years to come. The proposal has been criticized by Republicans, though, who note the off-budget fund is merely an accounting gimmick used to circumvent the state spending cap, which only covers appropriations from within the formal budget.
The committee plan is likely to draw criticism from some rank-and-file Democratic lawmakers for not following through on what many party leaders said was a major priority this year: boosting Medicaid rates for doctors who treat the poor.
The last broad-based rate adjustment plan took effect in early 2008, and critics say many children and adults enrolled in Connecticut’s HUSKY program effectively are uninsured, unable to find doctors willing to accept more Medicaid patients.
Earlier this year, Democratic legislators announced a plan to boost spending on Medicaid rates by $300 million by 2028-29, starting with a $75 million jump next fiscal year.
Instead, the Appropriations Committee plan hewed closely to the increased spending Lamont proposed in February: adding about $10 million next fiscal year and $25 million in 2026-27 for a much more modest, incremental bump.
Exceeding the spending cap for the first time in nearly two decades
Legislators faced many tough choices in this plan — even before cuts in federal aid have been ordered — because of a controversial series of state budget caps that a growing number of Connecticut officials insist need reform.
These “fiscal guardrails,” as supporters call them, have generated annual surpluses of $1.8 billion in their first seven years. Another $1.8 billion cushion is projected for the current year. 
These surpluses represent 8% of the General Fund, and critics say they have leached too many dollars away from education, health care, child care and other core programs.
The Appropriations Committee’s plan hinges on making two key changes to this “guardrails” system.
A program that has barred legislators from spending $1.4 billion in annual income and business tax receipts since 2017 would be scaled back by $300 million, effective immediately. 
And the spending cap that ties budget growth to household income and inflation would be exceeded and reset to allow an extra $131 million in appropriations next fiscal year. That can be done with a three-fifth’s vote in the House and Senate, provided the governor first declares a fiscal emergency in writing.
Lamont, a fiscally moderate Democrat who called the spending cap “sacrosanct” during a January meeting with state business leaders, is expected to challenge that aspect of the committee plan.
“My administration has stressed careful spending that can be sustained into the future,” Lamont said shortly after the committee plan was released. “Unfortunately, some portions of this budget proposal include spending that may not be sustainable and could unfortunately result in cuts or tax increases under future state leaders. Connecticut has gone down this road before and the result was financially harmful for taxpayers, municipalities and nonprofits.”
The governor added, “My administration will continue to meet with legislative leaders to find a compromise.”
Lamont wasn’t the only one criticizing the committee plan early Tuesday.
“This is fiscally irresponsible to say the very least,” said Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield.
“The fact that we’re going over the spending cap is definitely an area of concern,” said Rep. Tammy Nuccio of Tolland, ranking House Republican on the Appropriations Committee. 
Legally exceeding the spending cap is far from unprecedented, though it hasn’t happened in a long time.
Unlike the other “fiscal guardrails,” the spending cap has existed in various iterations since 1991, when it was enacted — and later added to the state Constitution — to temper public outrage over creation of a state income tax.
From the late 1990s through 2007, Republican Govs. John G. Rowland and M. Jodi Rell teamed up with Democratic-controlled legislatures to legally exceed the cap seven times.
The last time, in the spring of 2007, Rell and the legislature approved a new biennial budget that exceeded the cap by $690 million in the first fiscal year.
But those cap overruns largely have been criticized by both parties as excessive and irresponsible.
Nuccio also noted the new committee spending plan underfunds a major contractual obligation, heatlh benefits for retired state workers.
Comptroller Sean Scanlon recommended that the committee find another $228 million over the next budget cycle — in addition to what Lamont proposed — to cover this contractual obligation. The comptroller made a similar recommendation to the Lamont administration in December, but the governor didn’t add the money into his February budget plan. 
The committee also ignored this recommendation and, like Lamont, is hoping Scanlon can negotiate savings with the state’s health insurance carrier to at least mitigate this gap.
Delaying raises for most state employees
Because the new Appropriations Committee proposal already exceeds the spending cap for the upcoming fiscal year, the panel assumed raises for most state employees, which are due July 1, would be delayed at least one year.
The governor, who is negotiating with the State Employees Bargaining Agent Coalition, has announced no agreement to date.
SEBAC unions have received about 4.5% annual raises — a 2.5% general hike and a step increase that normally is worth another 2 percentage points — for the past four fiscal years. According to nonpartisan analysts, this year’s raises cost the General Fund about $120 million.
If Lamont doesn’t ask lawmakers to ratify a new wage agreement before the regular session ends on June 4, that doesn’t mean workers would forfeit raises. A pay hike eventually ordered for 2025-26 might be delivered late — as has been done on occasion in the past.
Other elements of the Appropriation Committee’s proposal include: 

Adding about $120 million over the next two fiscal years combined to the Department of Correction. State employee unions and many legislators say the department, which spends more on overtime than most agencies, is badly understaffed. The department is projected to overspend its salary account this fiscal year by almost $41 million.


Rejecting Lamont’s call to increase bus fares by 25 cents in 2026-27 and rail fees by 5% in each year of the upcoming biennium. Those changes would generate an extra $35.5 million and are necessary, the administration says, because ridership remains below pre-pandemic levels. 


Adding 53 employees to the Public Defender’s Office and 13 in the Secretary of the State’s Office.

When Gov. JB Pritzker tells audiences how he became interested in politics, it often starts with stories about his mother.

As a child growing up in the San Francisco Bay Area, Pritzker often shares, he’d attend marches, rallies and protests with his mother in support of abortion, women’s rights and LGBTQ issues. Those experiences, Pritzker says, set the foundation for many of his progressive beliefs.

“I’m living proof that introducing your kids to the gay agenda might result in them growing up to be governor,” Pritzker told a crowd at a Human Rights Campaign event in Los Angeles in March.

Pritzker has made supporting LGBTQ rights a regular part of his platform as governor, including speaking at dinner events for the HRC and Equality Illinois in recent months. He’s set to speak to the New Hampshire Democratic Party on Sunday – one of the first Democratic presidential primary states.

But some Democrats, who are often named as possible 2028 Democratic presidential candidates alongside Pritzker, think the party needs to talk less about LGBTQ issues such as transgender athletes.

“We weren’t good on the kitchen table issues; we weren’t really good on the family room — the only room we really did well on in the house was the bathroom,” former ambassador to Japan and former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel said on a podcast with California Gov. Gavin Newsom last week. “We not only look like we were on the cultural periphery, we look like that’s what was front and center for us.”

Newsom, who is also a second term governor like Pritzker, ignited a controversy among Democrats earlier this year when, in a separate podcast interview with far-right activist Charlie Kirk, broke from his party and voiced opposition to transgender women competing in women’s sports.

“I think it’s an issue of fairness. I completely agree with you on that ... It’s deeply unfair,” Newsom told Kirk.

Speaking in Newsom’s state last month at the HRC event, Pritzker avoided criticizing the California governor, instead focusing on what he describes as the Trump administration’s attack on individual rights. He warned Trump’s executive actions targeting transgender people in the military and in sports could one day lead to orders targeting marriage licenses for same-sex couples.

“I won’t let hope be a blindfold and I won’t continue to advocate that we wage conventional political fights when what we really need is to become street fighters,” Pritzker said in L.A.

The HRC dinner was another example of Pritzker introducing himself to audiences outside Illinois, but he told reporters at a recent news conference in Springfield that people shouldn’t draw conclusions about his remarks.

“I gave a speech about what I believe,” Pritzker said. “It wasn’t aimed at anybody. It wasn’t about creating a lane. These are things that I’ve said here in the state of Illinois. I repeated them in another venue. I’m perfectly happy about that. To the extent that people see it as a lane, that’s their view.”

Pritzker’s views are mainstream in the Democrat Party, University of Illinois Springfield political science professor Jason Pierceson said, who specializes on the politics of gender and sexuality. He said it’s Newsom and Emanuel who are trying to carve a more contrarian lane.

“I think it’s less that Pritzker is carving out a lane than about embracing trans rights and LGBTQ rights,” he said in an interview.

While Pritzker has not joined Newsom and Emanuel’s calls to avoid focusing on transgender issues, he has also suggested that Democrats make economic issues their top priority.

“Here’s where Democrats have to be honest with ourselves: Donald Trump didn’t just ride into power on the backs of oligarchs who wanted tax cuts so badly they were willing to throw a record stock market into the toilet for them,” Pritzker said at an event last month at the Center for American Progress in Washington, D.C. “No, a number of Americans, 49.8%, went to the ballot box agreeing with Democrat positions on the issues most important to their lives, and they picked the other guy.”

Gallup polling from September 2024 shows the economy was the top issue for voters going into the election, with 52% calling it “extremely important.” At the bottom of the 22 issues polled: transgender rights, with 18% of voters calling it “extremely important” and 36% saying it was “not important.”

“There’s a lot of intensity by activists, particularly on the right against trans rights, but I’m not sure that translates into votes for the median voter or the independent voter,” Pierceson said.

Pierceson said transgender rights get a lot of attention in campaigns, but voters aren’t making final decisions based only on the issue. That could mean Newsom and Emanuel are calling for an overcorrection to the Democrat platform.

“There’s a tendency I think in the professional political class to overestimate the conservatism of voters and to always argue that the most conversative position will be the most politically potent and powerful position,” Pierceson said.

Pritzker was confronted with polling data on LGBTQ issues during his first FOX News interview as governor earlier this month. The March FOX News poll showed 68% of respondents favor President Donald Trump’s executive order attempting to ban transgender women from women’s sports, and 54% support federal policy that recognizes only two genders. Pritzker brushed aside the poll.

“You can go issue by issue and you can ask a question whether people support this issue or that,” he told the FOX News host. “Here’s what people really care about: They care about their health care, they care about their affordability, they care about the kitchen table issues that really matter every day.”

Asked by a reporter last week about his response on FOX News, Pritzker said, “We’ve got to stand up for people’s civil rights. It is vile and inhumane to go after the smallest minority and attack them as if it’s something that is OK in this country.” But he pivoted back to Trump’s tariff policy and said affordability issues “are the ones that affect them in their homes every day.”

Pierceson said it’s too soon to know what the top issues in the next two election cycles will be, but the economy will likely be one of them. He also said rather than abandon LGBTQ issues in campaigns, Democrats should reframe the issue of transgender rights, adding he doesn’t expect most of the party to follow Newsom’s and Emanuel’s position.

“I think one of the things moving forward to think about is can Democrats move away from the athletic issue to a broader narrative about discrimination and maltreatment that maybe ties into some immigration issues and other arbitrary decisions made by the Trump administration,” Pierceson said.

(Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kathy Keck and Jacob Perron carried with them one large photograph and many memories of the late Mireya Keck, a child adopted into the family after suffering a brain injury when aggressively shaken at 7 weeks of age.
Keck spoke of Mireya while her sibling, Perron, held an image capturing a moment when brother and sister shared a laugh. The occasion was made possible, in large measure, by Mireya’s eligibility for Medicaid benefits that provided nursing services so she could live a life not available to her in an institutional hospital, Keck said. She died Jan. 30 2024, in hospice at home south of Topeka.
“Without Medicaid,” Keck said, “we wouldn’t have been able to keep Mireya living in a home where she was loved. She knew love and she knew great joy.”
Keck and Perron, who suffered a brain injury at birth that led to cerebral palsy and other disabilities, took part Monday evening in Medicaid forum with a couple dozen other people at the Topeka & Shawnee County Public Library. The event provided a forum to share thoughts about the value of Medicaid to people with disabilities, seniors in nursing homes or who get care at home, pregnant women or low-income youth in Kansas.
The event offered folks with personal insight into Medicaid the opportunity to speak to others with knowledge of how the national health program influenced quality of life.
But the ultimate audience was limited to six individuals — U.S. Reps. Sharice Davids, Traci Mann, Ron Estes and Derek Schmidt and U.S. Sens. Jerry Moran and Roger Marshall of Kansas. These elected politicians working in the U.S. Capitol could eventually be asked to vote on federal legislation — details aren’t publicly available — that slashed federal Medicaid spending over the next 10 years.
“This is not right or left. This is truly a human right,” Keck said. “Yes, we want to get rid of fraud. People using the support, that’s not fraud. That’s called helping people live their best life in the most respectful and dignified way possible.”
 
The budget knife
Medicaid is a joint federal and state program serving about 72 million Americans and 425,000 Kansans with limited income and resources. Forty states and the District of Columbia, but not Kansas, expanded eligibility for Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act to include lower-income adults.
In Washington, a U.S. House committee with oversight of Medicaid has been assigned the task of finding $880 billion in savings over the next decade. Medicaid funding flows directly to states, so reductions in federal appropriations for Medicaid would take the form of cuts to state budgets.
Ben Sommers, professor of health care economics at Harvard University and a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, said during an online briefing for reporters that most federal lawmakers, whether Republican or Democrat, were worried about how deep cuts to Medicaid would resonate among their constituents.
He said profound reductions could negatively impact hospitals reliant on Medicaid funding and other health care providers engaged in delivering Medicaid services. Eight rural hospitals in Kansas shut down in-patient services since 2015, Medicaid advocates said, and Kansas had more rural hospitals at risk of closing than any state of comparable size.
“Right now, we have big numbers to target,” Sommers said the $880 billion, 10-year objective. “We don’t have a lot of explanation of where that money comes from. That’s all kind of behind closed doors.”
Political rhetoric from House and Senate members keen to cut federal spending was often linked to the goal of addressing government waste, fraud and abuse.
“There is simply no way to get to a number that big through waste, fraud and abuse. There isn’t enough fat to cut from Medicaid to get there,” he said.
Sommers said it was important to acknowledge motivation to gut spending on Medicaid was to sustain tax breaks endorsed by President Donald Trump and “heavily skewed towards higher-income individuals.”
Adrianna McIntyre, assistant professor of health policy and politics at Harvard’s School of Public Health, said during the briefing there was genuine appetite among conservative Republicans in Congress to shrink spending on Medicaid. Implications of Medicaid adjustments for governors on both sides of the partisan aisle could be profound, she said.
“There are definite concerns among governors about sudden changes in Medicaid funding and what it could mean to hospitals and other providers for many low-income people to suddenly find themselves uninsured,” she said. “Generally speaking, if you’re saving money, it’s coming from fewer people having benefits.”
If federal aid was withdrawn, she said, state lawmakers would have the option of reducing the number of people enrolled in Medicaid or to fill the funding gap by raising taxes or slashing spending elsewhere.
 
Personal stakes
Lisa Collette, mother of a nonverbal child who qualified for Medicaid, took the opportunity to share her thoughts during the forum hosted by the Alliance for a Healthy Kansas.
Collette said it would be wrong to carve away an essential health programs because of the high human cost inherent in those budget decisions. Her daughter has a rare syndrome often linked to deafness and blindness, and she receives home nursing care through Medicaid.
“I strongly oppose these cuts because they affect the most vulnerable in our society — the elderly, low-income children and those with disabilities,” Collette said. “As a taxpayer, it’s frustrating to see that programs that benefit the most vulnerable are always No. 1 on the chopping block.”
Julie Avard, of Topeka, said her experience with dementia illustrated the value of Medicaid to families otherwise faced with personal economic ruin or uprooting of their work lives to care for someone no longer capable of doing that alone.
“Who is taking care of a loved one who has dementia or who is aging?” she said. “It gets harder and harder to take care of or to keep the person safe. Without Medicaid, we would be up the proverbial creek without a paddle.”
Rebecca Schultz, a former special education teacher from Leawood, said the electric wheelchair she relied on to be active and to participate in volunteer work or public advocacy cost $25,000. She’s not enrolled in Medicaid, but she said there was no avoiding the harmful outcomes if Congress reduced investment in Medicaid so people with disabilities have fewer support services.
“I’m fortunate. I’ve had a lot of supports in my life,” she said. “For the people that need it, let’s be human beings.”
The debate about Medicaid cuts were disturbing, said Topekan Elvera Johnson, who lives on Social Security income with her husband.
“This is not the time to recklessly cut Medicaid,” said Johnson, who suggested politicians look the example of others. “All people should have access to good medical care. It should be a given. Jesus helped people who needed help. He was a healer.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Perron-Keck-and-Mireya-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-22 15:08:12.852101

July 3, 2024. (Courtesy of Nebraskans for Medical Marijuana campaign)GRAND ISLAND, Neb. — The District Court of Hall County decided Tuesday to allow criminal charges against a notary public for “official misconduct” to proceed, overturning a lower court decision.
District Judge Andrew Butler, in a 10-page opinion, reversed a previous motion to quash against 24 counts of “official misconduct” — a Class II misdemeanor — against Jacy Todd of York, who was a notary for the successful ballot measures to legalize and regulate medical cannabis last year. Todd is believed to be the first notary criminally charged in this way.
Todd is accused of allegedly notarizing petition pages outside the presence of a petition circulator, Michael Egbert of Grand Island, on 24 different dates, each leading to a separate criminal charge. Todd has repeatedly denied all allegations.
Egbert admitted to using a phone book to illegally add voters to petition pages. He accepted a plea deal, reducing a Class IV felony charge to a Class I misdemeanor and $250 fine. Egbert said during a Lancaster County trial against the ballot measures that he has a mental condition that affects his memory.

Butler said he had to view the appeal from Hall County Attorney Marty Klein, who is working with the Nebraska Attorney General’s Office in the case, “in the light most favorable” to the State of Nebraska because Todd and his attorney have motioned to end the case. 
More facts are needed, Butler argued, and the “extreme outcome” of a motion to quash should be “rare.”
“Granting the motion to quash was not appropriate at that time when considering the facts most favorable to the nonmoving party,” Butler wrote. “Further, and most importantly to the court, a notary public is a public servant that is subject to civil penalties and criminal penalties if warranted.”
‘Integrity of our elections’
In a statement, the AG’s Office expressed gratitude for Butler’s decision.
“Notaries are public officials who play an important role in our election process to ensure that the integrity of our elections are secured,” spokesperson Suzanne Gage said in a statement.
As the AG’s Office considered an appeal late last year, attorney Mark Porto representing Todd said that “a series of politically orchestrated (and false) Class II misdemeanors are among the least scary and intimidating things” that Todd, a veteran, had ever seen. 
Porto did not immediately respond Tuesday to a request for comment.
Public servant or public duties?
Hall County Judge Alfred Corey in November ruled that notary publics were not public officials and agreed with the “motion to quash” from Todd and his attorney, Mark Porto.
Corey said that while important, notarial duties “hardly implicate responsibilities that go to the heart of representative government” and were “essentially clerical and ministerial.”

Butler said he did not see a distinction between different definitions of “public servant” across state laws and that notaries are “officers” who are appointed by the Nebraska Secretary of State’s Office to hold office.
“This language clearly shows that a notary public is a public servant as an officer,” Butler wrote.
‘Voice of its residents’
Butler questioned the extent of resources being used to pursue such criminal charges and the number of such charges “when looking at the current climate of the state and voice of its residents.” 
Nearly 71% of voters voted to legalize medical cannabis, and about 67% to regulate it.
“However, those decisions are left to another entity,” Butler wrote. “The court simply is tasked with applying the laws as written and, in this matter, the motion to quash should have been denied and the matter considered by a finder(s) of fact.”
The case returns to Hall County Court, unless appealed up to the Nebraska Court of Appeals.

(Photo: John Partipilo)The Tennessee Ethics Commission on Tuesday unanimously threw out a complaint against a Montgomery County Republican representative and admonished those who filed it after determining that the commission lacked authority to consider the case.
The complaint, filed April 3 by a group of current and former educators in Montgomery County, said Clarksville Republican Rep. Aron Maberry’s actions as a state representative violated his oath as a sitting Clarksville Montgomery County School Board member. 
The complaint cites Maberry’s vote in favor of House Bill 793 — which would allow school districts and charter schools to refuse to enroll students without permanent legal documentation — as a breach of his “duty to provide equal education opportunities and to refrain from using his position for partisan gain.”
The measure itself is on hold over concerns that its contradiction of the U.S. Supreme Court’s 1982 Plyler v. Doe ruling guaranteeing all children access to public education could result in Tennessee schools losing federal funding.

In an expedited hearing Tuesday morning, Commission Chair Tammy White said she was “extremely disturbed” that the press obtained copies of the complaint before it was filed with the commission. She also warned the complainants that filing “unsubstantiated complaints” could result in civil penalties against them.
“This body was not created to be used as a political pawn for headlines,” White said. “There should be serious repercussions for those who act in such a manner as this. And while I do applaud everyone’s political involvement and passion, matters like today should and can be resolved at the local ballot box.”
Tuesday’s special-called hearing, which would typically be confidential, was open to the public at Maberry’s request. The committee’s next regularly scheduled meeting is in August, which the commission deemed too far in the future to allow a complaint of this nature to go undecided.
Bill Young, the commission’s executive director, characterized the complaints as “policy disagreements” and said staff determined that the commission did not have jurisdiction to decide qualifications for office or compliance with the ethics codes of local bodies. The constitutionality of policy is litigated in court, he said.
The Tennessee constitution does not prohibit individuals from serving as both a state representative and a school board member.
Commission threatens action against complainants
Commission Secretary Duane Gilbert said the complaint was a “colossal waste of time, the state’s resources and employees.”
The commission considered calling for a show-cause hearing to determine whether the complainants should be penalized for filing the complaint, but ultimately decided against it.
White and Commission member Stacey Floyd-Thomas said they did not want this complaint to set a precedent for others. 
“Any further action in this manner would necessitate a show-cause hearing” where the complainants would be asked to show why their actions should not be considered reckless disregard, Floyd-Thomas said.
Joy Rice, a member of the group that filed the complaint, said she was “shocked” at the commission’s response.
“I didn’t realize I would have to bring an attorney with me to an ethics complaint,” she said. “I think … it’s a bullying tactic to make sure that nobody else complains.”
Rice said the complaint was not based on Maberry serving in two seats, but rather that “what he’s doing in one seat affects the other one.”
“He took an oath for the Code of Ethics in the school board capacity to represent all children, and then he went to the state and immediately … attempted to pass legislation that went in direct violation of that,” Rice said.
Karen Reynolds, who also signed the complaint, said she was encouraged by a school board member to file the ethics complaint with the state because the school board lacks a formal ethics complaint policy.
“That’s a lot of bullying up there, considering that basically they said they didn’t have jurisdiction,” Reynolds said. “We knew we would hit that wall, but I guess we didn’t expect — basically they tried to silence us by saying, get a lawyer or shut up.”

Maberry, who was also present at the hearing, said he was grateful for the commission’s decision on what he says is a “partisan attack” against him led by someone who he believes is “trying to stay politically relevant in the community.”
Reynolds, a Democrat, ran for the District 22 Tennessee Senate seat in 2024 but lost to Republican Bill Powers.
“Education and protecting CMCSS was the core reason that I ran for state senate, so I’m still going to stand up and do what I think is right for our schools and our children and our community,” Reynolds said.
Reynolds and Rice said their group will consider other paths available to them to pursue the complaint.
Maberry said every decision he’s made on the school board is “to better our public schools,” and his constituents at the state level voted him into office knowing that he intended to keep his school board seat. He does not plan to resign from the school board.
“I believe the message was sent clearly to Tennessee that if you’re going to come after somebody that’s duly elected and make up complaints against them, that you yourself need to make sure that it’s an actual complaint, because you could be breaking state law,” he said.",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/NEW-LEGISLATORS035-683x1024.jpg,,,2025-04-22 14:21:08.445122

Undertones of culture war politics were more on display during the second round of debate in the statehouse. State Sen. Barry DeKay of Niobrara —  in a nod to some national Republicans calling similar bans around the country an attempt to stop the “elitist” class from promoting unnatural foods — called lab-grown meat an attempt by groups to undermine Nebraska beef.
“I’d like to also share this quote from Bill Gates…rich nations should move to eat 100% synthetic beef,” said DeKay, who introduced the bill. 
 Joining other states

Nebraska is marching toward becoming the fourth state to implement a ban on lab-grown meat. Mississippi was the third state to outlaw cell-derived meat. Florida and Alabama have banned cultivating and selling meat grown in laboratories in recent years.
The proposed law doesn’t ban alternative-meat products like the Impossible Burger, which is made entirely from plants. The target is cell-derived meat produced from animal cells, enabling the cells to multiply and differentiate into muscle, fat, and connective tissue without slaughtering animals. The bill would ban the production, import, distribution, promotion, display or sale of any cultivated-protein food in the state.

State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln proposed an amendment to the bill that would have replaced the ban with labeling of lab-grown meat — a proposal supported by the Nebraska Farm Bureau. 
“I believe that’s a better, more thoughtful approach that’s in line with agricultural leadership thinking on this topic,” Conrad said.  “I think a ban is too restrictive.” 
The amendment failed with a 12-24 vote. 
Nebraska is the second-largest cattle-producing state in the U.S., behind only Texas. Cattle and other livestock production are among Nebraska’s largest industries, bringing nearly $31.6 billion to the state, according to the Nebraska Department of Agriculture. The Food and Drug Administration approved lab-grown meat for human consumption in 2022. 
“I believe it will only add to the arsenal group of individuals who want to engineer our dietary choices,” DeKay said in support of his proposed ban, “increasing pressures to legally, culturally deny real meat out of animal welfare activists.” 
Conrad questioned the DeKay claims of negative effects. Democratic aligned lawmakers said labeling is a better option because it is a more free-market approach. Rural State Sen. Teresa Ibach of Sumner preferred the labeling approach. 
“Because cattle is [Nebraska’s] number one industry,” Ibach said. “I will do everything to protect that. Banning it is not a bad thing.”
Ibach said she is fine with either approach and was marked “present not voting” for Conrad’s amendment.
 ‘Bioreactor meat’ 

California-based UPSIDE Foods, which sells lab-grown meat, sued the state of Florida for its ban on cell-derived meat last year. While a district court judge rejected Upside Foods’s request for a preliminary injunction, the lawsuit is still ongoing. 
Uma Valeti, CEO and founder of UPSIDE Foods, said he recently met with Gov. Jim Pillen about the potential ban and called it a productive conversation.
“There’s a lot of misinformation about cultivated meat,” Valeti said. “Banning cultivated meat won’t protect farmers; it will only limit Nebraska’s ability to lead, grow its meat production capacity, and weaken its food system.”
DeKay’s bill was introduced at the request of Pillen, who owns a major hog operation based in Columbus. Pillen has called the creation of “bioreactor meat” a “dishonest attack” on producers in Nebraska. 
The Nebraska Farm Bureau supported legislation that would label lab-grown meat but not ban it, saying the bureau supports a free and open market and believes that there is a much better option than a ban. 
State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha supported Conrad’s failed amendment. He said he and the Farm Bureau often disagree on issues. 
“If the (Farm) bureau and I are on the same side of something, that’s certainly something people should take seriously,” Cavanaugh said.

(Photo by Jackie Llanos/Florida Phoenix)The federal government is blaming a U.S. citizen for his arrest during a traffic stop in Leon County last week under a temporarily blocked state immigration law.
A senior official with the Department of Homeland Security said Monday that Juan Carlos Lopez-Gomez, a 20-year-old born in Georgia, was detained Wednesday after he told a Florida Highway Patrol trooper that he was in the country illegally.
“Immediately after learning the individual was a United States citizen, he was released,” a DHS senior official said in a statement Monday. “When individuals admit to committing a crime, like entering the country illegally, they will of course be detained while officers investigate.”
The trooper charged Lopez-Gomez following a traffic stop with illegally entering the state as an “unauthorized alien,” under a new state law that a federal judge temporarily suspended on April 4. Lopez-Gomez, released from Leon County jail Thursday evening, insists he told the trooper he was a U.S. citizen born in Georgia, handed over his Social Security card and Georgia ID, which meets federal security standards under the REAL ID Act of 2005.
The case garnered national attention following Florida Phoenix’s reporting on Thursday.
 Differing accounts

The arrest report states that Lopez-Gomez said he was in the country illegally and had entered Florida illegally, but turned over his ID. However, the arrest report doesn’t mention the Social Security card. The trooper stopped the car Wednesday morning because the driver was going 78 mph in a 65 mph zone, according to the report. Lopez-Gomez was a passenger in the car with two others on his way to a flooring job from Cairo, Georgia, to Tallahassee.
Amilcar Sales-Lopez, a family member of the driver and boss of the crew, said he arrived at the scene on U.S. Highway 319 because the men called him as they were getting pulled over. Sales-Lopez told the two troopers that Lopez-Gomez was a U.S. citizen, but first had to hand over his Florida driver’s license, he said in a phone interview with Florida Phoenix.
“He said I had to verify who I was or that they would arrest me,” Sales-Lopez said in Spanish.
“They wanted to intimidate me,” he added.
The arrest report doesn’t mention that Sales-Lopez was present during the arrest.
The 20-year-old’s first language is Tzotzil, a Mayan language, his mother told the Phoenix. He lived in Mexico from the time he was 1-year-old until four years ago, when he returned to Georgia.
The Phoenix has requested video footage of the arrest from the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles. A spokesperson from the department repeated in a statement to the Phoenix Friday that Lopez-Gomez had stated he was in the country illegally and that he had a federal detainer issued on him.
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement issued a detainer asking the jail to hold Lopez-Gomez for 48 hours after his arrest. A Leon County judge cited the ICE hold as the reason she lacked jurisdiction to release Lopez-Gomez, even though she found no probable cause for the arrest after inspecting the Georgia birth certificate and Social Security card his mom brought to court.
The ICE hold states that DHS determined Lopez-Gomez could be deported based on biometric confirmation of his identity and his statements to an immigration officer or “reliable evidence.”
DHS did not respond when the Phoenix asked whether the arresting trooper had federal authorization to act as an immigration official. Approximately 1,400 troopers have completed 40 hours of training to question and arrest people they suspect are in the country without authorization.
Although Attorney General James Uthmeier argues the federal prohibition on enforcement of the law, SB 4C, doesn’t apply to law enforcement, he sent a memo Friday to FHP, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, police chiefs, and sheriffs stating that they shouldn’t arrest or detain anyone under the suspended law.
U.S. District Court Judge Kathleen Williams extended her prohibition on the enforcement of Florida’s immigration law until April 29.

(Photo by Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)Both chambers of the Maine Legislature cast initial votes to pass legislation that would increase funding for sexual and reproductive health care services. 
The House voted 78-66 on Tuesday after the Senate passed the measure 21-13 on Thursday. However, enactment votes must still occur in both chambers and the bill needs to secure funding, which is tight this session as the state faces a substantial budget deficit.
The bill, LD 143, sponsored by Senate Majority Leader Teresa Pierce and nine Democratic co-sponsors, including both presiding officers, would provide an annual allocation of $6.18 million for what are considered family planning services, which include routine gynecological and well exams, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections, birth control, cancer screenings, gender-affirming and behavioral health care, among others. 
These funds would be in addition to the baseline $978,000 the state annually provides for family planning, which providers argue has been stagnant for a decade and is no longer adequate to meet needs.
Reproductive health providers call for more state funding as federal threats loom

Such funding is not used for abortions, though several people who submitted testimony against LD 143 falsely claimed the bill would fund the procedure, as did several lawmakers on the House floor on Thursday. 
Rep. Kathy Irene Javner (R-Chester) and Rep. Marygrace Caroline Cimino (R-Bridgton) requested on the House floor that the bill explicitly state the funds won’t be used for abortion. Rep. Michael Lemelin (R-Chelsea) said, “this bill comes as close to money laundering as I’ve ever seen,” claiming that the funding could possibly be used by healthcare providers for things such as spending in elections. 
“We can say categorically that these dollars are not used to support the provision of abortion care services, nor are they used to support political campaigns,” George Hill, president and CEO of Maine Family Planning, the statewide grantee for both federal and state family planning dollars, told Maine Morning Star after the comments on the House floor. 
Maine Family Planning and its sub-grantees, including Planned Parenthood, are subject to regular federal audits. 
“Not once in our 50+ years as the statewide grantee have we been found to be non-compliant on either of these baseless claims,” Hill said. 
Lisa Margulies, vice president of public affairs for Planned Parenthood Maine Action Fund, similarly told Maine Morning Star after the representatives’ comments that providers have robust systems for accounting and auditing to ensure compliance with all requirements of federal and state laws. 
“It’s unfortunate that we have elected leaders sowing confusion about this bill and what it would fund,” Margulies said.

Planned Parenthood of Northern New England, the clinical side of operations, and the Planned Parenthood Maine Action Fund PAC, which spends in elections, are also separate organizations, Margulies clarified. 
“The very reason that organization exists,” Margulies said referring to the PAC, “is because of the political attacks we face constantly in providing clinical care to patients through Planned Parenthood of Northern New England.” 
On the House floor, Javner and House Assistant Minority Leader Katrina Smith (R-Palermo) argued the funding should instead go toward labor and delivery units in Maine. Several maternity units have closed in recent weeks, in rural areas in particular, though their leadership have cited low birth rates rather than a lack of funding. 
The legislation ultimately secured the support of the Democratic majority on Tuesday, with some members of that caucus sharing personal stories to illustrate the broad array of services that constitute family planning. 
Rep. Cassie Lynn Julia (D-Waterville) said she was diagnosed with cancer at 18 years old at a center funded by family planning dollars. 
“If I didn’t have access to Waterville family planning when I was growing up as the child of a single dad, I probably wouldn’t be here,” Julia said. 
Providers say Trump Title X freeze will have devastating impact on tens of thousands of Mainers

Providers say the state funding increase is also crucial in light of President Donald Trump withholding federal funds to health care providers under what’s known as Title X, the country’s only federally funded program that supports family planning services. Providers in the Title X network have never been able to use the funds for abortion services, however those who offer such services are eligible to receive and use the funds for family planning services. 
Providers also pointed to possible cuts to Medicaid in the congressional budget plan when emphasizing the importance of state support. 
Maine Family Planning and its subgrantees serve roughly 31,000 patients across the state each year and more than 70% qualified for free or reduced-cost care in 2023. 
Last year, 47% of the patients served by Maine Family Planning were enrolled in MaineCare, the state’s Medicaid program, which is a joint federal-state program that helps cover medical costs for some people with limited incomes. 
This is not the first time providers and lawmakers have sought an increase in state family planning funding, though they’re upping their ask this year. 
Last session, Pierce sought a nearly $3.4 million increase. While that bill received initial support from both chambers and was approved to receive funding by the Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee, it ultimately failed because it wasn’t taken up for final enactment votes before session ended. 
LD 143 still needs to clear the hurdles that held up the legislation last year, all within a much tighter budget year. 
“While there’s a ton of budget priorities and there’s a lot of important things to fund, it is absolutely essential that we keep reproductive health care available to Mainers,” Margulies said.

Calling hours will be held Sunday from 3 to 8 p.m., and again Monday from 8:30 to 10 a.m. at Maceroni Funeral Home in Providence.
Ruggerio died Monday morning following a yearslong battle with cancer. He was 76.
A North Providence Democrat, Ruggerio was the longest-serving member of the Rhode Island General Assembly, including four decades in the upper chamber. Condolences and praise for his legacy and leadership has poured in from state and federal officials, local union organizers and advocacy groups.
The Rhode Island House of Representatives will honor Ruggerio with a moment of silence, followed by a prayer, when it meets at 4 p.m. today, Larry Berman, a House spokesperson, confirmed via email. 
A resolution in Ruggerio’s memory will also be introduced in the House, followed by tributes from House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi and Rep. Arthur Corvese, also a North Providence Democrat and a “very close friend” of Ruggerio, Berman said.
The Rhode Island Senate has canceled all sessions and committee hearings until after Ruggerio’s funeral. When the remaining 37 senators meet again, their first task will be to elect a new president. 
At least three senators — Sen. Ryan Pearson, Sen. Frank Ciccone III and Senate Majority Leader Val Lawson — are believed to be vying for the president spot, though none have publicly confirmed their intentions.
On Monday, Lawson walked away when asked at the conclusion of a State House briefing about the forthcoming president election. Ciccone has not returned multiple calls for comment. Pearson, who served as majority leader until he was ousted by Ruggerio last year following a feud between the two, declined to comment Monday on the election.
Gov. Dan McKee has ordered flags at state buildings and facilities fly at half staff until Ruggerio’s internment.

Glenn Youngkin. (Photo courtesy of John Reid)The Republican ticket for Virginia’s 2025 statewide elections is now locked in, after longtime Fairfax County Supervisor Pat Herrity announced Monday that he is withdrawing from the lieutenant governor’s race due to lingering health complications following heart surgery.
That clears the path for conservative radio show host John Reid of Richmond to become the GOP nominee for lieutenant governor — joining Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, who is now her party’s default nominee for governor after two challengers failed to qualify for the ballot, and Attorney General Jason Miyares, who is seeking reelection unopposed within the party.
Reid brings a long resume in Republican politics and communications to the ticket. He has served as vice chair of the Henrico County GOP Committee, was elected an alternate delegate to the Republican National Convention in 2020, and a full delegate last year. He is also the founder and chair of the Virginia Council, a group of educators and activists focused on preserving the state’s cultural heritage. 
Reid previously worked as director of editorial communications for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and as Senate communications director for former U.S. Sen. George Allen, R-Va. Earlier in his career, he served as president of the bipartisan U.S. Senate Press Secretaries Association and had the distinction of being one of the last interns to President Ronald Reagan. 
On Monday, Reid offered praise for Herrity and struck a unifying tone as the GOP closed ranks around its 2025 ticket.
“Pat has been a gentleman during this campaign and he has devoted many years of his life to serving the people of Fairfax and of Virginia,” he said in a statement. “We all owe a debt of gratitude to responsible men and women who step forward into the arena, sacrificing their time and often personal lives to offer leadership.”
Reid called Herrity’s decision to end his campaign “selfless” and said it provides the Republican Party with an early chance to rally around a full statewide slate. Positioning himself as a candidate focused on broad appeal, Reid said he’s prepared to carry the GOP banner across the state. 
“As I hope my travels across the state and work ethic have demonstrated, I take my new responsibility as the Republican nominee for lieutenant governor seriously. I will continue to work hard to be worthy of this opportunity and to earn every vote of Republicans, Democrats, and all those looking for a voice across Virginia.”
Herrity said in a lengthy statement that he made the decision “with a very heavy heart,” noting that while his doctors still expect a full recovery, complications from his March 13 open-heart surgery have made it clear that returning to the campaign trail at full strength won’t be possible in the near future. 
“Unfortunately, the 150 percent effort required for a statewide campaign would also significantly delay my recovery, put undue stress on my health and come with some risk,” he wrote.
The sole Republican on the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors and the only GOP candidate from vote-rich Northern Virginia in the statewide field, Herrity had been off the trail for weeks but still led all candidates — Republicans and Democrats alike — in first-quarter fundraising for the office of lieutenant governor, pulling in $540,000. 
That put him ahead of former Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney ($429,000), state Sen. Aaron Rouse, D-Virginia Beach, and physician Babur Lateef, both of whom raised just under $400,000. Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Richmond, raised $306,000, followed by former U.S. Department of Justice counsel Victor Salgado at $134,000.
Herrity’s exit leaves Reid as the lone Republican for the job, avoiding a divisive primary fight and allowing the GOP to fully consolidate its resources toward November. 
He also used the moment to urge continued support for the Republican slate, calling Earle-Sears “critical” to preserving what he described as Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s legacy. 
“If not, Virginia will lose its competitive edge with forced unionization, our neighborhoods will be less safe, education standards will again be lowered, California will determine what cars we drive and electricity will continue to be both more expensive and less reliable.”
Earle-Sears congratulated Reid on X, saying, “With Jason Miyares and our team, we’ll continue building on the meaningful results of the Youngkin-Sears Administration — making Virginia safer, stronger, more affordable, and with more opportunity than ever before.”
Democratic candidates were quick to offer words of support for Herrity’s recovery, even as they prepare for what promises to be a fierce primary battle.
“Wishing (Pat Herrity) strength and healing as he steps back from the LG race,” Rouse posted on X. “Praying for a full recovery for him and his family.”
Stoney added: “I am sending my best wishes for a speedy recovery to Pat Herrity. Brandy and I are thinking about you and your family during this time.”
Lateef struck a more pointed tone in his response, saying he hoped Herrity makes a full recovery and that he would be ready to take on Reid, “flip the lieutenant governorship, help win the governor’s and attorney general’s races, and expand the Democratic majority in the House of Delegates.”
Democrats have already secured their nominee for governor — former U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger was unchallenged for the party’s top spot. But the battles for lieutenant governor and attorney general remain crowded and costly.
Former Del. Jay Jones of Norfolk is attempting a political comeback in the attorney general’s race after his 2021 primary loss. He faces Henrico Commonwealth’s Attorney Shannon Taylor. Both are currently lagging behind Miyares in fundraising. Miyares raised $1.5 million in the first quarter, compared to $931,000 for Jones and $534,000 for Taylor.
Political observers say Herrity’s exit reshapes the dynamics for both parties.
“With the GOP slate now settled with Earle-Sears, Miyares and Reid, it gives the GOP some room to launch a coordinated campaign,” said David Richards, a political science professor at the University of Lynchburg. “Money they would have spent in a primary now can be spent in the general election.”
Richards noted the ticket’s diversity could be a strategic advantage for Republicans but warned of its ideological branding. “It is also a diverse ticket, which will be a selling point, but also a very pro-Trump, far-right ticket, which will be a difficult sell in much of Virginia.”
Democrats, meanwhile, are facing a double-edged sword. 
“That means spending money now and having less later,” Richards said. “On the positive side it means that the Democrats get a lot more attention as primary season rolls around in June, while the GOP gets sidelined until later in the summer when the regular election campaign season starts.”
Despite stepping back from the statewide race, Herrity said he remains committed to his role on the Fairfax Board of Supervisors and to helping Republicans in November. 
“My campaign was less about me and the lieutenant governor position and more about doing well in Northern Virginia so we could elect Winsome Sears as our governor and reelect Attorney General Jason Miyares,” he wrote. “I remain committed to the mission.”
Youngkin offered his support late Monday.
“After making a difficult decision today, Pat Herrity — one of Virginia’s strongest leaders — is in our prayers for strength and a full recovery. We’ll continue to fight alongside him as the best supervisor in Fairfax County,” he said. 
And while his recovery may be slower than expected, Herrity insisted he’s not down and out. 
“I can assure you that I did not have a stroke or heart attack and I am walking over three miles a day and climbing stairs.”

Members of a Senate spending panel on Tuesday agreed that there should be more oversight over the state program that pays health care costs for the poor, elderly, and disabled and passed SB 1060.
The bill, which heads to the full Senate next, establishes a Joint Legislative Committee on Medicaid Oversight to ensure transparency in the state’s Medicaid program, mostly administered through contracts with managed care plans.
It would require the Agency for Health Care Administration (AFCA) , which houses the Medicaid program and is charged with oversight, to by July 1 enter into a contract with the the state auditor general to maintain a data-sharing agreement. The auditor general is directed to assist the committee in its work.
With time ticking on the 2025 regular session, it’s not clear whether the bill will make it through the process, though. That’s because the House counterpart, HB 935, has yet to be heard in a committee.
Double checking AHCA
Sen. Jason Brodeur said he filed the bill because AHCA increased Medicaid reimbursement rates by $100 million over the amount that the Legislature appropriated in state fiscal year 23-24 to pay the plans. The agency, he said, held authority to increase the rates because Florida law authorizes agencies to make adjustments within 5%.
“So, this bill simply says we’re creating a joint committee with our own actuary. So that should we get those kinds of bills presented to us, we have our own folks we can ask to say, ‘Is this right?’ It may be. Probably is. But if we’re going to be spending that kind of money on a program this big, I’d like to have somebody who works for us tell us that’s the right number.”
The bill comes amid a whirlwind of controversy surrounding AHCA, its role in a Medicaid settlement with health care giant Centene that directed $10 million to Hope Florida Foundation, and the foundation’s contributions to political committees fighting a proposed constitutional amendment to legalize marijuana.
Health care giant Centene writes a $10M check to Hope Florida Foundation

Hope Florida Foundation meeting includes warning on tax status

The growing controversy, first reported by The Tampa Bay Times and the Miami Herald, has dominated the 2025 session and played a role in the Senate’s decision this week to not confirm two of Gov. Ron DeSantis’s choices to run large state agencies: Shevaun Harris as secretary of AHCA and Taylor Hatch as secretary of the Department of Children and Families.
Touching on the Hope Florida controversy, Sen. Jason Pizzo asked Brodeur whether the new joint committee would have authority over pre-suit settlements.
“I do not know,” Brodeur replied.
Pizzo followed, “Would you be amenable to taking a look as to whether or not the oversight board would be able to monitor pre-suit settlements of Medicaid overpayments?”
Brodeur said he would.
“It sounds reasonable to me, because the entire point of this is oversight to begin with. So whatever oversight that looks like, it should be comprehensive,” Brodeur said.

(Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)Attorney General Liz Murrill wants state lawmakers to pass a new law that would move hundreds of criminal cases with 15- and 16-year-old defendants from juvenile to adult courts every year. 

The request comes a few weeks after Louisiana overwhelmingly voted down a constitutional amendment that could have led to similar teenage transfers in the criminal justice system. 
Murrill included Senate Bill 74, sponsored by Sen. Alan Seabaugh, R-Shreveport, in her the package of bills she is pushing during the Louisiana Legislature’s 2025 session. As currently written, it would automatically put 15- and 16-year-olds charged with felony crimes who currently go before juvenile justice judges in front of district court judges who typically handle adult defendants. 
In an interview Tuesday, Murrill described the legislation as solely a “venue change,” meaning the teens would still be subjected to juvenile criminal standards and not face lengthier adult prison sentences. 
Opponents said the bill would throw four of the state’s largest court systems – in Orleans, Jefferson, East Baton Rouge and Caddo parishes – into chaos. Those jurisdictions have juvenile courts with judges who solely handle cases involving people under age 17. 
“Children are not simply tiny adults that you can handle in adult criminal court,” said Paul Young, a retired Caddo Parish juvenile court judge who opposes Murrill’s legislation. 
Other parts of the state would also feel the effects of the proposal. In some parts of Louisiana, city and parish courts handle cases with teenagers under 17. Like juvenile courts, their authority over 15- and 16-year-olds facing felony allegations would be transferred to district courts focused on adults if the bill passes. 
Critics say the public sent a clear message on moving minors into the adult criminal justice system in March. That’s when 66% of state voters rejected a constitutional amendment Gov. Jeff Landry backed that could have put 15- and 16-year-olds in adult prisons for a wider range of offenses.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 
The bill doesn’t go quite as far as the amendment could have. Fifteen- and 16-year-olds would still be subjected to lighter juvenile punishments instead of adult sentences, but the senator’s aim is to put more teenagers in adult courts. 
But Seabaugh said he planned to file his bill before voters rejected the constitutional change. 

“The bill is not a response to the amendment,” he said.

Instead, the legislation is a reaction to frustrations with juvenile court judges in New Orleans, according to Seabaugh and Murrill. They don’t believe those judges are giving out harsh enough sentences, and the gentler approach is contributing to a high crime rate. 
“The juvenile judges, particularly in Orleans Parish, are not doing their job,” Seabaugh said in an interview last week. 

Murrill doubled down on Seabaugh’s concern about juvenile court judges in New Orleans. She said minors in the city are not being held responsible for offenses they commit, 

But the attorney general is also considering ways to soften the proposal with regards to juvenile judges in other parts of the state because, she said, there are those who are “doing a good job.” 
Murrill may ask for an amendment to the legislation to give district attorneys and her office the option to move a felony case involving a 15- or 16-year-old to district court instead of mandating an automatic transfer. The change would help address problems with juvenile court judges in New Orleans, she said, while not yanking cases from other judges who are performing effectively. 
State elected officials like Seabaugh and Murrill, who call for stricter criminal measures, like to emphasize New Orleans public safety challenges, even though the city has seen a dramatic decline in its crime rate over the past two years. 

The New Orleans juvenile court judges also pushed back on Murrill and Seabaugh’s statements about their lack of effectiveness. Intake arrests for New Orleans minors were down by almost a third between 2023 and 2024, according to the New Orleans juvenile judges’ spokeswoman Yolanda Johnson. 

“The Court is perplexed by the inaccuracies being presented that is not supported by data,” Johnson wrote in a prepared statement provided Tuesday. 
There is also broad consensus that rehabilitation provided in the juvenile system – as opposed to punishment provided in adult prisons – is especially effective for teenagers because their brains haven’t fully developed yet. 
“There are tons of studies that show that is the worst thing you can do and all it does is create another generation of criminals,” Jay Dixon, the former state public defender in Louisiana who now works in Massachusetts, said about the plan to put more minors in adult court. 

”It is incredibly stupid and short-sighted,” Dixon said. 
But Seabaugh points out judges already handle criminal cases for minors and adults side by side in Louisiana’s smaller judicial districts. Rural courts, which have as few as two judges, don’t have the luxury of a specialty juvenile court. 
District courts with juvenile sections in Caddo, Orleans, Jefferson and East Baton Rouge parishes are already busy, however, and don’t have the capacity or facilities to take on a large influx of underage defendants, critics say. 
State laws require juvenile cases to be handled on a much faster timeline. Minors have to go to trial within three months of their arrest, whereas adult cases are allowed to languish for over a year, Young said. 

Juvenile cases also require judges to meet in person with minor defendants every six months while they are incarcerated. By contrast, a district court judge often never sees an adult convicted of a crime after their sentencing, Young said.  
District judges in the four parishes with juvenile courts are overwhelmed by their current workloads. Moving several hundred cases onto their dockets would cause severe scheduling challenges, Young said. 

“You can’t hold a child in limbo waiting for trial for upwards of a year or more,” he said.
District judges would also have to close their courtrooms every time they handle a juvenile case. Most hearings for adult defendants are open to the public, but juvenile cases have to be conducted in private. 

Transporting more minors and holding them in the courthouses could also prove difficult. Federal law requires underage people to be driven to court independently of adult defendants. They also have to be kept in separate holding spaces while awaiting their hearings, and some courthouses aren’t equipped to house them independent of adults. 
District attorneys and public defenders might also be forced to hire more staff to cover juvenile cases. 
“From a volume perspective, it’s going to cause issues,” said Michelle AndrePont, who runs the public defender office in Caddo Parish.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_5974-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-22 13:16:25.250182

(Photo by Getty Images; logo courtesy of CMS)With a Texas court striking down efforts to increase staffing levels in nursing homes, and Congress pushing back against those same efforts, the state of Iowa’s lawsuit to block the new regulations is continuing to move forward.
Last fall, Iowa joined 19 other states, including South Carolina, as well as representatives of the nursing home industry in suing the Biden administration to block the implementation of new staffing requirements for taxpayer-funded nursing homes.
The new standards would eventually require homes to conduct assessments of their residents’ needs, provide 3.48 hours of direct nursing care per resident, per day, and require then to have a registered nurse available 24 hours per day, seven days a week.
The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa, seeks to overturn those requirements, which were approved last year by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
In their court petition, the 20 states and more than a dozen industry associations argue that the staffing requirements pose “an existential threat to the nursing home industry as many nursing homes that are already struggling will have no choice but to go out of business. And the main victims will be the patients who will have nowhere else to go.”




Nursing home staffing lawsuit
Other plaintiffs in the Iowa-led lawsuit over nursing home staffing include: Nebraska, Kansas, South Carolina, Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Missouri, Montana, Oklahoma, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, Virginia, and West Virginia.
Co-plaintiffs include the LeadingAge lobbying and professional associations in Iowa, Nebraska, South Dakota, Kansas, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Missouri, New Jersey, Ohio, Colorado, Delaware, Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Michigan.




 Texas judge says CMS lacks authority

The Iowa lawsuit is nearly identical to a suit filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas where, on April 7, District Court Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk vacated the new requirements.
Kacsmaryk ruled that while the goals of the new rules were “laudable,” they were not consistent with congressionally approved statutes.
“CMS lacks authority to issue a regulation that replaces Congress’s preferred minimum hours with its own. That is exactly what the 24/7 requirement does,” Kacsmaryk stated in his ruling. “Congress took it upon itself to set the minimum hours nursing homes ‘must use the services of a registered professional nurse.’ It set that level at ‘at least eight consecutive hours a day.’ The 24/7 requirement in effect amends the statute because it strikes Congress’s ‘eight,’ and replaces it with the agency’s ’24.’”
The ruling was not unexpected. When the Texas case was filed, consumer groups noted that Kacsmaryk, who was the only judge to whom it could be assigned, had previously presided in multiple health care cases in which he had ruled against government regulators.
In the Iowa case, which remains active, a judge in January denied the states’ motion for a preliminary injunction to block implementation of the rule. Three weeks ago, CMS filed a brief in the states’ appeal of that decision — signaling that CMS, at least to a certain extent, still backs the new rule, despite the change in administration that took place in January when Donald Trump took office as president.
On the same day CMS filed its brief with the appeals court, the State of Iowa and its co-plaintiffs filed a brief in the underlying case, arguing that even if CMS had been granted the statutory authority to enact such rules, Congress’ delegation of that authority was unconstitutional. “If that authority justifies the rule, there is no limit on what CMS can do,” the plaintiffs argued. “The rule imposes billions of dollars in costs, overrides state laws, and effectively rewrites other provisions of the Medicaid and Medicare statutes.”
 Congress poised to block rule

Some consumer advocates believe CMS, now headed by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is angling for congressional action to block the new rules, so that government savings from repealing them can be used to partially offset a proposed $880 billion cut in the Medicaid budget.
Given that, as well as the potential for an Iowa court ruling that might conflict with that of Kacsmaryk’s decision, industry officials and GOP lawmakers are pushing for CMS to administratively repeal the rule or for Congress to simply block it.
U.S. Rep. Michelle Fischbach, a Minnesota Republican, told industry lobbyists recently that she believed the staffing mandates threatened rural nursing homes, adding that despite the Texas court ruling she would be pursuing “legislation because we need to make sure this rule is overturned.”
Fischbach first introduced the Protecting Rural Seniors Access to Care Act in 2023, shortly after a preliminary version of the rule was proposed by CMS. U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra of Iowa was a co-sponsor of the bill.
Fischbach reintroduced the bill in February of this year. In the Senate, James Lankford, an Oklahoma Republican, and Deb Fischer, a Nebraska Republican, have introduced a similar version of the bill.
 Iowa homes cited for lack of staff 

Last year, the Iowa Capital Dispatch reported that Iowa nursing homes had compiled the sixth-worst record in the nation for staffing-level violations. Data from CMS showed that 14% of the state’s 422 nursing facilities were cited for insufficient staffing in fiscal year 2023. That was more than double the national average, which was 5.9%.
Report ranks SC worst in the nation in nursing home inspectors

Only five other states — Hawaii, Michigan, Montana, New Mexico and Oregon — had a worse record of compliance with the sufficient-staffing requirement.
Des Moines’ Fleur Heights care facility compiled Iowa’s worst record of compliance.  Over a nine-month period between May 2023 and February 2024, Fleur Heights was cited, but never fined, five times for insufficient staff — more than any other facility in the state.
Federal data suggest many care facilities already meet the new standards, but industry officials allege nursing homes will need to hire an additional 27,000 full-time registered nurses and 78,000 full-time certified nurse aides, at a cost of more than $7 billion, to meet the requirements.
A report from the Long-Term Care Community Coalition earlier this year showed that 6 in 10 of all U.S. nursing homes would have met the new nurse-staffing standard of 3.48 hours in the fourth quarter of 2023.
The fact that a majority of facilities already meet the new minimum standard while still facing quality-of-care issues has been a concern for many advocates who say the new standards don’t go far enough.
They point to a federal study that shows each resident needs at least 4.1 hours of nursing care each day – a standard met by only 26% of all nursing homes nationally.
A University of Pennsylvania study recently concluded that the new staffing mandates, if left in place, would save roughly 13,000 lives per year. In Iowa alone, the researchers said, the mandates would save 101 to 250 lives per year.

As the chief of staff to former Democratic Gov.

Members at the time, from left, were Jim Martin, Whitney Smith, Robin Wheeler Sanders and Jeremy Schneider. Attorney Scott Pool, the commission's counsel, is at the far right (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).Last fall, St. Louis attorney Brad Ketcher read the news that a Republican candidate for the Missouri Senate was using money from his church to help fund his campaign.
As the chief of staff to former Democratic Gov. Mel Carnahan in the 1990s, Ketcher helped establish the Missouri Ethics Commission, a state agency that enforces campaign finance and ethics laws. 
He was so “appalled” when the Senate candidate in question won the seat in November that Ketcher filed an ethics complaint asking the commission to investigate.
But in April, he learned his complaint was getting thrown out because there weren’t enough commission members to convene a meeting to review it. 
“Because there were not four commissioners able to consider the investigation within the statutory timeframe, the commission could take no action on this complaint,” the commission said in dismissing the complaint. 
The complaint is among 16 others that have been dismissed in the more than 100 business days since the commission last had enough members to reach a quorum. It’s the second time in less than a year that the commission hasn’t had enough members to enforce state campaign and ethics laws. 
Missouri Ethics Commission finally has a quorum — but still can’t meet or take action

Ketcher refiled the complaint last week in hopes that the governor will fill the commission vacancies. When he served as Carnahan’s right hand, Ketcher said he’d never want to read a headline: “Governor fails to appoint ethics panel.” 
“Do I want that headline?” he said. “Hell no, I don’t want that headline. Even though there’s probably nothing nefarious going on, that’s what it looks like to the rest of the world — like you’re trying to hide something, you’re up to something or trying to protect somebody.”
A spokeswoman for Gov. Mike Kehoe, who was sworn into office in January, did not respond to a request for comment. 
On Jan. 13, former Gov. Mike Parson withdrew two commissioners who he’d appointed months earlier but who had not yet been confirmed by the Missouri Senate. That left only two of the six seats on the commission filled. The last time the commission had enough members to meet was Nov. 20. 
Ketcher said it’s challenging for the ethics commission to get a new governor’s attention in the middle of his first legislative session. 
“I would say it’s probably doubly a challenge for an acting executive director,” Ketcher said. 
Stacey Heislen, acting executive director of the commission, declined to comment. 
State law requires an investigation be completed within 90 business days of a complaint, which is then presented to the commission to determine whether there are reasonable grounds of a violation or whether it should be dismissed. 
However, for campaign-finance complaints 60 days from an election, the investigations must be completed within 15 days. The law also requires at least four commission members for a quorum, and at least four affirmative votes shall be required for any action or recommendation of the commission. 
The state faced the same problem last year for several months, before Parson appointed Jeremy Schneider of Macon in April, Whitney Smith of Des Peres in June and Jim Martin of Perryville in July. 
With Robin Wheeler Sanders serving as the chair since 2022, the commission finally had a quorum after those three appointments. 
However, only Sanders and Schneider remain after Parson withdrew his appointments for Smith and Martin. The law states the vacancies are to be filled within 75 days. 
“State government has made crime fighting a priority, and that should include enforcement of the ethics and nepotism and conflict of interest laws,” Ketcher said, “and they ought to move promptly to get a full commission in place to deal with those important issues.”
Missouri’s governor appoints commission members from nominations received by the congressional districts of the political parties that received the two highest votes for the last gubernatorial election.
Members are prohibited from running for office, making contributions for or against a candidate or issue, working as a lobbyist, for the state or any political subdivision, being an officer of a political party or participating in an election except for voting.
The state Senate must then confirm the appointments. 
For Ketcher’s complaint, he believes the Senate confirmation raises an “interesting” question.
The focus of his complaint is Joe Nicola, a Republican from Grain Valley now serving in the Senate and able to vote on nominees for the ethics commission.
“Let’s assume the governor does appoint some commissioners, is Nicola gonna basically get to vote for or against his jury pool?” Ketcher said. “And I think that will be a moment of truth for the state Senate and for him.”
Nicola told The Independent that Ketcher’s complaint was “ridiculous.”
“My church made donations to a PAC,” Nicola said, but he doesn’t believe it’s against regulations because his church isn’t a registered nonprofit.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ethics-Commission-II-20241016-1024x615.jpeg,,,2025-04-22 13:16:25.250182

For the first half of his career in law enforcement, working as a police officer in South Florida, Chase Fopiano did not think cyberattacks on police agencies were a serious threat.
Many of his law enforcement colleagues were under the same impression — that since they were the most likely to investigate the attacks, there was no way cybercriminals would go after them.
By about 2015, as technology advanced and hackers became more creative, that changed, Fopiano said. Now, from the U.S. Secret Service to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, there are thousands of attempts to compromise networks or organizations every day, he said.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“A lot of those [attempts] are toward government or even police, especially because they know that we’re not as prepared as we should be,” said Fopiano, who now oversees cybersecurity as part of a regional task force.
Spanning health care facilities to court systems, states and local communities are facing a rise in cyberthreats. They include threats to critical infrastructure, increased activity from foreign actors, continued ransomware attacks and more, according to a recent report from the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center.

But President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order shifting some of the responsibility from the federal government to states and localities to improve their infrastructure to address risks, including cybercrimes. And federal cuts have reduced resources for state and local officials, including a cybersecurity grant program and a key cybersecurity agency.
States and localities are taking steps to address the problems, such as establishing new penalties for tampering with critical infrastructure, centralizing state IT personnel and setting standards in areas from elections to health care.
But the Trump order and federal funding cuts, a shortage of IT experts at the local level and an overall lack of preparedness could weaken their efforts.
In December, a major cyberattack forced Rhode Island to take down its online portal used by residents to obtain Medicaid benefits and SNAP, commonly known as food stamps. The personal data stolen from Rhode Island’s public benefits network — including Social Security numbers and banking information — was later found on the dark web.
In February, a “sophisticated cyberattack” hit the office of Virginia Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares, which led agency officials to shut down computer systems and resort to paper court filings.
Last week, hackers also breached the computer network of the Fall River School District in Massachusetts. The school district is working with third-party experts and law enforcement to determine if anyone’s personal information was targeted, according to MassLive.
In 2023, of the 48 states that participated in the Nationwide Cybersecurity Review, a voluntary self-assessment conducted by federal agencies that examines how well governments are prepared to respond to cyberattacks, only 22 states reached or surpassed the recommended levels of security in their systems.










The notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.


– Samir Jain, Vice President of Policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology


Cybersecurity has become increasingly important over time because more government services and data are digitized, said Samir Jain, the vice president of policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology, a nonprofit that advocates for digital rights and freedom of expression.
But a national shortage of people with that expertise — especially at the local level — creates a challenge.
“The federal government has traditionally played at least some role in trying to fill some of those gaps,” Jain said. “And so the notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.”
Local governments and law enforcement agencies also have other priorities, Fopiano said. The police need cars, guns, shields and other resources that generally take precedence over cybersecurity.
Today, Fopiano is the cybersecurity chair of the Southeast Regional Domestic Security Task Force in Florida, overseeing cyber activity from South Florida to the Florida Keys. The attacks continue to rise, he said.
“Terrorist groups are getting into cybercrime, cartels are getting into cybercrime, you have kids just learning about hacking and just fooling around,” he said. “The audience of who’s doing it has definitely expanded and led to that rise in overall cybercrime.”

Cuts to federal resources

In 2022, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced a first-of-its-kind cybersecurity grant program, providing more than $1 billion in funding for states, localities, tribes and territories to address cybersecurity risks and threats.
The State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program, created under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, awarded $279 million to states and localities in fiscal year 2024. The Tribal Cybersecurity Grant Program awarded another $18 million for tribes in its first year.
But the grant program is set to expire in September, with no current plans to renew it. At a hearing this month, several state and local officials urged Congress to reauthorize the program. But U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who refused the federal aid during her tenure as governor of South Dakota, questioned the program’s efficacy.
The Trump administration is also cutting as many as 1,300 employees from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, which administers the grants alongside the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

The program has allowed states to assess the security of their networks, develop cybersecurity training, implement multi-factor authentication features — which requires users to provide more than one form of verification to access a site or service — and much more, said Alex Whitaker, the director of government affairs at the National Association of State Chief Information Officers.
“This has been a really great program because we’re seeing a lot of great evidence for how states and their counterparts in local government are improving their cyber defenses,” Whitaker said.
Counties also rely on a number of federal resources to strengthen their defenses, including services provided by CISA, said Rita Reynolds, the chief information officer at the National Association of Counties and managing director for County Tech Xchange. NACo is an organization that represents county governments across the United States.
The Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center, for instance — a key collaboration between CISA and the Center for Internet Security to help state and local governments with cybersecurity operations — lost some of its federal funding for certain programs last month, Reynolds said.
In trying to keep up with emerging threats, counties are still trying to find resources to help them implement multi-factor authentication, convert government pages to “.gov” domains and other methods of protecting their infrastructure, she said.
“Are counties prepared?” Reynolds asked. “I would say they’re not as prepared as they’d like to be. And in some cases, they are looking at how to strategically approach this now that resources are disappearing.”
In a statement, CISA spokesperson Jared Auchey said Trump’s executive order empowers state and local governments “to make risk-informed decisions and investments to improve their preparedness.” The agency will work with state and local officials to ensure they have the information and support they need, Auchey added.

Lawmakers step up

In 2024, 33 states adopted resolutions or enacted legislation regarding cybersecurity, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan public officials’ association.
Many of those measures sought to protect states’ critical infrastructure, including water systems, government services, health care and more. Florida, Louisiana, West Virginia and other states created new criminal and civil penalties for people who attempt to tamper with critical infrastructure.
In Minnesota and Washington state, lawmakers passed measures allowing or requiring state and local governments to invest in cybersecurity protections related to election administration. Connecticut and Florida also passed legislation to secure health care facilities from cyberattacks by having hospitals create plans or by supporting investments in new technologies.
Other states are looking for solutions from outside vendors. South Dakota has set aside $7 million for a company to examine local governments for vulnerabilities to hackers.

With attacks occurring at every level of government, New Mexico Democratic state Sen. Michael Padilla, the Senate majority whip, sponsored legislation in 2023 to create the state’s office of cybersecurity. As chair of the Senate Science, Technology and Telecommunications Committee for 10 years, he plays a significant role in most of the state’s cybersecurity legislation.
Through the committee’s work, Padilla says New Mexico is in good shape to fend off cyberattacks — and the state’s cities and counties are joining in.
“I think New Mexico is in a very good position because what we decided to do by creating that office is to ensure that any transactions that occur with state government here [in New Mexico] have to meet a minimum set of security standards,” he said.
In Indiana, Republican state Sen. Liz Brown filed legislation that would encourage state agencies and groups to develop cybersecurity policies. The bill was approved by both chambers, with the Senate agreeing to changes sent from the House.
“You have to protect your infrastructure,” Brown said. “We don’t want utility systems to be shut down. We don’t want wastewater or freshwater treatment plants or even the water supply being contaminated or harmed in some way. Our systems all have backups, but even so, we know there are bad actors.”
Some states are also preparing to reshuffle their offices or create new ones to centralize their cybersecurity efforts. Arkansas, for example, enacted legislation this month to create a new state cybersecurity office, which will monitor the state’s computer networks and respond to cyberthreats.

In Alabama, rather than having information technology people scattered throughout the government, Republican state Rep. Mike Shaw wants cybersecurity personnel centrally managed.
Shaw’s legislation, which passed the House and is currently in the Senate, would give the Alabama Office of Information Technology central authority to maintain the needs of all of the state’s departments.
The centralization would make it easier to pursue cybersecurity initiatives in the future, Shaw said.
“The federal government is really big, and it’s really hard to come up with a one-size-fits-all solution for things like cybersecurity, data privacy and technology in general,” Shaw said. “So, in some sense, it’s good that the states are coming up with their own.”

The Little Rock Black Nurses Association of Arkansas, the Arkansas Birthing Project and the Arkansas Minority Health Commission will co-host the event with Watershed, according to a Monday news release from LRBNAA and the Birthing Project.
Attendees will be able to receive health screenings from members of the LRBNAA and the Arkansas Medical, Dental and Pharmaceutical Association, and physicians in Little Rock and North Little Rock will accept referrals for follow-up appointments with individuals who do not have primary care physicians, according to the news release.
Roughly 30 vendors will provide “resources and information about pregnancy, general women’s and men’s health, mental health challenges, body mass index, tobacco use and cessation, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR),” the release states. The event will also sell food and drinks and offer door prizes.
Study: Disparities in Arkansas child health persist, especially for Black families

The Arkansas Birthing Project’s executive director is Zenobia Harris, a registered nurse and an advocate for improving Arkansas’ maternal health landscape for Black mothers. Arkansas’ Black maternal mortality rate more than doubled from 1999 to 2019, according to a 2023 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
Earlier this month, Harris expressed support for extending Medicaid coverage for postpartum women to 12 months after giving birth if they do not already qualify for the state’s Medicaid expansion program. A legislative committee voted down the proposed policy, and Arkansas remains the only state without some version of this coverage option.

Three people died in the collapse. Rescuers amputated the leg of a fourth victim to free her from the rubble.
Before the dust from bricks and other building materials settled, the community asked  how and why the collapse occurred, who was responsible, and how the city could avoid similar tragedies in the future.
The debris is gone now, and the dead are buried. But questions still linger — largely because local officials continue to use their power and pay attorneys to keep many pertinent documents secreted from journalists and concerned residents.
The Iowa Legislature intended just the opposite when it wrote the state’s public records law 50 years ago. Likewise, sound government does not act this way.
Iowa Senate adds restriction on Capitol security video to open records bill

The latest skirmish in this drawn-out fight over access to records and information comes courtesy of Scott County Attorney Kelly Cunningham. She asked the Iowa Public Information Board last month to ratify her belief that she can keep the report from an independent investigation of the collapse secret.
Her request for a “declaratory order” from the IPIB likely will hit the board’s May 15 agenda, when the staff is expected to recommend whether an Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation report qualifies for a disclosure exemption under the public records act.
While that contention is murky, this much should be crystal clear to the county attorney, the Iowa Public Information Board, and Davenport city officials:
The people of Davenport hunger for facts about the tragedy. They want to know what problems with the building’s structural integrity were reported by tenants before the building fell. They want the facts about the owner’s maintenance of the residence. They want to know the facts about what building code enforcement officials at City Hall did — and did not do — in response to tenant and neighbor complaints before the collapse.
Keeping the DCI report secret further dashes the already damaged public trust and confidence in how local elected officials acted before and after the collapse. Public distrust has intensified since Cunningham decided not to file criminal charges and, instead, asked the IPIB for help to keep the DCI report confidential.
The Iowa Freedom of Information Council, the nonprofit, nonpartisan organization I lead, believes nothing in the public records law prevents Cunningham from releasing the full DCI report, scrubbed only of birth dates and other private personal information about tenants or the names of any confidential sources.
Although Cunningham cites Iowa court decisions to justify her request to keep the DCI report secret, the public records law expressly says confidential documents CAN be made public by the lawful custodian of a record. In this case, Cunningham is that lawful custodian, so the choice is hers if she has the courage to make it.
In her request to the IPIB, Cunningham said, “The concern of the Scott County Attorney is the safety of the public and individuals who in some way were involved with the City of Davenport and/or were perceived to have had something to do with the building collapse. The public involvement and outrage surrounding the May 28, 2023 events has been immense.”
She also told the IPIB that Andrew Wold, the building owner when the collapse occurred, and his building manager have received threats to their safety and protests at their homes.
What Cunningham ignores is that the immense public interest in the DCI report comes from people who want to know precisely, and without spin or favor, what state agents found so the public can hold city leaders accountable for preventing a repeat of the tragedy.
The Iowa Supreme Court, in a 1998 decision, provided a very cogent explanation of the role the public records law has in matters like this: “The purpose of [the public records law] is to open the doors of government to public scrutiny [and] to prevent government from secreting its decision-making activities from the public, on whose behalf it is its duty to act.”
The United States Supreme Court had similar guidance in a 1980 case when the court said: “People in an open society do not demand infallibility from their institutions, but it is difficult for them to accept what they are prohibited from observing.”
The Quad-City Times summed this up nicely in a recent editorial: “How can we learn without all the facts? The facts don’t belong to public officials. They belong to all of us. Public information can be inconvenient and uncomfortable, but it is vital for a citizen-powered government.”
The message is clear. But why the Scott County attorney has not received the message is anyone’s guess.

(Photo by Antonio Cotrim – Pool/Getty Images)After weeks at death’s door and just hours before his demise, Pope Francis on Easter Sunday met with Vice President J.D. Vance of Ohio. Vance hadn’t been scheduled for an official visit with the pontiff, and the meeting called attention to an issue that has divided Catholics and prominent Republicans in Ohio since last summer — immigration.
Francis, 88, died of a stroke early Monday. Last month, he was discharged from the hospital after a severe health crisis that included pneumonia.
He had clashed for years with President Donald Trump over Trump’s treatment of immigrants. In 2016, just after saying mass on the Mexican side of its border with the United States, Francis said that anyone who advocates building walls is “not Christian.” The Vatican later denied that the remark was directed at Trump, but the president has steadfastly advocated for a wall as he repeats false claims about migrants.
While Trump has pushed for a wall, Francis fought just as hard on behalf of migrants from the time he became pope in 2013. During that time, anti-immigrant rhetoric around the world has grown, while the number of forcibly displaced people has more than doubled, to 120 million, USA Today reported Monday.
In a 2015 speech to Congress, the pope implored lawmakers to help those crossing the southern border fleeing persecution and seeking opportunity.
“Is this not what we want for our own children?” Francis asked. “We must not be taken aback by their numbers, but rather view them as persons, seeing their faces and listening to their stories, trying to respond as best we can to their situation. To respond in a way which is always humane, just and fraternal. We need to avoid a common temptation nowadays: to discard whatever proves troublesome. Let us remember the Golden Rule: ‘Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.’”
He reiterated those sentiments in Sunday’s Easter message.
“I would like all of us to hope anew and to revive our trust in others, including those who are different than ourselves, or who come from distant lands, bringing unfamiliar customs, ways of life and ideas! For all of us are children of God!’” it said.
Those words stand in stark contrast to the words and actions of Trump and his administration. He has referred to immigrants as “not human” and “animals” who are “poisoning the blood” of the United States. Trump and his allies have referred to undocumented crossings as an “invasion” even after the rhetoric helped spur a racist mass murder in El Paso in 2019.
Trump now is deporting or trying to deport hundreds of thousands who came legally using the CBP One app, unknown numbers of foreign university students.  He’s also dusted off a law not used since World War II to accuse undocumented migrants of gang affiliations and deport them to a notorious Salvadorean prison. The president has ignored court orders related to the latter deportations, and appears headed for a showdown with the U.S. Supreme Court in the matter.
Trump is also trying to end temporary protected status for hundreds of thousands of immigrants, including many Haitians in Springfield.
As the Caribbean nation has descended into chaos, those in the United States are terrified of being forced to return. But during a debate last summer, Trump repeated the racist lie that Haitians in Springfield were stealing their neighbors pets.
“In Springfield, they are eating the dogs,” he said. “The people that came in, they are eating the cats. They’re eating — they are eating the pets of the people that live there.”
In the ensuing furor, dozens of bomb threats were made against public buildings, including elementary schools.
As a U.S. Senator representing Ohio, those threats jeopardized Vance’s constituents. But he repeated the lies even after his staff knew they were untrue.
The episode divided some Ohio Republicans who also happened to be Catholic.
Vance became one in 2019. Gov. Mike DeWine is a lifelong Catholic who has stayed all executions since taking office and signed a harsh anti-abortion bill into law.
During last year’s firestorm in Springfield, the governor criticized Trump and Vance in the New York Times.
“I am saddened by how they and others continue to repeat claims that lack evidence and disparage the legal migrants living in Springfield,” DeWine wrote. “This rhetoric hurts the city and its people, and it hurts those who have spent their lives there.”
Less than two months later, Trump and Vance won the election. Then in January, the president of Haiti’s transitional presidential council met with Pope Francis at the Vatican and then said Trump’s planned deportations and aid cuts would be calamitous for his country.
In February, Francis wrote a letter to U.S. bishops saying that Trump would create a “major crisis” with the mass deportations he planned. The pope also slammed the interpretation of Catholic theology Vance used to justify them.
Vance had invoked the doctrine “ordo amoris” to claim that one should think of family, then community, then country ahead of the rest of the world.
The pope said that was wrong. He noted that Jesus himself was forced to seek refuge in a foreign land.
“Jesus Christ… did not live apart from the difficult experience of being expelled from his own land because of an imminent risk to his life, and from the experience of having to take refuge in a society and a culture foreign to his own,” Francis said in his letter.
He added that people should consider all as being part of their families and communities.
“The true ordo amoris that must be promoted is that which we discover by meditating constantly on the parable of the ‘Good Samaritan‘ that is, by meditating on the love that builds a fraternity open to all, without exception,” the pope said.
He then sank into a 38-day hospitalization. Then he rallied, defied doctors’ orders and spent a busy Easter Sunday, the most important day on the Christian calendar. And he made room for a brief meeting with Vance as one of his last acts.
Coming a day after the pope’s lieutenants said they talked to Vance about “difficult humanitarian situations, with particular attention to migrants, refugees, and prisoners,” the meeting seemed intended to send a message. “Pope Francis Gave JD Vance a serious lesson just hours before he died,” was the title of a column Hafiz Rashid wrote in The New Republic.
Vance honored the pontiff after his passing in a post on X. But he made no mention of migrants.
“I just learned of the passing of Pope Francis. My heart goes out to the millions of Christians all over the world who loved him,” he said. “I was happy to see him yesterday, though he was obviously very ill. But I’ll always remember him for the… homily he gave in the very early days of COVID. It was really quite beautiful. May God rest his soul.”
For his part, DeWine acknowledged the pope’s relentless advocacy for migrants.
“He was an inspiration to us and to millions around the world,” DeWine said in a written statement. “His genuine love of and devotion to all people — the poor, the unborn, those without a home, those emigrating to build a better life for themselves and their families, those of all faiths, and those with no faith — was evidenced to the world from the day he was selected to serve as Pope until his last public appearance on Easter Sunday.”

(Photo by Megan Gleason / Source NM)Tree deaths in New Mexico forests have doubled since 2023, according to a state survey released Monday, driven by insects and stress from prolonged warmer conditions.
Those deaths include 70,000 acres of conifer trees  in 2024, more than twice the 33,000 acres recorded the year prior.
Native insects largely drove the tree damage, according to Victor Lucero, coordinator for the state Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department’s Forest Health Program.
“Especially in bark beetles, longer, warmer and drier conditions stretching further into the fall, these insects can increase the number of generations they have each season,” Lucero told Source NM.
The New Mexico Forest Health Conditions 2024 survey assessed approximately 14 million acres of forests by air across state, private, federal and tribal forests. About 406,000 acres showed damage from disease, insects and drought, a growth of 12%, with 42,000 more acres than last year.
Wildfire also played a role.
Officials surveyed forests surrounding the Hermit’s Peak-Calf Canyon and McBride fire burn scars for the 2024 survey, following a  one-year pause because fire damage looks similar  to disease or insect damage.
Stands of trees that initially survived the fires in both burn scars experienced heavy impacts from bark-beetle activity recorded this year, Lucero said, with long-term stress from drought and the fires reducing the trees’ ability to create sap and resin to defend against the insects.
Beyond the beetle, the trees suffered an increase in defoliation, or the loss of needles or leaves, from insects such as caterpillars of the Douglas-fir tussock moth, which defoliated 18,000 acres within mixed conifer forests — a jump from last year due to wetter conditions.
Drought conditions, which have been ongoing for decades in New Mexico, eased slightly last year, with a strong monsoon system offering relief in the forests, reducing heat and drought impacts by 65%.
However, New Mexico’s warming climate will stress forests and promote longer insect seasons, Lucero said.
“As conditions continue to be hotter and drier, forests and woodlands need to be managed for those conditions,” he said. “That translates to managing forests by thinning — reducing the number of trees competing for water, sunlight and soil volume.”
Lucero said he understands this may seem counterintuitive.
“We want to save the forest, and we want to thin the forest to save it,” he said. “With drought and warming conditions, we want healthy trees that can naturally combat the attacks made by insects.”

The University of Louisiana at Lafayette is developing an artificial intelligence and data analysis tool the Louisiana Department of Health will use to fight “fraud, waste and abuse,” state officials said. The university is developing the technology that could be deployed within a week to begin looking for instances of fraud in the Medicaid program, ULL Vice President for Research Ramesh Kolluru said in an interview.
“We are committed to improving government efficiencies in Louisiana using innovation,” Kolluru said. “Our first mission … is to improve efficiency and integrity of the Louisiana Medicaid program.” 
The state health department has created a “Fighting Fraud, Waste and Abuse” task force to detect wrongdoing within Medicaid, Undersecretary Drew Maranto said. The agency will partner with LA DOGE, Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry’s version of Elon Musk’s controversial Department of Government Efficiency. A Medicaid fraud control unit already exist
The AI technology is being trained on national data and peer-reviewed publications that have identified fraud, and it will then be tasked with finding similar patterns in Louisiana’s Medicaid data, Kolluru said. Staff within the Louisiana Department of Health will verify any findings, he added. 
Maranto said the department will also be working with the state Office of Motor Vehicles to check if any Medicaid recipients have active drivers licenses in other states, which could help them determine their eligibility to receive Medicaid benefits in Louisiana.   
ULL’s work on the AI program will not cost the health department because it already contracts with the university for other computing projects, Kolluru said. 
ULL will also partner with the state Office of Technology Services to “modernize Louisiana Medicaid systems,” Kolluru said.

In addition to detailing the counterfraud measures, Greenstein said the state has set a goal to reduce drug overdose deaths during pregnancy by 80% over the next three years.
Overdose deaths have been the leading cause of maternal mortality in Louisiana since 2018, LDH Deputy Secretary Dr. Pete Croughan said. 
The new initiative, Project MOM (Maternal Overdose Mortality) will push to increase the availability of naloxone and buprenorphine, medications that can halt the effects of opioid overdoses when administered promptly. Other goals include more training health care providers on opioid use disorders and using money from settlements with opioid manufacturers to expand residential treatment facilities and outpatient clinics.
According to publicly available data, there were 28 overdoses during pregnancy in 2020, the most recent year data in available. LDH is setting a goal to reduce overdose pregnancy deaths in the state by 80% over three years, reducing the death rate to five or six people annually. The department expects to appoint a Project MOM director within 90 days.
Greenstein also announced the state would be moving away from having a single pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) for its Medicaid program. Such entities have been labeled as “middlemen” that process prescription drug claims for the managed care organizations that provide Medicaid services, with critics saying they don’t provide enough transparency to determine whether they provide any cost savings to patients.
Since October 2021, Louisiana has worked with Magellan Medicaid Administration as its sole prescription benefit manager. On Monday, Maranto said the department would work closely with its managed care organizations who run the state’s Medicaid program and pharmacies to “ensure the best approach to managing these benefits.”
The continued closures of chain and independent pharmacies threatens patient access to critical prescription drugs across Louisiana, Maranto added. The state’s new approach will lean on the private contractors for Medicaid to handle prescription claims while also keeping drug prices in check.

Among those storefronts damaged was Ashewell Medical Group, Dr. Carly Brown's primary care clinic. (Photo: Courtesy of Carly Brown)Just a fraction of homes and businesses in western North Carolina were insured against the floodwaters that deluged the region during Hurricane Helene.
An estimated 10.2% of commercial properties had FEMA-backed flood insurance, and just 5.2% of homes were protected.
The low figures had devastating implications in the face of Helene, a lower-windspeed, heavy-rain storm that hit mountainous communities poorly acquainted with flooding. When the water subsided and recovery began, it became clear that many wouldn’t be reimbursed for the kind of damage their buildings had suffered.
But even for those that were protected, it’s been a long road. Six months after Helene, some property owners looking for a bounce back through insurance have struggled to access it.
It took until late March for one business owner to see any payment — and when it came, it was just a fraction of what she had expected. Another was able to recoup some flood money, but was bewildered when he was denied payment on other parts of his policies. And a larger group of business owners in the region’s largest city are considering going to court to pursue money they believe they qualify for.



Two businesses’ long paths to payment
Bryan and Angela King, who own 12 Bones Smokehouse & Brewing, filed claims on both of their locations: one on the river by Asheville’s downtown River Arts District, and the other further south.
The Kings had been paying into their insurance on the south location since it opened in 2019; they had put down around $300,000 total there, Bryan King estimated.
They were able to get about $100,000 from flood insurance, he told NC Newsline, but they were denied reimbursement on two other policies: contents and business disruption. Contents insurance covers flood damage to movable objects within a building; business disruption insurance covers lost income, often after a disaster.
King kept in frequent contact with other business owners in the area. He heard similar stories — particularly as others tried to navigate those same contents and business disruptions policies. Now, he told NC Newsline, a group of them are considering going to court over the matter.
“There’s discussion of trying to pursue a class-action lawsuit,” King said in a late March interview. “I honestly think that’s basically going to be the only way that we get anything out of this.”
North Carolinians who have sought insurance payouts in the months since Helene described other similar frustrations and bureaucratic hurdles that complicated an already fraught process.
That includes homeowners who told the Asheville news station WLOS that they had received cancellation notices from their providers months after the storm.
Among the other layers of complexity: adjusters who live out of state, multiple subcontractors and extensive documentation requirements.
Carly Brown, who runs Ashewell Medical Group in Asheville, told NC Newsline her provider had subcontracted out to another group, which had then subcontracted out to another adjuster.
When Brown finally received a flood insurance payment in late March — six months after the storm — it was a “fraction of our losses.” Her practice’s office had filled with 11 feet of flood water during the storm. She, too, has now engaged with a law firm.
“They just nickel and dime you after paying faithfully on a flood policy for eight years,” Brown said. “You think you’re doing everything right, being a responsible business owner and citizen. Then the insurance companies essentially keep all their profits, without upholding their responsibilities.”



The Kings ran into other barriers as they filed their claims.
They were told by their Utah-based adjuster that as part of their documentation, they needed a letter from Duke Energy testifying that the damage to their south Asheville location was from wind, and not water.
That seemed unnecessary, Bryan King said — there was no real flooding in that area, but there were plenty of downed trees and power lines to show for the whipping winds.
“You definitely get the sense that it’s like they’re trying to make it as hard as possible,” he said. “So that people just give up. Like, you know, ‘screw it — I don’t have time to work on this, I’ve got a business to run, and I don’t think we’re going to get it anyway.’”
Duke Energy said customers could request a power outage verification letter by contacting the company’s customer care team.
“During significant weather events, multiple factors can contribute to outages, making it difficult to identify a single cause of a power outage,” a Duke Energy spokesperson said in a statement to NC Newsline. “Our primary focus is restoring power as quickly and safely as possible for our customers and communities.”
  Rep. Jennifer Balkcom (R-Henderson) (Screenshot: NCGA)
The chair of the North Carolina House Insurance Committee, Rep. Jennifer Balkcom (R-Henderson), said she had heard from constituents about slogging through insurance in the region — specifically on business disruption claims, some of which are denied outright.
“I’m asking the insurance commissioner to kind of help me look into what’s going on, and we’re trying to get some specifics so that we can work with those individuals,” said Balkcom, whose district was among those that were hardest hit by Helene.
In western North Carolina, spotty insurance coverage meant confusion
There are around 150,000 flood insurance policies in place in North Carolina, according to FEMA and NC Department of Insurance data. The vast majority of those (around 130,000) are federal policies; the rest are private.
Many of those policies are for properties in eastern North Carolina, which has been struck multiple times in recent decades by deadly hurricanes. The extent of the mountainous west’s coverage pales in comparison: according to FEMA data, there are a total of just 1,295 federal policies in the region’s most populous county of Buncombe and its communities, including Asheville.
A total of 1.8 million North Carolinians live in the 25 counties that were part of Helene’s disaster zone.
Jason Tyson, communications director for the NC Department of Insurance, said in an interview that Helene had brought about “a whole variety of situations and scenarios” in the region. The minimal flood coverage, he said, combined with early communication struggles and a host of different providers, often led to confusion.
“I think the industry and the carriers have done the best they can, in light of difficult circumstances,” Tyson said.
The department has asked providers to report updated data on claims periodically in the months after Helene.
The scope of that information is limited, as it does not include federal flood policies. And only data from one reporting deadline — January — is available publicly. NC Newsline requested and received claims data from October 2024. Data from the department’s other reporting deadlines, in November and December, are not posted publicly and were not provided.
But the data that is available gives a sense to how complex — and long — some flood claims can be.



As of January, 32.4% of those private flood claims were closed. That’s a far lower closure rate than other types of claims made after Helene. Residential property claims had closed at an 84.4% rate; just over 70% of business interruption claims had closed as of January.
Those 547 reported private flood claims account for more than a half-billion dollars in damage, according to DOI’s data. Just over $240 million had been paid as of January.
The department is expected to have updated data from providers in the coming weeks.
FEMA’s federal flood insurance program (NFIP) paid out almost $214 million to North Carolinians in 2024, across more than 2,500 claims. That’s roughly 20% of the total paid out by the program to the state over the last decade.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/dji_fly_2-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-22 13:16:25.250182
,California,2025-04-22 16:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,How do high schoolers in your area really fare after graduation? A new California tool lets you know,Adam Echelman,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/higher-education/2025/04/california-high-school-graduates-tracker/,California’s new Cradle to Career dashboards track students' college paths and earnings after high school graduation — but leave out some key details.,"In summary
California’s new Cradle to Career dashboards track students’ college paths and earnings after high school graduation — but leave out some key details.


Want to know how students at your child’s school district are performing five or even 10 years down the line? 
Today, California released a new tool that aims to make that question — and many others — much easier to answer. Known as the Cradle to Career Data System, these new “dashboards” consolidate data from roughly 3.5 million high school graduates in California, showing where they enrolled in college, what kinds of degrees they earned, and the wages they made four years after receiving a college diploma or certificate. 
For years, parents and researchers alike have complained that accessing education data is unnecessarily hard — with information spread out across various websites, drop-down menus and graphics. A new data system was a key priority for the Newsom administration, though it faced months of delays, in part because of data privacy concerns. 
“We have people who’ve been calling for this (data system) for 10 years, for 20 years,” said Mary Ann Bates, executive director of the Cradle to Career Data System. “The effort the state is making now to bring this together is so that students, families, educators and policymakers can have this information at their fingertips.”
Some other states, such as Kentucky, have already pioneered better approaches, creating a single, understandable website that houses data from the state’s K-12, college and workforce providers. In 2019, California allocated more than $24 million so it could catch up.  
But today’s data tool represents just a fraction of the state’s education and workforce data. It only looks at students who attend one of California’s public colleges and universities and it only looks at students who graduate from a public high school. One tool by the California Department of Education shows that among 2015 California public high school graduates who headed to college, 15% went to a private or out-of-state college or university within 16 months.
Bates said her team will eventually update these public dashboards to include information about students who attend private or out-of-state colleges and who don’t graduate high school. 
As part of this data system, the state has also promised to release other data, including information about early childhood education and teachers’ training and retention. Bates’ team initially said the teacher training information would be available by June 2024, but it remains in limbo. She said that tool would be released “soon,” though she did not specify a date. 
How useful is it?
Although the Cradle to Career Data System is presenting information in new ways, the information itself isn’t new. California has already developed similar tools, but none so widely accessible to the public or incorporating data from so many different schools and state agencies. 
The state Education Department already allowed users to download data and sort college-going rates by school or district, although it’s unlikely most parents would spend the time to download the spreadsheet and try to understand all the column names. One strength of the system is its ease of use — the tool displays key data visually and intuitively.
But each data system may use slightly different numbers. For example, the department uses DataQuest, which has a broader definition of what it means to “graduate” high school. The Cradle to Career Data System looks only at traditional graduates and not people who receive a GED, said Ryan Estrellado, the Cradle to Career system’s director of data programs.
The nonprofit Educational Results Partnership operated one of the many predecessors to the Cradle to Career Data System, and president Alex Barrios said he’s skeptical that the state’s new tool is a real improvement. 
“If the dashboard doesn’t start the cohort at 9th grade, then the dashboard is useless,” wrote Barrios in a text to CalMatters. Just over 88% of students who started as ninth graders finished high school five years later, according to 2024 state data, but for certain groups, such as African American or Native American students, the graduation rates were lower. 
Without information about high school dropouts, the new tool makes it look like students attend college at higher rates than they actually do, he said. It’s called the Cradle to Career Data System, he added, not the “the High School Graduation to College Data System.” In the previous tool that Barrios helped operate, known as Cal-PASS Plus, researchers could look not just at high school graduates but also at all students who enrolled in 9th grade. 
Bates said the Cradle to Career Data System is only as powerful as the data that schools and agencies share. This current data uses information from the past 10 years, which is only enough time to measure the long-term college and career outcomes of high school graduates, she said, adding that other data, such as information about the long-term fates of younger students, will be added as it’s available. 
Although the data lacks certain features, it may still lead to powerful findings: One of the new data dashboards shows that community college students who receive a certificate earn more than those who receive an associate degree— even though certificate programs typically take much less time to complete. 
The Cradle to Career Data System is “a neutral source of information,” said Bates. “Our office is not going to weigh in on specific policies or interpret the why.”

(Photo via National Park Service)Gov. Ron DeSantis added a new front to his dispute with the House during a Tuesday press conference: Funding for Everglades restoration.
The governor bashed House leadership on Earth Day because the House’s proposed budget includes $279 million toward Everglades restoration, but DeSantis said his plan included $800 million for it.
“A lot of the reason they’re doing it is because the leadership in the House of Representatives has taken a position that if I’m for something, that it’s their view to just oppose us, just in a knee-jerk fashion,” DeSantis said during the press conference at the Rookery Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve in Naples.
But DeSantis thanked Senate President Ben Albritton, saying the upper chamber’s budget “basically agreed” with his $800 million proposal. However, the Senate only includes $625 million for Everglades restoration.
The dispute with the House has dominated press conferences the governor has held recently, as he has attacked the House on rising condominium fees, funding for the Florida Highway Patrol, and the probe into Hope Florida.
“We’re getting into this regularity, where [DeSantis] has a temper tantrum,” House Speaker Daniel Perez told reporters last Wednesday. “He gets in front of a camera, and he starts to do one of two things: Either … willingly choosing to lie about what he is telling the people in front of a camera, or he is choosing to not read the bills or look at our budget.”
Alexis Lambert, secretary of the Florida Department of Environmental Protection; and Roger Young, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission executive director, joined the governor in talking about maintaining momentum in Everglades restoration.

(Photo by Parker Michels-Boyce/Virginia Mercury)A group of eight Republicans in the Minnesota House have introduced legislation (HF3219) that would designate certain vaccines and medical treatments as “weapons of mass destruction” and make possessing or administering them a crime punishable by up to 20 years in prison.
The legislation specifically targets messenger RNA (mRNA) treatments, which include several COVID-19 vaccines. Those vaccines have saved millions of lives and are considered one of the most important medical and public health achievements of the 21st century so far.
The bill’s language appears to have been drafted by Joseph Sansone, a Florida hypnotist and conspiracy theorist who believes that mRNA treatments are “nanoparticle injections” that amount to “biological and technological weapons of mass destruction.” 
Sansone has falsely claimed that “more Americans have died from mRNA injections than in WWI, WWII, and the Vietnam War combined,” and has said he has stood “alongside an Army of the Dead” to file unsuccessful legal complaints against vaccines in Florida.
The bill has no chance of passage given the narrow margins in the House and Senate, as well as the DFL’s control of the governorship. But its support among multiple Republican representatives, including several members of GOP House leadership, give a sense of how the party would govern if it controlled the state legislature.
The Minnesota Republicans sponsoring the bill include Shane Mekeland (Clear Lake), Krista Knudsen (Lake Shore), Assistant GOP Floor Leader Walter Hudson (Albertville), Jeff Dotseth (Silver Township), Tom Murphy (Underwood), Pam Altendorf (Red Wing), Keith Allen (Kenyon), and Deputy Speaker Pro Tempore Isaac Schultz (Elmdale). Several have also sponsored a marginally less extreme bill (HF 3152) that would make administering mRNA vaccines a misdemeanor subject to a $500 penalty.
The Reformer requested comment from several of the bill sponsors but none responded. 
In addition to vaccines for infectious diseases, mRNA technology holds tremendous promise for treating cancer and other ailments. Thousands of cancer patients are currently participating in trials of personalized mRNA vaccines targeting various types of tumors. 
Minnesota’s Mayo Clinic has been at the forefront of some of that research, which would be criminalized under the proposed bill.
The language in the bill further bans “nanotechnology or nanoparticles that alter genes and create a biosynthetic cell replication,” which could impact other cutting-edge medical technologies like CRISPR. It also bans “any human gene therapy product for any infectious disease indication.”
The bill compels state and local authorities to “use all lawful means necessary” to enforce its provisions, and would subject authorities to prosecution under existing weapons of mass destruction statutes if they refused to investigate alleged violations of the law.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/210202_vm_covid_vaccine_0212-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-22 13:16:25.250182

(Getty image)The imposition of tariffs on energy imports from Canada jeopardizes both our climate targets and the economic security of millions of residents and businesses across New England and New York.
President Trump has imposed broad 25% tariffs on Canadian imports. It remains unclear whether these tariffs apply to electricity (the Trump administration issued no clarification), an intangible good that has never before been subject to import duties.
The Northeast has long been a leader in clean energy innovation, setting ambitious goals to transition to a more sustainable, affordable, and reliable power grid. Tariffs of this magnitude on clean Canadian electricity imports are a direct attack on affordability, burdening U.S. consumers with an estimated $400 million in additional costs annually.
These tariffs will be felt particularly during peak-demand periods, when the Northeast’s reliance on Canadian electricity is most acute. During these hours, tariffs could increase wholesale electricity prices by up to 30%. These costs disproportionately affect working families and small businesses that are already struggling with high energy costs.
At a time when states like Massachusetts and New York are working to expand clean energy infrastructure and reduce reliance on fossil fuels, the artificial price increases from tariffs will drive clean and affordable hydroelectricity from Canada out of energy markets. The result is the opposite effect of what our state policies seek and instead will drive up costs and push the region further into dependence on natural gas and oil.
Massachusetts alone is expected to see a $200 million increase in electricity if 25% tariffs are imposed on Canadian electricity imports.
Beyond the financial impact, tariffs will undermine the reliability of the Northeast’s power grid. Just this year, during the coldest periods of January and February, Canadian energy exports accounted for 10% of New York’s demand and 15% in New England, rising to 20% during peak-demand hours.
With the added tariff costs on imports, our region will inevitably rely more heavily on fossil fuel plants that are vulnerable to fuel supply shortages and price spikes during extreme weather events. The energy market works by selecting the least expensive form of energy available to provide the required amount of energy demanded by the market. If tariffs make otherwise affordable Canadian hydroelectricity more expensive than oil and gas, the market will choose those less costly sources.
Some parts of our region are especially vulnerable. Certain rural areas in Vermont and Northern Maine, which are directly linked to electric grids in Canada and have no viable alternative supply, could be hardest hit. Tariffs could lead to millions of dollars in increased costs annually, exacerbating energy insecurity for residents who already face higher-than-average electricity prices.
Imposing tariffs on Canadian hydroelectricity is not just bad economics—it’s bad climate policy. With the withdrawal of this affordable, clean energy source, the region will be forced to burn more natural gas and oil, leading to an estimated 10 million additional tons of carbon emissions annually — annual emissions equivalent to those emitted by every car registered in New York City.
This is a step backward at a time when we should be accelerating our clean energy transition. The Northeast has set aggressive goals to cut emissions and transition to 100% clean power, yet these tariffs will make clean energy less competitive, slowing progress toward a carbon-free grid.
Supporters of these tariffs argue that they will level the playing field for domestic energy producers but, in reality, they will undermine the market forces that are driving innovation and competition in the clean energy sector.
They completely ignore the interconnected nature of the U.S.-Canadian electricity system, which has historically provided economic, reliability, and environmental benefits to both countries. Just last week, New York State released a report assessing tariff impacts. State agencies conclude that “losing access to Canadian imports during the peak summer cooling months could create significant reliability challenges.”
New York and New England cannot afford to let anything but the public interest and cost dictate energy policy. These tariffs will raise prices, reduce reliability, and set back the clean energy transition at a time when we need to accelerate progress, not stall it.
Governors, legislators, and regulators in the Northeast must visibly stand together against these tariffs, advocating for continued access to affordable, clean electricity. Businesses, labor groups, and community organizations must also speak out, making it clear that these policies will harm local economies, cost jobs, and increase energy burdens for working families.

The University of Alabama had not confirmed Trump’s appearance as of Tuesday morning. Messages seeking comment were left with university officials on Tuesday. 
The university has eight graduation ceremonies from May 2-4. 
U.S. Sen. Katie Britt, R-Alabama, an Alabama graduate, said in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, that she was looking forward to the address.
“What a tremendous honor for my alma mater. Looking forward to a historic occasion for graduates and their families,” the post said.
The announcement comes as the Trump administration has challenged the legal status of foreign students on college campuses around the nation. The Associated Press said that at least 1,024 students at 160 colleges, universities and university systems have had their visas revoked or their legal status terminated since late March.
Officials with Immigration Customs and Enforcement (ICE) detained Alireza Douroudi, an Alabama doctoral student from Iran, in March. Doroudi was denied bond last week, but the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has not named any charges. Auburn said in a statement last week that 15 foreign students or personnel on its campus had their visas cancelled. 
Trump won 65% of Alabama’s vote in last November’s presidential election. His margin in Tuscaloosa County, the home of the University of Alabama, was about 60%.

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)As the Trump administration takes aim at diversity initiatives in both the public and private sectors, a New Jersey lawmaker wants to require all state agencies and departments to have a diversity, equity, and inclusion office.
Under new legislation, each office would be led by a chief DEI officer who would oversee programs that promote cross-cultural education and employee engagement. Bill sponsor Assemblyman Reginald Atkins (D-Union) said as one of the most diverse states in the country, New Jersey should have a government reflective of its people. 
“This bill is important because it makes sure every state department and agency is thinking about equity and inclusion in a real way, not just talking about it. It gives structure to something we say we value: making sure all communities are treated fairly and represented,” Atkins told the New Jersey Monitor. 
The measure would also require the office to keep track of relevant data and find ways to improve agencies “with the goal of facilitating a more diverse, equitable, and inclusive workplace.”
The legislation stresses that no data would be used for civil immigration enforcement.
His bill comes amid a national trend of rolling back DEI programs. A wave of corporations revoked their DEI policies after President Donald Trump signed a series of executive orders in his first week in office terminating all DEI offices in the federal government and cutting contracts with companies that provide DEI training, among other things.
New Jersey said last week it wouldn’t follow the Trump administration’s demand to certify that Garden State schools have no “DEI practices in violation of federal law.” The federal Department of Education has said it would withhold funding from states that don’t comply with Trump’s order to jettison all DEI initiatives. 
Atkins didn’t comment directly on Trump’s move to end diversity programs. His bill, which has a Senate companion bill sponsored by Sen. Angela McKnight (D-Hudson), has not yet been scheduled for a committee hearing.

The Tennessee House of Representatives voted 84-10 with one abstention Monday to place the matter in voters’ hands. It received the approval of the required two-thirds of the Senate in March.
The issue will appear on the Nov. 3, 2026 gubernatorial ballot and must receive a majority vote from participants in that election’s governor’s race to become law. 
The proposed amendment would strip the right to bail “when the proof is evident or the presumption great” from defendants charged with any of 73 felony crimes for which Tennessee requires convicted people to serve at least 85% of their sentence.
Those crimes include second-degree murder, acts of terrorism, aggravated rape of a child, vehicular homicide, aggravated burglary and the third felony offense of manufacture, sale or delivery of a controlled substance. 
The decision of whether to grant bail would lie in the hands of the judge.
  House Speaker Cameron Sexton took the unusual step on Monday of directly advocating for passage of a bill to deny pretrial bail in some cases. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)
Tennessee’s constitution currently safeguards the right to bail for all prisoners except for capital offenses (functionally, first-degree murder and rape of a child under age 12).
The ballot measure’s opponents said it would deny due process for those accused – not convicted – of these crimes.
“We are already deciding who should be in jail and who should not be in jail as if our criminal legal system is perfect, as if our criminal legal system always gets this right,” Rep. Justin Pearson, a Memphis Democrat, said. “… Taking somebody’s liberty is not a small thing.”
House Speaker Cameron Sexton, a Crossville Republican, sponsored the resolution and took the unusual step of stepping down from the dais to present it from the well.
Sexton said the removal of the right to bail would not be automatic because of the judge’s discretion in applying the law.
He said he also hopes this proposal could address the artificial inflation of bail and the practice of trumping up charges to raise bail to a point that a defendant cannot pay and must remain incarcerated before trial. It “sets an even playing field between those of all income levels based on the crime as well, in my view,” Sexton said.
Reps. G.A. Hardaway and Antonio Parkinson, both Memphis Democrats, spoke in support of the ballot measure. Parkinson said his constituency is “sick” of violent crime in their community.
Pearson and Nashville Democratic Rep. Vincent Dixie said leaving a defendant’s right to bail to a judge’s discretion does not assuage concerns.
“Judges are imperfect people with their own biases as well that they bring into the courtroom, and there can again be a disproportionate harm on poor folks, a disproportionate harm on Black folks, on Latino folks,” Pearson said. 
Sexton said this line of thinking minimizes trust in judges, who are often elected.
“You deny bail and keep people … incarcerated who you’re afraid to put out on the streets,” he said. “Everybody else you should be giving bail to. They should have reasonable bail.”










Judges are imperfect people with their own biases as well that they bring into the courtroom, and there can again be a disproportionate harm on poor folks, a disproportionate harm on Black folks, on Latino folks.


– Rep. Justin Pearson, D-Memphis


The proposed amendment has seen support from the Tennessee Sheriff’s Association and the Tennessee District Attorneys General Conference.
Pearson agreed that the crimes included in the proposed amendment are heinous. 
“But when we talk about safety and protecting people, we also have to protect the people who are being sentenced who have not committed the crime for which they are being accused,” he said.

(Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)In February, the Trump administration sent a letter to all state education departments with a broad message: diversity, equity, and inclusion programs in public schools must come to an end. Every public K-12 school and university must stop policies related to “diversity, equity, and inclusion,” or face a potential loss to their funding, the letter stated.
This month, a New Hampshire federal judge is grappling with whether to stop the government from enforcing the letter.
A group of organizations — the National Education Association, the National Education Association of New Hampshire, and the Center for Black Educator Development — have sued the U.S. Department of Education in the U.S. District Court of New Hampshire to block enforcement of the letter. The suit is being litigated by the American Civil Liberties Union’s Racial Justice Program and the American Civil Liberties Union of New Hampshire.
On Thursday, April 17, Judge Landya McCafferty presided over oral arguments in the lawsuit. She’s weighing whether to issue a preliminary injunction.
The requirement is not immediate; after an extension agreed to last week, state education agencies have until April 24 to certify that the state’s schools have agreed to the conditions in the letter. But plaintiffs are hoping McCafferty issues the injunction sometime next week to halt enforcement before that deadline arrives.
Plaintiffs argue that because the letter threatens financial repercussions against school districts that allow for DEI programs, it could in turn force schools to drop support for NEA and CBED teacher diversity programs. And the NEA says the vagueness of the letter will push its teacher members to take defensive measures and avoid teaching certain topics if they think there will be professional consequences for doing so.
But the government says plaintiffs are overreacting to the letter, which they say simply warns school districts not to fall afoul of Title VI, a federal statute that prevents discrimination in public programs based on race or national origin, and promises investigations and potential withholding of federal funding for those districts that do.
‘Dear colleague letter’
The letter that kicked off the dispute, known as a “dear colleague letter,” presents a stark portrait of public schools.
“Educational institutions have toxically indoctrinated students with the false premise that the United States is built upon ‘systemic and structural racism’ and advanced discriminatory policies and practices,” the letter reads. “Proponents of these discriminatory practices have attempted to further justify them — particularly during the last four years — under the banner of ‘diversity, equity, and inclusion’…”
The letter relies on Students for Fair Admissions Inc v. President and Fellows of Harvard College, a landmark 2023 U.S. Supreme Court decision in which the court held that the race-based admissions policies at Harvard and the University of North Carolina had violated the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment.
And it says the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights would “vigorously enforce the law” and that institutions that failed to comply with federal law may “face potential loss of federal funding.”
“The Department will no longer tolerate the overt and covert racial discrimination that has become widespread in this Nation’s educational institutions. The law is clear: treating students differently on the basis of race to achieve nebulous goals such as diversity, racial balancing, social justice, or equity is illegal under controlling Supreme Court precedent.”
To the U.S. Department of Justice, the letter is not an official agency rule; rather, it is an interpretive guidance. That means it can’t be struck down by a court the way a rule can, they argued.
Abhishek Kambli, a U.S. deputy associate attorney general who traveled to Concord to argue the case Thursday, said the letter is simply articulating existing law preventing school districts from classifying students according to their race. Kambli pointed to the Students for Fair Admissions decision, and said the dear colleague letter is simply trying to stop K-12 schools from that kind of discrimination, Kambli told the court Thursday. Already, U.S. case law has established that schools should not make distinctions on the basis of race or other characteristics except in rare circumstances, Kambli argued. And he said those circumstances must face a legal test of strict scrutiny to pass.
The plaintiff’s hardship, Kambli said, “is due to self-censorship based on a misunderstanding of what the dear colleague letter says.”
Kambli added that the government does not claim diversity, equity, and inclusion itself is illegal; rather, it claims that schools that are already breaking the law by classifying students by race should not use the concept of DEI as an excuse to do so.
And he said despite the colorful language in the letter, any decision by the federal government to withhold funding to a school could come only after an investigation, and would include the possibility of an appeal. “It’s a lengthy process,” he said.
Actions chilling, plaintiffs argue
But plaintiffs say the government’s characterization understates the impact and scope of the letter.
The letter creates the possibility of consequences for teachers because of its threat to punish school districts, who directly employ those teachers, Sarah Hinger, deputy director of the ACLU’s Racial Justice Program argued Thursday. And she said the letter contains pronouncements that are hard for teachers to apply to their instruction.
“Every day, today, tomorrow, they go to work and they are tasked with following the dear colleague letter, along with all their other obligations,” Hinger said. “They are chilled now in their ability to speak. … They are uncertain of what practices they can engage in.”
Hinger also pointed to the Trump administration’s swift move to withhold funding from Columbia University and Harvard University, suggesting that the administration could move quickly to block funding to public schools if it decides to.
“The chill from that is happening now, and plaintiffs are not required to wait until they are hauled into court in order to challenge an unconstitutional law,” she said. McCafferty appeared sympathetic to plaintiffs, asking Kambli questions about how teachers could cover periods of American history like Reconstruction or the Jim Crow South without worrying they were improperly teaching that America has structural racism.
The case bears similarity to another lawsuit alleging that New Hampshire’s 2021 “banned concepts” law prohibiting public school teachers from advocating for certain topics around race and gender is unconstitutional. In 2024, the U.S. District Court of New Hampshire agreed with plaintiffs and struck that law down; the decision is currently being appealed in the First Circuit Court of Appeals.
But Kambli said those lawsuits were different because they involved state laws that directly affected teachers. The dear colleague letter should not have a direct effect on the topics that can be taught, he argued.
“It goes toward how they treat students,” he said. “It doesn’t go toward what they teach.”
And Kambli argued the suing organizations are not linked directly to the Department of Education’s enforcement action, and lack standing to bring a case in the first place.
Lawyers for the ACLU are attempting to add a handful of New Hampshire school districts as parties to the case, in order to make additional arguments about how the letter would unfairly affect them. But the government argued it needs more time to file a motion countering those arguments, and McCafferty has not yet approved the districts’ inclusion to the case.
For now, the parties are expecting McCafferty to issue a ruling on the injunction before next Thursday. Lawyers for the government asked her to issue a narrow injunction that affects only the named plaintiffs if she must issue one; lawyers for the plaintiffs urged a nationwide injunction.
Under the agreement reached last week, any New Hampshire school district that signs a letter certifying that they will comply with the letter will not be bound to that letter until April 24, meaning that if the court enjoins the letter before then, the district will not be subject to it. As of Thursday, 165 New Hampshire school districts have signed on, according to the Department of Education’s website.
At a press conference after the hearing, Hinger said she hopes McCafferty will act quickly.
“I think that the government has shown a track record of avoiding and ignoring careful due process, moving swiftly against institutions and using the full power of its authority against individuals in the education sector and beyond,” she said.

After pausing during the early weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic, the agency has not collected on defaulted loans in over five years. More than 5 million borrowers sit in default on their federal student loans, and just 38% of borrowers are current on their payments, the department said.
“American taxpayers will no longer be forced to serve as collateral for irresponsible student loan policies,” U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon said in a statement Monday.
During last year’s presidential campaign, President Donald Trump criticized his predecessor and successor, President Joe Biden, for his efforts to erase student debt. McMahon resumed that line of attack Monday, blaming Biden’s administration for unreasonably raising borrowers’ expectations of forgiveness.
“The Biden Administration misled borrowers: the executive branch does not have the constitutional authority to wipe debt away, nor do the loan balances simply disappear. Hundreds of billions have already been transferred to taxpayers,” McMahon said.
She added that “going forward, the Department of Education, in conjunction with the Department of Treasury, will shepherd the student loan program responsibly and according to the law, which means helping borrowers return to repayment — both for the sake of their own financial health and our nation’s economic outlook.”
The department said the Office of Federal Student Aid will restart the Treasury Offset Program, which the U.S. Treasury Department administers, on May 5.
The Education Department statement said all borrowers who are in default will get emails over the next two weeks “making them aware of these developments and urging them to contact the Default Resolution Group to make a monthly payment, enroll in an income-driven repayment plan, or sign up for loan rehabilitation.”
The department said the Office of Federal Student Aid will “send required notices beginning administrative wage garnishment” later this summer.
More than 42.7 million borrowers owe more than $1.6 trillion in student debt, according to the department. 
The administration claims that “instead of protecting responsible taxpayers, the Biden-Harris Administration put them on the hook for irresponsible lending, pushing the federal student loan portfolio toward a fiscal cliff.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-22 14:30:06+00:00,CT Mirror,Efforts to increase affordable housing in Fairfield County underway amid market squeeze,Abigail Brone | Connecticut Public,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/22/fairfield-county-affordable-housing/,"Rising rent and mortgage interest rates are causing a squeeze on Fairfield County’s housing market, and developers are looking for ways to ease it.","Rising rent and mortgage interest rates are causing a squeeze on Fairfield County’s housing market. Developers in Connecticut are looking for ways to ease the squeeze placed on middle-income renters.
Not only is there a lack of deeply affordable apartments in Fairfield County, but there aren’t enough options for renters on the higher end of the affordability needs, according to Andrew Bolger, a senior data and research analyst at the Connecticut Housing Finance Authority (CHFA), a quasi-public agency that helps create affordable housing.
“There are more units available than there are households in the middle of the market,” Bolger said.
Bolger explained this is causing a squeezing effect in the middle.
Recently at a Fairfield County Talks Housing meeting, Bolger outlined new data regarding Fairfield County’s housing market. It showed that many renters are being forced to pay more than they can comfortably afford for an apartment, and other renters are opting for apartments below what they could afford, leaving less options for lower-income renters.
“Because there’s a lack of units that are affordable to the lowest income renters, they are essentially forced to rent up into units that are affordable to someone, say, someone earning 50% AMI (area median income),” Bolger said.
In Fairfield County, the average rent has increased between 20% and 30% over the last six years, Bolger said.
Recently, CHFA stepped up efforts to generate housing for different income levels in Fairfield County, funding several mixed-income housing developments in Bridgeport, Darien and Greenwich.
Along with generating more affordable rental options, CHFA works to educate prospective homeowners on the homebuying process. It also creates affordable homeownership opportunities.
CHFA provides assistance to homebuyers earning below 120% AMI.
“In Bridgeport that equates to, depending on the household size and location, about $133,000 up to $171,000,” Bolger said.
CHFA also operates Connecticut’s Time to Own program, which provides forgivable loans for first-time homebuyers. In Fairfield County, nearly 500 families have been able to purchase homes through the program since it began in 2022.
CHFA is keeping an eye on how the current presidential administration may impact its programming, Community Engagement Officer Terry Nash said.
Some programs cannot be eliminated or defunded immediately since they are in place by law, Nash said.
“HUD (Department of Housing and Urban Development) funding has been paused, but not eliminated, and there are certain programs that are now under review for audit,” Nash said. “It seems like everything’s up for review. So we’ve been told that it’s fair to say business as usual until told otherwise.”

(Photo by Jane Norman/States Newsroom)The United States Supreme Court has declined to hear an appeal in a long running case challenging the University of Michigan’s ban on firearms on campus, denying the petition on Monday. 
In Joshua Wade v. University of Michigan, the Michigan Court of Appeals previously ruled that the University’s ban was in line with other policies permitted by the Second Amendment which ban firearms in “sensitive places” like schools. 
According to the University’s brief to the Supreme Court, Wade is neither a student or faculty member, but a private citizen who “spend[s] a lot of time outdoors and in downtown Ann Arbor” and “believe[s] it is [his] constitutional right to carry a weapon on University property,” seeking a waiver to the University’s policy. When his waiver was denied, he sued the university, alleging violations of the Second Amendment and state law.

In petitioning the Supreme Court, Wade’s attorney questioned “whether the Second and Fourteenth Amendments allow a criminal ordinance that prohibits mere possession of firearms on an entire poorly-delineated university campus, except by permission of a single government official with unfettered discretion, which is granted only for ‘extraordinary circumstances,” disputing the Court of Appeals’ classification of all university property as a “sensitive place”.
“The decision of the Court of Appeals, upheld by the Michigan Supreme Court’s denial of appeal, has significant and troubling consequences. By broadly designating the entire university campus as a ‘sensitive place,’ the court effectively nullifies the Second Amendment for thousands of individuals who live, work, or study on or near university property,” Wade’s attorney wrote. “This sweeping prohibition also chills the exercise of the right to bear arms for those who might pass through campus, where the boundary between university property and public space is often indistinguishable.”
The Supreme Court also denied an appeal in another Second Amendment case on Monday, where the State of Minnesota sought to challenge a ruling striking down a law restricting permits to carry a handgun in public to applicants 21 or older, which was upheld by a federal appeals court. 
While another federal appeals court struck down similar age restrictions in Pennsylvania, yet another court upheld the restrictions in Colorado. With similar age restriction cases pending in other jurisdictions, the attorneys for Minnesota argued the Court should either grant its petition, vacate the lower court’s decision and remand the case, or review the lower court’s decision to give direction to the lower courts set to hear these similar cases.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/supremecourtoct92024-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-22 11:10:15.486189

(Kansas Reflector screen capture from KCC video)TOPEKA — Stark disagreements on the future of Evergy’s proposal to build two new natural gas plants in Kansas surfaced Monday during opening statements at the beginning of three days of Kansas Corporation Commission hearings.
Evergy announced last fall it would build two natural gas plants in Kansas, in Reno and Sumner counties, citing economic growth in the state that will increase demand. In March, the company announced plans to build a third plant in Missouri. Evergy also is planning a new solar installation in Douglas County.
KCC regulates utilities in Kansas, and the three-person board will determine whether Evergy can move forward with its plans.
Significant opposition to the proposed Kansas natural gas plants is coming from retail customers, who believe the new plants will raise rates and are not necessary to ensure adequate electricity supply. Those organizations are on the docket to speak and filed testimony ahead of time.
In opening remarks, Jim Zakoura, an Overland Park attorney representing multiple industrial and retail businesses, said 99% of retailers who have spoken out are against building the two plants.
“There’s almost no testimony by Evergy in this docket regarding the retail impact on constructing two natural gas facilities, the cost of about $2 billion on 735,000 retail ratepayers in the state of Kansas,” Zakoura said. “Essentially, 99.9% of the retail ratepayers do not support the agreement. Retail ratepayers don’t want the commission to gamble with their hard-earned money.”
Alissa Greenwald, an attorney representing New Energy Economics, expressed concerns that Evergy has understated the risk to customers based on the natural gas fuel price forecast and that viable alternatives, such as investing in battery storage, could help meet capacity needs at a lower cost to customers.
Evergy officials and KCC staff were the two primary entities standing as proponents of the plants.
Evergy attorney Will Wohlford disagreed that both plants weren’t needed and spoke at length about the research and work that goes into the integrated resource planning that Evergy undertakes. Utility companies use IRPs to forecast utility needs and growth in the communities they serve. He explained this docket specifically addresses predetermination of rates for Every Kansas Central, one of Energy’s divisions that would have 100% ownership of the planned solar installation, and 50% of each new natural gas plant.
He also pointed to legislation last year that passed almost unanimously through the Kansas House and Senate that he said supports what Evergy is trying to accomplish.
“This is a resounding public policy pronouncement by the Kansas Legislature in favor of additions of gas facilities for reliability and the use of pre-determination procedures to establish rate treatment for those additions,” he said, referring to House Bill 2527.
Wohlford made a case for the need of the proposed improvements to the Evergy system.
“We know in the last three to four years, we have started to get tight during various weather events, not just Evergy but (the Southwest Power Pool),” Wohlford said. “I would prefer and I think Evergy would prefer to utilize the results of our integrated resource plans and the work that we’ve done and staff have also done an assessment of. This is not the end game. If you look at our IRP, it calls for more resources that we need to consider in 2031 and beyond.”
Some opponents said investing in these plants locks ratepayers into unknown costs and risks, said Carly Masenthin, the lead legal staff for KCC. The regulator’s staff see things differently.
“We’ve made it through our more severe weather periods so far thanks to the efforts made by this commission, our Kansas utilities, the energy industry as a whole in this state, and by importing electricity from our neighboring regions,” she said. “But I think the downside of that success is that it enables taking for granted the fact that the air conditioner and the heat stays on, and perhaps it masks the reality that our success has come by the skin of our teeth for the last four to five years.”
“Even though these plants won’t be online this year or next, staff will sleep easier knowing that Kansans can look forward to additional dispatchable, reliable generation coming on in the near future,” Masenthin added. “Staff urges the commission to find that these plants are needed, that the cost to build them is reasonable and will be well managed, a cost which, again, staff believes will only increase if they are delayed.”
In its long-range plan filed with regulators in 2022, Evergy planned to exclusively add wind and solar facilities over the coming decade. A year later, it scaled back those planned renewable energy facilities, forecasted plans to add natural gas plants and delayed the retirement of the Lawrence coal plant.
Once the plants are online, expected to be in 2029 and 2030, the plants will each add 705 megawatts of power to Evergy’s generation capabilities.
KCC commissioners began hearing testimony in the afternoon, much of which was behind closed doors because of confidential business information being shared by Evergy.
Wohlford was the first person called to testify, and he said he was surprised that opponents were saying the costs of building the plants weren’t included in the information.
“I would suggest that our definitive cost estimate here has the same level of engineering and cost rigor to it than any other predetermination that we brought forward. There certainly are some things we haven’t done yet, because you don’t procure everything and cost everything before the commission weighs in on predetermination,” he said.
Wohlford said costs and information will be consistently updated throughout the projects.
“I think we’re a long way from saying the costs of these projects are unknown,” he said.
Jason Humphrey, Evergy vice president of development, testified before the hearing at the end of the day, discussing the adaptations Evergy made to account for tariffs and other costs that may have increased. It is estimated each plant will cost about $1 billion. Humphrey was asked about the affect of tariffs and the current economy on cost estimates previously submitted.
“Our definitive cost estimates were filed for really an appropriate contingency for this point in the project,” he said. “We do understand the specter of uncertainty that is out there. If we do anticipate costs going over 115% of the definitive cost estimates. At that time, we would have the ability to pause and reevaluate. Our definitive cost estimates today stand, but we wanted a mechanism in place and settlement that if we do see costs rising that we would have the ability to come and talk to parties and the commission about that.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/EvergyZakouraScreenshot-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-22 10:03:59.137924

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)The federal leader of the Denali Commission said Friday she is trying to save long-planned Alaska infrastructure projects now threatened by the Trump administration — and the life of the independent federal commission itself.
Julie Kitka, who served for three decades as president of the Alaska Federation of Natives before taking on the new role in October as federal co-chair of the Denali Commission, discussed those challenges on Friday in Nome at a conference organized by that city’s government.
“I have to tell you that dealing with the new federal administration, I had a mindset of, ‘This is an administration unlike anything we’ve seen in our lifetime,’ so that’s proved out,” she said. 
“Too, ‘Urgency is the new normal,’ and that’s proved out,” Kitka said at the City of Nome Investment Summit.
The Denali Commission was founded in 1998 and modeled after the Appalachian Regional Commission, which was established in1965. The Denali Commission coordinates rural Alaska infrastructure and economic development planning among multiple agencies, and it disburses grants for various projects, such as water and sewer systems, telecommunications and health care facilities. It gets funding from the federal government, through congressional appropriations and other sources, and it is empowered to receive funding from nongovernmental sources as well.
But now it is jeopardized by the Trump administration’s campaign to dramatically shrink the federal government.
Kitka said she met on Thursday with representatives of the “Department of Government Efficiency,” also known as DOGE, the ad-hoc team led by billionaire Elon Musk that has directed mass firings and deep budget cuts across federal agencies and programs.
Now Kitka said she has three DOGE people assigned to shadow her and the Denali Commission, putting her and her colleagues in the position of defending its existence.
If the Trump administration tries to eliminate the Denali Commission now, it would not be the first time. There were similar attempts in the first Trump administration, but Congress preserved the commission then.
Kitka said one way that she and others are trying to prove the commission’s value is through what she called a “strategic pivot” to emphasize dual use of funded infrastructure projects. Thus, an expanded airport runway or an improved harbor, communication system or health care facility can benefit not only the local and regional community but also the nation’s military forces, which are paying more attention to the Arctic and its role in national defense.
An example of a project that the commission is trying to save with that dual-use pivot is a project to establish climate-resilient telecommunications on the North Slope. The project, led by the Iñupiat Community of the Arctic Slope, a Tribal government, in partnership with the telecommunications company Quintillion, was working its way through a Federal Emergency Management Agency grant program.
Though the North Slope project and many others were already in the design and planning phase, the Trump administration in earlier this month terminated the grant program, called Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities, or BRIC.

	“The BRIC program was yet another example of a wasteful and ineffective FEMA program. It was more concerned with political agendas than helping Americans affected by natural disasters. Under Secretary Noem’s leadership, we are committed to ensuring that Americans in crisis can get the help and resources they need,” an unnamed FEMA spokesperson said in an April 4 statement.
The BRIC program was established during the first Trump administration, and a 2019 report said it saved $6 in costs for every $1 spent. The program awarded grants on a competitive basis, had protocols to ensure that awarded projects were geared at saving people’s lives and required a 25% local or state match. It was expanded during the Biden administration.
Among the BRIC-funded work in Alaska now in jeopardy is a project in Skagway to excavate a rock slope at the city’s port to lessen the risks of landslides and a localized tsunami there. The city was awarded a $19.9 million BRIC grant in February, but the Trump administration’s cancellation of BRIC projects is retroactive to 2020.
Past BRIC grants in Alaska also include $1.465 million awarded in 2022 to the Native Village of Kwigillingok, a Tribal government in a Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta village coping with accelerating erosion, increased flooding and permafrost thaw. It was one of several grants made to tribal governments or Native villages around the nation.
Kitka, in her Nome remarks, said the Denali Commission hopes to convince FEMA that the Utqiagvik telecommunications project and its BRIC funding are worth saving. It can be a “test case” to show how an infrastructure investment can benefit not just the local community but also the military.
There are 16 other pending Alaska projects that are threatened by the decision to axe the BRIC program, she added.
Kitka said another argument to be made to preserve the Denali Commissions is that its role as a coordinating agency, with funding flexibility, is itself a model of efficiency.
Because other federal departments and agencies are able to transfer money to it outside of annual deadlines, the commission can do some multiyear planning, avoiding seasonal problems and delays, she said.
“People have told me that this is the only entity, federal entity, like this in the state of Alaska, that there isn’t any other one like that,” she said. “The downside is we don’t know if it’s going to survive this new administration.”
Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, also spoke at the Nome conference and addressed concerns about halted or canceled federal funding. “As we are looking to push for new funding, we’ve got to make sure that the funds that we already secured are disbursed,” she said.
Like Kitka, Murkowski said it is important to emphasize Alaska’s role in national security and to make the case that federal investment has national benefits.
That is particularly the case in Nome and the Bering Strait region, which lies at the Pacific gateway to the Arctic Ocean, is involved in Arctic diplomacy and borders Russia, as well as offers the potential for producing important critical minerals, she said.
“We’re looking at Greenland because of national security and mineral and economic security. What’s Nome? Chopped liver?” Murkowski said.
Justifications for the Trump administration’s focus on Greenland can apply to Alaska’s Bering Strait region, she said.
“So let’s make sure that, when we talk about the advantages of having that security on that side of North America, we don’t overlook this side of North America. And, by the way, this side, it is already part of the United States of America,” she said.

House Bill 90, sponsored by Rep. Troy Hebert, R-Lafayette, seeks to ban companies such as Appointment Trader, Dorsia and ResX from arranging reservations through their platforms without explicit contracts with restaurants. 
“I’m not preventing the business model from existing,” Hebert said in a phone interview Monday. You just have to have the restaurant’s permission.”
His bill cleared the House Commerce Committee last Wednesday with the unanimous approval of 17 lawmakers, and Hebert said it could come up for a full House vote as early as this week. No one spoke in opposition to the bill at the hearing, and several lawmakers said they’re opposed to the idea of paying for reservations.
Appointment Trader founder Jonas Frey, who lives in Miami, said he intends to speak with lawmakers before the bill goes up for a final vote. 
Founded in 2021, Appointment Trader lets sellers set their own prices for reservations, and bidders can make offers at any price. Additionally, prospective buyers can use the platform as a concierge service, offering a flat fee to anyone who can secure them a reservation at a particular establishment. 
Someone paid $2,138 for a reservation at a French Quarter restaurant. Should this be outlawed?

Though still relatively new to Louisiana, the Appointment Trader drew attention after the Illuminator reported on its sale of hard-to-get bookings in the New Orleans market during Super Bowl weekend — including a $2,138 reservation at Antoine’s.
Hebert said he sponsored the legislation at the request of the Louisiana Restaurant Association, which argues the sale of reservations without restaurant consent can lead to empty tables, missed opportunities for real customers and diminished service. The LRA modeled Hebert’s bill after legislation New York adopted last year with the backing of major online restaurant booking platforms OpenTable and Resy.
Booking sites let diners reserve tables for free and make money by charging restaurants a fee every time someone books through their apps. Louisiana Restaurant Association president Stan Harris told lawmakers Hebert’s bill would not affect those booking apps “other than actually probably helping protect their business model a little bit.”  
Hebert’s bill calls on the Louisiana attorney general to impose a $1,000 fine against a trading platform for each day a table reservation is offered without a restaurant’s consent. 
Appointment Trader is actively trying to partner with restaurants, its founder Frey said, offering them half of the final bid proceeds for each reservation.
If the bill clears the House floor, it will next head to the Senate for consideration.

(Ellen Schmidt/Minnesota Reformer)The number of intensely segregated school sites in the Twin Cities has grown almost five-fold, from 21 to over 100, since the turn of the century, according to University of Minnesota researcher Will Stancil.
If enacted, HF2899 would fund incentives for districts to integrate schools within their boundaries, as well as participate in programs to bus students across district lines to reduce segregation between school districts.
The bill would also create a system of four magnet schools open to students in the metro. Additional state funding would go toward transportation costs for the three integration programs.
A hodgepodge of other proposals are included, like more money for summer school; new data reporting requirements for districts participating in the integration programs and an on-campus summer credit recovery pilot with the University of Minnesota for high school students behind on credits to graduate.
A work group led by Minnesota Education Equity Partnership joined with bill author Rep. Cedrick Frazier, DFL-New Hope, to craft the bill over the past year. The group included two attorneys — Daniel Shulman and Myron Orfield — who have spent over three decades advocating for desegregation, including a single, metro-wide school district to promote racial and economic integration of Twin Cities public schools.
The bill is intended as a vehicle for community engagement as well as a placeholder for a potential settlement of the Cruz-Guzman lawsuit, first filed by Shulman in 2015 on behalf of a group of parents against the Minneapolis and St. Paul school districts and the state of Minnesota.
The parents allege that the de facto economic and racial segregation of Minneapolis and St. Paul schools violates the Minnesota Constitution, which guarantees a uniform and adequate education. Whether the court finds in favor of the plaintiffs, or if a settlement is reached, any changes to state law — including additional funding for schools — would need legislative action to be implemented.
The bill’s proposals echo previous attempts to integrate Twin Cities public schools. In 2001, the Choice is Yours program, in which the state paid to bus low-income Minneapolis students to suburban school districts, came out of a settlement from a similar lawsuit, also filed by Shulman. That program also created inter-district magnet schools through the West Metro Education Program and the East Metro Education Program.
Minneapolis Public Schools changed its school assignment policies, school attendance boundaries and magnet programs in 2021 — partially in response to the Cruz-Guzman lawsuit — in an attempt to draw the district’s wealthy students into magnet programs in schools that had previously served primarily low-income students of color.
The changes have largely failed to create integrated magnet schools, and last year the district removed almost all of its additional financial support to help the magnet schools succeed.
In other respects, the proposals in Frazier’s bill differ from earlier attempts at desegregation. The focus is now on balancing the economic status of students within schools, rather than relying on race. The state would also provide additional revenue for districts that participate in the various integration programs, not just transportation aid.
Unlike Choice is Yours, which only bussed low-income Minneapolis students out of the district, the bill would also pay to bus high-income students to schools serving primarily low-income students.
Charter schools would also be eligible to participate in the integration programs.
The bill has been referred to the House Education Policy Committee but it has not yet had a committee hearing.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Minnesota-Reformer-File-74-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-22 09:10:12.694907

Nancy Mace talks to Harley Hicks, a transgender student at the University of South Carolina, at an event held by the school's Turning Point USA chapter on Monday, April 21, 2025. (Photo by Shaun Chornobroff/South Carolina Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Following a contentious exchange with a college campus audience, U.S. Rep Nancy Mace doubled down on offensive language toward a transgender student and then posted a video of the interaction on social media.
After approaching the stage, University of South Carolina student Harley Hicks, who uses she/they pronouns, asked Mace to apologize for using the word “tranny.”
Is that “derogatory to you?” Mace asked after a speaking event hosted by USC’s chapter of Turning Point USA, a nonprofit that advocates for conservative viewpoints on high school and college campuses across the country.
“Well, yeah. Of course it f—ing is,” Hicks responded.
Mace, who’s considering a run for governor in 2026, then repeated the word three times, as seen in the video she posted on X.
After the interaction, Hicks grabbed a potted plant, which Mace said her security team thought Hicks was going to throw at her. Mace repeated the claim on a Fox News appearance after the event.
Talking to a pair of reporters, the 20-year-old student denied that claim.
“I’m like a shark, more afraid of her than she is of me,” said Hicks, who added that being at the event as a trans person was one of the bravest actions she’d ever taken.
“If I were attacking her, you’d have seen a very different video,” Hicks said.
About 60 people attended the roughly 35-minute event at USC’s student life center.
It quickly devolved into a question-and-answer session as people in the audience interrupted Mace’s speech by shouting questions about immigration, abortion, student loans, and her repeated use of the phrase “lunatic left” to describe Democrats.
Monday’s interaction comes after multiple controversies between Mace and trans people.
In February, the 1st District congresswoman was criticized for using the same offensive language she used with Hicks during a House Oversight Committee hearing on spending by the United States Agency for International Development, known as USAID, which the Trump administration has halted.
Mace accused USAID of “funding some of the dumbest, I mean stupidest, just dumbest initiatives imaginable, all supported by the left,” citing a list of diversity and transgender advocacy initiatives funded around the world.
Following the election of Delaware Rep. Sarah McBride, the first openly transgender member of Congress in November, Mace led the charge to ban transgender women from using women’s restrooms in the U.S. Capitol and House office buildings. House Speaker Mike Johnson then issued a rule that “all single-sex facilities in the Capitol and House Office Buildings — such as restrooms, changing rooms, and locker rooms — are reserved for individuals of that biological sex.”
Mace then introduced legislation to expand the rule to all federal buildings, as well as a separate bill applying the rule to restrooms nationwide.
The 47-year-old congresswoman didn’t mention McBride by name but alluded to her at Monday’s event.
“I was the first woman last year in Congress when we had somebody who was elected, who was a biological male dressed as a woman, who decided this isn’t going to happen in the United States,” Mace said.
“It’s not going to happen in South Carolina. It’s not going to happen anywhere, if I decide to put a stop to it,” she added.
Over the weekend, an interaction between the congresswoman and Ely Murray-Quick at an Ulta Beauty store went viral after both the constituent and Mace posted video from their perspective.
Murray-Quick questioned Mace about not holding any in-person town halls, something she has been consistently criticized for in recent weeks. By the end of the video, both Mace and Murray-Quick had traded curse words.
The congresswoman has pointed to threats against her and staffers as the reason there has yet to be an in-person town hall in 2025. On April 8, she held a telephone town hall without advance notice or promotion.
Mace was the first to curse in the video that’s pinned to the top of her X profile. When asked by a pair of female reporters ahead of the event why she started cursing and if that behavior was appropriate for a member of Congress, Mace criticized them.
“To shame a woman for standing up for herself is completely ridiculous. That’s what you’re doing. You’re shaming a woman for standing up for herself,” she said. “Either of you, how do you think that makes other women feel?”
Minutes later, Mace took the stage and told the crowd that she had to “call out the insanity” with reporters who “were offended that an adult female used a curse word.”
“I’m like, have you seen my interviews?” she said.
It only took four minutes before Mace’s speech was interrupted by people in the audience.
When asked about mass deportations of immigrants without proper authorization, Mace said, “We did it under Obama, we did it under Biden, we did it under Bush and beyond. If it was good enough for all of those presidents then, it’s good enough for Trump today.”
When asked if it was necessary for immigrants to receive due process with judicial proceedings, Mace said “they didn’t have due process on the way in, they shouldn’t get it on the way out.”
Her take received a mix of cheers and yells from an outraged crowd.
While the event was held by a conservative group, the most vocal members of the audience disagreed with Mace. One even asked if her faith in God is genuine.
“Yes, I went to church yesterday,” Mace said.
Mace has publicly said she’s mulling a run for governor.
Others publicly considering a bid include Attorney General Alan Wilson, Lt. Gov. Pam Evette and U.S. Rep Ralph Norman, as well as state Senators Josh Kimbrell and Sean Bennett.
Holly Sox, a 58-year-old Gilbert resident, was among the attendees Monday.
Though a lifelong Republican, she said she started voting for Democrats last year due to the rhetoric of Mace and the Make America Great Again movement.
“This MAGA crowd has corrupted and co-opted what I grew up believing,” said Sox, who was wearing a shirt with the face of U.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett of Texas, who Mace has sparred with.
The final question of the event came from a self-identified Democrat, who asked how Democrats can trust that Mace will have a real conversation with people she’s labeled part of the “lunatic left.” When the congresswoman said she’ll have a conversation with anyone, the person followed by asking if that extends to the trans community.
“It applies to everybody,” she said. “But I’m not going to allow some guy in a skirt to be in my bathroom or in my locker room undressed.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_5537-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-04-22 10:03:59.137924

(Courtesy of Travis Entenman)My recent trip to Washington, D.C., sponsored by United Today, Stronger Tomorrow (UTST), was a powerful reminder of what can be achieved when community members unite to educate decisionmakers about the priorities they’ve identified as most important back at home. Alongside 40 mostly rural and remote leaders from a broad range of organizations, sectors, and elected offices across eight states, we brought critical issues to the forefront by sharing specific, data-supported, real-world impacts of freezing, cutting, or clawing back federal investments in our communities. Together, we were able to lift up rural and remote voices in the halls of power.
Northern Prairies Land Trust (NPLT) has long championed conservation efforts across South Dakota. Our work preserving grasslands and advocating for farmers and ranchers aligns perfectly with UTST’s own commitment to developing grassroots leaders to advocate on their own behalf for priorities that they’ve identified. In half-a-dozen meetings, we emphasized the urgent need to address the U.S. Department of Agriculture funding freeze, which is jeopardizing vital conservation programs and leaving producers without promised resources.
Funding freezes and staff cuts pull the rug out from under farmers

The USDA funding freeze has placed farmers in an untenable position, with many struggling to cover costs for projects initiated under programs like the Agricultural Conservation Easement Program (ACEP). As I’ve noted in recent writings, this freeze undermines an already fragile trust between producers and government agencies. Farmers and ranchers who have invested in fencing, cover crops, and renewable energy systems are now left uncertain about their financial futures. Our advocacy aimed to restore that trust by educating policymakers about the dire consequences of interrupting these federal investments, choosing not to honor existing contracts, or refusing to release funds critical to sustaining rural and remote economies.
While streamlining the federal government is a valid goal, it should not come at the expense of rural and remote communities and the environment. We need targeted solutions that address inefficiencies without jeopardizing vital conservation programs. During my meetings with our members of Congress, I emphasized the need for a more nuanced approach that considers the unique needs of agricultural communities. Their reactions, both positive and surprised, emphasized the importance of flying “experts from the field” to Washington, D.C., to share, face-to-face, the fruits of our experiences “on the ground.”
The USDA’s actions threaten the progress we have made in promoting regenerative agriculture and conservation. It is imperative that we reverse these harmful cuts and ensure that farmers have the resources they need to protect our land and water. My conversations in Washington underscored the urgency of this issue, and I urge policymakers to prioritize the needs of our agricultural communities.
Despite these challenges, our meetings with lawmakers were encouraging. Our members of Congress expressed a willingness to explore solutions that would restore funding and support farmers who have already invested in conservation projects. The discussions highlighted the importance of organizations like NPLT and UTST in bridging the gap between local needs and federal policy. These moments of collaboration underscored a shared commitment to protecting both agricultural livelihoods and natural resources.
As we move forward, it is clear that unity, education, and advocacy are key to overcoming challenges like the USDA funding freeze. The positivity and progress from our meetings in Washington give hope that solutions are within reach. In fact, this week, UTST will join local farmers, community organizations, and health centers for the South Dakota Stronger Tomorrow Rural Bus Tour with members of Congress who are home on recess. This time, the policymakers will be on our turf, and I anticipate it will result in an even deeper understanding of the unique challenges and opportunities federal investments can manifest in South Dakota. What’s certain is that together with partners like UTST, we will continue to champion producers, conservationists, and rural and remote communities — proving that united efforts today truly lead to a stronger tomorrow.

Special education advocates and educators in California are raising red flags over President Donald Trump’s dismantling of the U.S. Department of Education and how it would affect some of California’s most vulnerable students.
As CalMatters’ Carolyn Jones explains, nearly 800,000 K-12 California students, or 14%, are enrolled in special education. Last year the state spent roughly $13 billion on special education, with the federal government covering about 10%. 
In his push to shutdown the federal education department, Trump is slashing its workforce by half, and in March he said he plans to move special education oversight to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services — itself undergoing a more than 20% reduction in workforce.
Trump has also threatened to pull federal funding for schools to states, including California, that do not comply with his orders to terminate diversity efforts or to limit protections for transgender students. 
At the same time, while Congress left special education funding intact in the most recently passed budget, its GOP members are considering deep cuts to Medicaid as they seek to maintain 2017 tax cuts that primarily benefit the rich. 
Medicaid helps school districts pay for speech and occupational therapy, as well as mental health services for students with disabilities. Regional centers in California, which are partly funded by Medicaid, also provide parents with disabled children diagnoses, medical equipment such as wheelchairs and other services.
Any federal cuts or changes to special education could have a major effect on the community and jeopardize the safety of students and staff, according to some special education experts. For Gina Gandolfi, a former special education teacher in San Bernardino County, she worries whether Trump’s changes would disrupt the services her son receives. Nathan, who is a ten-year-old with Down syndrome, receives speech and occupational therapy and one-to-one classroom support. 

Gandolfi: “The disability community has fought hard for where we are now. What if those services are taken away? Kids with disabilities will go back to being second-class students.”

Could CA Republicans regain the governorship?

As Democratic candidates for California’s crowded 2026 gubernatorial race wait in anticipation for former Vice President Kamala Harris to decide whether she’ll throw her hat in the ring, Republican candidates seek to become the state’s first GOP governor in more than a decade, writes CalMatters’ Alexei Koseff.
Despite an overwhelmingly Democratic populace, California Republicans have some reason to be optimistic: In November they flipped three seats in the state Legislature, and Trump increased his vote share in nearly every county. Two of the more high-profile GOP candidates for California’s highest elected office are Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco and former Fox News host Steve Hilton, who joined the race Monday. 
Both candidates want to eliminate the state income tax and roll back environmental regulations. They are also vocal Trump supporters who argue that California is faring worse under the Democratic party’s policies on crime, homelessness and the economy.

Bianco, to CalMatters: “We are being led down a path of complete government control and socialism. This is no longer Democrat versus Republican. We’re at a point where it’s sane versus insane.”


Hilton, to CalMatters: “I don’t think there’s any other way of describing California today, other than the sick man of America. It’s just undeniable that we’re in a terrible, terrible mess in California and we have to change direction.”

Homeowners sue insurance companies

From CalMatters economy reporter Levi Sumagaysay:
California homeowners sued the state’s biggest insurance companies late Friday, saying the companies conspired to cancel policyholders and caused them to be under-insured after the Los Angeles County fires. 
The lawsuits, brought by two law firms on behalf of homeowners, name State Farm, Farmers, 21st Century and other insurers as plaintiffs accused of violating the state’s antitrust and unfair practice laws. The plaintiffs allege the “group boycott” by the insurers drove Californians to the FAIR Plan, the insurer of last resort — which is run by an association of the same insurers. The plan, which offers less coverage but higher prices than other policies, essentially shifted financial risk to homeowners, the lawsuits say. 
One lawsuit seeks class-action status on behalf of all FAIR Plan customers. The other was filed on behalf of some families that had FAIR Plan policies when their homes burned down in the recent L.A.-area fires.
The suits say the coordination was made possible through meetings among the FAIR Plan board and two industry groups. Rex Frazier, president of the Personal Insurance Federation of California, called it “an outrageous lie that distracts from the well-known state policies that predictably caused, and continue to cause, the market problems.” The other group, the American Property Casualty Insurance Association, did not immediately return a request for comment.



And lastly: CA offers discounted Naloxone

California Voices
CalMatters columnist Dan Walters: Though Trump’s tariffs might make California’s economy worse, the state’s film, tech and agricultural industries have already been struggling.
To achieve California’s clean energy goals, its lawmakers must pass a bill that would help make it easier to build more solar and wind projects in the North American West, writes Michael Wara, director of the Climate and Energy Policy Program.

By assessing a flat rate as well as additional per capita fees on social media platforms with over 100,000 monthly users, SF3197 would raise an estimated $137 million in 2026-27 from the 14 largest platforms operating in Minnesota. 
Here’s why the data mining tax is a good idea
Like efforts to curtail multinational corporate tax avoidance in 2023, this is an important and innovative idea that would once again make Minnesota a national leader in creating a stronger and more equitable tax code. 
Democratic lawmakers registered enthusiastic support during initial hearings, with pointed criticisms of an exploitative industry. House Ways and Means Chair Zack Stephenson, DFL-Coon Rapids, and Sen. Grant Hauschild, DFL-Hermantown, likened the data mining tax to taxes on smoking and mineral extraction, respectively. Hauschild went so far as to describe social media platforms as leeches, and he’s not off base.
In 2024, for example, Meta made $62 billion in after-tax profits on $164 billion in revenue for an astounding 42% profit margin. Out of $69 billion in net revenue, they paid just $8.3 billion in taxes for an effective tax rate of 12%. 
These earnings don’t result from new value or innovation in the traditional sense, but from attention-seeking business models that create addictive behavior among users while generating few jobs and little in socially productive economic activity. 
Multiple scientific studies have found social media use is strongly associated with increased rates of mental health challenges like depression, anxiety and disordered eating, especially among children and adolescents. 
Social media advertising models have also contributed to the degradation of our information ecosystem, which is an essential pillar of democracy. The southwest Metro and southeastern Minnesota lost 10 local newspapers last April alone, all replaced with nothing other than Facebook rage and viral conspiracy theories. 
In my testimony on the bill, I explained how the policy could be described as a Pigouvian tax — a tax levied on a socially harmful activity in hopes of reducing its prevalence and/or raising revenue to compensate for its deleterious effects. Big tech is increasingly leveraging in-depth user knowledge to extract maximum profit. To allow these practices to proliferate with minimal regulation is bad enough, but to do so without any fiscal compensation is simply foolish. 
A tax on data mining is especially important in the case of social media platforms because they offer their services for free, in exchange for access to consumer data, which is then monetized through the sale of advertising. 
Economists describe this as a barter — you give them lots of data about yourself, and in exchange they let you scroll for free — and policy experts have written on the importance of taxing such transactions, both to discourage the rampant acceleration of hidden extraction, and so that the public can benefit from growing industries in which traditional monetary transactions don’t occur.
To put it in simple terms: The Zucks of the world are enriching themselves by pumping us full of free content that comes with high hidden costs. The new tax would act as a limiter, or at least a compensator, for those hidden costs. 

Similar to the discussion around sales tax exemptions, there is a fairness argument for businesses here as well. According to the Department of Revenue, businesses pay nearly half of all state sales taxes, but not all industries incur the same sales tax liabilities. White collar and other intangible services are generally not subject to sales taxes while many tangible goods are. 
A parallel pattern plays out in the broader economy: If growing online industries generate substantial profit based on the value of consumer data, but consumer data is not taxable, then these industries have an inherent advantage over others, even if those others provide more socially productive goods and services. 
That’s a lot of reasons to celebrate. 
Here’s the bad news
None of these arguments will persuade influential business groups to support the idea. With an evenly split House, any tax increase will face a difficult path to becoming law. 
Initial objections by the business-funded Council on State Taxation follow a familiar pattern — using legalese and overly complex language to grant an air of authority to their arguments that boil down more simply to “our wealthy funders don’t want to pay taxes.” But while many of these points are in bad faith, Minnesota would be the first state to pass this policy, and there are implementation questions as well as a guarantee of court challenges, which have arisen over similar policies in Maryland. 
Legal challenges will arise, not because it is illegal or unjustified, but because large tech firms have the money and incentive to fight tooth and nail against any new tax. This is what happened with digital ad taxes in Maryland, but advocates there have cleared significant hurdles, and the state is collecting tax revenue in the meantime. There’s something deeply undemocratic about this strategy of legal obstruction, and Minnesota shouldn’t be deterred. 
As bad news goes, that’s not the worst. 
Here’s where it gets ugly
The data mining tax, though certainly worthwhile, is the result of a politics that sees taxes as a punishment that should be heaped only on the wicked. I am all for taxing extractive practices, but those sorts of policies won’t get us anywhere near the revenues we need to avoid looming cuts to education and disability services, let alone mitigate the damage wrought by impending federal budget cuts. The real revenues we need will require raising taxes on a larger swath of Minnesota residents and businesses — something politicians on both sides of the aisle are very reluctant to do.
In tax policy circles, there’s a phrase used to describe this dynamic. “Don’t tax me, don’t tax thee; tax the man behind the tree!” In other words, everyone wants a tax that raises revenue from someone else. And that’s the exact sort of thinking we are seeing here, as fingers point to a handful of large companies with poor reputations that are nowhere near the primary culprits of our top heavy economy.
In New York, for example, a similar bill created a rate and fee structure much the same as this one, but applied it to all data collection, not just that by social media platforms. That policy design brought in banks, credit card companies, cell phone providers, and more. That would raise considerably more revenue and much more meaningfully crack down on unfettered data collection as a business model. But it would seem that even those major industries didn’t make for a clear enough villain for Minnesota legislators this time around.
Furthermore, and somewhat ironically, some of the same senators that railed impressively against social media platforms are also moving to potentially expand tax breaks for data centers run by some of the very same companies impacted by the social media data mining tax. I think they mean well, and I can understand the desire to attract new high-paying jobs. But the contrast reveals that we are still in need of a deeper attitude adjustment around taxes.
Taxing online enterprises is essential to the state’s long-term budgetary stability, so I am glad we are starting the conversation. In a bad budget year, it’s refreshing to see legislators fighting to make more profitable corporations pay their fair share. 
But this policy is not on par with our revenue needs. We can’t just find someone we don’t like and tax them. We have to agree to tax ourselves because it’s the only way to create a more effective government and humane society moving forward.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/socialmedia-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-04-22 09:10:12.694907

Steve Hilton and Chad Bianco lead the field of Republicans who hope to snap a long GOP losing streak in next year’s California governor’s race.


After more than a decade being exiled from the governor’s office in California, Republicans are eyeing growing voter frustration with the dominant liberal politics of the state as a launching pad for a comeback next year.
Though lacking the statewide profiles of a deluge of Democratic contenders, a pair of GOP hopefuls with devoted conservative followings has jumped into the open 2026 gubernatorial race in recent months, hoping to persuade voters that only a radical shakeup can fix California’s problems.
“I don’t think there’s any other way of describing California today, other than the sick man of America,” said Steve Hilton, a former Fox News host and onetime political adviser to British Prime Minister David Cameron who officially announced his candidacy on Monday. “It’s just undeniable that we’re in a terrible, terrible mess in California and we have to change direction.”
Hilton is kicking off his campaign today with an event in Huntington Beach, the city that has remade itself over the past few years into the bulwark of conservative resistance in California. He follows Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco, a hero of the right for defying state mandates during the COVID pandemic, who entered the race to succeed termed-out Gov. Gavin Newsom in February.
Both believe that voters have grown sick of a generation of one-party Democratic rule in Sacramento and are banking on appeals to cut taxes and regulations — which they blame for making California unaffordable — to reach across traditional partisan lines.
“We are being led down a path of complete government control and socialism,” Bianco said in an interview. “This is no longer Democrat versus Republican. We’re at a point where it’s sane versus insane.”
But conservative candidates face a steep climb in a state that has not elected a Republican to statewide office since Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger won a second term in 2006.
California Democratic Party Chairperson Rusty Hicks said the gubernatorial race is about more than just who can deliver for Californians. Voters know the governor has a powerful platform to stand up to the Trump administration and they won’t want a Republican in a role that is also critical to the future of the rest of the country and the whole world, he said.
“I certainly applaud them for continuing to try,” Hicks said. “But time and time again, we see California voters see their policies for what they are, which is not in line with the values of Californians.”
Slashing taxes and regulations
More than 20 people have already filed a statement of intention to run for governor in the 2026 primary as Republicans — though few will be serious candidates and some may never qualify for the ballot at all, which requires paying a filing fee or submitting thousands of signatures from registered voters.
Only two, including Bianco, have reported raising any money for their campaigns so far. While the first fundraising report of 2025 is not due until the end of July, major donations are filed with the state on a rolling basis.
Leo Zacky, a poultry farm heir and perennial candidate who received 1.3% of the vote in the 2022 gubernatorial primary and 0.1% in the 2021 recall election, seeded his campaign last month with $50,000 of his own money.
Meanwhile, since launching his campaign in February, Bianco has reported more than $380,000 in major contributions — enough to solidify himself as an early frontrunner for conservative voters, but a far cry from the millions that some Democratic contenders have already raised.
That leaves an opening for Hilton, 55, a native of the United Kingdom who moved to California in 2012 with his wife, a public relations executive for tech companies. Hilton has a built-in audience from hosting the weekly commentary program “The Next Revolution” on Fox News from 2017 to 2023, and Silicon Valley connections that could provide the money he needs to spread his message more broadly.
Hilton said his campaign will focus on practical solutions to rebuild a “ladder of opportunity,” so that every Californian can have a great job and a great home — though many of them are ideas that the Democratic supermajority in the Legislature is unlikely to ever support.
He would eliminate the state income tax for Californians below an unspecified income level. He wants to boost housing development by simplifying building codes, ending lawsuits under the infamous California Environmental Quality Act, and promoting construction of single-family homes. He believes the state needs mandatory phonics education and more accountability for teachers based on test scores to improve student achievement.
Though he has had a long career in politics, Hilton has never held elected office himself, which he argues is an asset.
“I would ask people, how good are the machine politicians in Sacramento who are involved in this one-party rule? How is that working?” Hilton said.
Bianco, 57, was a longtime sheriff’s deputy in Riverside County who ran for sheriff in 2018 out of frustration with what he called a “pro-criminal” approach to public safety in California. During his two terms as chief law enforcement officer of Riverside County, he has been a controversial but locally popular figure, refusing to enforce Newsom’s COVID lockdown orders or apologize for his brief affiliation with the far-right Oath Keepers militia.

He said he’s now running for governor because, like many Californians, he is tired of how the government has failed a state that people otherwise love. Many of his priorities align with Hilton’s: Bianco would like to completely abolish the state income tax, get rid of laws that he said are driving farmers and ranchers out of business, and leave environmental regulation to the federal government.
And echoing the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency initiative, Bianco said he wants to eliminate wasteful spending such as the high-speed rail project and multibillion-dollar programs that have not reduced homelessness.
“The number one job of government is public safety,” Bianco said. “All the rest of it is fluff.”
The anti-Trump bump
California Republicans have been jubilant since the November election, when they flipped three seats in the state Legislature as President Donald Trump increased his vote share in nearly every county. At a party convention in Sacramento last month, they strategized over how to build on the momentum by leaning into issues such as affordability and crime that appear to be helping them gain ground, particularly among Latino voters.
“That tells us that Californians, on the local level and when it comes to the laws that are being passed in Sacramento, they’re looking to Republicans,” Corrine Rankin, the newly elected chairperson of the California Republican Party, said in an interview. “They’re rejecting the failures that are coming out of the Capitol by the Democrats.”
In a February survey by the Public Policy Institute of California, only 48% of likely voters said the state is going in the right direction, compared to 51% who said it’s going in the wrong direction — underwater, albeit the highest approval in two years.
To win the governorship next year, Rankin said the state GOP would eventually unite behind a candidate who can help Californians understand how that dissatisfaction is driven by what Democrats in charge of the state are doing.
“We need change here in California. Californians expect change and we’re positioned to deliver,” she said.
But the modest advances of the last election belie a GOP that is still far from competitive in California. Trump only received about 38% of the vote, losing to Democratic nominee Kamala Harris by more than 20 percentage points, and Republicans lost three U.S. House seats.
The 2026 midterms, in which Democratic anger at the Trump administration could produce an even more liberal electorate, will be a difficult political environment for the California GOP to snap a statewide shutout that dates back to 2010. In 2022, no Republican candidate for statewide office came within 10 percentage points of victory, and most lost by about twice that margin.
Andrew Acosta, a Democratic political consultant who is not working on the governor’s race, said there are substantive problems in California for serious conservatives to campaign on. “The Republicans have a lot of fodder if they did it the right way,” he said.
But candidates so closely tied to Trump are unlikely to overcome the deep anti-Trump sentiment in the electorate and win the governorship next year, Acosta added. “There’s zero chance of these Republicans.”
Both Hilton and Bianco are vocal Trump supporters. Hilton’s campaign even references the MAGA movement with a “make California golden again” slogan, and he rolled out an endorsement on the first day from Vivek Ramaswamy, one of the architects of Trump’s DOGE initiative.
Though some Democratic candidates are already tapping into the fury at Trump to fuel their campaigns, Hilton said the focus is misplaced.
“None of that helps a single person in California,” he said. “These are real issues. So if Democrat candidates want to deflect from that and become national political commentators, then good luck with that.”
Bianco said Democrats have done “outstanding psychological warfare” for decades convincing people that Republicans cannot win in California, which has suppressed conservative participation in elections. But things have finally gotten so bad, he said, that those frustrated voters will turn out next year and elect a Republican governor.
“We can’t blame Donald Trump. Donald Trump doesn’t have anything to do with California and the laws that have been passed in the past 20 years,” he said. “I believe that the majority of people, of hard-working Californians, have conservative leanings.”

But will its first cohort be its last?,"In summary
Santa Monica College started the first community college program to train people for much-needed jobs in homeless services. But will its first cohort be its last?


With more than 187,000 people sleeping on California’s streets and in its shelters, the state’s homeless services industry is struggling to hire enough qualified workers to help them. 
Last year, Santa Monica College set out to fix that: It heralded the state’s first-ever community college program aimed at training the next generation of homeless service workers. But the program has fallen victim to many of the same challenges that have long stymied progress on homelessness in California, including unreliable funding, high attrition rates and political turmoil. 
In fact, it’s not clear if the much-needed program will persist. 
“We know the value added when somebody is adequately trained before they’re deployed,” said Vanessa Rios, a senior advisor for workforce development with the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority, which funds the community college program. “It would be a disservice to our system should we not fund and support this effort. Where the dollars (will) come from, I don’t know.”
It’s the front-line jobs, where staff interact face-to-face with unhoused clients, that often are the most difficult for agencies to fill or keep filled. That includes doing outreach in encampments, staffing homeless shelters, and working as a case manager trying to find permanent housing for clients. 
More than 8,000 people worked in the homeless services sector in Los Angeles County in 2022, a report by consulting firm KPMG and United Way of Greater Los Angeles found. But the county still had more than 1,300 open positions and would need more than 2,200 workers on top of that — so, more than 11,500 altogether — to meet the needs of Los Angeles County’s homeless population. 
Even compared to other major U.S. cities such as Atlanta, Chicago or Houston, homeless service workers in Los Angeles have a higher turnover rate, according to a more recent KPMG report. 
It’s an issue all over the state. Most nonprofits that provide homeless services in California can’t help everyone who asks, in part because they struggle to recruit and retain staff, according to a 2024 study by the UC Berkeley Terner Center for Housing Innovation.
The new community college program was supposed to fill those holes by giving students the specific skills they need to succeed in homeless services. But amid perennial state budget uncertainty and questions about the region’s homeless services, Rios couldn’t say if her team will be able to fund another round of students at Santa Monica College. 
The state’s Homeless Housing, Assistance and Prevention fund initially supported the program with roughly $750,000. That fund is the main source of flexible money that California cities and counties use to combat homelessness. Once the $750,000 runs out, it’s not clear whether it will be renewed. Gov. Gavin Newsom’s proposed budget, released in January, did not include any new money for Homeless Housing, Assistance and Prevention, although the Legislature could still add some.
That uncertainty is a major problem. For years, nonprofits, cities and counties have said a lack of consistent state funding hampers their ability to fight homelessness. While Newsom has poured billions into the cause, it has largely been in one-time grants — not the predictable, ongoing funding that service providers say they need in order to plan long-term programs.
At the same time, the agency that funds the community college program is in crisis. The Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority — a joint agency of the city and county of LA — has all but imploded. Earlier this month, the LA County Board of Supervisors voted to pull its money out of the joint agency, following a scathing audit of its work. Three days later, the head of the agency said she would resign. Now,  the city is considering pulling out as well.

“We’re hopeful that we’re able to secure funding in the future,” said Patricia Ramos, dean of academic affairs for Santa Monica College. “But nothing is guaranteed.” 
Rios said her team is looking for additional money to support the college program, including from the state and philanthropic partners. If the community college program does continue, it wouldn’t accept another class of students until spring of 2026. 
‘Can I do this?’
When Tamyra Simpson saw a LinkedIn advertisement about the Santa Monica College program, she thought it was “too good to be true.”
Growing up, her grandmother, a substance use counselor, would pick up Simpson at her childhood home in Pasadena and travel to Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles, where they’d serve food to homeless people on Thanksgiving. 
“The women in my family, they’ve always been service-oriented,” she said. 
Simpson works as a nanny in the wealthy Los Feliz neighborhood near downtown Los Angeles, but said her goal is to eventually work in homeless services. 
She was one of about 70 people who applied for admission into the inaugural Santa Monica College homelessness services program, and one of just 27 students who were ultimately selected, said Steven Sedky, who oversees the program. Students take multiple courses over the span of two semesters, where they learn about the history of homeless services, effective practices to help homeless clients, and even strategies to avoid burnout. The program culminates in a paid internship at a relevant nonprofit or agency in Los Angeles County.

Only about half of the students are left, Sedky said — an attrition rate “much higher than we initially anticipated.” 
Students dropped out for a variety of reasons, he said. One student lost housing, while other students struggled with the commute to class, which includes in-person meetings on Wednesdays. 
On Wednesday mornings, Simpson starts her nanny job at 7 am. Then, around 8 am, she begins the hour drive to Santa Monica. If traffic is bad, it can take up to an hour and a half. After class, a little after noon,  she drives back to Los Feliz and works another five hours  as a nanny. 
“I really ask myself, ‘Can I do this?’” she said. “But there’s so much value in this program, this experience. I don’t think I would have changed anything if I could.” 
After she graduates in June, she’ll face a job market rife with its own challenges. An entry-level position at LA-based homeless services nonprofit The People Concern, for example, typically pays between $21 and $25 an hour, said CEO John Maceri. Simpson said she makes about twice that much working as a nanny. 
“LA is an expensive place to live,” Maceri said. “It’s hard to survive.”
 “This sector does not pay livable wages unless you’re in senior management,” said Celina Alvarez, executive director of Housing Works. She helped create the Santa Monica College program and teaches a class there. “We’ve got to do better by (the workers). They are first responders. They don’t even have access to mental health support, considering they experience and witness a tremendous amount of human suffering on a daily basis.” 
Alvarez said between 10 and 15 of the 73 total jobs at her organization are vacant. 
At The People Concern, which will host two Santa Monica College students as interns, about 85 jobs are open — about 10% of their total positions. Once the interns complete the program, Maceri said his organization would be happy to hire them.
“The quality of the work is only as good as the quality of the people doing the work,” he said. “And we need more folks in the homelessness response system workforce.”
A difficult job
Low pay isn’t the only thing that makes people wary of jumping into a career in homeless services. The work is extremely grueling and difficult. Burnout is common. A lack of resources makes everything worse. Workers can try their best to help someone, but if there are no shelter beds or housing available, they can’t do much. That can be very frustrating, Maceri said. 
“Sometimes people have a fantasy of what the work is like, and then get into it and realize ‘Oh, this is different than what I thought,’” he said. “I think most people want to help, but the intensity of the work day in and day out is a lot to handle.”
A lack of adequate training makes it even harder, as workers may not know how to respond to the specific challenges they encounter in the field. Alvarez gave an example of a newly hired case manager at her organization: The case manager went to a client’s house to pick up the client for a psychiatric appointment. Before they left, the client injected themself with an unknown substance. The big-hearted case manager didn’t know what the client had injected but took them to their appointment anyway — a dangerous move that could have ended with the client becoming aggressive or even overdosing in the caseworker’s car, Alvarez said. 
Existing degree programs don’t train workers for the realities of what they’ll face in the field, such as navigating the bureaucracy of hospitals and nursing homes, or how to reunite a homeless individual with family, Rios said.
The program also tries to prepare students for burnout, by providing counselors who debrief with students after they go out in the field, and teach them techniques to cope with what they see.

But there are some intractable problems this training program can’t fix. 
For social workers, who have a master’s degree, it’s more lucrative to work as a therapist in private practice. Even other low-paying industries, such as child welfare, offer special grants or fellowships. In Los Angeles, the county’s decision to gut the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority makes it even harder for graduates to imagine this industry as a stable career choice.  
Still, as a current student, Simpson is hopeful that the community college program will continue. 
“As an inaugural cohort, there are going to be missteps. We’re essentially the guinea pigs,” she said. “At its core, it’s an incredible opportunity.” 
She said she’s well-aware of the pay cut that an entry-level job in homeless services might require, and that she’s willing to keep her full-time nanny position as long as it takes to find other work. 
Given the number of job vacancies, it’s unlikely that she’ll wait very long.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/070624_LA-Homeless_REUTERS_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-22 09:10:12.694907

Clean. Reliable. Affordable. Those are the challenging but achievable goals for California’s electric grid. 
To affordably and reliably get the clean energy required to run a state as populous and prosperous as California, we have to build. We must build all of the rooftop renewables that we can. We need to build unprecedented amounts of new solar and battery storage at big power plants throughout California. And we must import significant quantities of renewable energy from other states to fill the gaps. 
We need all three. And the third means renewed and deeper collaboration with our energy partners across the West.  
State Sen. Josh Becker’s proposal, Senate Bill 540, represents the carefully considered path to achieving that partnership. SB 540 continues the march started by several western energy officials who proposed a new independently governed entity offering an expansive suite of wholesale electricity market functions across the largest possible footprint. Making a market that spans the North American West is fundamental to providing a roadmap for solar and wind projects to get built, helping fill the gaps left by our transformative buildout of clean energy in California.
SB 540 is also critical to enabling California’s participation in that market, and ensures our state has a leadership role since other competing market concepts are less likely to share the commitment to our clean energy goals. 
During a 2020 heat wave, California’s grid operator was forced to institute rotating outages, a necessary step to protect the grid in California and neighboring states. Gov. Gavin Newsom led a careful multi-agency after-action analysis, identified causes and made changes to market design. The state began accelerating the deployment of batteries to help stabilize the grid.
When the next heat wave occurred in 2022, these changes brought positive results. But it was still a close call. During extreme heat last year, the grid remained stable as the solutions had progressed even further. 
We cannot afford to rest on this success. 
Heat waves and related emergencies highlight the challenges of decarbonizing a grid as large as California’s amid ever-worsening climate change. Unfortunately, we need to redouble our efforts because climate change is going to get worse even as we become more dependent on renewable energy resources that do not produce energy at all times. 
SB 540 will allow us to rely on our neighbors in a pinch, and allow them to rely on us as well. This bill is a key next step. 
This is nothing new. Since the Pat Brown era, California has always collaborated in securing its electricity. The transformation we are leading — with our pathbreaking commitment to clean electricity, commitment to electric vehicles and broader goal of demonstrating what a prosperous, opportunity-creating clean energy economy can look like — requires a renewed focus on interstate institutions and structures that have shaped our modern energy reality in ways that may be hard to see. They are taken for granted. 
As the Western Interstate Energy Board brings together stakeholders in California and other states to continue a west-wide pathway, clean, reliable, affordable energy is edging closer to reality. Consumers, utilities and regulators must continue developing a shared market concept that creates wins for everyone. 
SB 540 ensures that California can continue to benefit from those wins and increase collaboration and efficiencies across the West. History — both the early path to national economic leadership and the recent close calls with our grid — counsel continued work to create the governance necessary to build and run the 100% clean grid that is California’s North Star. 
My research with economists, engineers and policy analysts has shown that clear, equitably enforced market rules are key for achieving California’s energy and climate goals. SB 540 is the next major step on a course toward practical solutions to this challenge.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/100422-ROOFTOP-SOLAR-REUTERS-MB-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C718&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-22 09:10:12.694907

(File photo by Danielle E. Gaines/Maryland Matters)Mike Tidwell is one of the most aggressive lobbyists in Annapolis, a fierce advocate for climate action who doesn’t suffer fools gladly. Lobbying a state government that routinely resists bold action, where progress is incremental at best, Tidwell has been known to aggravate legislative leaders, administration officials and their top aides with a pull-no-punches style highlighting the urgency of the climate crisis.
But playing against perception, if not against type, Tidwell, the founder and leader of the Chesapeake Climate Action Network (CCAN), has just released a book about global warming that is sweet and lyrical, almost poetic, and surprisingly hopeful.
“The Lost Trees of Willow Avenue” is, in one sense, what it purports to be: A look at how severe weather and climate change have decimated the tree canopy on a single street in Takoma Park, where Tidwell lives. But it’s also a broader meditation on multiple global environmental crises and the people who are heroically trying to do something about them, even at a very micro level.
CCAN has been around for more than two decades now, but probably few people who interact with Tidwell know much about his own journey into climate activism. Once a journalist and travel writer, Tidwell began fretting about the world his son and younger generations would be inheriting and became convinced he needed to do more personally. So CCAN, which has become a regional environmental powerhouse, was born.
Tidwell’s book essentially charts his own activism and observations, particularly in the historically hot year of 2023, alongside the sometimes sudden and other times slow deaths of towering trees on his street and in the surrounding neighborhood in Takoma Park, the “Peoples Republic” that borders Washington, D.C.
  Mike Tidwell is the Director of the Chesapeake Climate Action Network.
One by one, Tidwell introduces the reader to a cast of characters in Maryland who are trying to do something about climate change. Some are familiar political leaders like Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-8th) and Del. Lorig Charkoudian (D-Montgomery). These two elected officials are climate warriors like Tidwell who have also overcome personal crises over the years – in Tidwell’s case, it’s the lingering and debilitating impacts of Lyme disease, which he contracted several years ago thanks to the proliferation of deer in suburban neighborhoods, a trend directly attributable to climate change. Raskin and Charkoudian also happen to be Tidwell’s neighbors in Takoma Park.
In the book, Tidwell also discusses the desire of a climate scientist who wants to bury dead trees to help capture carbon and heal the Earth; the worries of his pastor, vexed by the expense of responding to the intense flooding that is ravaging the church basement; the work of the city arborist and his bosses in Takoma Park; and numerous neighbors who are scrambling to make the best of the disappearing tree canopy on Willow Street by planting climate-resilient trees, expanding their vegetable gardens, and looking after their neighbors’ lawns.
Through the years, Tidwell has become an unofficial steward of tree health in Takoma Park, leading expeditions of volunteers who clip vines that are choking local trees to death – an effort he describes in his book . It’s a model of cataloguing and pruning he hopes other activists will follow across the country. Tidwell writes at length about the science of tree birth, life and death, about the souls of trees and the healing qualities they bring to communities and all sentient beings.
“The Lost Trees of Willow Avenue” is a quick and enjoyable read, and ultimately serves as a primer for climate action that anyone can follow. Tidwell sounds many hopeful notes on what’s possible and attainable, including the growing prominence of renewable energy across the globe.
It’s worth pointing out that he wrote the book before Donald Trump moved back into the White House in January and before Maryland political leaders backslid alarmingly this year on climate legislation; Tidwell no doubt is licking his wounds and shaking his head after a very rough session for environmentalists in Annapolis.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
But there are important reminders in “The Lost Trees of Willow Avenue”: Climate catastrophes are in the news every day – epic, apocalyptic, international-scale disasters like wildfires, tsunamis and flooding. Yet the ravages of the crisis are around us all the time – so obvious that we can observe and comprehend the implications of a few dead trees on a single suburban street. It follows, then, that the solutions to this existential crisis are often close at hand – and begin with each and every one of us.
Of course, it wouldn’t be a Tidwell book without some polemic. Individual climate action is important, he argues. But don’t lose sight of the responsibilities and culpability of the polluters and their enablers in elected office; collective action is essential.
“We did not, as a country, end racial segregation and stop child labor practices and phase out DDT through voluntary individual choices,” Tidwell observes. “Those victories required national movements of people demanding statutory change. The climate movement, likewise, needs more citizen activists to hasten the switch to clean power and finally abolish fossil fuels by law.”

(CCSD video)A bill to boost the state’s ability to investigate and enforce prevailing wage violations has earned the support of both organized labor and industry groups, but it may still face an uphill battle in the Nevada State Legislature because it would fund new state positions at a time of fiscal uncertainty.
Assembly Bill 502 would restructure the Office of the Labor Commissioner to include a dedicated Public Works Compliance Division to investigate alleged violations of state prevailing wage laws, which set minimum wages for workers on publicly financed projects. The bill also adjusts the penalty structure and allows the office to help public bodies who are having difficulties monitoring compliance.
“We all agree that something needs to change,” Labor Commissioner Brett Harris told lawmakers earlier this month, referring to organized labor groups, the companies that hire them, and the executive branch agency.
The effort to improve the Labor Commissioner office stems from an interim legislative committee. Democratic Assemblymember Max Carter, who represents east Las Vegas, says he was asked to work on proposed legislation.
“I look at this as an industry bill,” he told the Nevada Current. “Not labor or management. It was joint.”
Contractor groups did testify in opposition to AB502 during its hearing in the Assembly Committee on Government Affairs on April 7 but lobbyists emphasized the concerns were relatively minor and could likely be addressed through a minor amendment to the bill.
Lobbyist Warren Hardy, representing the Associated Builders and Contractors of Nevada and Nevada Urban Consortium, called AB502 “the best good faith effort I’ve seen to get at the issues that are of concern.”
The bill was amended and passed out of the committee three days later, and Carter said he believes everyone is satisfied with the end result.
AB502 was referred to the Assembly Ways and Means Committee on Thursday because it comes with a fiscal impact — approximately $790,000 over the biennium, mostly to fund four new staff positions.
Gov. Joe Lombardo included that funding request in his recommended budget.
But many in Carson City expect the state’s revenue forecast to be adjusted downward come May 1 when the Economic Forum meets. If that happens, the state may be forced to “triage,” as Lombardo has put it, state resources and programs, making any request for additional funding much tougher.
Carter told the Current the uncertain revenue outlook feels “like a wet blanket over everything.”
Still, he said he remains “cautiously optimistic” that AB502 can find a path forward.
Labor groups have long said that wage violations are rampant across the state and that better enforcement is needed. In the case of prevailing wage, the public agency awarding the funds is supposed to monitor compliance but many don’t for one reason or another.
“If I go to a big box store and walk out with a set of golf clubs, it will be rapidly investigated, I will be found, prosecuted and punished in a very defined, timely manner,” Nevada State Pipe Trades lobbyist Guy Esposito told lawmakers during the bill hearing. “The people that you represent, wage earners, workers, they probably don’t even know who to call if they haven’t gotten paid properly. If their boss has decided ‘no, you didn’t really work 40 hours last week, you worked 20, and I dare you to say something about it.’”
In Fiscal Year 2024, the Labor Commissioner received 3,828 non-prevailing wage claims and 146 prevailing wage claims, in addition to other types of investigations they oversee. Only 62% of prevailing wage claims were resolved in 90 days, compared to 82% of general wage claims.
The current fiscal year doesn’t end until June 30, but Harris told the committee that as of March 27 her office had received 2,521 wage claims and 185 prevailing wage claims.
“What happens is, our wage and hour claims are so highly voluminous and so regulated that those kind of get priority,” Harris said, adding that public works claims are “more audit heavy” and “a lot denser in technicality” with more complex legal interpretations.
In Nevada, any public project with a contract price of $100,000 or greater that is wholly or partially funded by public dollars is subject to prevailing wage law. Rates for prevailing wage are set annually by the Nevada Office of the Labor Commissioner, which compares similar projects in the region.
Of the 185 wage claims received in the first nine months of the current fiscal year, only 32 were initiated by the public body; 153 were filled by a third party.
Jimmy Schwarz, an organizer with Ironworkers Local 433, said a complaint filed by the union led to members receiving $120,000 in back pay last year.
“Workers were performing iron work and paid as laborers,” he said. “That’s about a $20 an hour difference.”
Harris, who was appointed labor commissioner in 2022, told the Current last year she wanted the office to become more proactive on prevailing wage issues.
The Office of the Labor Commissioner currently has 26 full-time employees. Four of those positions were added last session as part of a 2023 bill that broadened apprenticeship mandates on public works projects.
Republican Assemblymember Rich DeLong asked the labor commissioner if the addition of four new positions this session would be enough considering their current and expected workload.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)As the Trump administration spearheads federal rules revisions on water, considering the removal of Clean Water Act protections, Utah environmental advocates worry it could impact 79% of the water in the Great Salt Lake Basin. 
The Environmental Protection Agency announced in March that it would review the definition of “waters of the United States” to streamline and speed up permitting and cut compliance costs, according to a news release. Also, to comply with a U.S. Supreme Court decision on what constitutes federally protected water. 
That decision limited the scope of federally protected wetlands, ruling that water bodies would only be considered in the conservation provisions if they are “relatively permanent” waterways that are also adjacent to interstate navigable waters, which the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers defines as “waters which are currently used, or were used in the past, or may be susceptible to use in interstate or foreign commerce.” 
However, the proposed rule is expected to go further.

“If finalized as proposed, the EPA’s rule would exclude most of Utah’s seasonal streams and wetlands — waters that make up the bulk of the state’s freshwater ecosystems,” according to a news release by the Utah Wildlife Federation, a wildlife protection organization.
According to a Federal Register notice looking for public input on the proposed rule, “going forward, the (EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers) will seek to provide clear and transparent direction regarding the definition and will prioritize practical implementation approaches, provide for durability and stability, as well as for more effective and efficient jurisdictional determinations, permitting actions, and other actions consistent with relevant decisions of the Supreme Court.”
Any future action on the definition of “waters of the United States” will consider feedback from landowners, industry groups, the agricultural community, states, Tribes, local governments, community organizations, environmental groups, and the general public, according to the notice.



Let us know what you think...


 


That narrower definition increases Utah environmentalists’ worries about the future of the already declining Great Salt Lake, since more than 79% of the water in the basin comes from rain-fed, seasonal streams, the release reads, citing a University of Massachusetts and Yale University study. In Utah, according to the Utah Department of Natural resources, 90% to 95% of water supply comes from seasonal snowfall which feeds the streams and rivers that fill reservoirs and natural lakes. 
“Utah has invested millions in restoring watersheds to improve water quality and help more water reach the Great Salt Lake and drinking water reservoirs,” Isobel Lingenfelter, wildlife connectivity coordinator at the Utah Wildlife Federation, said in a statement. “It’s baffling that, at a time when drought and dust storms threaten our health and economy, the EPA is considering a rule that would make it easier to pollute or destroy the very waters we depend on.”
Cox considers emergency declaration as drought worsens in southern Utah and Lake Powell levels drop

But for Lee Zeldin, the EPA administrator, the policy would make rules clear and consistent across all states.
“The previous Administration’s definition of ‘waters of the United States’ placed unfair burdens on the American people and drove up the cost of doing business,” Zeldin said in a release. “Our goal is to protect America’s water resources consistent with the law of the land while empowering American farmers, landowners, entrepreneurs, and families to help Power the Great American Comeback.” 
According to the EPA, the Biden administration failed to follow the Supreme Court ruling, maintaining uncertainty on what bodies fall under Clean Water Act protections. It’s now a priority for this administration to work with state and local officials “to protect their treasured water bodies while accelerating economic opportunity,” the EPA wrote in the release. 
However, with vulnerable streams feeding drinking water reservoirs in Utah, the advocates warn that such policy changes will bring another burden to the state’s government.
“The Supreme Court tied EPA’s hands, but not completely,” Lingenfelter said. “The agency still has the authority — and the responsibility — to protect drinking water sources where it can. With Lake Powell less than a third full and the Great Salt Lake disappearing before our eyes, the state will need to step up if the federal government steps back.”

The legislation seeks to ban specific synthetic food dyes and other ingredients from schools. Both sponsors said these proposals mirror efforts in other states and align with a national push by U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to scrutinize processed foods.
“You go to any school, obesity is rampant. Childhood diabetes is rampant. Something clearly we’re doing is not working. The life expectancy is in decline. I’m loving what I’m seeing from RFK with Make America Healthy Again, because, honestly, we do need to make America healthy again,” Butler said in a phone interview Monday.

Kennedy has promoted numerous controversial and unfounded views around public health issues. Kennedy most recently claimed measles could be treated with Vitamin A and is linked to poor diet. Kennedy also petitioned the F.D.A. in 2021 to stop the COVID-19 vaccine rollout because he believed the risks outweighed the benefits, and pointed to ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine as alternative treatments after it was deemed ineffective against the virus. 
Kennedy has also claimed environmental chemicals could affect a child’s sexual orientation or cause “gender confusion;” baselessly connected anti-depressant use to school shootings and has advocated for raw milk consumption despite health risks.

Butler said the timing makes passing his bill challenging this year, the bill’s main purpose currently is “to just have the conversation,” while Ingram said he hopes to pass his bill this year.
HB 580, sponsored by Butler, proposes banning schools participating in federally funded meal programs from serving or selling “ultra-processed food” starting in the 2026-2027 school year. It lists 11 ingredients that would qualify food as ultra-processed, including potassium bromate, titanium dioxide, brominated vegetable oil, Red Dye 40, Yellow Dye 5 and Blue Dye 1. The legislation also directs the Alabama State Department of Education to create a certification process and publicly list compliant schools. The law would not affect private purchases of these foods.
HB 491, sponsored by Ingram, specifically targets seven synthetic food dyes: Red No. 3, Red No. 40, Yellow No. 5, Yellow No. 6, Blue No. 1, Blue No. 2, and Green No. 3. It would prohibit any public K-12 school from selling or serving food containing these dyes, effective Aug. 1, 2025. The bill provides an exception for sales during school fundraisers held off-campus or well after school hours.
California banned Red Dye No. 3 in 2023 after a 2021 report from the California Environmental Protection Agency indicated that federal levels for safe synthetic food dye consumption may not be adequate for children, linking it to concerns over increased Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) diagnoses in youth over the last 20 years.
The federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced in January that it was banning Red Dye No. 3 in food effective in early 2027, and in drugs effective 2028. The health impact of other dyes is still being researched.
Apreill Hartsfield, a policy and data analyst for VOICES for Alabama’s Children, said in an interview Monday that while there is some research that supports claims that some additives can cause adverse health effects, she said more research is needed before implementing policy.
“We have to be careful that we are really making sure that this is backed up by science and not just going off conjecture or anecdotal evidence,” Hartsfield said.
Ingram suggested that “Make America Healthy Again” efforts in Washington have made the conversation possible in Alabama, saying that Kennedy, who was once a Democrat, is what “we need in this country to get down to the truth, instead of following a party telling us we don’t need to do that.”
HB 491 was referred to the House Health Committee, while HB 580 went to the House Education Policy Committee. Both await further action.

PR on behalf of the Alaska Pollock Fishery Alliance)Alaska U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski and other coastal senators have proposed new legislation to exempt seafood processing companies from a cap on the number of international workers they can hire through the temporary H-2B visa program.
The Alaska seafood industry regularly recruits and hires workers from around the world each year, including Mexico, the Philippines and Ukraine. Companies must demonstrate they are unable to fill processing jobs with American workers, and then through the temporary H-2B visa program, they hire thousands of guest workers to meet the needs of Alaska’s labor-intensive, high-volume commercial fishing seasons.
Seafood processing companies must apply each year for a number of H-2B visas in order to hire workers, competing with various nonagricultural sectors, including construction, landscaping and hospitality industries. Currently, Congress has set the cap at 66,000 visas per year, split evenly between the time periods of October through March and April through September. 
Under the proposed legislation, the Save Our Seafood Act, seafood companies would be exempt from caps on these visas, to allow hiring of international workers as needed.
“Alaska’s seafood industry is a delicate chain — and when processors don’t have the workforce to meet demand, the whole industry can fall apart,” Murkowski, R-Alaska, said in a written statement announcing the legislation. 
“Coastal communities, family-owned fishing boats, and Alaskans who work in the industry need to know that they have fully-functioning operations where they can deliver their catch,” she said. “Through this legislation, I’m working to ensure that the industry has a dependable workforce that can process and deliver the highest-quality seafood in the world.” 
Murkowski introduced similar legislation in 2023, but it failed to advance in Congress. Several U.S. senators from Virginia, Maryland and Louisiana signed on as co-sponsors of the legislation to support their fishing industries, including crab and shrimp fleets. 
No other industry in Alaska relies as heavily on out-of-state workers as seafood processing, which increased to over 80% nonresident workers in 2023, according to an analysis by the Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development. The number of Alaska seafood processor jobs has also declined over the last decade, and totaled 8,495 in 2023, the most recently available number. 
Alaska’s seafood industry has also taken a hit in recent years, with a “perfect storm” of declining fish prices, global market competition, and rising costs to bring products to market. 
But despite Alaska’s seafood market woes, the labor needs of the processing industry remain the same, said Brian Gannon, vice president of government relations at LaborMex, a Texas-based company that connects employers with international workers through the H2 visa program. 
“You still need a lot of people to touch individual fish to feed the machines,” he said. 
Seafood processing workers handle fish unloaded from commercial fishing vessels, from sorting, cleaning and cutting, to freezing, canning and packaging. Though processing plants have become more efficient, Gannon noted Alaska seafood processing has always relied on out-of-state labor. 
“It’s consistent with the last 100 years, that hasn’t changed,” he said. “Because in the remote coastal communities there is no workforce that is available, that is ready and not already engaged in the fishing or tendering effort. There’s just a severe lack of human capital in those regions.”
In 2023, Alaska employers applied for 825 guest workers via the H-2B visa program, according to the Alaska Department of Labor, and 554 were for seafood processor roles. Visas are valid for up to three years, and there were an estimated 1,500 international workers each year, Gannon has said. 
Gannon estimates the workforce needed for Alaska is more like 4,000 jobs for the peak summer fishing seasons. “The industry needs to fight for a place within the 66,000 annual visas,” he said. “And the seafood industry needs to compete with landscapers, hotel operations, amusement parks, horse racing stables, grass cutters, lawn mowers, to provide workers or to have access to workers to cut fish.”
Gannon said the proposed legislation to exempt the seafood industry from the visa cap would benefit businesses. “Those employers would not have to worry about, ‘Are we going to have access to visas this year or not?’” he said. “It would be obviously very helpful for the Alaska seafood industry, and the U.S. seafood industry.”
Each year, seafood companies host job fairs abroad, and contract companies such as Gannon’s to assist with recruiting and hiring. Workers go through a hiring process, background check and visa interview, then if they are approved, seafood companies arrange their travel and airfare to work in Alaska’s over 70 onshore plants and 15 at-sea catcher-processor vessels. 
Gannon argued the cap does not reflect the current need for guest workers in nonagricultural industries nationwide. “There’s only so many visas allowed by the federal government for workers to come in, and that’s an arbitrary number that was set 20 or 25 years ago. It’s only in the last six years that that cap has been hit, where the employers are requesting more visas than than are available, and now it’s up to a factor of three or four times,” he said. “I believe most likely that that number should be 200,000 or 300,000 visas to reflect the needs of industry.”
The Trump administration’s escalating crackdown on immigrants and ramped up deportations could present a dilemma for U.S. industries that rely on immigrant labor.
Ganon said while there is worry and concern, there is a precedent for the Trump administration prioritizing food industries. “When COVID hit, the administration quickly allowed for workers from Mexico and other countries that were in jobs and having nexus to food security, and U.S. food production, and they came in,” he said. “So we believe that the literal actions surrounding visas and critical food jobs, or food producing jobs, will remain an actual priority of this administration, regardless of words that come out of Washington, D.C.” 
Gannon noted that interest is still high among international workers, as wages are $16.50 per hour for processing jobs this year, with airfare, housing and meals included and promised overtime.
If the bill is passed in Congress, it would be enacted for next year’s fishing season, in 2026. In the meantime, Gannon says industry advocates hope to garner support for the guest worker program, and the seafood industry. “There’s so many challenges, and but for a few administrative strokes by the federal government, they could do their part to really help employers in Alaska, and this would be a big thing to safeguard the industry,” he said.

(Legislative stream screengrab)In the last few legislative sessions, Nevada has seen reforms to the criminal legal system to ensure certain crimes, such as low-level drug offenses, don’t lead to lengthy sentences. 
State lawmakers should also consider a process to review the sentences of those who have already been incarcerated for a prolonged period of time, says Democratic Assemblymember Erica Roth.
Assembly Bill 91, deemed “second look” legislation, would create an avenue for those incarcerated to have sentences reviewed by the State Board of Parole Commissioners after they’ve served extended periods of time. 
“We as a body and legislators have realized that placing somebody in prison for extreme amounts of time does not necessarily meet the public policy goals, especially when they have been rehabilitated,” Roth, a Reno Democrat, said during hearing on the bill earlier this month.
AB 91 passed out of the Assembly Judiciary Committee April 11 in a party line vote but hasn’t been heard in the Assembly. 
It has until Tuesday to receive a vote in the Assembly. Except for bills declared exempt, legislation must be passed in its house of origin by then to move forward. 
Lawmakers in previous years have sought to address the growing prison population by revising sentencing guidelines and bolstering diversion programs. A 2019 bill that passed with bipartisan support reduced penalties for non-violent theft and drug crimes while increasing access to speciality court programs.
Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo has tried to roll back those provisions, but with only limited success.  He’s proposing more punitive measures this session that include increasing penalties for drug dealers and curtailing early discharge from probation for gun violations.
Lombardo’s efforts to pass tougher actions come as the Nevada Department of Corrections faces a $50 million budget shortfall during a session in which lawmakers are growing more and more apprehensive about the prospects of reduced revenue as a result of a slowing economy. The bill is also likely to face challenges from a Legislature controlled by many of the same Democrats who passed the criminal justice reforms Lombardo has targeted.
Meanwhile, state lawmakers in the interim session voted to pursue a “second look” authorizing sentencing review boards to re-evaluate some sentences.
The legislation’s proponents note it not only addresses the far-reading societal harms inflicted by mass incarceration, it is also a way to reduce the prison population, which could alleviate financial strains. 
There have been 13 states along with the District of Columbia that have passed similar “second look” review policies, according to the Sentencing Project, a nonprofit research and advocacy organization. 
The Nevada legislation also allows the parole board to “grant a second look review” for people convicted of Category A offenses, which include murder and sexual assault, provided the incarcerated person has served 25 years. For category B felonies, such as robbery and assault with a deadly weapon, they must have served at least 15 years.
Lawmakers were told during interim legislative hearings last year that of the slightly less than 11,000 people incarcerated by the Nevada Department of Corrections, 1,888 were sentenced to more than 15 years, and of those, 1,272 people currently incarcerated have already served 15 years. 
Those serving life sentences, sentenced to death or deemed as “a significant and articulable risk to public safety” wouldn’t be eligible for consideration. 
The bill also expands opportunities for parole for people convicted of crimes before turning 25, opportunities currently only extended to those who committed crimes before 18.
“Research shows individuals tend to age out of high crime years as they mature, making extended incarceration less effective in reducing recidivism,” Roth said. “Second look policies also recognize the developmental difference between youth and adults, aligning again with national reforms that provide greater opportunities for youth offenders.”
Opposition from DAs, law enforcement
Republican Assemblyman Ken Gray, of Dayton, questioned why the state needed to provide additional ways for inmates to attempt to reduce their sentences.  
“There’s a lot of different avenues you can go through with your attorney,” he said. “It just seems like we’re just adding more and more ways to challenge what, at the time, is a fair sentence.”
While there are ways for people to challenge the constitutionality of the case or any issue associated with the trial, there aren’t many ways for people to challenge or review the sentence itself, Roth said. 
The bill was supported by public defenders throughout the state. 
“Twenty five years, 15 years, is a long time,” said Angela Knott, a public defender with Washoe County. “AB 91 reflects the belief that people shouldn’t be defined by their worst actions. It gives those who have truly changed, who have grown up and matured, a chance to prove their potential for a positive contribution to society.”
The prison rights advocacy group Return Strong and the Nevada Coalition Against the Death Penalty, though not opposing the bill, said it falls short. 
“Building mechanisms for people to have an opportunity and hope for freedom is a huge motivator for change,” said Nicole Williams, a board member with Return Strong. But the bill, she said, doesn’t go far enough since it excludes people serving life without parole sentences.
“This exclusion fails to account for individuals who were sentenced under outdated policies, extreme sentencing practices, who were targeted by racist law, or those who have demonstrated remarkable rehabilitation while incarcerated,” Williams said. 
District Attorneys and law enforcement agencies opposed the bill. 
Jennifer Noble, a lobbyist with Nevada District Attorneys Association, specifically cited provisions allowing a second look for those convicted of sexual assault and murder. 
She agreed it’s not a “foregone conclusion” that those convicted of such crimes would win release, the process itself could come at the expense of victims. 
“To ensure victims will be heard as required by the constitution … they have to be notified, they have to decide whether to participate, they have to relieve these events and they have to be retraumatized,” Noble said. “Lawful sentences should not be second guessed every two years each time an offender can file a new petition under this bill.”
Roth said there is nothing in the bill that prevents the parole board from considering the person’s crime and the impact of victims. It simply asks the review board to consider  “how old they were, how much they’ve changed, what they’ve accomplished”, she said. 
“At the end of the day, this is not a get out of jail free card,” Roth said. “This is an opportunity for the board, who already makes these reviews on a daily basis, to consider a human being and who they are holistically.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Image-4-21-25-at-3.56-PM-1024x635.jpeg,,,2025-04-22 09:10:12.694907

(Photo courtesy Kyle Roerink)While Lake Mead sits at about one-third full, a bipartisan cohort of Nevada’s state lawmakers think now is the time to sell off public lands to support more Colorado-River-dependent homes and businesses in Southern Nevada. 
On Thursday, Nevada Assemblymembers, the majority of whom are Democrats, overwhelmingly voted to ask President Donald Trump to support selling off tens of thousands of acres outside of Las Vegas as fast as possible. The resolution implores the administration to support  federal legislation from Senator Catherine Cortez Masto, the Southern Nevada Economic Development and Conservation Act. 
The news of the 36-6* vote in the Assembly comes as communities across the West are rising up and opposing efforts to sell off public lands. Coalitions of concerned citizens across party lines have reservations about these efforts to build in areas prone to drought, wildfire, or flooding.
Nevada Democrats do not. 
Traditionally, public lands privatization is an issue championed by sage brush rebels and urbane developers aligned with the GOP. The Keep It Public movement in Nevada has some legitimate supporters but a dark underbelly. Thanks to a special carveout in federal law championed by Nevada Democrats in the late 1990s, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM)  sells off large chunks of public land that facilitates cookie-cutter growth around Las Vegas and praise from politicians. 
Across the West, the private-sector crowd views many places not named Yosemite or Yellowstone, or lacking a Grand or Great adjective, as blank canvases for industry. The industry du jour changes among the decisionmakers. But the lands are always expendable enough. Today, affordable housing is the artifice by which powerful interests believe they can get cheap land for major projects.  
For Las Vegas, there’s less water in the Colorado River System and rapidly warming temperatures posing deep uncertainty. As for the overall quality of life, it depends on your income bracket. And most of the people championing public land sales don’t fret around tax time.   Many politicians are, after all, wealthy. 
For the masses, there are more regressive taxes and higher utility bills across Nevada than decades past. Nevada’s public education system still ranks as one of the worst in the nation. The health care system is near the bottom rung. The  well being of children is worse in Nevada compared to other states. And, of course, housing affordability is a major problem as investors like Black Rock buy up residential blocks that were, you guessed it, built on lands sold off by the BLM. 
 A quarter century of practice can fairly raise the question: Is the public-lands-sale model working? Now is the time for Nevada to tell the others in the West: proceed with caution. Instead, Nevada politicians of all stripes are saying “build, baby, build.” 
The challenge, of course, is finding an effective substitute that meaningfully incentivizes the private sector without further sapping the public in the long run.  In Clark County, there are more than 75,000 acres of infill available. But developers aren’t buying it at meaningful rates to appease political appetites. 
We have opportunity zones, abatements, investment trusts, deductions, and credits that industries benefit from in the West.  Data centers, energy companies, mines, and casinos are a few industries that can attest to the benefits.
Meaningful solutions to the housing problem will require financial tools and reasonable foresight too. And that will require more than milking the sacred cow of legitimized public land sales. We need to put people where there’s existing infrastructure, high-rise opportunities, walkability, and mass-transportation options. There must be water and power infrastructure already in-place. 
But instead, Nevada Democrats just supported putting more folks in the wildland-urban interface so associated with the fringes and foothills of western public lands. These are water-scarce places currently home to desert tortoise and important carbon capturing environments. Many of the very people who attest to giving a damn about urban heat just voted to exacerbate the problem. But don’t try telling them that. There’s money to be made. 
The type of sprawl Nevada Democrats voted to support via AJR10 will warrant expensive new water lines, sewer systems, roads, electricity infrastructure, schools, fire stations, and a host of other intangibles that have costs that span decades. These are not one-time expenses. They are forever expenses. 
Nevada Democrats and Senator Cortez Masto are desperate to expand the existing policy from former Senators Reid and Bryan known because it dispenses proceeds from public land sales. And other states will take notice. Such revenue streams are red meat for states looking to Nevada as an exemplar. 
BLM accounts for  $4 billion in revenue generated from public land sales since the Southern Nevada Public Lands Management Act first took effect. Public education, regional water managers, and the aviation department split less than $700 million since the genesis of the program, according to a federal report released last summer. 
New proposals would have to indeed fill the gaps. But it does make you wonder: Are public land sales the only way to support our community?  Is it sustainable? Are the funds sufficient to cover the new needs that will inevitably occur. 
Nevada Democrats think so. 
But these are folks who also think that, of all things to ask President Trump to do, selling off public lands is the most pressing issue of the day.

“If there is not a reason to wear the mask in a public place, this also deals with universities, then there needs to be an excuse for wearing that mask,” Kiel said to members of the committee. “Instead of just wearing a mask in a place where there may be, like a parade for instance, it is not a masquerade mask, then this would allow law enforcement to request to remove the mask unless they have a medical reason.”

According to the bill, Alabama statute states that people can be charged with loitering if they remain in a public place to panhandle, gamble and to solicit prostitution, and if they remain in a transportation facility for commercial purposes.
They can also be charged with loitering if they wear a mask while in a public space or stay on the grounds of the university or college after they are told to leave by officials with the school and who are not connected with the university in some way.
People can be charged with a violation if they are charged with loitering for the first time, but they may be charged with a Class C misdemeanor, punishable by up to three months in jail and a $500 fine.
The legislation Kiel filed exempts people from getting charged with loitering during times they are wearing a mask while in public, such as a protest or a parade, but they must demonstrate to law enforcement that they have legitimate medical reason.
“If I want to wear my mask for safety procedures, I have to get a doctor’s order just for me to stand out (there), or just for the three of us gathering together,” said Tashina Morris, D-Montgomery.
Republicans on the committee allows law enforcement to identify people who stay in a public place, such as a protest on school grounds for example, in case any incidents occur, and that university and college officials agree with the measure.
“The only thing we are trying to do is when we are having a situation on campuses where we have some folks who are coming to protest,” said Porter Bannister, vice chancellor for state affairs with the University of Alabama system. “They may or may not be students. They are telling our police officers, ‘No, I will not take off my mask’ when we ask them for identification. That is all we are trying to do.”

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)The Alabama House Judiciary Committee Wednesday approved legislation that would criminalize medical examiners who retain the organs of people without family approval.
HB 383, sponsored by Rep. Chris England, D-Tuscaloosa, makes it a Class C felony, punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a $10,000 fine, to take organs without a family’s permission.
This is the second year that England filed legislation pertaining that adds a criminal penalty to the practice of illegally retaining organs in the state without notifying the deceased individual’s next of kin. The House Judiciary Committee approved a similar bill last year, but it stalled in the House chamber.

The legislation is in response to a lawsuit that alleges that the Alabama Department of Corrections and the University of Alabama at Birmingham had an agreement that gave the university permission to retain the organs of those who died in prison. Families of the deceased said they were not informed of the arrangement or that their loved ones’ body parts were taken without their permission..
State code already prohibits medical examiners from retaining organs unless specifically allowed by the Governor’s Office, the Alabama Attorney General’s Office or the district attorney in the case, but the law did not outline any sanctions.
“Basically, the warden was giving UAB permission to keep those organs in violation of a very clear prohibition,” England said to the committee during the meeting.
Montgomery Circuit Court Judge J.R. Gaines, presiding over the lawsuit, denied a motion by the University of Alabama System  and the ADOC earlier this month to dismiss the case.

(Photo by Antonio Cotrim – Pool/Getty Images)After weeks at death’s door and just hours before his demise, Pope Francis on Easter Sunday met with Vice President J.D. Vance of Ohio. Vance hadn’t been scheduled for an official visit with the pontiff, and the meeting called attention to an issue that has divided Catholics and prominent Republicans in Ohio since last summer — immigration.
Francis, 88, died of a stroke early Monday. Last month, he was discharged from the hospital after a severe health crisis that included pneumonia.
He had clashed for years with President Donald Trump over Trump’s treatment of immigrants. In 2016, just after saying mass on the Mexican side of its border with the United States, Francis said that anyone who advocates building walls is “not Christian.” The Vatican later denied that the remark was directed at Trump, but the president has steadfastly advocated for a wall as he repeats false claims about migrants.
While Trump has pushed for a wall, Francis fought just as hard on behalf of migrants from the time he became pope in 2013. During that time, anti-immigrant rhetoric around the world has grown, while the number of forcibly displaced people has more than doubled, to 120 million, USA Today reported Monday.
In a 2015 speech to Congress, the pope implored lawmakers to help those crossing the southern border fleeing persecution and seeking opportunity.
“Is this not what we want for our own children?” Francis asked. “We must not be taken aback by their numbers, but rather view them as persons, seeing their faces and listening to their stories, trying to respond as best we can to their situation. To respond in a way which is always humane, just and fraternal. We need to avoid a common temptation nowadays: to discard whatever proves troublesome. Let us remember the Golden Rule: ‘Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.’”
He reiterated those sentiments in Sunday’s Easter message.
“I would like all of us to hope anew and to revive our trust in others, including those who are different than ourselves, or who come from distant lands, bringing unfamiliar customs, ways of life and ideas! For all of us are children of God!’” it said.
Those words stand in stark contrast to the words and actions of Trump and his administration. He has referred to immigrants as “not human” and “animals” who are “poisoning the blood” of the United States. Trump and his allies have referred to undocumented crossings as an “invasion” even after the rhetoric helped spur a racist mass murder in El Paso in 2019.
Trump now is deporting or trying to deport hundreds of thousands who came legally using the CBP One app, unknown numbers of foreign university students.  He’s also dusted off a law not used since World War II to accuse undocumented migrants of gang affiliations and deport them to a notorious Salvadorean prison. The president has ignored court orders related to the latter deportations, and appears headed for a showdown with the U.S. Supreme Court in the matter.
Trump is also trying to end temporary protected status for hundreds of thousands of immigrants, including many Haitians in Springfield.
As the Caribbean nation has descended into chaos, those in the United States are terrified of being forced to return. But during a debate last summer, Trump repeated the racist lie that Haitians in Springfield were stealing their neighbors pets.
“In Springfield, they are eating the dogs,” he said. “The people that came in, they are eating the cats. They’re eating — they are eating the pets of the people that live there.”
In the ensuing furor, dozens of bomb threats were made against public buildings, including elementary schools.
As a U.S. Senator representing Ohio, those threats jeopardized Vance’s constituents. But he repeated the lies even after his staff knew they were untrue.
The episode divided some Ohio Republicans who also happened to be Catholic.
Vance became one in 2019. Gov. Mike DeWine is a lifelong Catholic who has stayed all executions since taking office and signed a harsh anti-abortion bill into law.
During last year’s firestorm in Springfield, the governor criticized Trump and Vance in the New York Times.
“I am saddened by how they and others continue to repeat claims that lack evidence and disparage the legal migrants living in Springfield,” DeWine wrote. “This rhetoric hurts the city and its people, and it hurts those who have spent their lives there.”
Less than two months later, Trump and Vance won the election. Then in January, the president of Haiti’s transitional presidential council met with Pope Francis at the Vatican and then said Trump’s planned deportations and aid cuts would be calamitous for his country.
In February, Francis wrote a letter to U.S. bishops saying that Trump would create a “major crisis” with the mass deportations he planned. The pope also slammed the interpretation of Catholic theology Vance used to justify them.
Vance had invoked the doctrine “ordo amoris” to claim that one should think of family, then community, then country ahead of the rest of the world.
The pope said that was wrong. He noted that Jesus himself was forced to seek refuge in a foreign land.
“Jesus Christ… did not live apart from the difficult experience of being expelled from his own land because of an imminent risk to his life, and from the experience of having to take refuge in a society and a culture foreign to his own,” Francis said in his letter.
He added that people should consider all as being part of their families and communities.
“The true ordo amoris that must be promoted is that which we discover by meditating constantly on the parable of the ‘Good Samaritan‘ that is, by meditating on the love that builds a fraternity open to all, without exception,” the pope said.
He then sank into a 38-day hospitalization. Then he rallied, defied doctors’ orders and spent a busy Easter Sunday, the most important day on the Christian calendar. And he made room for a brief meeting with Vance as one of his last acts.
Coming a day after the pope’s lieutenants said they talked to Vance about “difficult humanitarian situations, with particular attention to migrants, refugees, and prisoners,” the meeting seemed intended to send a message. “Pope Francis Gave JD Vance a serious lesson just hours before he died,” was the title of a column Hafiz Rashid wrote in The New Republic.
Vance honored the pontiff after his passing in a post on X. But he made no mention of migrants.
“I just learned of the passing of Pope Francis. My heart goes out to the millions of Christians all over the world who loved him,” he said. “I was happy to see him yesterday, though he was obviously very ill. But I’ll always remember him for the… homily he gave in the very early days of COVID. It was really quite beautiful. May God rest his soul.”
For his part, DeWine acknowledged the pope’s relentless advocacy for migrants.
“He was an inspiration to us and to millions around the world,” DeWine said in a written statement. “His genuine love of and devotion to all people — the poor, the unborn, those without a home, those emigrating to build a better life for themselves and their families, those of all faiths, and those with no faith — was evidenced to the world from the day he was selected to serve as Pope until his last public appearance on Easter Sunday.”

For the next 10 weeks, people can travel to and from the scenic San Juan Islands for free as the archipelago tests the waters of county-run, passenger-only ferry service. State money is paying for a twice-daily roundtrip between the three most populous islands and Anacortes using a chartered whale watching tour boat.
The boat trial grew out of frustration with unreliable state ferry service in recent years. But even if the county’s walk-on ferry proves popular, it’s unclear how it could be sustained.
“Until people in San Juan County feel that they can count on the [state] ferries like they did 10 years ago,” San Juan County Council Chair Kari McVeigh said, “this is a big deal.”
McVeigh rode along on the inaugural round trip between Friday Harbor and downtown Anacortes. The foot ferry made intermediate stops at Orcas Landing and Lopez Island in each direction. McVeigh noted the boat was very punctual, as hoped for.
Ridership was light during the opening weekend of service due to the short-notice startup and limited pre-launch publicity. Captain Brian Goodremont steered the 55-foot tour boat Sea Lion across sun-splashed seas at about the same speed as the state ferries – 17 knots – on an unusually warm Good Friday to inaugurate the service.

“I think it is mostly going to be islanders that use this service,” said Goodremont, who owns San Juan Safaris, the contracted passenger-only ferry operator. “As we get closer to peak season for visitors – once school is out – I can see visitors using it as an alternative.”
As part of the same state-funded pilot project, San Juan County also contracted with a different local tour company for emergency interisland water taxi service, which will sail only when the state interisland ferry is expected to be out of service for more than four hours. That standby water taxi contract similarly expires on June 30.
In recent weeks, state ferry system leaders have told the public and their overseers in the state Legislature that the car ferries have turned the corner on reliability. Washington State Ferries chief Steve Nevey and his deputy told a state Senate panel last month that crewing is back to pre-pandemic levels and cancellations significantly reduced.
“We’re clearly going in the right direction,” deputy John Vezina testified. “We’re clearing the maintenance backlog. We are on the path to building new boats. But it’s been tough for our customers and we are aware of that.”
Riding the temporary passenger-only service
The San Juans to Anacortes passenger-only ferry pilot project was designed with the needs of ferry-dependent islanders at the top of mind, but the service should be appealing to visitors from the mainland too. The foot ferry terminates in downtown Anacortes at the Cap Sante Marina where islanders can walk to a wide variety of businesses, restaurants and medical/dental clinics. Daytrippers headed to the San Juans can park at the marina for free, unlike at the state ferry Anacortes terminal.
The Sea Lion vessel is certified for 49 passengers, but Goodremont said it will be limited to 35 riders for the time being so that everyone has access to the heated, indoor seating if desired.
Orcas Island resident Sooz Stahl was pleased to hear about the new county-run ferry as she waited in the sun for the state ferry to take her to her job running the post office on neighboring Shaw Island.
“I think it’s fantastic,” Stahl said. “They should support ways and plans for people to get here and to visit the islands without a car.”
Stahl said she was unsure whether she would use the walk-on ferry during its 10-week tryout. The county-provided service skips Shaw Island because the isle lacks a public dock suitable for the passenger-only ferry.
A potential drawback of the foot ferry for visitors is that there is no public transit or Uber/Lyft on the islands. Friday Harbor is quite walkable, but Orcas Landing and the Lopez dropoff at Odlin County Park are a good distance from the main attractions of their respective islands.
Traditional taxis are available on San Juan and Orcas islands, though. Bikes can be brought on board the passenger boat with prior reservation.
For travelers going between Friday Harbor and the mainland, the walk-on ferry takes longer than Washington State Ferries because of the intermediate stops.
In years past, Bellingham was proposed as the mainland terminus for a San Juan Islands passenger-only ferry run. But San Juan County officials only considered Anacortes as the mainland landing this time around because the point of the state funding was to backstop the state ferry service.
The temporary passenger-only ferry is fare-free because the state is footing the bill. Former Gov. Jay Inslee awarded the county $1.5 million in discretionary emergency relief funds last September after hearing a litany of complaints from islanders about missed appointments, stranded schoolchildren and other disruptions caused by cancelled state ferry sailings.
Just recently, the state Department of Commerce denied the county’s request to spend leftover grant funds after the state’s fiscal year ends on June 30 so this walk-on ferry service could be extended into peak tourist season in July.
What could the future bring for San Juan Islands foot ferry service?
Passengers who use the free foot ferry will be surveyed to provide the county with data that it can then use to make the case for a permanent service, if that seems justified.
An ongoing passenger-only run would require a big subsidy if the fares were to be kept reasonable. McVeigh said San Juan County does not currently have the deep pockets to shoulder those operating costs.
San Juan Safaris’ contract to operate the grant-funded temporary foot ferry costs $7,647.50 per day, which adds up quickly to more than half a million dollars for the ten-and-a-half week duration of the pilot project.
Earlier this year at the Legislature, San Juan County council members testified in support of a bill dubbed the Mosquito Fleet Act to launch new, locally operated walk-on ferry routes across Puget Sound. But that proposal was stripped of funding last month and then died in the state Senate at the beginning of April.

Senate Transportation Committee Chair Marko Liias, D-Edmonds, said the state government is not in a position to subsidize new ferry services in the near to medium term.
“The (2025-27) budget is really focused on making sure that our mainstay Washington State Ferries service is healthy, strong and sustainable,” Liias said in late March.  “We want to make sure that the service we’re providing is top notch again and we’re investing to get there. Passenger service in the future makes sense, but for now we’re focused on the core of WSF service.”
Absent further state support, another option would be federal grant funding. But McVeigh observed the chances of getting that look grim given the current budget-slashing tenor in the nation’s capital.
A third option would be to turn to local voters for approval to create a county transit district with taxing authority, as Kitsap County did previously. However, McVeigh said it is very premature to go down that path.
“We’re not there yet,” McVeigh said. “This is really just proof-of-concept, this pilot. We want to look at the data. We want to see how our constituents feel about this.”
For now, the council chair from Friday Harbor said people should try out the limited-term passenger service and let the county know what they think. It’s use it or lose it time, to paraphrase her.
“It’s a free ferry ride for now,” McVeigh said. “Come, come, come.”

(Courtesy of Sumuri LLC)Steve Whalen loves his home state of Delaware and he’s proud to manufacture computers there that police officers use to “catch bad guys.” He said tariffs on imports from China and other countries, along with sharp cuts to government spending and the winding down of a program for small manufacturers, will make it harder for him to do that.
“We got into business to keep costs low for the ‘good guys,’ but tariffs or anything else that raises prices keeps us from doing that,” said Whalen, co-founder of Sumuri LLC in Magnolia, Delaware, which makes computer workstations for police and government investigations. Whalen has to buy materials overseas, often from China, and he said the tariffs could force him to triple his price on some workstations to $12,000.
Tariffs are the main tool President Donald Trump is wielding to try to boost manufacturing in the United States, calling the achievement of that goal “an economic and national security priority.” But the higher levies have led to retaliation and suspended shipments, and Whalen said they are just one of several Trump administration actions squeezing his small manufacturing business.
The wave of federal spending cuts, which has affected grants to state and local governments, could make his customers put off purchases. And the administration has moved to cut off funding for a $175 million state-based program that provides expert advice to smaller factories like his.
The Delaware version of that program, the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, helped Sumuri fit expanded product lines into the limited space in its small-town factory.
“We were really having a tough time trying to figure out how to utilize our space efficiently,” Whalen said. “They came here and helped us organize and optimize, and it made a huge difference.”
On April 1, the Trump administration cut off funding for 10 such manufacturing programs that were up for renewal in Delaware, Hawaii, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, and Wyoming. Other state MEP programs will expire over the next year.
The administration gave a reprieve to those 10 states until the end of the fiscal year after objections from Democrats in the U.S. House and Senate. The National Institute of Standards and Technology, which manages the program, extended funding for the 10 states “after further review and consideration” and will “continue to evaluate plans for the program,” said agency spokesperson Chad Boutin.
The program has come under fire from Republicans since the George W. Bush administration first tried to end it in 2009, and again during the first Trump administration, but Congress has continued to fund it. The conservative Heritage Foundation said in a 2023 book that MEP’s functions “would be more properly carried out by the private sector.”
 ‘Dots don’t quite connect’

Buckley Brinkman, executive director of the Wisconsin Center for Manufacturing and Productivity, which works with his state’s MEP program, said it didn’t make much sense for the administration to shutter the program as it seeks to boost the number of U.S. manufacturing jobs.
“It’s one of those things where the dots don’t quite connect,” Brinkman said. “I mean, jeez, here’s a part of government that doesn’t cost a whole lot, in the grand scheme of things — less than $200 million a year — that’s returning 10-to-1 to the national treasury, working on a priority for the president.”
A 2024 Upjohn report found an even higher return: 17-to-1 on $175 million in the 2023 fiscal year, creating $3 billion in new federal tax revenue.

In Wisconsin, which has lost more than 138,000 manufacturing jobs since 2000, some parts makers report that business is booming as manufacturers seek to avoid tariffs by finding U.S. alternatives to Chinese manufacturers, Brinkman said. But more broadly, he doubts that the tariffs will spark a manufacturing boom in the state.
“Do we want all this manufacturing back? Do we have the will to get it back? The answer to both those questions is ‘no,’” Brinkman said. “Even without the tariffs we don’t really want Americans doing a lot of those jobs that are in Chinese factories right now.”













I mean, jeez, here’s a part of government that doesn't cost a whole lot, in the grand scheme of things … that's returning 10-to-1 to the national treasury.


– Buckley Brinkman, director of Wisconsin Center for Manufacturing and Productivity





In Delaware, the MEP helped Sumuri manage its expansion, but unpredictable tariffs and budgets are now a bigger danger, said Jason Roslewicz, Sumuri’s vice president for business development. He’s had to devote two employees to monitoring supply lines, tariff news, and competitor pricing to stay afloat.
“We went from putting things together in a basement to a 19,000-square-foot facility, doing exactly what we’re supposed to do here in the U.S., and it’s all in danger of coming apart because of this problem,” Roslewicz said.
Other small manufacturers express similar concerns. TJ Semanchin, who owns Wonderstate Coffee in Madison, Wisconsin, said his business roasting and distributing coffee is in crisis because of the tariffs.
Wonderstate’s costs have almost doubled between tariffs on imported coffee and packaging materials from China, plus a cyclical rise in coffee prices. “I’m borrowing money to pay for this and at some point we’ll have to raise prices. We’ll have no choice,” Semanchin said.

But many Republican state officials, and even some Democrats, have backed Trump’s tariff push, including Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who credited the Trump administration with “reshoring manufacturing and restoring this middle class which has been eviscerated over the last 20 years.”
“There’s dislocation in the short term, there’s long-term opportunity,” Youngkin said in an April 15 interview on CNBC. He said his state is hearing more interest from manufacturers looking to build or expand local factories since Trump took office. For instance, Delta Star recently announced a plan to add 300 jobs building power transformers in Lynchburg.
“The president has been clear that there will be some level of tariffs, and folks are coming, and that’s good for Virginia,” Youngkin said in the CNBC interview.
Virginia’s MEP program, called Genedge, claims successes in streamlining production and quality control for local factory products including TreeDiaper, an automated tree watering device made in Ashland, and for advising EDM, a Lynchburg plastic product assembler that needed more efficient production to keep overseas competition at bay. But Virginia’s MEP is one of the state programs slated to expire in the next year.
 Long-term trend

The slide in U.S. manufacturing jobs has continued on and off since 1979, and many experts say tariffs will not bring them back. Despite a modest bounce back under the Biden administration, the number of manufacturing jobs has declined from nearly 20 million in 1979 to less than 13 million today, even as the total U.S. workforce has grown from 89 million to 159 million during that period.
Manufacturing faces labor shortages, with many factories operating below capacity because they can’t find enough workers, according to Jason Miller, a professor of supply chain management at Michigan State University.
That doesn’t bode well for a mass reshoring of factories from China and other countries, but Miller doesn’t expect that to happen anyway.
“Firms are not planning on reshoring much of the work that was offshored 20 to 25 years ago,” Miller said. “I’m not concerned about having enough workers for manufacturing jobs that would be reshored because this isn’t going to happen.”
In a 2024 survey by the libertarian Cato Institute, 80% of Americans said America would be better off if more people worked in manufacturing, but only 25% said they personally would be better off working in a factory. The Chinese government has poked fun at the idea with memes of American workers struggling to make Nike sneakers with sewing machines.
Joseph McCartin, a labor historian at Georgetown University, said the idea of a manufacturing rebirth is a “mirage being conjured to attract the support of workers who have been underpaid in an increasingly unequal economy for the last 40 years, and are desperate for some hope of renewed upward mobility.”
Manufacturing “isn’t the magic wand to make that happen,” McCartin said.
“What we need is to raise workers’ wages and make the economy less prone to producing inequality,” McCartin said. “That mission is not at all what Trump is about. He is dealing in stale nostalgia.”

Sen. Ryan Mishler, the chief budget architect for Senate Republicans, squashed any requests for increased funding prior to public input, saying the grim Wednesday budget forecast that projected $2 billion less in spending “speaks for itself.”
“We have some tough decisions to make,” said the Mishawaka Republican. “Please don’t ask for more because the question at this point will be, ‘Who do you want us to take it from?’”
Aside from that early remark, Republicans largely took a back seat for the rest of the hour-long meeting — neither offering comment nor asking many questions.

Sen. Fady Qaddoura, D-Indianapolis, condemned the GOP members for not commenting on private negotiations during Monday’s meeting. As both chambers have a Republican supermajority, Democrats are often excluded from such discussions. 
“I was extremely disappointed today that would have been — or should have been — a public process to discuss the budget publicly and the solutions … did not occur. We are a public institution serving 6.9 million Hoosiers across the state and the budget process should have been much more transparent,” said Qaddoura. 
Rep. Greg Porter, also a Democrat from Indianapolis, likened it to being given a seat at the “kids table.”
“We know they had a lot of conversations this past weekend. So we have had conversations also and we have brought a solution to our situation,” Porter said, pointing to increases on so-called sin taxes and reducing school choice voucher spending.
In a comment to reporters, Rep. Jeff Thompson — who leads budget negotiations for House Republicans — said that Monday’s meeting was the last opportunity for public comment.
 To raise or to cut Indiana’s taxes?

A smattering of public advocates took the opportunity to make a last-minute appeal before lawmakers, including 16-year-old central Indiana Girl Scout Vera McConnell. 
McConnell, who has appeared before budget writers before during this session, made repealing the state sales tax on menstrual products — also known as the Pink Tax — the goal of her Gold Award, one of Girls Scouts’ highest honors. 
“Women and girls have paid the pink tax, through both good and bad economic times, and it’s no longer a fiscal issue. Rather, it’s a fairness issue,” McConnell said Monday. “We should not profit from the necessary bodily functions of people. The time is now.”










We have some tough decisions to make.


– Sen. Ryan Mishler, R-Mishawaka


The average woman will spend roughly $18,000 over her lifetime on feminine hygiene products like pads and tampons — which are taxed as luxuries and not as a medical necessity. These dollars contribute $5.6 million in sales taxes to state coffers, or 0.01% of the budget. 
House Republicans struck the tax in their version of the budget but Senate Republicans reversed course — much to the chagrin of their Democratic counterparts, who tried to amend it back into the budget last week but failed on a largely party-line vote. 
McConnell’s effort will have a difficult time getting over the finish line following last week’s budget forecast. Other testimony used that news to try to push forward a long-sought tax increase on cigarettes. 
According to the American Lung Association, only a dozen states tax cigarettes at a lower rate than Indiana, which has the lowest tax of its surrounding states at $0.995 per pack. That is nearly half the national rate of $1.93. 
Tiffany Nichols, the Indiana director of advocacy for the American Lung Association, pushed for a $2 increase, which could bring in an estimated $800 million in tax revenue. However, that number doesn’t include smokeless tobacco products, cigars or vapes — all of which are taxed at a lower rate.

Nichols urged lawmakers to bring taxes for those in line with cigarette cartons.
“We know from decades of research that increasing tobacco taxes is one of the most effective ways to reduce use,” said Nichols. “We must close this loophole. Creating barriers across all tobacco products ensures a consistent public health message: all tobacco products are harmful.”
Increasing such a tax would, ideally, only generate a temporary bump in revenues as tobacco use goes down. However, reducing Hoosier tobacco use would lower the state’s overall health costs — especially for Medicaid, which is the fastest-growing line item. 
The House has passed such an increase a handful of times but never gotten the Senate onboard. Previously, legislative leaders said all options are on the table with the exception of marijuana legalization and an expansion of gaming taxes. 
Raising so-called sin taxes — which can include alcohol in addition to cigarettes and gaming — was at the heart of Democrat suggestions for addressing the $2 billion budget shortfall. 
“We don’t seem to want to tax sin in the way we used to,” lamented Rep. Ed DeLaney, D-Indianapolis.

But the health center’s administrator, Zachary Moser, said a recent decision to freeze family planning funds has the center fearful it won’t be able to continue covering family planning services for its rural southeastern Missouri population.
In late March, the Trump administration froze about $27.5 million in Title X funding to a number of states, including several million dollars to Missouri that are distributed by Missouri Family Health Council. 
The Title X program was created more than half a century ago as a funding stream to support access to family planning options, including contraceptives, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections and cancer screenings related to reproductive health.

While some have speculated the administration was trying to target abortion providers, only seven of the 52 recipients of Title X grants through the Missouri Family Health Council are Planned Parenthood clinics. A breakdown of how funding is distributed between clinics was not made available.
The majority of the recipients are health centers like Moser’s. Moser said in the short-term, Dent County has redirected some general revenues toward family planning services and continues to offer them to patients for free.
“Will we be able to do that indefinitely?” he asked. “No.”
For example, instead of Title X funding covering the cost of an IUD — a contraceptive device that is inserted into the uterus to prevent pregnancy — the patient would instead have to foot the bill, choose a less-effective but more affordable or go without. 
Moser said some of the longer-lasting contraceptive devices can cost upwards of $1,000 out of pocket, a price that isn’t feasible for most of the people the center serves. 
Limiting or eliminating family planning services can impact entire communities and public health. 
Michelle Trupiano, executive director of the Missouri Family Health Council, said if the freeze continues, she anticipates immediate health consequences like increased unintended pregnancies, later-stage cancer diagnoses, more overall disease and worse maternal health outcomes. 
Missouri Family Health Council has been leading the state’s Title X planning program for nearly 45 years. Their network of 52 clinics includes health departments, community action agencies, federally-qualified health centers and hospital-based clinics. They also work with family planning clinics, including seven Planned Parenthood locations.
“The Trump administration and Elon Musk are using Title X to push their own political agenda and impose their personal beliefs on everyone at the expense of people who need critical access to care,” Emily Wales, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, said in a statement. ” …. If blocking health care for low-income patients is what the Trump administration means by ‘making America great again,’ then we want no part of it. It’s cruel, it’s calculated, and it won’t stop us from fighting for our patients.” 
Trupiano said she’s not sure why Missouri was targeted while other states with Planned Parenthood clinics were left untouched. But the letter Trupiano received announcing the freeze cited compliance concerns around diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, or DEI. She said the grant they were awarded includes “access, quality and equity” among its priorities. 
Through Title X funding, Missouri clinics served nearly 34,800 patients in 2024. Of those, 83% were female, 75% were under the age of 34 and 45% were uninsured.
Last year, 58% of the patients served were white and 30% were Black. 
“We know the devastating impact and consequences that will result if this is not swiftly resolved,” Trupiano said.
The funding to Missouri Family Health Council was paused the day before year four of a five-year grant cycle began on April 1. 
The Dent County Health Center applied for Title X funding after hiring a full-time nurse practitioner in 2022. Not only does the grant help them increase health care access for patients, but Moser said it also backs up an ongoing effort to inform more young people on pregnancy prevention. 
In his corner of southeast Missouri there’s still a lot of stigma around premarital sex, Moser said, making it difficult to educate teenagers on pregnancy-prevention. Among those teens who do seek out contraceptive access at the health center, he said many don’t want to go through their parent’s insurance policy because they want to keep their choices private. 
“We won’t have any way to serve those patients,” Moser said. “It’s going to limit access for sure, which is going to drive up the teen pregnancy rate, drive up unwanted pregnancies and have other unintended consequences.”
Missouri’s teen pregnancy birth rate has steadily declined over the past several years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, though it still remains among the highest in the country.
Stephanie Kraft Sheley, director of Right By You, a Missouri-based nonprofit that in part advocates for contraceptive access, said some of the most common calls to the organization’s hotline revolve around navigating birth control access.
She said a continued freeze could have “catastrophic” effects, potentially shuttering programs or clinics whose efforts help reduce unintended pregnancies.
If the freeze continues, Kraft Sheley said, that likely means navigating fewer people to pregnancy-prevention options and increasingly directing them to abortion options. While abortion is now legal in Missouri, access is still difficult for many people, as only three Planned Parenthood clinics have resumed procedural abortions and medication abortions remain unavailable.
Missouri abortion ban clears House, heads to Senate despite concerns from top Republican

Trupiano has spent the past few weeks helping clinics like Moser’s navigate the abrupt funding change as they work to determine how to stretch resources in order to continue providing free family planning services to patients. 
“They already were working in the leanest possible way to provide this critical care,” she said. “These cuts are very devastating, and for a lot of the health departments and other safety net clinics, this isn’t the only infrastructure cut that they are facing.” 
That rings true in Dent County, where Moser said Title X is one of a handful of programs under threat right now. He remains particularly concerned about continued federal funding for the county’s lead testing and vaccine programs, both of which rely entirely on grant funding.
Trupiano and others have been drawing attention to Missouri’s public health safety net for years, raising concerns that clinics and providers are stretched beyond capacity. Funding freezes such as this only cause longer wait times and more people who ultimately go without timely care as the burden shifts off one clinic and onto another, she said. 
For example, if a clinic relying on Title X funding were ultimately to close, those patients would be forced to find another provider. In many places, new patient wait lists are already months long. For those without reliable access to transportation, getting to a different clinic further away might be too much of a burden to continue care.
While the greatest harm will be inflicted on the most vulnerable Missourians, Trupiano said, “the impact is going to be borne by everybody.”

Taylor, which asks if Montgomery County parents have a religious right to opt children out of classes that use LGBTQ+ friendly books. But advocates say the case has national implications.","The U.S. Supreme Court. (File photo by Danielle E. Gaines/Maryland Matters)When the Supreme Court hears arguments Tuesday in Mahmoud v. Taylor, it will be considering whether Montgomery County parents have a right, on religious grounds, to opt their children out of classes in county schools that use LGBTQ+ friendly books.
But to the scores of religious, legal and educational groups across the country who have filed friend-of-the-court briefs, it’s a case with national implications.
“Whatever rule the Court promulgates in this case will apply far beyond the circumstances of this dispute,” says a 30-page brief filed on behalf of the School Superintendents Association, Consortium of State School Boards Associations, Council of the Great City Schools and National School Attorneys Association. That brief does not support either side in the dispute, but asks the justices to tread carefully.
Most of the other briefs, however, are decidedly on one side or the other: With the parents who argue that the county policy infringes on their right to raise their children according to their religion, or with the school board that says the books are part of an inclusive curriculum and are not coercive or targeting any religion.
The case began at the start of the 2022-23 school year, when the county unveiled a list of “LGBTQ+-inclusive texts for use in the classroom,” including books for grades as low as kindergarten and pre-K. After initially saying that parents could opt their children out of lessons that included those and other books, the school board reversed course in March 2023 and said opt-outs would not be allowed beginning in the 2023-24 school year.
Parents are allowed to opt their children out of parts of sex education classes, but not other parts of the curriculum, like language arts.
The parents sued the school board in May 2023, saying the inability to opt their children out of the classes infringes on their First Amendment freedom of religion rights. They also wanted the schools to notify them when lessons involving the books were coming up, and to plan alternative lessons for their children.
But school officials claim the books were not part of “explicit instruction on gender identity and sexual orientation in elementary school, and that no student or adult is asked to change how they feel about these issues.”
In its December filing that urged the Supreme Court to reject the case, the county said, “MCPS (Montgomery County Public Schools) believes that representation in the curriculum creates and normalizes a fully inclusive environment for all students and supports a student’s ability to empathize, connect, and collaborate with diverse peers and encourages respect for all.” It went on to say “teachers are not permitted to use the storybooks to enforce a particular viewpoint.”
Lower courts have rejected the parents request for a preliminary injunction, with a divided panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that the county policy did not have the coercion required to make it a burden on religious exercise.
In their petition to the Supreme Court, the parents cited a few of the elementary-aged books the school board includes as “LGBTQ-inclusive” and the guidance for teachers that went with each:

“Born Ready,” a story about Penelope, a student who identifies as a boy. “Teachers are told to instruct students that, at birth, doctors guess about our gender, but we know ourselves best”;
“Love, Violet,” a story about two young girls and their same-sex playground romance. “Teachers are encouraged to have a think-aloud moment to ask students how it feels when they don’t just like but like like someone”; and
“Intersection Allies,” a picture book for children to ponder what it means to be “transgender” or “non-binary” and asks, “what pronouns fit you?”

Mark Graber, a regents professor at the University of Maryland Francis King Carey Law School in Baltimore, said in an interview Monday that a Supreme Court decision in favor of the petitioners, or parents, would create “an administrative nightmare.”
“There are a lot of religions out there. Schools have to figure out what violates religion, what parents they have to contact,” he said.
Graber said the court will have to determine whether county teaches the topics “as secular” subjects.
“The parent has the right to go in and say, ‘What are you teaching?’ Public schools can teach one plus one equals two, regardless of what your religion says about the simpleness of mathematics,” he said. “They can teach about different forms of couples, regardless of what religion says about the simpleness of different kinds of relationships.
“The crucial thing is public schools must teach it as secular,” he said. “They may not praise or condemn any religion for holding opinions consistent with the public schools, or inconsistent.”
Even though parents have lost in lower courts on their preliminary injunction request, Graber said it makes senses for them to press the case with the current Supreme Court, given the justices’ openness to free exercise claims.
“The court has been extraordinarily sympathetic to free exercise claims brought by evangelical Christians,” he said. “They think they got the most sympathetic court they’ve ever had, so why not [petition the court]?”
‘Case is very important’
The fact the high court will be hearing the case based only “on an undeveloped and untested, preliminary injunction record,” and not hearings on the full merits of case in lower courts, was concerning to the school groups that filed the brief in support of neither side of the case.
“There are great risks presented by asking the Court to potentially adopt new rules for evaluating Free Exercise claims or constitutionalizing notice and opt out requirements,” said the brief from the School Superintendents Association, Consortium of State School Boards Associations, Council of the Great City Schools and National School Attorneys Association.
One other brief that supports neither side in the dispute came from the California Parents for the Equalization of Educational Materials (CAPEEM), a nonprofit and nonpartisan organization that focuses on “eradicating the disparaging treatment of Hinduism” in that state’s public schools.
The organization’s brief proposes the court adopt a four-part test to determine if school policies violate free exercise rights: Does the curriculum material negate religious beliefs or practices?; does the curriculum material itself or the process through which it was adopted reflect targeted hostility toward religion or a particular religion?; does the material or the adoption process lack neutrality toward a particular religion?; and is the curriculum material coercive?
“The outcome of this case is going to clearly affect my client’s rights, but whatever test the court comes up with … we have ideas in what would make sense in litigating the case,” Glenn Katon, counsel representing CAPEEM, said in an interview Monday.
“We’re not there to help either party. We’re there to try and get the court to adopt the test that makes sense, that will help Hindus get treated fairly in California,” he said. “This case is very important for schools in California [and] even across the country.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/US-Supreme-Court-1-1024x767.jpg,,,2025-04-22 07:08:39.935315

The bill would eliminate all state taxes on capital gains, or profits from selling investments such as corporate stock, real estate, antiques and artwork. No state with an income tax fully exempts capital gains, in no small part because doing so would let wealthy people collect tax-free passive income while continuing to tax middle class workers and people whose savings are in retirement accounts.
Nearly two-thirds of capital gains that Missourians report on their federal tax forms flows to households with incomes over a half-million dollars per year.
There are ample grounds for debating this proposal but one that has come to the forefront is how much it will carve from the state’s budget. The state’s Department of Revenue estimated the cost at $111 million per year. Nobody doubts that the department has access to good data. But tax analysis is hard, and it’s not unusual for people working with good data to reach the wrong result. Every piece of publicly available data I’ve unearthed points to that being the case here.
While Missouri is less transparent than most states in how it publishes basic tax statistics, IRS data on Missourians’ federal tax filings, and the real-world experience of states with similar policies show that Missouri will confront a revenue hit many times larger than the department predicts.
First, consider the IRS data. In 2022, Missourians reported more than $13.3 billion in capital gains on their federal tax forms. If those gains were taxed at the state’s top rate of 4.7%, this would mean that a capital gains exemption would cost $600 million or more — a far cry from $111 million.
To be fair, this calculation is a simplification of reality, as department staff pointed out to The Independent when asked earlier this month.
Social Security income is fully exempt from Missouri tax, for example, and retirees who worked in the public sector can exclude their pensions as well. These policies may push some capital gains recipients into lower tax brackets and reduce the cost of a new exemption.
But the IRS data are clear that most gains flow to Missourians with exceptionally high incomes who are surely facing the state’s top marginal tax rate. Even if the average tax rate on capital gains was somehow half the top rate, the exemption would still cost almost three times the department’s estimate.
Tellingly, this simplified math works well in other states that have lowered taxes on capital gains. In Wisconsin, South Carolina, and Montana, official estimates for capital gains provisions all come within 30% of the estimate arrived at by applying the top rate to the IRS capital gains data. Only in Missouri does the Department of Revenue estimate so widely diverge from IRS data.
It is also possible to evaluate the department’s estimate another way. The department suggests that individual income tax revenue will decline by just 1.2% if capital gains are exempted.
But in Wisconsin, South Carolina and Montana, capital gains tax preferences that are about half as generous as the Missouri proposal are reducing income tax revenue by 3 to 4.9% per year. When we adjust the data from these states to reflect a Missouri-sized exemption, the result is a revenue loss between 5.2 and 8.5% of current revenues — four to seven times larger than the department predicts.
Although there are many possible explanations for the low estimate, public statements by the department offer two possible clues.
First, the department notes that some capital gains Missourians report on their federal forms may be taxed by other states. While true, this is not a compelling explanation because the effect cuts both ways. Missouri residents sometimes pay tax on capital gains to other states, and nonresidents sometimes pay tax on capital gains to Missouri. These two things typically come close to canceling out.
Some press reports suggest the department thinks nonresidents would be ineligible for the exemption. This is not apparent in the bill language and, even if it was, it would not matter because that design would be struck down in court as a violation of the U.S. Constitution’s interstate commerce clause.
If the department failed to consider the impact on nonresidents, that could lead to an understated revenue estimate. In Montana, for example, nonresidents receive one in every six dollars of that state’s capital gains tax preference.
Second, the department notes that many high-income people purchase tax credits that offset some or all of their tax liability. That is also true but it doesn’t explain why the estimate is so low and, in fact, it presents exactly the kind of wrinkle that could cause someone working with the right data to reach the wrong conclusion.
Imagine a high-income investor who purchases transferable credits to reduce or eliminate their Missouri tax liability. If capital gains become tax-exempt, they will have less tax liability and will purchase fewer credits. A recalculation of this person’s tax bill would show little change in state revenue because the taxpayer will simply switch from claiming one tax break (transferable credits) to claiming a different one instead (the new capital gains exemption).
But it’s essential to acknowledge that those credits will be transferred elsewhere. If the department did not hold transferable credits constant in its analysis, it would reach an incorrect answer.
While it’s not possible to pinpoint with certainty what may have gone wrong with the department’s analysis, every publicly available datapoint suggests that the true cost of this tax cut for high-income investors will be many times larger than estimated.
In other words, exempting capital gains would take an extra half-billion dollar bite out of the state budget, beyond what lawmakers have been told.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/dollar-wave.jpg,,,2025-04-22 07:08:39.935315

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)A Republican senator detailed changes to a contentious sex education bill on Monday, including deletion of a proposed requirement for K-12 schools to teach about consent.
The last-minute edits to Senate Bill 442 were announced during a 13-minute conference committee meeting. Public testimony was allowed but none was provided.
The conference committee proposal had not been signed and officially approved as of Monday evening, however, meaning the bill’s provisions could still change.
Earlier versions of the legislation required any materials used to teach “human sexuality” for grades 4-12 be approved by a school board and include instruction on “the importance of consent to sexual activity.”
The latest proposed draft retained a mandate for districts to publish a list of materials used in connection with instruction on human sexuality. Bill author Sen. Gary Byrne, R-Byrneville, said tweaks were also made to requirements surrounding permission forms that must be sent to parents about such instruction.
Expected to stay in the bill, too, are requirements for elementary school students to watch a three-minute ultrasound video of fetal development if they participate in human sexuality coursework.
Byrne said he preferred to let school boards decide if local curricula include topics on consent.
“(Teaching about consent) can still happen. We’re just not going to require that in this bill,” he said. “This is a sensitive subject for many. I believe it may be different thoughts in different communities, and … this leaves, for the most part, local control on making those decisions.”
Brief discussion among lawmakers drew continued concerns from House and Senate Democrats on the committee.
“I don’t understand how we could possibly not agree to teach that as part of human sexuality,” said Rep. Tonya Pfaff, D-Terre Haute. “For consent, it protects both boy and girl — man and woman. We are talking about teenagers that sometimes don’t learn that they can say no.”
The introduction of sex education usually starts in the fourth grade, according to state guidelines. But Indiana does not require the course in schools. Instead, it only mandates that schools teach lessons on HIV and AIDS. Schools that do teach sex education are expected to focus on abstinence.
Critics of the bill have argued that school boards already have the authority to review and approve curricular materials. State law further requires school corporations to make instructional materials available to parents so that they can consent to instruction on human sexuality.

This is a portion of Montana Highway 253 between Terry and Circle, Montana (Photo by Darrell Ehrlick for the Daily Montanan). There has been a lot of focus on mental health issues in Montana during the past few years, specifically aimed toward marginalized groups like the LGTBQ community and indigenous peoples. And for good reason. But one statistic that might surprise people is that a high percentage of the suicides in Montana occur in the farming and ranching community, among middle-aged men. 
Courtney Kibblewhite grew up in Huntley, where her grandparents owned a ranch, but her father also worked at the Northern Ag Network, the radio station founded by former Sen. Conrad Burns in 1975. Courtney’s father started working there just out of college, and he eventually bought the business, which is now family run. Courtney is now the vice president of the corporation. But her family was always involved in the ranch, and it is still in the family, now run by Courtney’s brother, so she knows the culture well. And it is because of that connection, as well as her position at the radio station, that Courtney decided to find a way to bring more focus to the mental health issues that face the agricultural community in Montana. 
Courtney’s journey back to Montana and the radio station was a circuitous one that included going to college at Northwestern University in Chicago, followed by a couple of years in Uganda, and a year studying yoga in India. She met her husband Jonny, who is Welsh, in Thailand. But it was a difficult year even before these adventures that first inspired her to leave Montana, when she and her parents decided that a change of scenery might be beneficial. Some of Courtney’s cousins, who lived on a ranch near Birney, had attended a boarding school in Maryland and liked it there, so Courtney packed her bags and moved to Maryland, which turned out to be a very good experience.
“It wasn’t as if they provided me with any mental health resources, but I think it was just good for me to get out of my own head for a while. There were girls from all over the world at this school, so it was a great atmosphere,” she said.
It was that early awareness of mental health issues that inspired Courtney’s interest in the topic, which has led to the creation of Beyond the Weather, a program designed to provide help for farmers and ranchers who are dealing with depression or anxiety, or any other number of mental health issues. 
It has long been an established fact that Montana ranks in the top five in suicide, every year, and like so many families in Montana, Courtney’s family has a story about that, where one of her relatives was missing for several days, and neighbors went to investigate, only to discover that he had shot his wife and two kids before taking his own life. Sadly, it’s not an uncommon story in our state, and because of that, Courtney and several of her colleagues decided to record interviews with farmers and ranchers around the state who have faced mental health issues and gotten help for them. 
About the same time that Courtney began to explore this idea, the Montana Department of Agriculture received some American Rescue Fund dollars, as did every state in the union, that were to be directed toward “agriculture stress.” The Department of Agriculture utilized that money to fund three different approaches. If a rural community brought in a speaker to talk about mental health issues, the department would fund that. They also put $500,000 into a free counseling program for farmers and ranchers, through Frontier Psychiatry. And the third was Courtney’s  project to help promote the counseling program, but also to create these videos that would combat the stigma that is so prevalent among rural Montanans about getting help.  
The department wanted Courtney and her team to come up with a different name for their program, in order to avoid scaring people away with the mental-health label, which is how they came up with “Beyond the Weather,” which obviously refers to the fact that conversation in rural communities so often revolves around the weather. 
Like most Montana families, Courtney’s family struggled with having conversations about emotional topics, as evidenced by the fact that she didn’t even know about this horrific family tragedy for years, nor did she know that her grandfather’s second wife had once been married to one of his ranch hands. 
“It gave me a whole new perspective on my grandfather when I learned the story of his brother killing his family and himself, because when you go through something like that, and you live in a place where those kinds of things are discussed, it’s only natural that you would look for comfort somehow, either through drinking, or like he did, with someone else’s wife. The way that this kind of trauma affects so many families in Montana just doesn’t go away.”
Beyond the Weather features interviews with several ranchers and their spouses about issues of grief, stress, loss of a loved one, and depression, and as one young rancher, Travis Stuber, states so honestly, “I’m not a touchy feely guy, so this doesn’t come naturally to me, but I also know that as ranchers and farmers, the stigma around this stuff is weakness, and that’s the last thing we want to show is weakness. So I had to learn that it’s OK to be affected by loss. I lost my best friend and my mother in the past few years, and as my counselor pointed out when I said I was struggling with the loss of my mom, hey, that’s OK. Think about your mom and don’t bottle that up and throw it away.”
Not long after the COVID pandemic, a survey done by local law enforcement showed a huge spike in incidents of domestic violence in Montana, with an especially troubling rise in reports where one family member tried to strangle another. The isolation of ranching and farming, along with the stigma attached to asking for help, has long been a deterrent toward Montanas getting help for whatever mental health issues they are battling. So if you or someone you know is in that position, please visit the website for Beyond the Weather and check out the opportunity for free counseling, at https://www.northernag.net/beyondtheweather/.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Montana-roads-scaled-e1629831882279-1024x874.jpg,,,2025-04-22 07:08:39.935315

(File photo from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration)State transportation officials said they are working on strategies to protect the two bridges over the Chesapeake Bay following the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge.
The response from Maryland Transportation Secretary Paul Wiedefeld comes a month after the National Transportation Safety Board called for nearly six dozen bridges nationwide to undergo collapse-risk evaluations.
Wiedefeld, in a letter to NTSB officials released Monday, said the Maryland Transportation Administration “is developing a comprehensive risk reduction plan” for the two crossings over the bay.
Some of the short-term strategies could include new communications requirements for ship pilots, reduced speeds, one-way transits and managing vehicle traffic on the bridge, according to the response letter.
Longer-term strategies could include physical measures to prevent a strike.
In a statement, the Maryland Transportation Authority, which oversees toll bridges, including the former Francis Scott Key and Chesapeake Bay Bridges, spent $160 million last spring to study bridge protection at the Bay Bridge spans even though the agency was “not obligated to do so under the law.”
The review, conducted by Moffatt & Nichol, was performed as the agency looks at the long-term possibility of replacing the existing spans over the bay.
Maryland officials mark one year since collapse of Key Bridge

The NTSB released a report in March as part of its ongoing review of the allision that caused the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge on March 26, 2024. In that incident, the Dali, a 984-foot-long cargo ship flagged in Singapore, struck the bridge. The resulting collapse killed six people — all of whom were construction workers assigned to a detail on the span over the Patapsco River.
In its report, the NTSB said the state had failed to conduct a critical risk assessment on the bridge despite increases in both the amount and size of ship traffic in the channel. The agency said had the state conducted such an assessment, it would have found the risk for a collapse was 30 times greater than the current industry standard.
The safety board’s March report called on state transportation officials to use updated industry standards to determine the probability of a bridge collapse.
Wiedefeld, in his letter to the NTSB, said the consultants for the transportation administration “conclude the Bay Bridges do not meet the … risk threshold for new bridges.”
The board also recommended the state develop short- and long-term strategies to reduce the likelihood of a collapse caused by maritime traffic.
Michael Shields, an associate professor for civil and systems engineering at Johns Hopkins University, said in a statement that the results of the risk assessment commissioned by state transportation officials “which find that the Bay Bridge does not meet the (transportation industry’s) risk threshold for new bridges, are not surprising” given the university’s own analysis released a month ago.
Shields leads the university’s assessment of bridge vulnerabilities.
The standard for collisions that could cause a collapse should be measured in thousands of years, according to the university study. The Key Bridge would have been in the top 10 most vulnerable in the country, using that standard.
That analysis projected the Chesapeake Bay Bridge could expect a catastrophic collision every 86 years. That placed it in the top 12 in the Hopkins analysis.
The east-bound span opened in 1952, making it more than 70 years old. The west-bound span, opened in June 1972, would be more than 50 years old.
“Nonetheless, the MDTA’s stated commitment to invest in both short-term and long-term protections for the bridge are positive developments that will improve safety and reduce risk,” Shields said in his statement.

The pope died Monday at age 88.","Pope Francis, in an Aug. 3, 2023, photo from a visit to Portugal for World Youth Day. (Photo by Antonio Cotrim - Pool/Getty Images)Leaders from the worlds of church and state in Maryland remembered Pope Francis Monday for his humility and his advocacy for the poor and marginalized, with some sharing personal stories of meeting the pontiff. The pope died Monday at age 88, the Vatican announced.
“Pope Francis – the People’s Pope – led with humility, compassion, and love for all people,” said Gov. Wes Moore (D) in a statement that ordered flags flown at half-staff in memory of the pope.”I will be forever grateful for his spiritual leadership and the legacy he leaves behind. Dawn and I join millions across Maryland, our country, and the world in mourning his passing.”
President Donald Trump also ordered U.S. flags lowered to half-staff in memory of the pope. Both the U.S. and state flags will stay at half-staff until sunset on the day the pope is interred. A date for the funeral is expected to be set Tuesday, at the first gathering of cardinals after the pope’s death, the Vatican announced.
Washington Archbishop Robert McElroy and his predecessor, Cardinal Wilton Gregory, are among the 10 U.S. cardinals who will join 125 other cardinals from around the world who will meet in Rome to select the next pope in the coming weeks. McElroy said in a statement Monday that Francis, the first pope from Latin America, showed his roots while ministering directly to the sick, the incarcerated and the needy.
“It was in these intimate moments of pastoral care that we saw with such poignancy the heart of the pastor who had embodied mercy and love to the suffering in Buenos Aires and refused to diminish that commitment even when the strictures of the papacy fell upon him,” McElroy wrote. The Archdiocese of Washington includes Montgomery, Prince George’s, Calvert, Charles and St. Mary’s counties.
Baltimore Archbishop William E. Lori, who said he planned to travel to the pope’s funeral, recalled his visits with Francis Monday.
“Often the Holy Father would ask visitors to pray for him. I am sure he would want us to pray for him now that he may rest in the peace of the Risen Lord,” Lori wrote.
In his statement, Lori recalled previous visits with Francis, including one occasion when seminarians from Baltimore gifted Francis, “an avid sports fan,” with a Baltimore Ravens jersey.
“Throughout the years of his pontificate, Pope Francis manifested his love for the poor and marginalized. He lifted up the plight of migrants and refugees, victims of injustice, the sick and elderly, and global poverty,” Lori wrote.
Francis became pope in 2013, following the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI, the first pope in centuries to resign rather than die in the position. Born Jose Mario Bergoglio to Italian parents in Argentina, he became the first Latin American and the first Jesuit elevated to the papacy.
Francis called upon the cardinals to bring the church “to the peripheries, not only geographically, but also the existential peripheries: the mystery of sin, of pain, of injustice, of ignorance and indifference to religion, of intellectual currents and all misery.”
“His desire to bring the church to the peripheries has been witnessed to by the more than 45 papal trips he made over the 12 years of his papacy,”said Wilmington Bishop William E. Koenig in a statement Monday.
Koenig highlighted Francis’s comments on Easter Sunday, from what would be his final address in St. Peter’s Square. Francis said that the story of Jesus and his resurrection “fills us with the certainty that we too are called to share in the life that knows no end.”
“It is with this sure and certain hope that we entrust our beloved Holy Father into the ‘strong and mighty hand’ of God,” wrote Koenig, whose diocese includes Maryland’s Eastern Shore.
A memorial service for Francis is scheduled for April 28  at 12:10 p.m. at the Cathedral of St. Peter in Wilmington.
Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) remembered Francis as a “champion for a more just world,” and highlighted the pope’s Easter remarks as proof of his support for migrants like Kilmar Abrego Garcia, deported last month from Maryland and held ever since in a prison in his native El Salvador. Van Hollen, who traveled to El Salvador to meet with Abrego Garcia, has been fighting with the White House for weeks to bring Abrego Garcia back to the U.S. to be tried by courts here.
“Trump’s cronies said we ‘wasted Easter Sunday’ in discussing Mr. Abrego Garcia & their violation of his constitutional rights,” Van Hollen wrote on X. “We were in good company w/ Pope Francis, who on Easter decried ‘contempt’ for immigrants & has called on them to do better.”
Francis was a deender of immigrants to Europe and the U.S., recently speaking out about the treatment of immigrants in the United States.
“The act of deporting people who in many cases have left their own land for reasons of extreme poverty, insecurity, exploitation, persecution or serious deterioration of the environment, damages the dignity of many men and women, and of entire families, and places them in a state of particular vulnerability and defenselessness,” Francis wrote in a recent letter to U.S. bishops.
One of the pope’s last visits was from Vice President J.D. Vance, a recent Catholic convert who was in Italy to meet with Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. No politics were discussed in that brief meeting, and Vance extended condolences in a social media post.
“I was happy to see him yesterday, though he was obviously very ill,” said Vance, who said he will always remember the pope for a homily in the early days of pandemic in which he called on people to “be not afraid” but to have faith.
Others remembered the pope from his 2015 trip to the U.S., when he visited New York, Washington and Philadelphia. It was during that trip that Francis became the first pope to address a joint session of Congress.
Maryland Rep. April McClain Delaney (D) said she was “blessed to be in his presence” twice when the pope visited Washington in 2015. She shared a video of then-President Barack Obama (D) introducing Francis to a large crowd.
“Modeling the fruits of the spirit, the Pope gave an antidote to our present world. May he rest in peace and serve to remind us to shine God‘s light in good work and compassion,” McClain Delaney wrote on X.
Rep. Andy Harris (R-1st), Maryland’s only Republican in Congress, also shared condolences Monday, writing that he and his wife, Nicole “send prayers of strength to those in grief. May his legacy of ministry and charity continue to be an inspiration to us all. Rest in peace.”
Former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R), said he met with Francis after he was diagnosed with Stage 3 non-Hodgkin lymphoma during his first term as governor. Hogan, who is a Catholic, said he asked Francis to pray for all those battling cancer.
“He responded with such kindness and sincerity — taking a moment to pray with me personally. It was an encounter filled with comfort, strength, and grace, and it is something I will never forget,” Hogan wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1574192435-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-04-22 07:08:39.935315

Photo by Andrew KennardThe exoneration of David and Robert Bintz in a 1987 murder case has increased attention on what happens in Wisconsin after defendants’  convictions are overturned and they are released from prison. 
  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
The Wisconsin Claims Board considers compensation claims by innocent people who were convicted of a crime. The board can award up to $25,000, not including attorneys’ fees, and not more than $5,000 for every year of wrongful imprisonment. It can recommend that the state Legislature award additional compensation. 
Re-entering society  
Exonerated people often experience more difficulty accessing services to help them reenter society than people who were released on probation or parole, according to Rachel Burg, co-director of the Wisconsin Innocence Project. 
State programs work with people on probation or parole before release, Burg said, and include pre-release job training, assistance with applications to public benefits and general release planning. After release, a person may have court or supervision-mandated programs, such as school or work requirements. 
“By no means am I saying being on probation or parole is easy or conducive to successfully reentering society, but in theory there is access to resources that are not available to the wrongfully convicted,” Burg said in an email to the Examiner. 
Exonerated people don’t have probation officers making sure they have their identification cards and get set up for Medicaid, she said, or parole agents helping with job applications. 
A guilty person gets more support from the state than an innocent person who was exonerated, Keith Findley, co-founder of the Wisconsin Innocence Project and an emeritus law professor at UW-Madison, said in an interview in November. 
“They’ve spent often decades in prison, had their livelihoods taken away from them, their relationships, their homes, their professions, their good names,” Findley said. “And then when we discover we got it wrong and made a mistake, we just open the door and say, ‘OK, have a good life,’ with nothing more from the state.”
Findley said Wisconsin could create a state forensic science commission, as well as conviction integrity units (CIUs) in prosecutors’ offices. In neighboring Michigan, the CIU in the state attorney general’s office  investigates claims of innocence that are accompanied by new evidence. 
Paths to compensation 
Exonerees in the U.S. may receive compensation through a civil lawsuit, a private bill passed by a state legislature or a state law, if the state has a compensation statute.
Wisconsin’s compensation cap for wrongfully convicted people is one of the lowest caps in the country. The rare exception to the cap is if the Wisconsin Legislature approves a higher amount.
The Wisconsin Claims Board decides whether to grant compensation to an exonerated person and can recommend that the Legislature award an amount higher than the $25,000 cap. 
The members of the Wisconsin Claims Board come from the Wisconsin Senate, the Wisconsin Assembly, the governor’s office, the Wisconsin Department of Justice and the Wisconsin Department of Administration. Currently, the legislative representatives are Rep. Alex Dallman (R-Green Lake) and Sen. Eric Wimberger (R-Oconto). 
How much does Wisconsin pay wrongly convicted people?
Wisconsin pays an average of about $4,200 per year of wrongful incarceration to those who filed and received compensation, according to an analysis of data collected by the National Registry of Exonerations,  Wisconsin Watch reported. 
A bipartisan bill that would have increased the $25,000 cap to $1 million passed the Wisconsin State Assembly in 2016, the Capital Times reported. It didn’t become law. The bill would have also granted assistance for  transitioning back into society and up to 10 years in the state’s health insurance program for public employees.
There were 39 states, along with the District of Columbia, with compensation statutes for wrongful imprisonment as of March. 
Some states’ compensation statutes allow exonerees to receive services, like assistance with tuition, job search and housing, Rachel Burg of the Wisconsin Innocence Project said.
As of July 2023, 62 Wisconsin exonerees were wrongly convicted in state courts since 1989 and potentially eligible for compensation, according to a research paper that used information from the National Registry of Exonerations. Jeffrey Gutman of George Washington University Law School published “Compensation under the Microscope: Wisconsin” in 2022, and it was updated in 2023.
As of July 2023, 25 of the 62 had filed claims. 17 of 25 applicants were granted compensation, and 8 were denied.
Gutman wrote that Wisconsin’s filing rate was significantly below a national average of 58% and said that “Wisconsin’s low compensation is a logical explanation.”  
In Findley’s view, Wisconsin’s compensation plan for exonerees “puts a very high burden” on innocent people to prove their innocence.
Wisconsin’s compensation statute does not give compensation to people because they show their conviction was overturned, the claims board said when it denied compensation to Lavontae Stinson in a 2024 decision.
Stinson’s conviction was overturned due to ineffective assistance of his legal counsel, the claims board said. For this to happen, Stinson had to show there was a “reasonable probability” that more effective counsel would have led to a different result.
According to the board’s decision, the Milwaukee County District Attorney decided not to retry Stinson because the state could not meet its burden of proof. According to the DA, additional information from Stinson’s post-conviction counsel “cast some doubt on whether Stinson was involved at all in the crimes for which he was sent to prison.”
To receive compensation, Stinson had to meet a different standard — proving his innocence with “clear and convincing” evidence — and the board ruled his arguments and evidence did not meet the standard.
Rare compensation from the Legislature 
In 2014, then-Gov. Scott Walker signed a bill granting Robert Lee Stinson an additional $90,000. In the end, Stinson was awarded the $115,000 he had requested from the Wisconsin State Claims Board — $5,000 for each year of his imprisonment.
Gutman’s “Compensation Under the Microscope” reported 17 cases of exonerees receiving state compensation, going back to 1989. Stinson’s case appeared to be the only example of the Wisconsin Legislature ordering additional compensation for a wrongfully convicted person following a claims board recommendation, he wrote.
Stinson spent over two decades incarcerated for a conviction based on flawed evidence, FOX6 Milwaukee reported. He settled litigation with the city of Milwaukee for $7.5 million.
Jarrett Adams, an attorney working with David and Robert Bintz, didn’t yet know if the brothers could make a claim for a federal lawsuit, he told the Examiner in late February. Wisconsin’s compensation statute might be the brothers’ only opportunity for compensation, he said. 
In the case of Daryl Holloway, the claims board recommended an additional $975,000 in March 2022, Gutman wrote, and the Legislature hadn’t acted on the recommendation as of June 2023. 
After a 3-2 vote, in a Jan. 30 decision, the board awarded Gabriel Lugo $25,000 in compensation, not including attorneys’ fees. 
Lugo had been sentenced to 30 years in prison for a 2008 shooting and released in 2023 after his conviction was vacated. The board recommended that the Legislature award Lugo an additional $750,000.

The Idahoan is the founder of Grove Fruit Growers, which grows mangos in Cambodia and processes them in Vietnam. After the COVID-19 pandemic brought her business to a halt, she moved her product to the Russian market — only to have to be forced out when Russia invaded Ukraine. Then as she worked to readjust her business plans, she was in a car accident that caused a brain injury.

After years of disruptions, she finally solidified buyers in the U.S. But the Trump administration announced 49% tariffs on Cambodia and 46% on Vietnam — targeting the countries where her business operates. While those tariffs are paused until July, if implemented, Carver said it would result in the end of her business. 
Carver said she supports fair trade and believes the U.S. has not “gotten a fair shake with China.” However, she said universal tariffs do not make sense. 
“We don’t even grow mangos in the U.S.,” she told the Idaho Capital Sun. “So it’s not protecting U.S. industry, because it’s just been a blanket tariff put on most of the world. It really wasn’t strategically looked at to say, ‘What industries do we want to protect or support?’ It’s just thrown at mango farmers, which is so bizarre.”
 A mission that’s more than just the mangos

Before becoming the owner of a 110 acre mango farm in Cambodia, Carver lived in Taiwan and owned a small food distribution company exporting nuts and grains from the U.S. into Asia, while her husband worked for Micron. 
In 2018, after her children were assigned a book in school about the Khmer Rouge — Cambodia’s brutal communist regime that killed most of the educated class between 1975 to 1979 and resorted to a rural agricultural society — Carver said she was in awe that this type of genocide had happened in her lifetime. This inspired her to visit the country with her family.
Upon visiting, she noticed piles of mangos in the countryside.
“I asked why, and they said they can’t find buyers,” she said. “I have this food distribution company, so I was like, ‘Oh, I can connect them to buyers.’”
It took years of geopolitical hurdles and receiving funding from the U.S. Agency for International Development — which the Trump administration dissolved earlier this year — to get a hold on the U.S. market. She can finally sell frozen fruit to retailers, and she is in the process of meeting with dried fruit buyers from major retailers and small grocery stories alike. 
Carver, who has a master’s degree from Harvard in sustainable global development, said her business is more than just about selling mangos. 
“It’s about development,” she said. “It’s about bringing people out of poverty in Cambodia, but also making a business case for me.”
Retailers are interested in the mission behind her business, Carver said, but if these tariffs go into effect, then the business is done. 
“I’m just so deflated,” she said. “I’ve spent so much money. We’ve spent just under a million dollars on this project, just of our own money, not only from getting grants. So, I think I might just be done.”

 Do tariffs work, and why Southeast Asia? 

During Trump’s first term, he began setting tariffs on China to punish it for what he called unfair trade practices. So who won that trade war? 
It wasn’t the U.S. or China — it was Vietnam, according to Rob Dayley, a political economy professor and Southeast Asia expert at the College of Idaho.
“Those first term tariffs merely incentivized companies to move production from China to other low-cost production countries such as Vietnam and Cambodia, countries that then were not in the crosshairs,” Dayley told the Idaho Capital Sun. 
To close that loophole 2025, the Trump administration chose to implement universal tariffs on nearby countries to China. Because those tariffs were so high and disruptive in global confidence of the U.S., President Donald Trump backtracked from his “Liberation Day” tariff rates, Dayley said, adding that the broader promises of the tariff policy — reducing deficits, bringing manufacturing back to the U.S., and lowering inflation — is “just not going to happen.”
There is no historical data to support that tariff policies will produce those positive outcomes, he said.
“The idea that manufacturers of shoes, toys, clothing, and other low-skill products would somehow decide to reshore production to Des Moines or Boise because of some import tariffs was unrealistic during Trump’s first term and remains unrealistic in his second term,” Dayley said. 
While it makes sense to protect national security industries, such as semi-conductors or other defense-related technologies, Dayley said it doesn’t make sense to punish fruit industries that are not grown in the U.S. If farms, like the Grove Fruit Growers, cannot make a profit, they’ll stop sending their products to the U.S. market, he said. 
“If Americans only want to exclude all foreign pineapple or mangos from our U.S. grocery stores (be it fresh, canned, or frozen), then prepare to eat Hawaiian pineapple or mangos at much higher prices,” he said. “When supply goes down, prices go up. It’s that simple.”

(Tom Werner/Getty Images)As a family medicine physician in Boise and president and CEO of Full Circle Health, I have dedicated much of my career to enhancing medical education and addressing Idaho’s physician shortage. 
Serving as the Graduate Medical Education coordinator for the state, I authored Idaho’s 10-Year Graduate Medical Education plan to build a robust Graduate Medical Education system of residency programs throughout Idaho.  
Idaho faces a critical need for more medical doctors (MD’s and DO’s), especially in rural and underserved areas. House Bill 368, as amended, is a vital step toward addressing this shortage by expanding medical education opportunities within Idaho. The bill increases the number of medical school positions and establishes a working group to develop a comprehensive plan for Undergraduate Medical Education, or medical school training, in Idaho.
Comprehensive medical education includes both Undergraduate Medical Education and Graduate Medical Education. Think of it as a pipeline. 
Undergraduate Medical Education is the front end of the pipeline which lays the foundation — classroom learning and early clinical training. Graduate Medical Education serves as the backend of the pipeline and provides the advanced, hands-on clinical and hospital experience through residency programs, where medical school graduates train in the specialty of their choosing. 
Residency training is critical, as physicians must graduate from a residency program in order to become licensed practicing physicians. Data consistently shows physicians are more likely to stay and practice in the state where they complete their training. But to truly build a pipeline, Idaho must educate more doctors who not only stay here, but also open their doors to medical students for clinical rotations and their training in Idaho.
Investing in both Undergraduate Medical Education and Graduate Medical Education is essential to creating a full, self-sustaining medical education ecosystem and ensuring Idaho has the health care workforce it needs for the future. By supporting House Bill 368, we can strengthen our medical education infrastructure, attract and retain talented physicians, and ultimately improve health care access for all Idahoans.

The survey is for the Community Health Needs Assessment, a private-public initiative by organizations including by the region’s two major hospital systems, St. Luke’s Health System and Saint Alphonsus Health System; the region’s two public health districts, Central District Health and Southwest District Health; along with other partners such as Terry Reilly Health Services, United Way of Treasure Valley and Weiser Memorial Hospital.
The needs assessment initiative is convened by the Western Idaho Community Health Collaborative.
“It’s important for residents to take this survey because it offers us direct, local input on how (the collaborative), community partners, and local health care providers can make the Treasure Valley a healthier place to live,” Berenice Medina, community health strategist at the Western Idaho Community Health Collaborative, said in a written statement. “Your feedback will help us to better understand what we can do to create positive change in people’s health and quality of life.”
The anonymous survey is available online and takes less than 10 minutes to finish. The survey will be open through May 31. Results will be used to help develop strategies to address southwest Idaho’s pressing health challenges, Central District Health announced in a news release. 
In June, 30 people who participate in the survey will be selected to win $20 gift cards through a raffle.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)In the final days of the 2025 legislative session, Tennessee officials are asking the U.S. Department of Education whether federal funds are being jeopardized by a bill that would restrict undocumented immigrant students from enrolling in K-12 schools.
The state’s Fiscal Review Executive Director Bojan Savic sent a letter Monday to U.S. Education Secretary Linda McMahon to determine whether the state could lose $1.1 billion in federal funds if the legislature passes bills that could force school districts to check the citizenship status of children and force them to pay tuition to enroll.
Hoping for a quick turnaround, House Majority Leader William Lamberth told the Lookout Monday he requested the letter because he wants to know whether the money is at risk before the end of the session, which is expected to be Tuesday. 
The bill he is sponsoring, HB793, hit a roadblock, in part because of financial questions surrounding it and could be delayed until 2026, even though it passed the Senate. The Fiscal Review financial analysis says the funds could be in jeopardy because of federal laws prohibiting discrimination.
“We fully trust the Trump Administration will not withhold federal dollars from our schools due to the passage of House Bill 793/Senate Bill 836,” Lamberth said. “However, out of an abundance of caution, we want to be exceptionally careful before we move forward to ensure no federal taxpayer dollars are at risk. Our first obligation is to prioritize public dollars for students lawfully in the United States. The last thing we want to do is cause our schools to be further drained of much-needed resources.”
The House version of the legislation would give school districts the option to check students to determine whether they have permanent legal documentation, differing from the Senate version, which would require districts to check students’ immigration status and require tuition.
Stockard on the Stump: Tennessee immigrant student bill losing momentum

Federal Title VI prohibits discrimination based on race, color or national origins in programs that receive federal funds, and violating the law could put the federal funds in danger. Those deal with the Every Student Succeeds Act, the Individuals with Disabilities Act, Carl Perkins Act and school nutrition.
Lamberth declined Monday to confirm that the bill could be dead for the year. The Lookout reported last week that the bill could be dead for the year, mainly because of financial questions.
Republican Sen. Bo Watson of Hixson, who has been feeling considerable pressure from opponents of the bill, said he would consider seeking a compromise on the measure, according to a Chattanooga TV report.
The bill is designed to go through the courts and challenge the 1982 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Plyler v. Doe that required school districts to education students regardless of their immigration status.

(Photo: Karen Pulfer Focht for Tennessee Lookout)A bill slashing regulations for an estimated 80% of Tennessee’s non-federally protected wetlands is headed to Gov. Bill Lee’s desk Monday after receiving approval from the General Assembly.
The bill’s West Tennessee Republican sponsors — Rep. Kevin Vaughan and Sen. Brent Taylor — said the legislation removes onerous and seemingly subjective mitigation requirements for landowners and developers. 
Environmental advocates and scientists said the legislation paves the way for the destruction of Tennessee’s natural resources.
The bill passed 71-21 with one abstention in the House, and 25-6 in the Senate.
Since the 1970s, wetland regulations in Tennessee have required developers and landowners to seek permission from the state before draining or altering wetlands. The swampy areas can host diverse species, soak up rain water and filter it as it seeps into groundwater tables, recharging aquifers. Alterations to wetlands required developers to pay for mitigation — efforts to preserve or restore other wetlands nearby.










(Flooding) is a constant that we are dealing with, and these two things are related … and what (Sen. Brent Taylor) belittles as ‘damp dirt’ is actually the stuff that matters.


– Sen. Jeff Yarbro, D-Nashville


Vaughan and Taylor’s legislation scraps automatic mitigation requirements for most of Tennessee’s isolated wetlands, which lack surface connections to navigable rivers and lakes. Federal law requires mitigation for those larger water bodies, but a 2023 Supreme Court ruling removed isolated wetlands from federal control, leaving their regulation entirely to the states.
Sen. Page Walley, a West Tennessee Republican who helped shape the legislation, said his district includes swampland. 
“That land over in that very agriculturally rich area is flat, it does flood, and it is replete with a variety of wonderful wetlands, but things change … and the state was given the authority to begin to monitor that,” Walley said Monday.
The Southern Environmental Law Center estimates the legislation will axe development regulations for up to 80% of Tennessee’s isolated wetlands.


Recent modeling commissioned by the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC) indicates most of the state’s isolated wetlands are located in West Tennessee, a region expected to see intense development around Ford’s new Blue Oval City manufacturing campus in Haywood County. 
More than 30,000 acres of isolated wetlands fall in the northwest corner of the state, which remains inundated with historic levels of water after severe storms caused generational flooding earlier this month.
Nashville Democrat Jeff Yarbro grew up in Dyersburg, one of several West Tennessee towns that flooded. 
“(Flooding) is a constant that we are dealing with, and these two things are related … and what (Sen. Taylor) belittles as ‘damp dirt’ is actually the stuff that matters,” Yarbro said. “The research is pretty clear that it’s these smaller wetlands that … actually reduce the peak flooding levels in communities.”
The Senate rejected Sen. Heidi Campbell’s attempt to add a 2-year sunset provision to the law and an amendment that would have brought the law in line with the recommendations presented by TDEC in 2024.
New wetlands regulations
The sponsors initially planned to eliminate all state regulation of isolated wetlands to match federal law, citing other states’ decisions to do the same.
Wetlands protections built an industry for mitigation banking. Rollbacks could erode it.

Instead, the legislation defines four types of isolated wetlands and sets regulatory thresholds for each of them.
Artificial wetlands, a new category, are wetlands created purposefully or inadvertently by the alterations of humans or beavers. Developers are allowed to drain and fill this type of wetland with no regulatory oversight.
No permits or mitigation are required for alterations to low-quality isolated wetlands up to 1 acre, or moderate-quality wetlands up to one-quarter acre.
These wetlands have minimal or moderate roles in ecosystems, natural water cycles and chemical cycles, according to the legislation. Exact definitions for wetland quality will be created through a rule-making process that includes public input opportunities.
General permits and 1-1 mitigation are required for low-quality isolated wetlands from 1 to 2 acres in size. Changes to moderate-quality isolated wetlands from one-quarter acre to 2 acres require a general permit with mitigation capped at a 1-1 ratio (which raises to 2-1 on the second acre). 
Alterations to high-quality isolated wetlands will continue to require more specialized Aquatic Resource Alteration Permits from the state and mitigation, as will changes to low- and moderate-quality isolated wetlands larger than 2 acres.

About 80% of Tennessee’s isolated wetlands are smaller than one acre, according to SELC Tennessee Director George Nolan. Around 94% of isolated wetlands are smaller than 2 acres.
​​The legislation also prevents TDEC from considering isolated wetlands of any quality when determining a project’s cumulative impact, even if the project encompasses other federally regulated wetlands.
The Tennessee Chamber of Commerce and Industry and Home Builders of Tennessee supported the legislation, as did the Pacific Legal Foundation, a national firm that fought for deregulation of American wetlands at the U.S. Supreme Court in 2023. They said the changes will support property rights and bring down costs for developers.
Several environmental groups, scientists and businesses that restore wetlands and sell mitigation credits to developers opposed the legislation, warning that the clause ignoring cumulative impact could super-charge wetlands destruction and hinder an industry that has invested more than $1 billion in restoration and conservation projects in Tennessee.
Vaughan said he sees mitigation requirements as “trampling people’s private property rights.”
“I may own a piece of property and because someone else says that there is something on my property that has resource value that I’m going to have to pay a third party to be able to use my own property. That does not compute,” Vaughan said Monday.
Rep. Justin Pearson, a Memphis Democrat, voted against the bill. 
“If these changes are being made to improve our environment, are being made to improve the quality of life of people in Tennessee, that’s one thing,” Pearson said. “But if we are changing the protections of our natural resources on behalf of corporate entities to be able to make more profit, I have a significant problem with that.”

Fed up with unchecked pollution, environmental leaders of the 1970s organized, educated, and advocated, ultimately ushering in landmark federal regulations, such as the Clean Air Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act, that fought contaminants in our air, water and land.
The environmental movement has excelled at standing up and saying “no,” with huge results. We can credit the rejection of pollution with helping to restore ecosystems and save countless lives. Today, while some things remain the same — and we’re still justified in fighting polluters to protect environmental and human health — some factors have changed, warranting new approaches. Climate change is no longer some far-off problem. It’s here, and it’s wreaking havoc. Last year was the warmest year on record; in fact, the hottest 10 years on record were all of the last 10 years. Floods, extreme storms, and disappearing winters are hurting Wisconsin’s communities and economy. And we need to do something about it. On this Earth Day, as we watch our federal government turn its back on the science of climate change, we have an opportunity to keep moving forward in Wisconsin by saying “yes” to wind and solar projects lining up for approval in our state.
While the president may be pushing expensive, “beautiful” coal and opening up protected lands for oil and gas drilling, we know that homegrown wind and solar are not only the cheapest ways to produce energy in Wisconsin, but they also bring enormous economic benefits to communities that host these projects. Farmers who sign leases to host solar panels or wind turbines receive high, stable income for 30 or more years. Communities hosting projects receive annual utility aid payments to the tune of $5,000 per megawatt. Local leaders can then direct this boost to municipal budgets where the community needs it most, like repairing roads and lowering taxes.
But let’s face it, in Wisconsin, large wind and solar projects remain controversial. Our state is rock bottom in the Midwest when it comes to the amount of wind energy we produce. Solar produces 100 times more energy per acre than ethanol, yet we devote more than a million acres of land to ethanol production and just a fraction of that to solar farms. The reality is that to protect the places we love and that sustain us, we need to build new, better infrastructure, because what we have now is harming us. We desperately need an alternative. We need more Wisconsinites to speak up in support of these solutions. The environmental movement cut its teeth by saying “no” to the problem of pollution. The time has come to build on this legacy and say “yes” to solutions: “yes” to clean energy, “yes” to thriving Wisconsin communities, and “yes” to a brighter future.",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/solar-farm-photo-clean-wisconsin-768x1024.jpg,,,2025-04-22 06:05:35.308034

The center has been studying the potential for rare earth mineral development in the state. (Kari Suedel/Energy and Environmental Research Center)Sen. Dale Patten says North Dakota is at the leading edge of rare earth mineral development in the United States and the Legislature is looking to keep it that way. 
Patten, R-Watford City, last week offered an amendment on House Bill 1459 that he said he hopes will keep North Dakota at the forefront of developing rare earth minerals, which are needed for products such as electronics and electric vehicles. 
China is filling most of the demand for rare earth minerals. But uncertainty over trade with China has increased the interest in developing rare earth minerals in the United States.
President Donald Trump in March issued an executive order to stimulate mineral production, including on federal lands controlled by the Department of the Interior.

Coal seams in North Dakota’s Williston Basin are a potential source, with Dan Laudal, a researcher at the School of Engineering and Mines at the University of North Dakota, telling a Senate committee last week the state could “piggyback” on existing coal mining to produce rare earth minerals. 
There was little discussion Monday as the Senate approved the amendment and the bill. It will now go back to the House, which had approved a very different version of the bill. 
Patten said last week that he hoped the House would not concur with the changes  the Senate approved Monday, which would push the bill into a conference committee for additional tweaks to improve the bill.
The House version proved to be contentious between groups representing landowners and lawmakers seeking to speed up extracting rare earth minerals by modifying existing coal leases. 
The amendment approved Monday removes references to coal leases from the bill. 
Patten said the new bill accomplishes three things:  

It establishes a policy to let the federal Department of Energy know that North Dakota wants to develop the resource. 
It clarifies that rare earth minerals are part of the mineral estate, as opposed to part of the surface land. 
It provides for a study of rare earth mineral development in the state. 

Troy Coons, chairman of the Northwest Landowners Association, testified against the previous version of the bill, saying the Legislature was interfering with what should be private contract negotiations between coal companies and landowners. He said the amended bill was better, but not perfect. 
“We’re not going to support it, but we’re not going to fight it,” Coons said Monday. 
He said the group would like to see the study include some guidance on how contracts with coal companies might be structured. He said he hopes the bill does not go into conference committee for fear that something gets changed in a way that will be detrimental to landowners. 
Several entities have been researching where rare earth mineral can be found in the state and the potential for development, including the Lignite Research Council, the Energy and Environmental Resource Center in Grand Forks, the North Dakota Geological Survey and UND.  
  Jonathan Fortner, interim president and CEO, North Dakota Lignite Energy Council. (Provided)
Jonathan Fortner, interim president of the North Dakota Lignite Energy Council, said one of the goals of his group was to avoid spending a lot of time in court battling over leases. 
“This is probably one of the more complicated things we’ve tried to work on,” he said of potentially valuable mineral intermingled, but very sporadically within a coal vein. 
But he said it is a great opportunity for the coal industry to diversify away from just producing electricity. 
There are 17 rare earth minerals that could be separated from the coal and sent to other facilities for further refining and manufacturing, Laudal said. 
Laudal said Thursday a $100 million facility extracting rare earth minerals from about 200,000 tons of coal per year could be done profitably. That’s about 50 times the size of a UND pilot project. 
Rare earth minerals are found in their highest concentration at the top and bottom of coal seams, he said. A facility could extract and concentrate a mixture of rare earth minerals. 
Rare earth minerals are of potentially high value and shipping just a truckload a week could make the investment pay, he said. 
Trump signs orders targeting revival of ‘beautiful, clean coal’

Fortner said with China’s dominance there is not an established market for domestic rare earth minerals, which may make it hard to attract investment. 
He said federal incentives or federal contracts, perhaps through the Department of Defense, could help provide some certainty and benefit coal companies and landowners. 
“Without more certainty, we won’t have extraction and landowners won’t benefit,” he said. 
Patten said having a domestic source of rare earth minerals is seen as a matter of national security and he is hopeful that the federal government could help offset the cost of development in North Dakota. 
“I would not be surprised that the Department of Energy says, ‘OK, because of a national security interest, we’re going to provide funding,’” Patten said.

Black maternal health advocates and researchers worry about federal funding cuts. (Courtesy of Birthlooms)Before everything went black, Tamika Jackson felt like she was drowning. While in labor giving birth to her baby boy, her body felt heavy and her breaths shallow.
“I can’t breathe,” she croaked to the anesthesiologist.
“If you couldn’t breathe, you wouldn’t be able to speak,” she recalled the doctor telling her, dismissing her as having a “panic attack.”
Minutes later, the 37-year-old’s lungs gave out. Her heart stopped beating.
Clinicians were able to resuscitate Jackson. Her baby boy was born via C-section, and the Michigan mom lived to tell her story of giving birth to Cree, who’s turning 3 next month.
Jackson is now a maternal health organizer at Mothering Justice, a Michigan-based nonprofit. She spoke with Stateline while on a bus to the Michigan Capitol, where she participated in a Black Maternal Health Week panel and pushed for a legislative package — nicknamed the Michigan Momnibus — which aims to increase obstetric patient protections and improve care for moms of color.
The Michigan Senate passed the package Thursday, and it now heads to the House.
Black moms like Jackson are three times more likely to die than white mothers and suffer higher rates of pregnancy-related complications.
But in its bid to eliminate federal diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, initiatives, the Trump administration has terminated community health grants and closed federal offices that support state efforts to tackle racial health disparities. Experts say the moves will hinder efforts to improve Black maternal health.
“DEI is not about politics. It’s about survival,” Jackson said. “This is about community-based solutions — and they’re undoing that.”
Jackson added that without federal dollars, “We’re going to be left trying to do a whole lot with a whole lot of nothing.”
The Trump administration has cut grants for maternal health studies and research on health disparities in various populations, including patients of color and LGBTQ people. It has laid off most staff at the federal Division of Reproductive Health, and removed maternal health data from federal agency websites.
It also is considering cutting next year’s budget for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services from about $121 billion to about $80.4 billion, according to The New York Times. The administration plans to create a new Administration for a Healthy America, which would focus on maternal and child health, among other issues.
HHS and its National Institutes of Health did not return requests for comment in time for publication.











DEI is not about politics. It’s about survival.


– Tamika Jackson, Michigan mom and maternal health organizer at Mothering Justice



Researchers and advocates like Jackson say that amid the Trump administration’s erasures, their work will continue.
Among those losing grants are nonprofits, health care systems and universities, including the Morehouse School of Medicine, a historically Black medical school in Atlanta, which received a $2.96 million grant for a center to improve the health of Black pregnant and postpartum women. Georgia has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the nation.
“We are reviewing the situation to assess how it may affect our research,” a Morehouse spokesperson wrote in an email. “More broadly, it is important that we all recognize the critical role medical research plays in developing potential life-saving innovation that will mitigate disease and improve the health and well-being of many people.”

The Morehouse center was selected among an initial 10 research centers funded under the NIH’s Maternal health and Pregnancy Outcomes Vision for Everyone, or “IMPROVE,” Initiative.
Columbia University and community groups throughout New York also received the grants. One goal was to connect postpartum moms with doulas to detect conditions such as postpartum preeclampsia, according to principal investigator Dr. Uma Reddy, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Columbia. Reddy said the grant was developed with communities who voiced their needs.
“We can actually prevent these deaths and these serious complications,” Reddy said. “This is a way to focus on a high-risk population and provide them with the resources that they don’t have available.”
Tufts University maternal health scholar Ndidiamaka Amutah-Onukagha said she’s had several meetings in Washington, D.C., get canceled, and while she’s thankful to have almost completed one federal grant project, there’s uncertainty about other grants she’s applied for, including a Black postpartum support research initiative.
The professor runs the Maternal Outcomes for Translational Health Equity Research (MOTHER) Lab and Center for Black Maternal Health and Reproductive Justice at the Tufts University School of Medicine.
“It not only stalls progress, but it actually actively endangers the most vulnerable among us,” she said. “These policy decisions can cause and will cause lasting harm to people who are already underserved by our health care system.”
Amutah-Onukagha said she is urging researchers and advocates to have “cautious optimism.”
“Most people are in the space of gloom and doom. I do get that, and I’m vastly in and out of that,” she said. “But because of the work that I do in maternal health, we have to remain optimistic. That lens cannot die. If it does, then the communities that we serve are going to be even more disadvantaged.”
Amutah-Onukagha, who recently testified before the Massachusetts Joint Committee on Public Health, said her team will continue to work with organizations around the state, such as Birth Equity & Justice Massachusetts and Resilient Sisterhood Project.
“We’re stronger in numbers,” she said.
Diana Greene Foster, research director in reproductive health at the University of California, San Francisco, conducted the seminal Turnaway Study documenting the harms women suffer from abortion denials.
She was in the middle of another study, funded by a federal grant, tracking post-Roe abortions and the efficacy of health exceptions in abortion ban laws. Her team was interviewing emergency room doctors about whether they could provide abortions amid major pregnancy complications such as eclampsia, a serious consequence of preeclampsia, which is a dangerous form of high blood pressure that disproportionately affects Black mothers.
The administration pulled her grant.
Foster, who is fundraising to continue her study, said she feels the administration’s actions send a message of “turning their back on science, on compassion, on caring about women.”
Tina Sherman, a doula and national director of maternal justice at MomsRising, a nonpartisan women and mothers advocacy group, said she worries about data the administration has removed, including the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System.
The surveillance system is a comprehensive tool states use to track maternal health and formulate policies to improve it.
“An attempt to erase the data,” said Sherman, “doesn’t erase the harm that has been done and creates additional harm.”
Without data, states can’t target where resources are needed and which communities are disproportionately harmed and how, said Sherman, who co-chairs the North Carolina Maternal Mortality Review Committee.
“We’re going to be going backwards,” she said.
The Trump administration also canceled several grants focused on intimate partner violence, a leading cause of pregnancy-associated death which disproportionately affects people of color.
One such grant was supporting a University of North Carolina project studying intimate partner violence against pregnant women shortly before they give birth.
“The issues remain. The urgency is pressing as it ever was. The reality is this: Black mothers and birthing people continue to carry the weight of a crisis that we did not create,” Amutah-Onukagha said. “We did not create it, but we are leading the fight to solve it and dismantle it, and we know that the systemic barriers existed before this administration.
They will continue to show up — but we will also continue to produce cutting-edge research here at the center.”

Goodman Drug in Corning, a town of about 3,000 people in Clay County, was one of two pharmacies that makes naloxone available over the counter. Though owner Cathy Goodman said she didn’t have many customers come in looking for the product, she said it was important to keep it in an accessible location.
“Some people have prescription drugs and children in the house,” Goodman said. “[Naloxone] may not necessarily be for them, but it should be readily available to anybody who has anything [with opioids] in their household,” she said.
More than 82,000 people in the United States died of a drug overdose in 2024, according to preliminary data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The same data shows Arkansas had 386 drug overdose deaths in 2024, though the figure could change as the data is finalized. The CDC reported a 28% decrease in Arkansas overdose deaths from 2023 to 2024.
Naloxone is packaged as many brands, and the Narcan nasal spray was a commonly known label when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration expanded its availability in March 2023. While the nasal spray is effective and designed for easy use, experts say 911 should still be called immediately in the event of an overdose.
Arkansas officials stress the importance of naloxone distribution as they gradually allocate the state’s $216 million share of the national $26 billion opioid settlement funds. The funds were divided between the state, counties and cities. The Arkansas Association of Counties and the Arkansas Municipal League pooled their allocations together and formed the Arkansas Opioid Recovery Partnership, which former state drug director Kirk Lane leads.
“I think there’s a stigma attached to anything that has to do with substance use disorder, and there always has been,” Lane said, acknowledging that naloxone carries a stigma. “It’s what’s always made it difficult for us to give resources to people who need it.”

Lane agreed that keeping naloxone behind the counter where a customer has to ask for it establishes a barrier. However, ARORP has distributed about 100,000 dosage units of naloxone statewide, and Lane said if someone has a will to access the medicine, they could get it very quickly from a local participating organization, law enforcement agency or emergency services group.
Lane said the recovery partnership has approved funding for a handful of pharmacies to provide naloxone kits free of charge to patients who can’t afford it.
Per Arkansas Act 651 of 2021, health care professionals are required to prescribe an opioid antagonist like naloxone under certain conditions, including when a patient has a history of opioid use disorder or if they receive an opioid dosage of at least 50 morphine milligram equivalents per day for at least five days.

Patient hurdles
Spence Reed, an owner of the ReedHutchins Pharmacy in Heber Springs, said he could see how the behind-the-counter placement of naloxone in his Cleburne County store would create an additional hurdle for customers. But Reed said he’s also concerned that people might steal the $60 medicine. He compared the product to pregnancy tests or condoms, which he said are commonly taken to avoid embarrassment.
Several other pharmacy operators said they were worried naloxone would be taken unknowingly out of their business and have kept it behind the counter so they can keep an eye on it.
Chris Cooper, director of operations for Heartland Pharmacy’s 11 Arkansas locations, said the location of the drug depends on the storefront. While smaller businesses with less to oversee may stock it on their shelves, it’s mostly kept behind the counter as a preventative for shoplifting.

“It’s not cheap, so contrary to what a lot of people think — they think that it is still very affordable, a cheap medication that they can just snag. Unfortunately, it’s not,” he said.
Cooper said the behind-the-counter placement is not meant to deter use of the drug in any way, and he expressed support for naloxone access as drug overdose continues to affect thousands nationwide each year.
Naloxone is typically packaged in a small box containing two nasal sprays. Most Arkansas pharmacies sold the product for about $65, though Eudora Drug Store’s pharmacist Clara Rice said the price was up to $250.
Eudora is a town of about 2,000 people in the Arkansas Delta, not far from the Mississippi River. Data shows the town’s median age is 52, and an average household income is about $27,000. Rice described the area as having high crime.
“We don’t want to take any chances with having [naloxone] out front,” Rice said. “Of course, if there were an emergency, it would be easy to get to if that was the case.”
Such is the notion that many rural pharmacies described: If a customer came in and asked for naloxone, they would still be able to buy it.
“It’s a financial thing for me,” said Tyler Staten, manager of Gannaway Drug in Warren, the seat of south Arkansas’ Bradley County. “If nobody’s demanding it — then just like stocking anything else, if you don’t have a demand for it there’s no need to stock it on the shelf. As soon as somebody wants it or needs it, I’m willing to do that. We will do that.”
While theft may play a small factor in Larry Thomerson’s decision to keep the medicine behind the counter at the Gurdon Pharmacy in Arkansas’ south central Clark County, he also wants to talk with his customers beforehand and ensure they know how to use it, he said.
Thomerson, a pharmacist of 50 years, said he doesn’t consider naloxone to carry a stigma, and there are no restrictions on buying naloxone in his shop. “I’ll be glad to sell it to anyone who wants one,” he said.
Cissy Clark, pharmacist and owner of Clarks Family Pharmacy in Earle, also pushed back on the idea that purchasing naloxone is complicated by stigma.
“I live in a really, super small town. I’ve known these people since 1995; raised them from diapers,” Clark said. “I think they’re comfortable enough with me to come in and ask for it.”
She also said that she recommends naloxone to customers who are headed off to college soon in case of any emergencies. 
Earle is located in Crittenden County on the Arkansas-Mississippi border. In 2020, the town had a population of about 1,800. The town takes up about 3.25 square miles, and staff said Clarks Family Pharmacy is the only local provider in town.
Still, Clark said she keeps naloxone behind the counter because of the area’s financial standing.
Financial burden
In Heber Springs, Reed said not many people have asked for naloxone over the counter, but it is included with frequent pain medicine prescriptions. He said that if a medicine could save a life and prescribers have to include it on their opioid scripts, insurances should cover it.
“We often try to tell them it could be somebody who doesn’t know what it is that gets a hold of [pain pills] in your house — could be another family member or grandchild — somebody that accidentally gets a hold of them and takes them,” Reed said. “That way, you would have [naloxone] on hand to hopefully rescue them or prevent an unwanted outcome.”
Mayflower Family Pharmacy owner Michael Thilo tells his Faulkner County customers something similar. Rather than highlight how a customer’s dependency on pain medicine is a physical addiction itself, Thilo said he puts a “soft spin” on naloxone to encourage people to keep the overdose-reversal medicine around.

Thilo said he prompts his clientele to think about what would happen if a child accidentally consumed the pills, which shifts the focus away from the person using the pain medicine.
“I definitely think there’s a stigma,” Thilo said. “I think most people see it as, ‘I don’t need that because I don’t have that problem,’ whether they realize they do have the problem or not. I think most people that have been on opioids long term just need it for day-to-day, but they don’t realize they’re addicted to it.”
Thilo said he hasn’t had anyone ask for naloxone over the counter, and affordability may be another barrier.
Of the most common insurance providers — including Medicare for whom Thilo considers the most vulnerable population — about half won’t cover the medicine, he said. He estimated that one customer out of every 10 who receive an opioid prescription at his pharmacy will pick up naloxone because of the copay expense.
“I think all insurances should be required to cover it for no cost,” Thilo said. “If we’re worried about it as a population, as a society, then I think we should take it seriously and remove the financial burden.”
Heath Branscrum, a pharmacist and part owner of Health-Wise Pharmacy in the small Washington County town of Lavaca, shared similar sentiments about his patients not jumping to pay the cost of the preventative medicine.
“One of the barriers to people gaining access to Narcan is the fact that their insurance is not covering, particularly Medicare-affiliated insurances, the over-the-counter version of Narcan,” Branscrum said. “…There’s a large number of people out there that are supposed to have Narcan available to them, but they don’t get it because it’s going to cost them $50.”
Other resources
Purchasing naloxone at a pharmacy isn’t the only way residents living in rural Arkansas can access resources to stop the opioid epidemic. 
River Valley Medical Wellness, a primary care provider with offices in Russellville and Hot Springs, in 2023 launched the Arkansas Mobile Opioid Recovery (ARMOR) nonprofit, which sends mobile health units with critical substance use care to rural pockets in the state.
Attorney General Tim Griffin funded the first mobile health unit with a $777,000 grant from the state’s opioid settlement funds. After seeing some success, the Arkansas Department of Human Services provided the same funding amount for a second mobile unit. Tucker Martin, chief operating officer at River Valley Medical Wellness and co-founder of ARMOR, said the goal is to have five mobile health units that provide services in each corner of the state and in the Little Rock metro area.
According to results from a twice yearly River Valley Medical Wellness social determinants of health survey, Martin said patients consistently list transportation to care at the top of the list.

“They’re making a decision about whether they’re going to buy food to put on the table for their family, or they’re going to put gas in their car, travel 38 miles or whatever it is, to go to the doctor,” Martin said. “That’s the kind of decision that these people are facing, so that birthed the idea of, ‘Let’s create an environment where we can take health care directly to communities.’”
April 14 marked the one-year anniversary of ARMOR’s mobile health unit launch, and Tucker said 1,785 patients in a handful of towns were treated during that time. Each of the meetings are “very meticulously scheduled” and coincide with a providing service already in the community, such as a local church, he said.
More than 1,200 free naloxone kits were distributed to the community in the last year, according to an impact report from ARMOR.
“My deep, deep desire is to give the same thing that was given to me, which is access to a little bit of hope,” said Martin, who celebrated nine years of continuous sobriety in October. 
At the state level, Griffin also has distributed a portion of opioid settlement funds to a variety of organizations focused on providing help to those with opioid addiction. Griffin recently launched a pilot program for the state’s specialty courts system and helped fund opioid research at Arkansas Children’s Hospital.
The Arkansas Opioid Recovery Partnership funds projects in all 75 counties that aim to abate the opioid epidemic. While Lane said ARORP doesn’t allow applications for naloxone kits from individuals, the organization works to provide funding for local entities that can distribute the resource in the community.
ARORP’s Naloxone Hero Project distributed more than 100,000 dosage units statewide, the majority of which went to local organizations. Recently, ARORP started distributing units to law enforcement agencies, first responders and fire departments.
The ReviveAR mobile app also teaches residents how to use naloxone, where they can access it locally and how to provide support for family and friends. The app provides step-by-step opioid reversal instructions in English, Spanish and Marshallese.
“I think in every ability where there’s any possibility of somebody overdosing … [naloxone] ought to be considered as a resource to reverse an overdose,” Lane said.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)The Tennessee Attorney General’s Office could soon have the responsibility for investigating claims of discrimination by state agencies after the state Senate passed a measure dissolving the Human Rights Commission and moving operations to the AG’s office. 
Senate Bill 861, sponsored by Huntingdon Republican Sen. John Stevens, passed Monday 27-6 on partisan lines. The House version, sponsored by Goodletsville Republican Rep. Johnny Garrett, passed Thursday. The bill would go next to the governor’s desk for his signature.
The 60-year-old commission is a nonpartisan and independent agency responsible for enforcing civil rights laws in employment, housing and public accommodation as well as discrimination claims against the state of Tennessee.  
Bill to give Tennessee AG civil rights oversight draws Democratic pushback over partisanship

The measure has drawn criticism from Democrats who say handing discrimination claims to Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti sets up a “fox in the henhouse” scenario. 
After Stevens referred to Skrmetti’s office as “the most nonpartisan” of Tennessee’s three branches of government, Sen. Raumesh Akbari, a Memphis Democrat, disagreed. 
“I’m not going to make it personal, but if you’ve never been discriminated against . . . it makes a difference who is investigating,” Akbari said. “I would urge you to google the last few suits the attorney general has filed and I assure you their actions do not look nonpartisan.”
Skrmetti has led or joined lawsuits that include a challenge to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s rule prohibiting discrimination against women seeking abortions, litigation seeking to stop transgender medical care for minors and sent letters to corporations warning them against diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, among other actions.
Tennessee Attorney General’s Office to election finance office: We’re “not an investigative agency”

Stevens said his review of the commission showed that thousands of claims have “languished” and not been investigated.
Democrats objected to that characterization.
“HRC testified to the fact they have several vacancies on their commission and it’s because the House Speaker has refused the fill the vacancies since 2022,” said Sen. Charlane Oliver, a Nashville Democrat.
“We have crippled the ability of the HRC to do their job,” she said. “That may be the reason they can’t respond to complaints.” 
Sen. Kerry Roberts, a Springfield Republican, described the commission as “enormously ineffective” before calling for a vote.
Under the measure, the commission will be dissolved by July 1 and its 30 staff positions will move to the attorney general’s office.

Tariffs meant to encourage U.S. manufacturing could have the opposite effect because many materials are imported from China. (Courtesy of Sumuri LLC)Steve Whalen loves his home state of Delaware and he’s proud to manufacture computers there that police officers use to “catch bad guys.” He said tariffs on imports from China and other countries, along with sharp cuts to government spending and the winding down of a program for small manufacturers, will make it harder for him to do that.
“We got into business to keep costs low for the ‘good guys,’ but tariffs or anything else that raises prices keeps us from doing that,” said Whalen, co-founder of Sumuri LLC in Magnolia, Delaware, which makes computer workstations for police and government investigations. Whalen has to buy materials overseas, often from China, and he said the tariffs could force him to triple his price on some workstations to $12,000.
Tariffs are the main tool President Donald Trump is wielding to try to boost manufacturing in the United States, calling the achievement of that goal “an economic and national security priority.” But the higher levies have led to retaliation and suspended shipments, and Whalen said they are just one of several Trump administration actions squeezing his small manufacturing business.
The wave of federal spending cuts, which has affected grants to state and local governments, could make his customers put off purchases. And the administration has moved to cut off funding for a $175 million state-based program that provides expert advice to smaller factories like his.
The Delaware version of that program, the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, helped Sumuri fit expanded product lines into the limited space in its small-town factory.
“We were really having a tough time trying to figure out how to utilize our space efficiently,” Whalen said. “They came here and helped us organize and optimize, and it made a huge difference.”
On April 1, the Trump administration cut off funding for 10 such manufacturing programs that were up for renewal in Delaware, Hawaii, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota and Wyoming. Other state MEP programs will expire over the next year.
The administration gave a reprieve to those 10 states until the end of the fiscal year after objections from Democrats in the U.S. House and Senate. The National Institute of Standards and Technology, which manages the program, extended funding for the 10 states “after further review and consideration” and will “continue to evaluate plans for the program,” said agency spokesperson Chad Boutin.
The program has come under fire from Republicans since the George W. Bush administration first tried to end it in 2009, and again during the first Trump administration, but Congress has continued to fund it. The conservative Heritage Foundation said in a 2023 book that MEP’s functions “would be more properly carried out by the private sector.”
 ‘Dots don’t quite connect’

Buckley Brinkman, executive director of the Wisconsin Center for Manufacturing and Productivity, which works with his state’s MEP program, said it didn’t make much sense for the administration to shutter the program as it seeks to boost the number of U.S. manufacturing jobs.
“It’s one of those things where the dots don’t quite connect,” Brinkman said. “I mean, jeez, here’s a part of government that doesn’t cost a whole lot, in the grand scheme of things — less than $200 million a year — that’s returning 10-to-1 to the national treasury, working on a priority for the president.”
A 2024 Upjohn report found an even higher return: 17-to-1 on $175 million in the 2023 fiscal year, creating $3 billion in new federal tax revenue.

In Wisconsin, which has lost more than 138,000 manufacturing jobs since 2000, some parts makers report that business is booming as manufacturers seek to avoid tariffs by finding U.S. alternatives to Chinese manufacturers, Brinkman said. But more broadly, he doubts that the tariffs will spark a manufacturing boom in the state.
“Do we want all this manufacturing back? Do we have the will to get it back? The answer to both those questions is ‘no,’” Brinkman said. “Even without the tariffs we don’t really want Americans doing a lot of those jobs that are in Chinese factories right now.”













I mean, jeez, here’s a part of government that doesn't cost a whole lot, in the grand scheme of things … that's returning 10-to-1 to the national treasury.


– Buckley Brinkman, director of Wisconsin Center for Manufacturing and Productivity





In Delaware, the MEP helped Sumuri manage its expansion, but unpredictable tariffs and budgets are now a bigger danger, said Jason Roslewicz, Sumuri’s vice president of business development. He’s had to devote two employees to monitoring supply lines, tariff news and competitor pricing to stay afloat.
“We went from putting things together in a basement to a 19,000-square-foot facility, doing exactly what we’re supposed to do here in the U.S., and it’s all in danger of coming apart because of this problem,” Roslewicz said.
Other small manufacturers express similar concerns. TJ Semanchin, who owns Wonderstate Coffee in Madison, Wisconsin, said his business roasting and distributing coffee is in crisis because of the tariffs.
Wonderstate’s costs have almost doubled between tariffs on imported coffee and packaging materials from China, plus a cyclical rise in coffee prices. “I’m borrowing money to pay for this and at some point we’ll have to raise prices. We’ll have no choice,” Semanchin said.

But many Republican state officials, and even some Democrats, have backed Trump’s tariff push, including Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who credited the Trump administration with “reshoring manufacturing and restoring this middle class which has been eviscerated over the last 20 years.”
“There’s dislocation in the short term, there’s long-term opportunity,” Youngkin said in an April 15 interview on CNBC. He said his state is hearing more interest from manufacturers looking to build or expand local factories since Trump took office. For instance, Delta Star recently announced a plan to add 300 jobs building power transformers in Lynchburg.
“The president has been clear that there will be some level of tariffs, and folks are coming, and that’s good for Virginia,” Youngkin said in the CNBC interview.
Virginia’s MEP program, called Genedge, claims successes in streamlining production and quality control for local factory products including TreeDiaper, an automated tree watering device made in Ashland, and for advising EDM, a Lynchburg plastic product assembler that needed more efficient production to keep overseas competition at bay. But Virginia’s MEP is one of the state programs slated to expire in the next year.
 Long-term trend

The slide in U.S. manufacturing jobs has continued on and off since 1979, and many experts say tariffs will not bring them back. Despite a modest bounce back under the Biden administration, the number of manufacturing jobs has declined from nearly 20 million in 1979 to less than 13 million today, even as the total U.S. workforce has grown from 89 million to 159 million during that period.
Manufacturing faces labor shortages, with many factories operating below capacity because they can’t find enough workers, according to Jason Miller, a professor of supply chain management at Michigan State University.
That doesn’t bode well for a mass reshoring of factories from China and other countries, but Miller doesn’t expect that to happen anyway.
“Firms are not planning on reshoring much of the work that was offshored 20 to 25 years ago,” Miller said. “I’m not concerned about having enough workers for manufacturing jobs that would be reshored because this isn’t going to happen.”
In a 2024 survey by the libertarian Cato Institute, 80% of Americans said America would be better off if more people worked in manufacturing, but only 25% said they personally would be better off working in a factory. The Chinese government has poked fun at the idea with memes of American workers struggling to make Nike sneakers with sewing machines.
Joseph McCartin, a labor historian at Georgetown University, said the idea of a manufacturing rebirth is a “mirage being conjured to attract the support of workers who have been underpaid in an increasingly unequal economy for the last 40 years, and are desperate for some hope of renewed upward mobility.”
Manufacturing “isn’t the magic wand to make that happen,” McCartin said.
“What we need is to raise workers’ wages and make the economy less prone to producing inequality,” McCartin said. “That mission is not at all what Trump is about. He is dealing in stale nostalgia.”

(File/Mary Ann Chastain/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — The state’s poor and rural districts stand to lose the most from a budget with no earmarks, some legislators said, while others celebrated a pause on spending long criticized for its lack of transparency.
When the Senate Finance Committee advanced its spending plan for the coming fiscal year, Chairman Harvey Peeler made a stunning announcement: The budget will not include any earmarks — in other words, no spending requested by legislators to fund projects in their districts.
The decision comes two years after total earmarks — what legislators have consistently called “community investments” — soared to $713 million. While last year’s tally was smaller, at $435 million, critics said the process still allowed unvetted spending of taxpayer dollars.
Churches, charities with little track record among nonprofits in line for $90M in SC budget

Peeler, the Senate’s chief budget writer since 2022, made clear the tally this year will be zero.
“No more pet projects equals more money in your pockets,” the Gaffney Republican said in a statement April 9.
Two hours later, a joint statement went out from Peeler and House Ways and Means Chairman Bruce Bannister agreeing to focus this year on “tax reform.” (Typically, the House adds earmarks after the Senate passes its budget plan.)
Exactly what that means remains to be seen.
The House Ways and Means Committee meets Tuesday to take “expert testimony” on options for changing the tax structure. The meeting comes three weeks after a fiscal analysis showed a House GOP proposal would result in most tax filers paying more in state income taxes initially, resulting in Republicans putting the skids on their own bill.
The agenda clearly states, in bold and underlined, the committee will take “no vote” Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the full Senate will open floor debate Tuesday on its spending package. It includes a revenue reduction of $290.5 million to complete the Legislature’s 2022 tax-cutting law, which phased in a reduction in income tax rates, a year ahead of schedule. The budget passed by the House in March planned to do at least that.
Legislators’ response to no earmarks
Peeler’s announcement surprised even legislators, including many who had already submitted the paperwork laying out their earmark requests. Poor, rural communities in particular will have to forgo improvements and new equipment they can’t afford without help, legislators representing those areas said.
That includes projects already underway that local governments need funding to complete, said House Assistant Minority Leader Roger Kirby.
“It is not conservative to waste money on restarting projects, and that’s what we’re going to have to do,” the Lake City Democrat said.
In Williamsburg County, one of the poorest in the state, Kirby had asked for money to expand the water system, with the hopes of attracting bigger businesses to the area.
Williamsburg County doesn’t have the tax revenue to afford finishing the project. But without the expansion, the county won’t be able to attract more economic development, Kirby said.
SC lawmakers set to spend over $430 million on local projects

That project and similar ones “are not going to happen on their own,” Kirby said. “They’re just not.”
Rural water system improvements were also among requests made by freshman Sen. Russell Ott.
Ott asked for new water meters in Swansea, as well as improvements to water and sewer systems in Calhoun County and the stormwater system in Cayce. Those systems are in dire need of upgrades that the cities and counties can’t afford, he said.
“Folks from my district need help, real help,” said the St. Matthews Democrat, who was the House’s assistant minority leader before Kirby.
Without extra money, cities in Marlboro County will continue driving firetrucks from the 1980s, said Sen. JD Chaplin, a Darlington Republican. The sheriff’s department in Lee County will remain unable to fix its broken air conditioning unit. And law enforcement officers across the five counties Chaplin represents will continue using unreliable radios, he said.
Chaplin, a freshman legislator, said he was disappointed to learn he wouldn’t get to fund those projects. When he was running for office, he promised to better fund law enforcement and infrastructure in his area, which those earmarks could have done, he said.
“It’s going to continue another year with patches and Band-Aids and not actually fixing the problems we have in South Carolina,” Chaplin said.
That’s not to say Chaplin opposes a tax cut, which was another of his campaign platforms, he added.
Chaplin and Ott, who also said he’d support a tax cut, questioned why legislators couldn’t figure out a way to do both.
Relying on state money that may or may not come through on a given year has always been a bad idea, said Sen. Greg Hembree. Each year, the Little River Republican suggests to representatives of the local governments and nonprofits that come to him for funding to think of whatever they get as a gift: nice to have but not necessary to keep running, he said.
Depending on earmarks is “a risky place to live,” he said.
Last year, at Hembree’s request, North Myrtle Beach received $1.5 million to dredge sediment and debris from Cherry Grove Beach, and Sea Haven Youth Crisis Center got $65,000 to screen youth for medical and dental issues, according to budget documents.
While Hembree would have liked to continue funding those causes this year, they won’t end without it, he said.
“Nobody’s closing their doors because the money isn’t coming in,” Hembree said.
Although earmarks are one-time spending, legislators have long used repeated requests to fund expensive projects in their districts or give annual allocations to nonprofits, amounting in some cases to millions of dollars over the course of several years.
Spending on earmarks ballooned after the COVID-19 pandemic, when the state’s budget was flush with federal assistance and sales tax collections spiked as South Carolinians spent their own federal relief payments. The budget passed in 2022 contained about $390 million in earmarks, after the Legislature upheld Gov. Henry McMaster’s vetoes that struck $33 million worth, before hitting a record high $713 million in 2023.
After such high amounts, taking a year off could help legislators take a step back and consider how they’re spending that money, Hembree said.
“It’ll be kind of healthy,” Hembree said.
Past and future budgets
If the budget continues without earmarks in coming years, Hembree said he feared a return to secretive spending slipped into the budget with little-to-no oversight. For years, earmark spending was rolled together in vaguely worded line items in agencies’ budgets that gave no clue as to where the money was going.
That practice ended in 2021, when legislators began listing earmarks and who sponsored them. In 2023, for the first time, legislators began giving the governor’s office paperwork explaining their requests before sending him their final spending plan.
But eliminating earmarks won’t eliminate requests for money, and the pressure will be on for legislators to fulfill them somehow, Hembree said.
“I fear (the process) could revert back to what it was,” Hembree said.
Legislators might consider creating a grant program, as McMaster has advocated for years. Under his proposal, local governments and nonprofits could apply for a chunk of money for agencies to dole out.
Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey celebrated even a brief end to a process he has criticized for years over a lack of transparency.
“Hallelujah,” said the Edgefield Republican, who was part of a bipartisan duo that successfully pushed for the secrecy to end.
Even after the changes in recent years, Massey has questioned the process and called for reviews on the back end, to be sure nonprofits were spending the money the way they said they would.
“Ultimately, I think we have to make a decision,” Massey said. “Should we collect more money than we need and then dole it out in this process that really has little vetting? Or should we just not take any more money from taxpayers than we need?”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_5092-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-22 06:05:35.308034

(Courtesy of Sumuri LLC)Steve Whalen loves his home state of Delaware and he’s proud to manufacture computers there that police officers use to “catch bad guys.” He said tariffs on imports from China and other countries, along with sharp cuts to government spending and the winding down of a program for small manufacturers, will make it harder for him to do that.
“We got into business to keep costs low for the ‘good guys,’ but tariffs or anything else that raises prices keeps us from doing that,” said Whalen, co-founder of Sumuri LLC in Magnolia, Delaware, which makes computer workstations for police and government investigations. Whalen has to buy materials overseas, often from China, and he said the tariffs could force him to triple his price on some workstations to $12,000.
Tariffs are the main tool President Donald Trump is wielding to try to boost manufacturing in the United States, calling the achievement of that goal “an economic and national security priority.” But the higher levies have led to retaliation and suspended shipments, and Whalen said they are just one of several Trump administration actions squeezing his small manufacturing business.
The wave of federal spending cuts, which has affected grants to state and local governments, could make Whelan’s customers put off purchases. And the administration has moved to cut off funding for a $175 million state-based program that provides expert advice to smaller factories like his.

The Delaware version of that program, the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, helped Sumuri fit expanded product lines into the limited space in its small-town factory.
“We were really having a tough time trying to figure out how to utilize our space efficiently,” Whalen said. “They came here and helped us organize and optimize, and it made a huge difference.”
On April 1, the Trump administration cut off funding for 10 such manufacturing programs that were up for renewal in Delaware, Hawaii, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota and Wyoming. Other state MEP programs will expire over the next year.
The administration gave a reprieve to those 10 states until the end of the fiscal year after objections from Democrats in the U.S. House and Senate. The National Institute of Standards and Technology, which manages the program, extended funding for the 10 states “after further review and consideration” and will “continue to evaluate plans for the program,” said agency spokesperson Chad Boutin.
The program has come under fire from Republicans since the George W. Bush administration first tried to end it in 2009, and again during the first Trump administration, but Congress has continued to fund it. The conservative Heritage Foundation said in a 2023 book that MEP’s functions “would be more properly carried out by the private sector.”
 ‘Dots don’t quite connect’

Buckley Brinkman, executive director of the Wisconsin Center for Manufacturing and Productivity, which works with his state’s MEP program, said it didn’t make much sense for the administration to shutter the program as it seeks to boost the number of U.S. manufacturing jobs.
“It’s one of those things where the dots don’t quite connect,” Brinkman said. “I mean, jeez, here’s a part of government that doesn’t cost a whole lot, in the grand scheme of things — less than $200 million a year — that’s returning 10-to-1 to the national treasury, working on a priority for the president.”
A 2024 Upjohn report found an even higher return: 17-to-1 on $175 million in the 2023 fiscal year, creating $3 billion in new federal tax revenue.

 
In Wisconsin, which has lost more than 138,000 manufacturing jobs since 2000, some parts makers report that business is booming as manufacturers seek to avoid tariffs by finding U.S. alternatives to Chinese manufacturers, Brinkman said. But more broadly, he doubts that the tariffs will spark a manufacturing boom in the state.
“Do we want all this manufacturing back? Do we have the will to get it back? The answer to both those questions is ‘no,’” Brinkman said. “Even without the tariffs, we don’t really want Americans doing a lot of those jobs that are in Chinese factories right now.”










I mean, jeez, here’s a part of government that doesn't cost a whole lot, in the grand scheme of things … that's returning 10-to-1 to the national treasury.


– Buckley Brinkman, director, Wisconsin Center for Manufacturing and Productivity


In Delaware, the MEP helped Sumuri manage its expansion, but unpredictable tariffs and budgets are now a bigger danger, said Jason Roslewicz, Sumuri’s vice president of business development. He’s had to devote two employees to monitoring supply lines, tariff news and competitor pricing to stay afloat.



“We went from putting things together in a basement to a 19,000-square-foot facility, doing exactly what we’re supposed to do here in the U.S., and it’s all in danger of coming apart because of this problem,” Roslewicz said.
Other small manufacturers express similar concerns. TJ Semanchin, who owns Wonderstate Coffee in Madison, Wisconsin, said his business roasting and distributing coffee is in crisis because of the tariffs.
Wonderstate’s costs have almost doubled between tariffs on imported coffee and packaging materials from China, plus a cyclical rise in coffee prices. “I’m borrowing money to pay for this and at some point we’ll have to raise prices. We’ll have no choice,” Semanchin said.

But many Republican state officials, and even some Democrats, have backed Trump’s tariff push, including Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who credited the Trump administration with “reshoring manufacturing and restoring this middle class which has been eviscerated over the last 20 years.”
“There’s dislocation in the short term, there’s long-term opportunity,” Youngkin said in an April 15 interview on CNBC. He said his state is hearing more interest from manufacturers looking to build or expand local factories since Trump took office. For instance, Delta Star recently announced a plan to add 300 jobs building power transformers in Lynchburg.
“The president has been clear that there will be some level of tariffs, and folks are coming, and that’s good for Virginia,” Youngkin said in the CNBC interview.
Virginia’s MEP program, called Genedge, claims successes in streamlining production and quality control for local factory products including TreeDiaper, an automated tree watering device made in Ashland, and for advising EDM, a Lynchburg plastic product assembler that needed more efficient production to keep overseas competition at bay. But Virginia’s MEP is one of the state programs slated to expire in the next year.
 Long-term trend

The slide in U.S. manufacturing jobs has continued on and off since 1979, and many experts say tariffs will not bring them back. Despite a modest bounce back under the Biden administration, the number of manufacturing jobs has declined from nearly 20 million in 1979 to less than 13 million today, even as the total U.S. workforce has grown from 89 million to 159 million during that period.

Manufacturing faces labor shortages, with many factories operating below capacity because they can’t find enough workers, according to Jason Miller, a professor of supply chain management at Michigan State University.
That doesn’t bode well for a mass reshoring of factories from China and other countries, but Miller doesn’t expect that to happen anyway.
“Firms are not planning on reshoring much of the work that was offshored 20 to 25 years ago,” Miller said. “I’m not concerned about having enough workers for manufacturing jobs that would be reshored because this isn’t going to happen.”
In a 2024 survey by the libertarian Cato Institute, 80% of Americans said America would be better off if more people worked in manufacturing, but only 25% said they personally would be better off working in a factory. The Chinese government has poked fun at the idea with memes of American workers struggling to make Nike sneakers with sewing machines.
Joseph McCartin, a labor historian at Georgetown University, said the idea of a manufacturing rebirth is a “mirage being conjured to attract the support of workers who have been underpaid in an increasingly unequal economy for the last 40 years, and are desperate for some hope of renewed upward mobility.”
Manufacturing “isn’t the magic wand to make that happen,” McCartin said.
“What we need is to raise workers’ wages and make the economy less prone to producing inequality,” McCartin said. “That mission is not at all what Trump is about. He is dealing in stale nostalgia.”

(Courtesy of EcoFlight)Last month, Lee Zeldin, the new head of the Environmental Protection Agency, announced a plan to revoke the 2009 greenhouse gas endangerment finding, the key scientific determination that allows the EPA to regulate climate pollution under the Clean Air Act.
One of the basic functions of good government is to provide reliable information that can then inform policy that is in the public interest. At a time when the federal government is subverting basic truths about climate impacts, it is imperative that local- and state-level policymakers highlight dangers to people and the planet.
Colorado House Bill 25-1277, “Increasing Transparency Impact of Fuel Products,” seeks to achieve this goal by requiring fossil fuel retailers to place a warning label on gas pumps and in other locations where fossil fuels are sold.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
If passed, HB-1277 would require retailers to affix a warning sticker with the following text:

WARNING: Use of this product releases air pollutants and greenhouse gases, known by the state of Colorado to be linked to significant health impacts and global heating, respectively, pursuant to section 25-5-1603, C.R.S. Tampering with this label is a violation of section 18-4-510, C.R.S.

In light of a multi-front assault on science in general and on climate data in particular, policies that inform the public about basic health and safety measures — think tobacco and alcohol warnings — are an important intervention. Furthermore, the legislation will not cost taxpayers money and represents a relatively small burden on retailers, who will have a 45-day opportunity to correct missing or illegible labels before any enforcement actions are begun.
The stakes could not be higher. A 2018 special report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found that in order to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the level required to avoid the worst outcomes, we would need to reduce emissions by 45% by 2030 and achieve net zero by 2050. Even limiting warming to 2 degrees Celsius requires 25% emissions reductions by 2030 and 100% by 2075.
Every additional fraction of a degree of heating exponentially increases risk to a stable climate and to the social and biological systems upon which we all rely. Here in Colorado, oil and gas production along with transportation are the top two sources of ozone pollution. Ozone is particularly dangerous for children and is linked to a range of health problems including asthma, metabolic disorders and cardiovascular disease.
Sadly, instead of playing a leading role in coordination efforts across sectors and borders that might give us a fighting chance to avoid climate catastrophe, the current federal administration is leading a fossil fuel cult devoted to short-term profit at the expense of a livable future. This involves denying basic truths about how fossil fuels harm our health and planet. The warnings required by HB-1277 can serve as a state-level counterbalance to this disinformation campaign.
My parents grew up at a time when clouds of smog hung over our cities and our rivers were flammable. I grew up at a time when public places were filled with cigarette smoke and there was a dangerous hole in the ozone layer. These hard-fought public health success stories demonstrate that science-based interventions that improve our health and wellness are possible.
No amount of governmental obfuscation can undo the inconvenient truth that climate impacts are here and now. At a time when climate progress and public health are at risk, states and municipalities must step into the breach to keep the public informed.

But 15 years of budget cutting have left the state far from prosperous. (Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)Several important policy priorities have defined conservative Republican governance of North Carolina during the last 15 years – the culture wars, the effort to make elections more partisan and voting more difficult, the explosion of private school vouchers. But if there is a single phenomenon that has stood out above all others, it has been the relentless crusade to defund core public structures and services.
Thanks to an ongoing series of regressive tax cuts, the falloff in what North Carolina invests in state government as a share of total state income – by far the best indicator of overall capacity and effort – has been precipitous. In 2024, for instance, the state General Fund budget was around 21% lower by this measure than it was in 2009. In previous years, the gap exceeded 30%. All told, North Carolina has disinvested in government to the tune of tens of billions of dollars over past decade-and-a-half.
For those who might still harbor any doubts as to why so many of a fast-growing state’s public school classrooms, DMV offices and correctional and mental health facilities lack adequate numbers of fully trained and qualified personnel, look no further than these dollar figures, and the low employee pay and poor benefits to which they have given rise.
Weirdly, however, despite the obvious cause-and-effect nature of this situation, conservative politicians have clung to a strange brand of denial over the years that, in turn, has helped spur a kind of vicious downward cycle.
Here’s how it has worked:
When GOP lawmakers assumed control of the General Assembly in 2011, the watchword was attacking “government bureaucracy.” Spurred on by people like national right-wing activist Grover Norquist, who infamously and gruesomely bragged that his mission was to shrink government down to the size “where I can drag it into the bathroom and drown it in the bathtub,” conservative pols made attacking state employment in Raleigh a top priority.
Department of Public Instruction employees – the people charged with the unenviable task of monitoring and assisting 115 school districts as they employed tens of thousands of educators and educated over a million children – were regularly dismissed as useless functionaries, authors of burdensome “unfunded mandates,” and inhabitants of the “pink palace” (a derisive reference to the Department of Public Instruction office building that was located just north of the Legislative Building).
And so it was that the General Assembly enacted big tax and spending cuts in response – some over the objection of Democratic governors, and for four years, with the aid of a Republican chief executive.
The result, unsurprisingly, was that core services like schools, mental health, transportation, public safety, and environmental permitting – plagued by funding cuts and staff reductions — all struggled mightily to keep up with rising demands of what remained a fast-growing population.
And it wasn’t long before the falloff in services produced scads of constituent complaints. Frustrated by things like teacher shortages, massive waits from services for people with developmental disabilities and basics as simple as driver’s license renewals and construction permits, North Carolinians spoke out and made their unhappiness known. It continues to this day.
Here, however, is the wrinkle that’s especially maddening.
Rather than responding to the complaints about inadequate services by restoring funding and at least placing a hold on more tax cuts, the same politicians who imposed the big cuts initially joined the chorus of complaints. Instead of acknowledging how their policies had demoralized and overwhelmed the state employees who remained, GOP lawmakers decried the decline in services, made a regular show of interrogating agency heads, and advanced two new solutions: privatizing public services and lowering standards
Indeed, both of these “solutions” are being advanced this year as GOP lawmakers promote ideas like increasing caps on public school class sizes, privatizing DMV services, allowing driver’s licenses to be renewed less frequently, doing away with environmental reviews of new developments near waterways, and lowering building code standards — ostensibly to promote Hurricane Helene recovery.
And, of course, the final step in this whole destructive cycle comes when, claiming to be motivated to improve quote “efficiency,” the same politicians advance legislation to start the whole process over again by pursuing still more tax cuts and threatening more state agency job cuts. See, for instance, the new state Senate budget proposal and the so-called DAVE Act bill that would empower state Auditor Dave Boliek to act as a kind mini-Elon Musk.
Taken together, it’s enough to make a body think that Norquist’s morbid fantasy may just have been the plan all along.
The bottom line: slashing funding for basic public services for the purpose of improving outcomes makes no more sense that draining blood from an anemic patient or forgoing the basic upkeep of one’s car or home. And right now, it’s long past time for our state to break this vicious and destructive cycle.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Seal-in-Senate-Chambers-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-22 06:05:35.308034

(Courtesy of the Virginia Department of Transportation)Certain Virginia bridges and tunnels could be repaired or replaced ahead of schedule, saving citizens years of waiting to use the structures, thanks to a law that will take effect this summer that stems from a bipartisan effort in this year’s General Assembly approved by the governor.
Lawmakers and Gov. Glenn Youngkin passed an administrative proposal allowing the state to expedite projects considered under Virginia’s Special Structures Program by issuing revenue bonds up to $200 million a year, and up to $1 billion total. Issuance will begin in 2028.
The Commonwealth Special Structures Program stems from a 2020 measure that allocates $80 million annually to cover “special structures,” identified by the Commissioner of Highways and approved by the Commonwealth Transportation Board (CTB) as very “large, indispensable, and unique bridges and tunnels.”
Virginia Secretary of Transportation Shep Miller said at an April 15 CTB meeting that bonding the program funds can help projects move much faster.
“This is a great financial decision for the commonwealth,” Miller said. “Not only do we get to use cheaper money as opposed to more expensive money, but we also get the benefits of all these programs many, many years earlier.”
Ahead of the last General Assembly session, the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) asked lawmakers to consider the bill, framing it as a way to help avoid future inflationary costs on the state’s structure improvements and replacements. 
According to the agency, VDOT has experienced 24% in cost escalation over the last three fiscal years in its construction program.
Laura Farmer, chief financial officer for VDOT, said in a recent April 15 presentation to the Commonwealth Transportation Board that “though the current funding revenue stream for special structures is reliable, it is not sufficient to set aside money over many years to take care of replacement projects.”
Senate Minority Leader Ryan McDougle, R-Hanover, carried the successful legislation, which Youngkin signed March 21. It will take effect July 1.
 Norris Bridge and more to come

With VDOT’s ability to bond funds in the special structures program, the agency has already moved forward with its planning to replace the Robert O. Norris Bridge, which connects the Northern Neck and Middle Peninsula, eight years ahead of schedule.
The 1.9-mile, 67-year-old bridge is located over the Rappahannock River, between Lancaster and Middlesex counties. If the bridge were closed for any reason, an average of 7,560 vehicles would have to take a detour route totaling 85 miles.
The agency said the vertical clearance in the channel span for marine traffic is 110 feet. 
According to the governor’s office, the new bridge will have “substantially” wider travel lanes, fully functional shoulders and significantly higher guardrails.

“It is time to build a modern bridge that will serve the communities of the Northern Neck and Middle Peninsula for the next 100 years,” Youngkin said in an April 15 statement. “Today we are accelerating construction of a new Norris Bridge to meet the daily travel needs of residents and businesses, and to welcome visitors to these scenic waterfront regions.Through this action, people will be driving over the new bridge almost a decade sooner than expected.” 
Stephen C. Brich, commissioner of highways for VDOT, said last week that staff has identified a collection of special structure projects for potential advancement, but did not specifically name any.
However, the Mercury was able to identify some of the upcoming special structure projects, according to a recent resolution passed by the board, including: the Big Walker Mountain Tunnel in the Bristol District; a SMART Road in Salem; the Benjamin Harrison Bridge in Richmond; the Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel; and the Rosslyn Tunnel in Northern Virginia.
“This isn’t just about the Norris bridge,” Miller said. “This is just the beginning. It impacts everything in the schedule because now we’ve got money in front. So it’s really a great win for the commonwealth.”

RICHMOND, Va. – Vickie Connors, assistant professor at the Center of Environmental Studies at Virginia Commonwealth University, owns a small farm a little over 40 miles from campus.
Two farmers maintain the 20-acre property, and like many in Virginia, they rely on long-range forecasts to decide what crops to grow.
Many Virginia farmers use the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, to guide their agricultural operations. However, cuts to the federal workforce under President Donald Trump have begun to affect NOAA’s employees, and there is concern that its ability to provide weather forecasts will be impacted.
Agriculture is the biggest private industry in Virginia, with an economic impact of $82.3 billion and over 381,800 jobs in 2021, according to the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services and a study by the University of Virginia.
 NOAA’s impact on agriculture

NOAA is a science agency that focuses on weather forecasting, monitoring the oceanic and atmospheric conditions, studying climate change and sharing its information.
“NOAA has responsibility in the area of our atmosphere and our oceans to keep up with what’s happening in those environments and also to provide warnings if something serious might happen,” Connors said.
The agency provides weather and climate information to farmers so they can make decisions on their crops and livestock. This includes drought and nitrogen management, according to NOAA.
The forecasted intensity of rainfall makes a big difference for farming communities when they plan resource management, according to Connors. This includes livestock operations if farmers are growing grain to feed their animals through the winter.
“It’s really hard to think about anyone who doesn’t take advantage at some level the work and the data that NOAA provides,” Connors said.
NOAA also alerts when inclement weather is approaching, according to the National Weather Service.
 Federal cuts begin to disrupt NOAA’s workforce

Approximately 650 employees from NOAA were fired on Feb. 27, according to Rick Spinrad, a former NOAA administrator, who spoke at a press conference the next day. The mass layoffs are part of a broader workforce reduction under the Department of Government Efficiency, a new agency created by the Trump administration to tackle government bloat.
The number of layoffs may have increased since, according to multiple reports, although it is difficult to track the exact number. NOAA is seated within the Department of Commerce and in September 2024 had a reported 12,430 total employees, according to a congressional report.
 Confusion and concern among weather experts

There’s a large amount of uncertainty with the layoffs, according to Sean Sublette, a Virginia meteorologist whose forecasts have been found on air, in print and online.
“It’s hard to know precisely who has been laid off because some people are laid off and then they’ve been called back and then laid off again,” Sublette said.
His friend in Washington was laid off, rehired and then let go again. Another friend in Maryland was laid off from NOAA, but was recently called back to return. The unpredictability of these layoffs leaves employees unsure of what they are supposed to do, according to Sublette.
“These are all government workers, these are people whose career in public service protecting life and property, which is what NOAA’s mission has always been,” Sublette said.
 Balloon launches cut, budget slashed further

Sublette’s main concern is for the three primary National Weather Service offices in Virginia, where radars monitor for damaging weather, tornadoes and thunderstorms. People in the Blacksburg, Dulles and Wakefield offices are worried about staff being laid off.
“If the weather’s especially volatile, and you need to bring in extra staff to handle it,” Sublette said. “Are they not available anymore?”
Sublette also expressed concern about potential cuts to the National Environmental Satellite Data and Information Service, a primary receiving station for satellite information.
“Those classical satellite pictures that you get on your phone or you see on TV,” Sublette explained. “So if people, they’re laid off, does that put that equipment and that information at risk?”
NOAA’s data collection capabilities have already been hit. The NWS announced on March 20 that it would reduce the number of daily weather balloon launches at six forecast offices across the country. These balloons, typically launched twice a day, collect data about air pressure, wind speed and direction, humidity, and temperature.
Under the new plan, balloons will now be launched once a day from those sites, according to the NWS.
More funding concerns were recently raised, with multiple outlets reporting that the Office of Management and Budget proposed an upcoming 27% cut to NOAA’s current $6 billion budget.

 Virginia farmers rely on forecasts to plan season

Virginia’s agricultural sector could be significantly impacted by continued layoffs and reduced weather data. This follows a difficult year for Virginia farmers.
Hurricane Helene caused almost $160 million in damages to farms in Virginia due to flooding and harsh winds, according to an agricultural damage assessment by the Virginia Cooperative Extension. That includes crop and livestock loss, in addition to land and infrastructure damage.
Many regions also experienced drought. The Virginia Department of Environmental Quality issued a drought watch advisory to 95 counties and cities and a drought warning advisory to 12 counties in Virginia last June.
Farmers’ ability to respond to such conditions is closely tied to access to weather data services, according to Andrea Young, farmer and owner of Hidden Creek Farm in Fauquier County.
It’s more difficult for farmers to prepare and react to weather without data.
“I cannot bring the animals to safety, I cannot cover up those tender plants, I cannot know that a rainstorm is coming and so I shouldn’t water,” Young said. “I cannot function as a farmer in an outdoor environment.”
 Some farmers trust instincts, not instruments

Not all farmers see the cuts as damaging. Howard Smith Sr., dairy farmer and owner of Gospel Spreading Farm in James City County, spends a lot of time outside. He relies more on traditional knowledge and weather patterns than digital forecasts.
“You don’t cut hay when you know the storm is coming,” Smith said, as an example.
 He doesn’t believe NOAA cuts will greatly impact farmers in the area, who, like him, may know from lots of outdoor experience what the weather will blow in or out.
“If you look in the clouds and you see a mist being drawn up into the clouds, then just know from experience that within three days it shall return upon the earth— it’s going to rain,” Smith said. “You can’t match that with no type of instrument.”
  Climate change and food security

The future carries much uncertainty for farmers, with climate change shifting agricultural growing zones and seasons. They have to prepare for major shifts in precipitation patterns, soil moisture, heat and minimum nighttime temperatures, while already living “right on the margin” of making a living, Connors said.
NOAA provides a global perspective of information that is utilized and tailored for agricultural purposes.
“Without that data stream, they will essentially be thrust back into like the 1700s of what they can do,” Connors said.
The cuts to NOAA will also impact consumers, according to Connors. Farmers won’t be as able to make informed decisions, and it could lead to food insecurity for the whole country.
“If we defund the federal agencies like NOAA and NASA, we’re essentially turning our back on science,” Connors said.

At first blush, the idea that eviction is the solution for landlords when residential tenants fall behind on their rent or otherwise violate terms of a lease seems obvious.
And, indeed, in many situations, it is the only realistic path.
As new research from landlord-tenant law experts at the national Legal Services Corporation shows however, there are actually relatively few situations in which evictions end up being a win for landlords.
The study found that eviction proceedings seldom result in landlords recovering back rent and often end up costing thousands of dollars.
So, what should landlords do?
The researchers found that by working together — rather than merely as adversaries — landlords and legal aid providers can reduce financial losses, improve stability for all parties, and minimize costs and disruptions.
The bottom line: At a time in which so many renters are cost-burdened, there is no magic solution. But data show that, often, landlords can achieve better results for everyone by thinking outside of the box.

Tariffs meant to encourage U.S. manufacturing could have the opposite effect because many materials are imported from China. (Courtesy of Sumuri LLC)Steve Whalen loves his home state of Delaware and he’s proud to manufacture computers there that police officers use to “catch bad guys.” He said tariffs on imports from China and other countries, along with sharp cuts to government spending and the winding down of a program for small manufacturers, will make it harder for him to do that.
“We got into business to keep costs low for the ‘good guys,’ but tariffs or anything else that raises prices keeps us from doing that,” said Whalen, co-founder of Sumuri LLC in Magnolia, Delaware, which makes computer workstations for police and government investigations. Whalen has to buy materials overseas, often from China, and he said the tariffs could force him to triple his price on some workstations to $12,000.
Tariffs are the main tool President Donald Trump is wielding to try to boost manufacturing in the United States, calling the achievement of that goal “an economic and national security priority.” But the higher levies have led to retaliation and suspended shipments, and Whalen said they are just one of several Trump administration actions squeezing his small manufacturing business.
The wave of federal spending cuts, which has affected grants to state and local governments, could make his customers put off purchases. And the administration has moved to cut off funding for a $175 million state-based program that provides expert advice to smaller factories like his.

The Delaware version of that program, the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, helped Sumuri fit expanded product lines into the limited space in its small-town factory.
“We were really having a tough time trying to figure out how to utilize our space efficiently,” Whalen said. “They came here and helped us organize and optimize, and it made a huge difference.”
On April 1, the Trump administration cut off funding for 10 such manufacturing programs that were up for renewal in Delaware, Hawaii, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota and Wyoming. Other state MEP programs will expire over the next year.
The administration gave a reprieve to those 10 states until the end of the fiscal year after objections from Democrats in the U.S. House and Senate. The National Institute of Standards and Technology, which manages the program, extended funding for the 10 states “after further review and consideration” and will “continue to evaluate plans for the program,” said agency spokesperson Chad Boutin.
The program has come under fire from Republicans since the George W. Bush administration first tried to end it in 2009, and again during the first Trump administration, but Congress has continued to fund it. The conservative Heritage Foundation said in a 2023 book that MEP’s functions “would be more properly carried out by the private sector.”
‘Dots don’t quite connect’
Buckley Brinkman, executive director of the Wisconsin Center for Manufacturing and Productivity, which works with his state’s MEP program, said it didn’t make much sense for the administration to shutter the program as it seeks to boost the number of U.S. manufacturing jobs.
“It’s one of those things where the dots don’t quite connect,” Brinkman said. “I mean, jeez, here’s a part of government that doesn’t cost a whole lot, in the grand scheme of things — less than $200 million a year — that’s returning 10-to-1 to the national treasury, working on a priority for the president.”
A 2024 Upjohn report found an even higher return: 17-to-1 on $175 million in the 2023 fiscal year, creating $3 billion in new federal tax revenue.

In Wisconsin, which has lost more than 138,000 manufacturing jobs since 2000, some parts makers report that business is booming as manufacturers seek to avoid tariffs by finding U.S. alternatives to Chinese manufacturers, Brinkman said. But more broadly, he doubts that the tariffs will spark a manufacturing boom in the state.
“Do we want all this manufacturing back? Do we have the will to get it back? The answer to both those questions is ‘no,’” Brinkman said. “Even without the tariffs we don’t really want Americans doing a lot of those jobs that are in Chinese factories right now.”










I mean, jeez, here’s a part of government that doesn't cost a whole lot, in the grand scheme of things … that's returning 10-to-1 to the national treasury. 


– Buckley Brinkman, director of Wisconsin Center for Manufacturing and Productivity


In Delaware, the MEP helped Sumuri manage its expansion, but unpredictable tariffs and budgets are now a bigger danger, said Jason Roslewicz, Sumuri’s vice president of business development. He’s had to devote two employees to monitoring supply lines, tariff news and competitor pricing to stay afloat.
“We went from putting things together in a basement to a 19,000-square-foot facility, doing exactly what we’re supposed to do here in the U.S., and it’s all in danger of coming apart because of this problem,” Roslewicz said.
Other small manufacturers express similar concerns. TJ Semanchin, who owns Wonderstate Coffee in Madison, Wisconsin, said his business roasting and distributing coffee is in crisis because of the tariffs.
Wonderstate’s costs have almost doubled between tariffs on imported coffee and packaging materials from China, plus a cyclical rise in coffee prices. “I’m borrowing money to pay for this and at some point we’ll have to raise prices. We’ll have no choice,” Semanchin said.

But many Republican state officials, and even some Democrats, have backed Trump’s tariff push, including Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who credited the Trump administration with “reshoring manufacturing and restoring this middle class which has been eviscerated over the last 20 years.”
“There’s dislocation in the short term, there’s long-term opportunity,” Youngkin said in an April 15 interview on CNBC. He said his state is hearing more interest from manufacturers looking to build or expand local factories since Trump took office. For instance, Delta Star recently announced a plan to add 300 jobs building power transformers in Lynchburg.
“The president has been clear that there will be some level of tariffs, and folks are coming, and that’s good for Virginia,” Youngkin said in the CNBC interview.
Virginia’s MEP program, called Genedge, claims successes in streamlining production and quality control for local factory products including TreeDiaper, an automated tree watering device made in Ashland, and for advising EDM, a Lynchburg plastic product assembler that needed more efficient production to keep overseas competition at bay. But Virginia’s MEP is one of the state programs slated to expire in the next year.
Long-term trend
The slide in U.S. manufacturing jobs has continued on and off since 1979, and many experts say tariffs will not bring them back. Despite a modest bounce back under the Biden administration, the number of manufacturing jobs has declined from nearly 20 million in 1979 to less than 13 million today, even as the total U.S. workforce has grown from 89 million to 159 million during that period.
Manufacturing already has made a comeback

Manufacturing faces labor shortages, with many factories operating below capacity because they can’t find enough workers, according to Jason Miller, a professor of supply chain management at Michigan State University.
That doesn’t bode well for a mass reshoring of factories from China and other countries, but Miller doesn’t expect that to happen anyway.
“Firms are not planning on reshoring much of the work that was offshored 20 to 25 years ago,” Miller said. “I’m not concerned about having enough workers for manufacturing jobs that would be reshored because this isn’t going to happen.”
In a 2024 survey by the libertarian Cato Institute, 80% of Americans said America would be better off if more people worked in manufacturing, but only 25% said they personally would be better off working in a factory. The Chinese government has poked fun at the idea with memes of American workers struggling to make Nike sneakers with sewing machines.
Joseph McCartin, a labor historian at Georgetown University, said the idea of a manufacturing rebirth is a “mirage being conjured to attract the support of workers who have been underpaid in an increasingly unequal economy for the last 40 years, and are desperate for some hope of renewed upward mobility.”
Manufacturing “isn’t the magic wand to make that happen,” McCartin said.
“What we need is to raise workers’ wages and make the economy less prone to producing inequality,” McCartin said. “That mission is not at all what Trump is about. He is dealing in stale nostalgia.”

(Nathan Howard/Getty Images)As climate change drastically increases the frequency and severity of wildfires, power companies say they’re facing growing risk for payouts that could bankrupt them or require massive rate hikes on customers.
Across the West, electrical utilities are pushing state lawmakers to grant them legal immunity or limit damage payouts if their equipment sparks a blaze.
They’re backing bills, which have passed or been proposed in at least eight states over the past few years, that would require the utilities to follow plans to limit their risks of causing a fire, such as trimming trees or burying power lines. In exchange for taking those steps, lawmakers would give utilities protection from lawsuits that could expose them to billions of dollars in damage claims.
“We’re only one wildfire away from bankruptcy,” said Shawn Taylor, executive director of the Wyoming Rural Electric Association, a group that represents electrical cooperatives. “Even if we avoid bankruptcy, we’d have huge rate increases to cover the cost of a lawsuit.”
Already, utilities are facing soaring insurance premiums because of the magnitude of claims they would face if they caused a fire. Taylor and other industry leaders argue that power companies should be granted relief if they take actions to limit their risk.
In 2019, Pacific Gas and Electric Company in California declared bankruptcy over its roughly $30 billion liability from a series of wildfires caused by its equipment, including the devastating Camp Fire. And in Oregon, PacifiCorp is facing billions of dollars in damage claims due to its role in the state’s 2020 Labor Day fires. PacifiCorp has been a key player backing liability bills in five states, the Oregon Capital Chronicle reported.











We're only one wildfire away from bankruptcy. Even if we avoid bankruptcy, we’d have huge rate increases to cover the cost of a lawsuit.


– Shawn Taylor, executive director of the Wyoming Rural Electric Association



The proposals face strong opposition from wildfire victims, insurance companies and trial lawyers. Those groups say the bills don’t do enough to protect residents from dangerous electrical infrastructure. And insurers say their own customers could pay the price if lawmakers protect utilities.
“When you push in one side of the balloon, it comes out somewhere else,” said Greg Van Horssen, a representative for State Farm Insurance, delivering testimony before the Montana House Judiciary Committee in February. “If we have a problem with recovering costs for burnt-down houses in Montana, from an insurance company’s perspective, we only have one option, and that’s to raise the rate of homeowners’ insurance.”
Utah became the first state to limit utilities’ liability when it passed a law in 2020. The law protects companies from negligence charges if they have a wildfire mitigation plan in place, and it puts limits on the damages victims can collect, using a fair market value figure that can fall well short of the full cost to rebuild.
This year, Idaho and Wyoming have enacted similar measures, and Montana lawmakers have sent a proposal to the governor. A bill in Arizona has cleared the House, while a North Dakota bill passed the Senate but was narrowly defeated in the House. An Oregon measure is still in committee. Alaska has also considered liability legislation in recent years.
Utah state Rep. Carl Albrecht, a Republican who sponsored that state’s liability law, said it has compelled power companies to trim trees, bury lines and take other steps to ensure they are complying with their safety plan. He said utilities are frequent targets of litigation.
“People look at the utility as deep pockets that can pay out a lot of damages,” he said. “It’s whoever has the best attorneys and can sell their case in court.”
Trump’s cuts to federal wildfire crews could have ‘scary’ consequences

Michele Beck, director of the Utah Office of Consumer Services, serves as an advocate for Utah energy customers. She said it’s difficult to protect electrical customers and wildfire victims at the same time.
“The costs for ratepayers are substantial, and it’s reasonable to try and find a balance between these extremely high jury awards,” she said. “I admit, it’s a devastating loss for people who are impacted [by wildfires], but somebody is also paying on the other side.”
In Oregon, consumer advocates are similarly torn.
“It is a difficult place to be, having utilities close to bankruptcy and unable to make investments that are necessary to provide service,” said Bob Jenks, executive director of the Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board, a nonprofit representing ratepayers. “At the same time, the principle that customers shouldn’t be bailing out utilities for bad practices is a critical standard.”
PacifiCorp says it faces more than $45 billion in liabilities, much of that driven by the 2020 Labor Day fires in Oregon. Multiple juries have found the company liable for failing to cut power to its lines. The massive costs PacifiCorp is facing have limited the company’s ability to invest in its infrastructure and clean energy, Jenks said. PacifiCorp did not grant a Stateline interview request, but the company has been involved in shaping legislation across several Western states.
Oregon state Rep. Pam Marsh, a Democrat, said her bill would not give utilities legal immunity. It would establish a certification process to ensure utilities are mitigating wildfire risk.
“The utilities need somebody else to help them identify the risk they’re carrying,” she said. “We never meant that if you got a safety certification in April that you’re bulletproof over the next year for any sort of wildfire liability.”
But some legal experts told the Oregon Capital Chronicle that utilities would likely use their compliance with the certification process in a legal defense against wildfire claims.
In Arizona, a liability measure has passed the House and advanced in a Senate committee. The bill would protect companies from lawsuits if they follow mitigation plans. Utility leaders say it’s necessary to ensure they can continue providing service.
“Unlike other businesses that might stop doing business in an area where risk has grown too high, we have an obligation to serve customers,” said Joe Barrios, senior media relations specialist with Tucson Electric Power. “Wildfire liability costs and higher insurance costs are passed along to customers through the rates that they pay. [This bill] helps to maintain service affordability.”
California fires show states’ ‘last resort’ insurance plans could be overwhelmed

But state Rep. Alex Kolodin, a Republican, believes the proposal violates a state constitutional provision that bars the state from limiting residents’ right to sue. And he said that limiting utilities’ liability will reduce their incentive to take safety measures.
“I wouldn’t want to be the legislator who voted for this, and then the utility causes a fire that burns down 200 houses in my district,” he said. “Then I have to explain to my constituents why they can’t recover any damages. ‘Sorry, guys, it’s because your legislator is an idiot.’”
Brandon Vick, a regional vice president with the National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies trade group, said utility groups have made a coordinated push across several Western states this session. He noted that more and more residents in fire-prone areas are going without insurance coverage, leaving them with no recourse if they can’t seek damages from a utility.
“Utilities are rightfully concerned that they’re gonna do something that causes a catastrophic wildfire,” he said. “The question we’ve been posing is, who should be responsible when that ultimately happens? [These bills] are really pushing that liability onto the people who can least afford it.”
Several states are also considering a wildfire fund similar to the one California enacted in 2019. Such measures allow utilities to set aside money, funded by a mix of rate increases and shareholder contributions, which they can later tap into to help cover damages caused by wildfires.
Marsh, the Oregon lawmaker, said her proposal would allow wildfire victims to quickly access funding to rebuild their lives. Residents would still have the option to forgo payouts from the fund and sue utilities for full damages. The bill died in committee amid opposition from wildfire victims who characterized it as a bailout for utilities.

(Getty Images)The Merrimack School District has long maintained a breakfast program for high school students: $2 per meal, with discounts for lower-income students. And after the district recently extended the program to its middle school, the effects were immediately apparent, Kaitlyn Bernier says. 
“We have seen test scores improve (after) the breakfast (program) just at that middle school,” Bernier, a member of the school district’s budget committee, said in testimony to lawmakers last week. 
One bill this year would allow the school district to extend those discounts to more students. After years of debate among New Hampshire lawmakers over legislation to boost school meal assistance for low-income public school students, legislation to do so is moving forward with bipartisan support — at least in the state Senate.
Senate Bill 204 would allow school boards to vote to raise the eligibility level for free and reduced-price lunches to 200% of the federal poverty level, up from the current 185% cap.
Currently, the National School Lunch Program allows students from families making up to 130% of the federal poverty level — $41,795 for a family of four — to pay nothing for school lunches, and those from families making between 130% and 185% — $59,488 for a family of four — to pay no more than 40 cents per lunch. SB 204 would allow school boards to extend that second category up to 200%. 
And those school districts that chose to expand would also be required to offer online and physical applications to the free and reduced-price lunch program.
The legislation passed the Senate by unanimous voice vote, but it has received a tougher reception in the House, as Republicans on the House Education Funding Committee have voiced skepticism that school meal access is as big a problem as advocates say.
“Are you familiar with any situations where a child is not given the breakfast or lunch in school because they are unable to pay?” asked Rep. Daniel Popovici-Muller, a Windham Republican, speaking to Sen. Donovan Fenton, a Keene Democrat who sponsored the legislation, during a hearing on the bill. Fenton said while he didn’t know of a student that was refused a meal, some school districts provide cold food options to children whose parents have school lunch debt. Others choose not to create consequences, but the meal debt still affects them, Fenton said. 
“What we are finding out is that schools are trying to pay no matter what for these meals, oftentimes going into massive amounts of debt that we pick up the tab for: the state,” Fenton said. “And if we have a program that is an opt-in program where the taxpayers aren’t burdened with this, I think that would help tremendously.”
Rep. Dan McGuire, an Epsom Republican, noted that the Legislature is increasing state funding to schools despite enrollment dropping. 
“What we just passed in our House budget was more money — not just per pupil, but total dollars — for education than ever before,” he said. 
The cost of SB 204’s proposed expansion would be split by the state and local taxpayers. 
In the existing national program, the federal government reimburses schools for a certain amount for students whose families make up to 185% of the federal poverty level — but no higher. Under SB 204, for those school districts that choose to expand to 200%, the state would pay half the additional cost and the school districts would pay the other half. 
The bill sets aside $250,000 for the first fiscal year for the Department of Education to distribute money to school districts, as well as another $107,000 to cover administrative costs for the department to help set up online applications. 
Fenton, who introduced the bill with Sen. Tim Lang, a Sanbornton Republican, said the bill is necessary to help more families avoid school lunch debt — and to help more students obtain more nutritious meals.
“We want to ensure that no child goes hungry in school,” he said. “We recognize that well-nourished students are better learners, and that investing in them today leads to a stronger workforce and economy tomorrow.”
The legislation comes a year after Democrats and some Republicans attempted to pass a bill that would increase eligibility for reduced-price lunches to 300% across all school districts. That legislation, House Bill 572, passed the House but was tabled by the Senate. This time, lawmakers are proposing to make it voluntary for each school district, Fenton noted.
“This is an opt-in program that allows communities to decide what is best for their students, while offering a cost-sharing structure that ensures neither the state nor local school districts bear the full financial weight,” Fenton said. 
New Hampshire Hunger Solutions, an advocacy group that has supported a number of bills to expand school lunch services in schools, endorsed the bill, arguing there are more children showing up to school hungry than may be known.
“I was at Somersworth Middle School: I popped into the (nurse’s office) and I asked her if she was tracking hunger visits,” said Riona Corr, deputy director of the organization. “It was 9:30 in the morning. I asked her how many kids came in because they were hungry. There was nine.”
Corr said the nurse at Somersworth High School that day told her the number was 15. 
“Our kids are hungry, and we’re listening to the constituents within the schools and hearing what they need,” Corr said. “We’re not here to ask for solutions. We actually do have a solution.”
But some Republicans have raised concerns about the cost of increasing the program to local taxpayers — even if the expansion option were voluntary.
Rep. Riché Colcombe, a Hillsborough Republican, asked about the need for lower-cost options for breakfast.
“I understand the part about lunch, but I don’t understand the part about breakfast,” Colcombe said. “I’ve always been fed breakfast before or eaten breakfast before I left the house, so as a child, I had breakfast before school started.”
“I think that’s amazing that you had breakfast,” Fenton replied. “The problem here is that a lot of children aren’t having those meals.” 
Bernier agreed, arguing that malnutrition and food insecurity do exist for children in New Hampshire.
“There’s a lot of people that might not have that privilege to be able to have breakfast at home with their family beforehand,” Bernier said. “Their parents might not have that money. They might be given a Pop Tart that was expired from the food pantry of their community that they’re trying to put together because they’re just trying to do what they can to give a child something, and what they could really benefit from is a more nutritious meal that our schools are trying to help provide.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cafeteria-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-04-22 06:05:35.308034

Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham)  speaks out against proposed cuts at the Social Security Administration during a rally in Detroit on April 4, 2025. | Kyle DavidsonThe field of Democrats seeking Michigan’s U.S. Senate seat next year has grown with the official announcement Tuesday by U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens that she is in the race with plans to fight what she called the “Trump-Musk chaos agenda.”
Stevens, a Birmingham Democrat who has represented the 11th District in Congress since first winning election in 2018, spoke to the Michigan Advance ahead of Tuesday’s formal announcement, saying her decision to run for Senate is centered on countering the actions of President Donald Trump and his ally, billionaire Elon Musk, that will have devastating consequences for Michiganders.
“We have people who are worried about their earned benefits because Elon Musk said that Social Security is a Ponzi scheme,” Stevens said. “I have veterans who are reaching out to me asking if they’re going to get that earned benefit check, and this is all coming at a time when costs are still going up and Trump and Musk are doing nothing to address rising costs.”
Stevens said her career has been defined by moments in which Michigan was in crisis, pointing to her role in the Obama administration as chief of staff to the federal auto bailout task force.

“When the auto industry was about to go belly up during the Great Recession, I stepped up to the plate to…help save over 200,000 Michigan jobs, and we now find ourselves at another moment of, frankly, crisis because of the chaos and uncertainty coming from the Trump Musk administration,” Stevens told the Advance, adding that those efforts have continued during her time in Congress. 
“I helped pass the Chips and Science Act when supply chain disruptions from COVID-19 were wreaking havoc on our automotive sector and automotive jobs. So, I’m putting up my hand in this moment to do what I have always done, which is stand up for the people of Michigan, let people know I have their back and that I am eager to be their champion in the United States Senate.” Stevens said.

Stevens is now the third Democrat to formally seek the opportunity to succeed U.S. Sen. Gary Peters (D-Bloomfield Twp.), who announced in January that he would not seek re-election. Peters had chaired the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee in 2024, which saw Democrats lose their majority. Republicans hold a 53-47 advantage this term and Michigan’s open Senate seat is considered a “must win” for both parties, with the National Republican Senatorial Committee listing it among their top three targets for 2026.
State Sen. Mallory McMorrow was the first Democrat to announce, followed last week by former Wayne County Health Director Abdul El-Sayed. Other potential candidates include former Michigan House Speaker Joe Tate (D-Detroit). Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel and U.S. Rep. Hillary Scholten (D-Grand Rapids).
On the Republican side, former U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers (R-White Lake) said last week he is once again a candidate for U.S. Senate. Other potential GOP candidates include U.S. Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-Holland), state Sen. Jonathan Lindsey (R-Coldwater), and former gubernatorial candidate Tudor Dixon.
Stevens is known as a prodigious fundraiser, having defeated fellow Democrat, former U.S. Rep. Andy Levin, in the 2022 primary when redistricting placed them in the same district. The American Israel Political Affairs Committee, or AIPAC, spent heavily in support of Stevens in that race, and CNN reported earlier this month that the political action committee plans to do so again this year. Stevens also reported raising approximately $1.1 million in the first quarter of this year.
With a recent Gallup Poll finding that just 21% of Democrats expressed sympathies for Israel, while nearly 60% were sympathetic toward the Palestinians, the Advance asked Stevens if having the support of AIPAC would be a benefit or a liability at a time of increased dissension within the Democratic Party over support for Israel. 
“Let me be clear on where I am on this issue. I want to see the war in the Middle East end and I want to see the remaining hostages return home to their families. There are 59 hostages still in Gaza in tunnels, including one American. I am the co-chair of that hostage task force in the United States Congress given the work that I did to free Paul Whelan,” Stevens said, referencing the former U.S. Marine from Novi who was detained by Russia in 2019 and held until his release last August.
“I want to see an enduring cease-fire that will allow for true peace for the Palestinian people and for Israel, who is our strongest and closest ally in the Middle East,” she said.

Democrats have occupied both of Michigan’s U.S. Senate seats for the last 25 years, a task that was tested in 2024, when now-U.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Holly) narrowly defeated Mike Rogers for the seat opened up with the retirement of Debbie Stabenow. With Rogers back in the hunt to try and make the second time the charm for the GOP, Stevens says she is the candidate most qualified to defeat a Republican in 2026 and keep the Democratic lock on the state’s Senate seats.
“We all know that Mike Rogers sold out Michigan. He left the state of Michigan and I will always have Michigan’s back and I will not let people down. I win for Michigan and I have won tough races at the federal level before. I have a very unique and special expertise in manufacturing and in Michigan’s manufacturing economy and workforce,” Steven said, pointing to her Manufacturing Mondays program in which she visited manufacturers across her district on a weekly basis. 
“I bring those experiences back to Congress with me to pass and write legislation and this is also what led me to write legislation to make sure that Black-owned businesses have access to business networks and supply chains,” said Stevens.
While Stevens said that opposing the economic policies of the Trump administration she believes will harm Michiganders will be a top priority, she also knows that offering voters a positive vision for the state is a key element toward victory.
“I tell people all the time that as a four-term sitting member of Congress, I get to go to the U.S. House of Representatives and brag about Michigan. There is so much for us to champion in the halls of federal policymaking,” Stevens said. “I want to take the Michigan way into the United States Senate to get things done, yes for our state, but also for our country. I am currently looking at how we can win the future and how we will win the future from a place called Michigan.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/P4041632-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-22 06:05:35.308034

(Photo by Nick Evans, Ohio Capital Journal.)The Ohio House’s version of the budget would eliminate the independent group charged with enforcing state campaign finance laws. With the Ohio Election Commission gone, those duties would fall to the Secretary of State and county boards of elections. Lawmakers slipped the provision into the 5,000-plus page bill as part of a wide-ranging amendment the day before the vote.
But lawmakers’ frustrations with the commission became apparent months ago.
At a February hearing, state Rep. Brian Stewart, R-Ashville, expressed “grave concerns” about the commission and said its process is “substantially broken.”
“I’m getting texts and calls here from other members saying, this is the time to make some reforms,” he said at the time, “and I hope we do that as part of this process.”
Stewart’s irritation stems in part from his own case before the commission, which took roughly three years to resolve. The commission determined he made no violation; the challenger is appealing that decision.
Even critics of the House plan acknowledge the commission’s shortcomings. But they contend such drastic changes belong in a standalone bill with plenty of opportunity for public testimony.

Lawmakers’ complaints

With a current annual budget of about $642,000, the Ohio Elections Commission is a rounding error in a budget spending more than $44.5 billion General Revenue Fund dollars a year. The governor’s spending proposal pushed its annual budget north of $800,000. At that February hearing, OEC Executive Director Phil Richter showed up to explain how the extra funding would cover a new filing system and an additional employee to take over when he retires.
Instead, lawmakers lit into the commission.
In particular, Stewart and state Rep. Jean Schmidt, R-Loveland, complained about cases dragging on.
“There are multiple committees over the last several years,” Schmidt said, “who have been required to attend hearings, and the decisions go into a year, two years, delay, delay, delay, before a decision is rendered. Sir, that costs people time. It also costs people money.”
  State Rep. Jean Schmidt, R-Loveland. (Photo from the Ohio House website.)
Schmidt, like Stewart, has been on the receiving end of a multi-year OEC case.
In an interview, Stewart argued lawmakers have been raising concerns about the commission for years. He pointed to a 2014 U.S. Supreme Court ruling invalidating an Ohio law against false campaign statements. That decision eliminated an entire class of OEC complaints, he argued, “but of course, (the) government never sort of adjusted and kind of right-sized the operation.”
Stewart also brushed off concerns about lawmakers who have faced OEC complaints leading the effort to eliminate the agency.
“The best people in the position to reform an agency,” he argued, “are those who have spent years being drug through the mud and seeing how completely inefficient it is.”
More important, Stewart stressed, lawmakers aren’t changing campaign finance law — they’re looking for better enforcement.
“Everything that’s legal is still legal,” he said. “Everything that’s illegal is still illegal, and you will still have all the same appeal rights that you do today to take your matter to court.”
Traffic cops
Chris Hicks hates a liar. Talking with him for 10 minutes and it’s obvious his skin crawls seeing powerful people get away with it. He’s unabashedly conservative but has no problem going after members of his own party if they’re breaking the law. He’s filed numerous complaints with OEC, including the ones against Stewart and Schmidt.
In Hicks’ telling, it started with a different candidate named Allen Freeman. In 2020, he was one of several candidates backed by then-House Speaker Larry Householder. Freeman blanketed Cincinnati airwaves with ads, which struck Hicks as weird — the vast majority of that audience wasn’t in his district, and he reported spending only about $15,000.
Hicks found Federal Communications Commission reports of more than $100,000 in ad buys on Freeman’s behalf, paid for by Householder-aligned groups. The OEC eventually fined Freeman $50,000, but his campaign wound up burning through its cash to pay for his defense.
Hicks explained the Freeman case was just a starting point for him. “Some of these invoices had a bunch of other candidates on them,” he said. Since then, he’s driven back and forth more than a dozen times from his home outside Cincinnati to OEC hearings in Columbus, pursuing various campaign finance cases.
“I have no love for the OEC at all, as you can tell,” he said. “But everything about what’s happening right now is demonstrative of how f-ed up things in Ohio are.”
He complained about lawmakers “dumping” the changes into the budget to evade public hearings and can’t believe Democrats aren’t making a bigger issue of it.
Hicks thinks maybe it’s got to get worse before it gets better.
“The funny part is, if it stays in there, it’s probably better than the OEC,” he said. “Because it’s going to create absolute chaos — absolute chaos.”

Putting the process in the hands of county boards, whose members are often local party leaders, or a state hearing officer, hand-selected by the Secretary of State, will remove any semblance of neutrality, he contended.
Catherine Turcer, who heads up the government watchdog group Common Cause Ohio, has her own frustrations with the OEC, but she’s decidedly against the burn-it-all-down approach. She agrees the process takes too long and the results can be lackluster, but she argued lawmakers abolishing the commission is the wrong answer.
“As opposed to thinking about how they could create greater transparency,” she said, “and how they could make an elections commission that would be functional and strong and robust, they’re thinking about eliminating it.”
Turcer criticized lawmakers for scrapping the commission as part of the budget, rather than in a standalone bill. And she rejected Stewart’s suggestion that nothing’s lost in handing off the commission’s responsibilities.
“That doesn’t take care of making sure that these, you know, traffic cops, essentially, that they’re as independent as possible,” she argued. “I think the problem is, by eliminating it, you’re essentially setting up a system of cronyism.”
The stakes
Phil Richter understands the complaints about his agency and said he’s open to working on improvements. But he insists the foundational idea — an independent body overseeing campaign finance — was a good one.
“For the state of Ohio to take this step, and step away from an independent, bipartisan organization reviewing these kinds of matters, I think that, to me, would be a black mark on the state,” he said.
With oversight in the purview of partisan actors, he warned, any decision will be open to claims of partisanship. Beyond the optics, Richter argued devolving decisions to county boards could be a mess. He described explaining the House proposal to a former member recently who interrupted, “wait a minute, that means there could be 88 different versions and 88 different interpretations of the statutes.” Richter added there’s a conflict of interest in asking the same body to audit campaign filings and judge cases, too.
“Again,” he said, “that’s why this commission was created — was to separate those instances.”
None of those concerns make an impact on Stewart.
“You have seven folks who don’t even have to be lawyers, playing judge and trying to hear cases over a period of years,” he said. “That’s a silly system.”

(Screenshot of SCETV legislative livestream.)COLUMBIA — The South Carolina Senate voted late Monday to remove state Treasurer Curtis Loftis from office for his role in a $1.8 billion accounting error that went unreported for nearly a decade.
By a vote of 33 to 8, with five senators absent, the Republican-controlled Senate used an obscure constitutional measure to do something never done before in South Carolina history — remove an elected official from office — in this case one who is a member of the majority’s own party. All eight votes against removal were cast by Republicans.
But senators don’t have the authority to remove Loftis on their own.
The House would also need to approve his removal by a two-thirds majority, which would then require Gov. Henry McMaster to take the official action.
And Republican leaders in the House have not said whether they will take up the case.
South Carolina’s accounting problems, which involved almost no actual money, stem from the changeover from the state’s legacy accounting system to a new one.
During that process, a series of electronic ledger entries made it appear the state had $1.8 billion sitting untouched in a fund with no record of where it was supposed to go. A forensic accounting firm hired by the state ultimately found the entries were made in error and all but $200 million of the money was never real.
But what seemed to frustrate senators the most is that the state’s financial officials never alerted the General Assembly to the issue.
Two Republican members of the panel that has spent the last year investigating the matter argued the treasurer was incompetent, untrustworthy and “willfully neglected his duties” when he failed to report the mistakes to legislators.
“When he was faced with a $1.8 billion anomaly that remained in state records for years and years and years, he failed to detect it, he failed to report it, and when questioned, he failed to tell the truth about it,” said Sen. Stephen Goldfinch, R-Murrells Inlet.
“This was not momentary oversight or a technical misunderstanding by any means,” he said. “It was a sustained failure of judgment, of duty and of candor.”
Questions from senators, Republicans and Democrats both, were largely focused on what the treasurer knew when and why he had not taken responsibility for his role.
“It makes it so difficult for me to tell my neighbor … It is so hard to defend,” Sen. Luke Rankin, R-Myrtle Beach, said to Loftis. “Help me. Help us. Accept the responsibility.”
In response, Loftis said, “Tell me what you want me to accept responsibility for, because it’s complicated.”
Throughout the process, Loftis has maintained he did nothing wrong and instead laid the blame for the error outside his office. No money went missing, he has argued, and the whole investigation amounted to nothing more than political theater.
Lawyers representing the treasurer opened their arguments with a photo of Loftis and Republican President Donald Trump. They pointed to his winning track record — four terms in office — and he is now making his case to voters again, 14 months ahead of the Republican primary.

“Our democracy was built by letting issues like this be decided at the ballot box.” said attorney Deborah Barbier.
The legal team went on to remind many of the 34 Republicans in the 46-member Senate that they represent GOP-dominated districts.
The voters who elected them also likely cast their ballot for Loftis, said attorney Johnny Gasser, and choosing to remove Loftis amounted to telling residents their vote didn’t matter.
“Do you really want to go down this path today?” Gasser asked.
But Sen. Larry Grooms, who has led the investigation, contended Loftis had not behaved like the treasurer voters believed they had elected in 2022 or any of the previous election years. Loftis, he said, decided “protecting his public image was much more important than faithfully executing the duties of Office of State Treasurer.”
“Now that he’s been outed, now that his secret is exposed, now that sunlight is shining upon him and his failures, he is a different person,” added the Bonneau Beach Republican. “This Curtis Loftis is a liability to the finances of our state.”
And while the accounting error itself involved almost no real money, that hasn’t stopped the state from racking up bills trying to get to the bottom of the problem.

“The self-proclaimed ‘best friend of the taxpayer’ is costing the taxpayers tens of millions in legal, auditing and oversight fees,” Grooms said. “And these costs to the taxpayer are just beginning. With friends like this, who needs tax-and-spend liberals.”
Lofits did acknowledge his actions may have fallen short of expectations at times and promised to do a better job in the future.
“My passion for fighting what I perceive to be injustice may have been inappropriate, but my intent was always to do the honorable thing,” he told the Senate. “I hope all of us in this room agree that we should rise above the moment and return our focus to what matters — serving the people of South Carolina with honor, respect and purpose.”
For many, it was too little, too late.
“If your banker has a $1.8 billion error in your account, what do you do?” Goldfinch said. “At the end of the day, you go get a different banker.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-04-21-at-9.02.56 PM-1024x708.jpg,,,2025-04-22 06:05:35.308034

Using 2021 data from the State Health Access Data Assistance Center, the Health Policy Institute of Ohio found that the state spent $24 per person on public health, “far less than most other states.”
“Overall, Ohio’s investment in public health is lower than many other states at both the state and local levels,” the institute stated.
According to the data, only 12 states are worse than Ohio for state public health funding, with the worst being Missouri, at $6.54 per person in 2021. The highest ranked was the District of Columbia, at $370.56 in per-capita spending that year.

Public health involves everything from vaccine awareness and health education to food and water safety.
While health outcomes are influenced by clinical care like primary care check-ups, health behaviors and the social, economic, and physical environment make up a bigger part of the health outcome influences, according to policy briefs by the institute.
“Public health workers focus on stopping health problems before they start,” the HPIO stated in a recent policy brief. “For example, public health workers prevent injuries and deaths by providing parents with information about how to correctly install infant car seats, distributing drug overdose reversal medication and raising awareness of senior fall prevention programs.”
Other public health roles include nurses at school-based health centers, restaurant inspectors, public assistance program nutritionists, epidemiologists who look at health trends like infant mortality, and workers who conduct home visits as part of the Help Me Grow program.
That program, along with infant vitality programs are portions of the state budget that may see cuts, even as public health advocates ask the state to support the sector more than it already does.
In the Ohio House’s version of the state budget, $22.5 million would be cut from the Help Me Grow program in fiscal year 2027, representing a 26% reduction. Infant vitality programs would see cuts of more than $2 million each in 2026 and 2027, a nearly 10% cut. The programs, both housed under the Ohio Department of Children and Youth, are still awaiting final numbers, as the Ohio Senate takes up its budget discussions. A final draft will then be developed by both chambers, before it’s sent to the governor by July 1.

The House version of the budget leaves local health department support unchanged, with that support set at the same $2.379 million the line item received in 2024 and this year. State funding for infectious disease prevention and control within the Ohio Department of Health will also receive relatively the same amount of funding as it received in 2024, though the House version drops the budget slightly from the estimated 2025 funding. The 2025 estimate by the state has funding at $5.2 million, and the House set funding for 2026 and 2027 at $4.9 million per year.
In Ohio, 2023 annual financial reports from the Ohio Department of Health and the Association of Ohio Health Commissioners showed 72% of local health department revenue comes from the local level, including local government funds, public health levies in some areas and fees. Federal funding distributed by the state makes up 16% of the revenue, 6% is from other state sources, and 5% comes from direct federal funding to local departments. Local health departments only receive 1% of their revenue via state subsidy, according to the data.
  Source: Health Policy Institute of Ohio
The Health Policy Institute’s review of 2024 Ohio Department of Health data shows it receives half of its revenue from federal sources, 31% from the state and 19% came from the federal response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
With $979 million in state fiscal year 2024, the state used that revenue almost equally across three topics: disease prevention, implementation of the federal Women, Infant and Children (WIC) program, and services related to COVID-19 and other infectious diseases, according to an HPIO policy brief on public health basics. These three topics each took 22% to 23% in ODH expenditures.
Another 11% went to family and community health services, 6% went to maternal and infant vitality, 5% to administrative services, 4% to “quality assurance” for long-term care facilities, 4% for public health preparedness information and 2% for “other family and community health services” passed through local health districts.
Public health initiatives yield an average return on investment of $14 for every dollar spent, through improved health outcomes, reduced health care costs and increased productivity, according to the institute’s public health analysis.
Among other policy recommendations, the instituted urged continued or even increased support for the federal Public Health Infrastructure Grant would be important to “strengthen the public health workforce, foundational capabilities and data systems through the end of 2027.”
The public health sector has faced struggles like high turnover, high burnout rates in existing employees and a lack of adequate pay.
“Consistent delivery of these services across the state depends upon an adequate public health workforce,” the HPIO stated.

(Photo by Antonio Cotrim - Pool/Getty Images)After weeks at death’s door and just hours before his demise, Pope Francis on Easter Sunday met with Vice President J.D. Vance of Ohio. Vance hadn’t been scheduled for an official visit with the pontiff, and the meeting called attention to an issue that has divided Catholics and prominent Republicans in Ohio since last summer — immigration.
Francis, 88, died of a stroke early Monday. Last month, he was discharged from the hospital after a severe health crisis that included pneumonia.
He had clashed for years with President Donald Trump over Trump’s treatment of immigrants. In 2016, just after saying mass on the Mexican side of its border with the United States, Francis said that anyone who advocates building walls is “not Christian.” The Vatican later denied that the remark was directed at Trump, but the president has steadfastly advocated for a wall as he repeats false claims about migrants.
While Trump has pushed for a wall, Francis fought just as hard on behalf of migrants from the time he became pope in 2013. During that time, anti-immigrant rhetoric around the world has grown, while the number of forcibly displaced people has more than doubled, to 120 million, USA Today reported Monday.
In a 2015 speech to Congress, the pope implored lawmakers to help those crossing the southern border fleeing persecution and seeking opportunity.
“Is this not what we want for our own children?” Francis asked. “We must not be taken aback by their numbers, but rather view them as persons, seeing their faces and listening to their stories, trying to respond as best we can to their situation. To respond in a way which is always humane, just and fraternal. We need to avoid a common temptation nowadays: to discard whatever proves troublesome. Let us remember the Golden Rule: ‘Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.'”
He reiterated those sentiments in Sunday’s Easter message.

“I would like all of us to hope anew and to revive our trust in others, including those who are different than ourselves, or who come from distant lands, bringing unfamiliar customs, ways of life and ideas! For all of us are children of God!’” it said.
Those words stand in stark contrast to the words and actions of Trump and his administration. He has referred to immigrants as “not human” and “animals” who are “poisoning the blood” of the United States. Trump and his allies have referred to undocumented crossings as an “invasion” even after the rhetoric helped spur a racist mass murder in El Paso in 2019.
Migrants in Ohio, Michigan and elsewhere scramble as Trump changes the rules

Trump now is deporting or trying to deport hundreds of thousands who came legally using the CBP One app, unknown numbers of foreign university students.  He’s also dusted off a law not used since World War II to accuse undocumented migrants of gang affiliations and deport them to a notorious Salvadorean prison. The president has ignored court orders related to the latter deportations, and appears headed for a showdown with the U.S. Supreme Court in the matter.  
Trump is also trying to end temporary protected status for hundreds of thousands of immigrants, including many Haitians in Springfield. 
As the Caribbean nation has descended into chaos, those in the United States are terrified of being forced to return. But during a debate last summer, Trump repeated the racist lie that Haitians in Springfield were stealing their neighbors pets.
“In Springfield, they are eating the dogs,” he said. “The people that came in, they are eating the cats. They’re eating — they are eating the pets of the people that live there.”
In the ensuing furor, dozens of bomb threats were made against public buildings, including elementary schools. 
As a U.S. Senator representing Ohio, those threats jeopardized Vance’s constituents. But he repeated the lies even after his staff knew they were untrue.
Vance spread Springfield rumors even after his staff was told they were false, news report says

The episode divided some Ohio Republicans who also happened to be Catholic. 
Vance became one in 2019. Gov. Mike DeWine is a lifelong Catholic who has stayed all executions since taking office and signed a harsh anti-abortion bill into law.
During last year’s firestorm in Springfield, the governor criticized Trump and Vance in the New York Times.
“I am saddened by how they and others continue to repeat claims that lack evidence and disparage the legal migrants living in Springfield,” DeWine wrote. “This rhetoric hurts the city and its people, and it hurts those who have spent their lives there.”
Less than two months later, Trump and Vance won the election. Then in January, the president of Haiti’s transitional presidential council met with Pope Francis at the Vatican and then said Trump’s planned deportations and aid cuts would be calamitous for his country.
In February, Francis wrote a letter to U.S. bishops saying that Trump would create a “major crisis” with the mass deportations he planned. The pope also slammed the interpretation of Catholic theology Vance used to justify them.
Vance had invoked the doctrine “ordo amoris” to claim that one should think of family, then community, then country ahead of the rest of the world. 
The pope said that was wrong. He noted that Jesus himself was forced to seek refuge in a foreign land.
“Jesus Christ… did not live apart from the difficult experience of being expelled from his own land because of an imminent risk to his life, and from the experience of having to take refuge in a society and a culture foreign to his own,” Francis said in his letter.
He added that people should consider all as being part of their families and communities.
“The true ordo amoris that must be promoted is that which we discover by meditating constantly on the parable of the ‘Good Samaritan‘ that is, by meditating on the love that builds a fraternity open to all, without exception,” the pope said. 
He then sank into a 38-day hospitalization. Then he rallied, defied doctors’ orders and spent a busy Easter Sunday, the most important day on the Christian calendar. And he made room for a brief meeting with Vance as one of his last acts.
Coming a day after the pope’s lieutenants said they talked to Vance about “difficult humanitarian situations, with particular attention to migrants, refugees, and prisoners,” the meeting seemed intended to send a message. “Pope Francis Gave JD Vance a serious lesson just hours before he died,” was the title of a column Hafiz Rashid wrote in The New Republic.
Vance honored the pontiff after his passing in a post on X. But he made no mention of migrants.
“I just learned of the passing of Pope Francis. My heart goes out to the millions of Christians all over the world who loved him,” he said. “I was happy to see him yesterday, though he was obviously very ill. But I’ll always remember him for the… homily he gave in the very early days of COVID. It was really quite beautiful. May God rest his soul.” 
For his part, DeWine acknowledged the pope’s relentless advocacy for migrants.
“He was an inspiration to us and to millions around the world,” DeWine said in a written statement. “His genuine love of and devotion to all people — the poor, the unborn, those without a home, those emigrating to build a better life for themselves and their families, those of all faiths, and those with no faith — was evidenced to the world from the day he was selected to serve as Pope until his last public appearance on Easter Sunday.”

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)As the advocacy director for Mainstream Coalition, I had a front row seat to the harm caused to vulnerable Kansans by our elected officials this year. I sat beside deeply religious and secular Kansans as we advocated passionately for our government to respect our rights, protect our children, and care for our neighbors.
I shared their grief as we lost. Repeatedly.
More than 30 years ago, Kansas faith leaders created Mainstream Coalition to protect religious freedom and guard against the spread of religious extremism into our local, state, and federal politics. We need this mission today more than ever as the Trump administration enacts Project 2025, the Christian nationalist handbook to dismantle democracy. Every day we wake to new efforts to eliminate institutions, research and people who don’t align with their goals.
This is the Christian nationalist playbook: Impose a theocratic government and privilege “patriots” pledging allegiance to a so-called Christian nation.
But if we’re only watching for threats from D.C., then we’re blind to the attack on our rights happening in Topeka through the decimation of church-state separation. For years we’ve fought against efforts to advance a dangerous political bastardization of Christianity through state policy. That fight got a lot harder this year.
When our elected officials spend hours fighting for legislation aimed to erase transgender identities, prioritize tax relief for fetuses over working Kansans, divert millions of public dollars to private schools and Crisis Pregnancy Centers, or force a last-minute religious exemption for childhood vaccinations, they’re not doing the work of protecting the rights or pocketbooks of everyday Kansans. They are abusing their power as elected officials to force their narrow religious beliefs onto all Kansans.
This year the supermajority of the Kansas Legislature had some major “wins.”
It began with Senate Bill 63, the gender-affirming care ban. Make no mistake, this bill exists to force a narrow religious definition of “God-given biological sex” onto all Kansans. Every Republican legislator (with the exception of Emporia Rep. Mark Schreiber) supported this bill, despite the hundreds of Kansas teachers, faith leaders, parents, transgender youths, and medical providers who warned that this would put children’s lives and mental health at risk. SB 63 was the first piece of legislation sent to the governor’s desk, passed on just the 14th day of session.
Despite what legislators may have said last year while asking for your vote, their top priority wasn’t to improve the economy or reduce your taxes. No, the first thing they did in Topeka was try to erase transgender Kansans because they are a so-called “attack on the creativity of God.”
This year the supermajority (or maybe we should just acknowledge the real power under the dome — Kansans for Life, Kansas Family Voice, and the Kansas Catholic Conference) also celebrated the passage of several anti-abortion bills. Fortunately, education advocates were able to hold back expanded voucher programs that would send public dollars to unregulated private, often religious schools with a track record of using textbooks that teach that the Loch Ness Monster is proof of creationism or that slavery was Black immigration.
One bill illustrates the real power of Christian nationalists in Topeka. House Bill 2311 puts some of our most vulnerable youths, queer children in our foster care system, in harm’s way by prioritizing religious beliefs about sexual orientation and gender identity over the well being of children. Extreme religious families are now legally permitted to foster or adopt a queer child and subject them to “conversion therapy,” an unethical, unproven practice that targets queer children and seeks to change their sexual and gender identities.
Legislators called this a religious freedom bill but at first failed to produce any examples of a religious household being denied a foster placement, the very problem they said so desperately needed protection in Kansas. They managed to find one unverified claim of religious discrimination before the bill was passed. This one example was touted as evidence that religious households are under attack by the state, and again ran roughshod over the dozens of opponents who said this bill would endanger children.
This is their secret weapon: Christian nationalists are skillful at escaping accountability through manipulative messaging. If a teacher is told to use a student’s chosen pronouns, then their freedom of speech is violated. If a household is denied a foster care placement because they want to “pray the gay away,” then their religious freedom is violated. If a legislator is told that they are threatening the lives of transgender youths by denying gender-affirming care, then their motives are being unjustly impugned.
They argue that they are the victims, not the innocent Kansans whose human rights and dignity they are dismantling.
Any attempt to hold Christian nationalists and their adherents accountable for their harmful actions is twisted to be a threat against not just them, but against their chosen faith and church. This was perfectly illustrated this year when the Satanic Grotto announced its plan for a “black mass” at the Statehouse. The group’s stated purpose to host a civil disobedience event to “reflect our own pain and anger of us being subjected to religion that we never gave consent to,” was immediately overshadowed by loud legislators who felt their religion was threatened by this public theater.
As the modern day religious show-down devolved into physical altercations and arrests, videos captured the loud prayers of Rep. Angela Stiens, Sen. Mike Thompson, and gubernatorial candidate Charlotte O’Hara, who were permitted to publicly display their religious beliefs inside the Statehouse without threat.
Sen. Rick Kloos summarized my dread regarding this year’s legislative session best when he preached from the Senate floor: “The day Jesus rose from the dead, we won, and we continue to win. I say it again, we already won.”
Who is the “we” that Kloos referenced? Not me. Nor is it the majority of Kansans, Christians or secular, who want our government to respect the pluralistic beliefs and constitutional rights of all Kansans. Those of us not privileged in this Christian nationalist world order are doomed to be the losers until we start holding them accountable and call out their actions for the un-Christian, theocratic agenda that begins at the federal level and trickles down to Kansas through our elected officials.

They had crossed over from Mexico the previous day to seek political asylum in the United States. Border Patrol detention facilities in Yuma were overwhelmed with thousands of new arrivals, with many families trying to reach U.S. soil before the court-ordered re-implementation of the Trump-era Remain in Mexico policy. The policy requires asylum seekers to stay in Mexico for the duration of their U.S. immigration court process. (Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)“On this day, I would like all of us to hope anew and to revive our trust in others, including those who are different than ourselves, or who come from distant lands, bringing unfamiliar customs, ways of life and ideas!” -Pope Francis on Easter.
It was his final message of caring, of opening hearts to those seeking a better life, of “increasing our mutual solidarity” as human beings with integral value. But those words were likely lost on the migrant-demonizing J.D. Vance who met briefly with the pontiff hours before his death. The vice president, who notoriously lied through his teeth about pet-eating Haitian immigrants working legally in his home state, never stopped lying about the powerless he could exploit.
His bald-faced lies about a wrongly deported Maryland father being a dangerous gang member — despite no evidence presented in court and no due process offered the man —are shameless. Never mind that Kilmar Abrego Garcia had legal permission to remain in the U.S and establish a life with an American wife and children. Never mind that he had never been convicted of any crime in the U.S. or his Salvadoran homeland. 
The man was shackled and flown to a brutal gulag in El Salvador (in direct violation of a court order) where he remains today while the Trump-Vance administration sits in open defiance of a U.S. Supreme Court decree to facilitate his return. Two days before meeting the pope Vance blasted out posts implying the father of three got his just desserts with a “valid deportation” and “shouldn’t be in the United States.” 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
But the broken veep is wont to “create stories” to fuel backlash against those “who come from distant lands” — exactly what Francis lamented before his death. Vance even went on the warpath against basic due process arguing that it’s an unnecessary impediment to ridding the country of millions of unwanted immigrants. “How much contempt is stirred up at times towards the vulnerable, the marginalized, and the migrants!” wrote the late pope.
But in the land of the free foreigners live in fear. The Trump administration is obsessed with racking up the numbers of deportations it can brag about to its base. It is disappearing people to detention facilities, denying them counsel or their day in court and stealthily shipping them to the war-torn or tyrannical countries they fled or to a notorious prison for life. Whatever it takes to advance the “largest mass deportation in history” of illegal and legal immigrants. 
The Trump cruelty Vance promotes cancelled the temporary protected status of Haitians, Venezuelans, Afghans, Ukrainians, and other nationals from unsafe homelands allowed to live and work in the U.S. Ending that protection with imminent deportations threatened hundreds of thousands of terrified families who sought safe haven from humanitarian and political hellscapes. Fortunately, an array of legal challenges halted many of those efforts. But the ruthless authoritarian mission of the Trump regime — to purify the country of immigrants “poisoning the blood of our country” has branched out to visa and green card holders in far-flung sweeps of universities and colleges. 
Under the guise of national-security, a huge dragnet has been cast in nearly every corner of higher education across America and Ohio to surveil and scoop up unsuspecting international students. At least a dozen Ohio universities and colleges and nearly five times as many international students attending those schools are being blindsided daily by menacing emails from the Trump administration.
Without warning or explanation, foreigners legally studying here and throughout the U.S. are being summarily kicked out of the country for no apparent reason except being foreigners. The crackdowns on students from India and China and other parts of the world are coming fast and furious. But these kids aren’t hiding or committing egregious, deportable offenses. They’re just going to school. Pursuing undergraduate and graduate degrees or post-graduation training in science and technology — and paying full freight to do so. 
Under the State Department’s newly launched, AI-enabled “Catch and Revoke” initiative, the government is scraping social media posts (including likes, shares and comments) to “find foreign nationals who appear to support Hamas or other designated terrorist groups” and cancel their visas. The effort is framed as an anti-terrorism measure, but it is being used to terrorize students at Ohio State University, Kent State University, Case Western Reserve University, the University of Cincinnati, Youngstown State University, the University of Toledo, Xavier University, Cleveland State University, the University of Akron, and others.
At least 1,300 student visas have already been cancelled nationwide. The international community at Case Western Reserve has been encouraged to carry immigration papers at all times. Foreign students who uprooted their lives to attain an education no other country affords are living in dread of a knock on the door and being spirited away by masked government agents in plainclothes driving unmarked vans.
On the last day of his life, Pope Francis made a powerful call for mercy and kindness for those “who are different than ourselves.” But he was under no illusions about America’s dark turn or Vance’s complicity in it. 
“What is built on the basis of force, and not on the truth about the equal dignity of every human being, begins badly and will end badly,” he predicted.
Pray that it will not come pass.

Steve Whalen loves his home state of Delaware and he’s proud to manufacture computers there that police officers use to “catch bad guys.” He said tariffs on imports from China and other countries, along with sharp cuts to government spending and the winding down of a program for small manufacturers, will make it harder for him to do that.
“We got into business to keep costs low for the ‘good guys,’ but tariffs or anything else that raises prices keeps us from doing that,” said Whalen, co-founder of Sumuri LLC in Magnolia, Delaware, which makes computer workstations for police and government investigations. Whalen has to buy materials overseas, often from China, and he said the tariffs could force him to triple his price on some workstations to $12,000.
Tariffs are the main tool President Donald Trump is wielding to try to boost manufacturing in the United States, calling the achievement of that goal “an economic and national security priority.” But the higher levies have led to retaliation and suspended shipments, and Whalen said they are just one of several Trump administration actions squeezing his small manufacturing business.
The wave of federal spending cuts, which has affected grants to state and local governments, could make his customers put off purchases. And the administration has moved to cut off funding for a $175 million state-based program that provides expert advice to smaller factories like his.

The Delaware version of that program, the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, helped Sumuri fit expanded product lines into the limited space in its small-town factory.
“We were really having a tough time trying to figure out how to utilize our space efficiently,” Whalen said. “They came here and helped us organize and optimize, and it made a huge difference.”
On April 1, the Trump administration cut off funding for 10 such manufacturing programs that were up for renewal in Delaware, Hawaii, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota and Wyoming. Other state MEP programs will expire over the next year.
The administration gave a reprieve to those 10 states until the end of the fiscal year after objections from Democrats in the U.S. House and Senate. The National Institute of Standards and Technology, which manages the program, extended funding for the 10 states “after further review and consideration” and will “continue to evaluate plans for the program,” said agency spokesperson Chad Boutin.
The program has come under fire from Republicans since the George W. Bush administration first tried to end it in 2009, and again during the first Trump administration, but Congress has continued to fund it. The conservative Heritage Foundation said in a 2023 book that MEP’s functions “would be more properly carried out by the private sector.”
 ‘Dots don’t quite connect’

Buckley Brinkman, executive director of the Wisconsin Center for Manufacturing and Productivity, which works with his state’s MEP program, said it didn’t make much sense for the administration to shutter the program as it seeks to boost the number of U.S. manufacturing jobs.
“It’s one of those things where the dots don’t quite connect,” Brinkman said. “I mean, jeez, here’s a part of government that doesn’t cost a whole lot, in the grand scheme of things — less than $200 million a year — that’s returning 10-to-1 to the national treasury, working on a priority for the president.”
A 2024 Upjohn report found an even higher return: 17-to-1 on $175 million in the 2023 fiscal year, creating $3 billion in new federal tax revenue.
In Wisconsin, which has lost more than 138,000 manufacturing jobs since 2000, some parts makers report that business is booming as manufacturers seek to avoid tariffs by finding U.S. alternatives to Chinese manufacturers, Brinkman said. But more broadly, he doubts that the tariffs will spark a manufacturing boom in the state.
“Do we want all this manufacturing back? Do we have the will to get it back? The answer to both those questions is ‘no,’” Brinkman said. “Even without the tariffs we don’t really want Americans doing a lot of those jobs that are in Chinese factories right now.”










I mean, jeez, here’s a part of government that doesn't cost a whole lot, in the grand scheme of things … that's returning 10-to-1 to the national treasury.


– Buckley Brinkman, director of Wisconsin Center for Manufacturing and Productivity


In Delaware, the MEP helped Sumuri manage its expansion, but unpredictable tariffs and budgets are now a bigger danger, said Jason Roslewicz, Sumuri’s vice president of business development. He’s had to devote two employees to monitoring supply lines, tariff news and competitor pricing to stay afloat.
“We went from putting things together in a basement to a 19,000-square-foot facility, doing exactly what we’re supposed to do here in the U.S., and it’s all in danger of coming apart because of this problem,” Roslewicz said.
Other small manufacturers express similar concerns. TJ Semanchin, who owns Wonderstate Coffee in Madison, Wisconsin, said his business roasting and distributing coffee is in crisis because of the tariffs.
Wonderstate’s costs have almost doubled between tariffs on imported coffee and packaging materials from China, plus a cyclical rise in coffee prices. “I’m borrowing money to pay for this and at some point we’ll have to raise prices. We’ll have no choice,” Semanchin said.

But many Republican state officials, and even some Democrats, have backed Trump’s tariff push, including Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who credited the Trump administration with “reshoring manufacturing and restoring this middle class which has been eviscerated over the last 20 years.”
“There’s dislocation in the short term, there’s long-term opportunity,” Youngkin said in an April 15 interview on CNBC. He said his state is hearing more interest from manufacturers looking to build or expand local factories since Trump took office. For instance, Delta Star recently announced a plan to add 300 jobs building power transformers in Lynchburg.
“The president has been clear that there will be some level of tariffs, and folks are coming, and that’s good for Virginia,” Youngkin said in the CNBC interview.
Virginia’s MEP program, called Genedge, claims successes in streamlining production and quality control for local factory products including TreeDiaper, an automated tree watering device made in Ashland, and for advising EDM, a Lynchburg plastic product assembler that needed more efficient production to keep overseas competition at bay. But Virginia’s MEP is one of the state programs slated to expire in the next year.
 Long-term trend

The slide in U.S. manufacturing jobs has continued on and off since 1979, and many experts say tariffs will not bring them back. Despite a modest bounce back under the Biden administration, the number of manufacturing jobs has declined from nearly 20 million in 1979 to less than 13 million today, even as the total U.S. workforce has grown from 89 million to 159 million during that period.
Manufacturing already has made a comeback

Manufacturing faces labor shortages, with many factories operating below capacity because they can’t find enough workers, according to Jason Miller, a professor of supply chain management at Michigan State University.
That doesn’t bode well for a mass reshoring of factories from China and other countries, but Miller doesn’t expect that to happen anyway.
“Firms are not planning on reshoring much of the work that was offshored 20 to 25 years ago,” Miller said. “I’m not concerned about having enough workers for manufacturing jobs that would be reshored because this isn’t going to happen.”
In a 2024 survey by the libertarian Cato Institute, 80% of Americans said America would be better off if more people worked in manufacturing, but only 25% said they personally would be better off working in a factory. The Chinese government has poked fun at the idea with memes of American workers struggling to make Nike sneakers with sewing machines.
Joseph McCartin, a labor historian at Georgetown University, said the idea of a manufacturing rebirth is a “mirage being conjured to attract the support of workers who have been underpaid in an increasingly unequal economy for the last 40 years, and are desperate for some hope of renewed upward mobility.”
Manufacturing “isn’t the magic wand to make that happen,” McCartin said.
“What we need is to raise workers’ wages and make the economy less prone to producing inequality,” McCartin said. “That mission is not at all what Trump is about. He is dealing in stale nostalgia.”

(Getty Images)Some Nebraskans, including former State Treasurer John Murante in March, have argued that “public funds should always be invested with fiduciary considerations and duties top of mind — and nothing else.”
Catholic tradition argues the opposite for the 350,000 Catholics and thousands of other Christians in Nebraska. The U.S. Catholic bishops assert, “Every economic decision and institution must be judged in light of whether it protects or undermines the dignity of the human person.” For a robust, faith-based response, consult the Vatican’s Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church, especially Chapter 7: “Economic Life,” or the U.S. Catholic bishops’ “Economic Justice for All.”
Christianity sees each person as made in God’s image and likeness (Genesis 1:26). The Church teaches that each person is sacred and has natural rights. U.S. bishops define rights as claims “on the basic goods that every human person needs to live and thrive.”
Faith instructs investing
St. John XXIII affirmed that every person “has the right to live. [Each] has the right to bodily integrity and to the means necessary for the proper development of life, particularly food, clothing, shelter, medical care, rest, and, finally, the necessary social services.”
Since God is love (1 John 4:8) who calls us to love (John 13:34), the Church also teaches that each person is innately social. This means every person has responsibilities to protect and promote the rights of others, especially the poor.
The Church stresses that government exists to ensure the protection of rights and fulfillment of responsibilities. This includes through its economic choices. Every economic decision can help or hurt – love or not love – people and the planet.

Investments can support companies that provide safe working conditions, pay living wages and care for the environment. Decisions also can support companies that do the opposite. Thus, as Pope Benedict XVI stressed, “Every economic decision has a moral consequence.” Public and private investments should always consider companies’ impacts on human dignity, particularly the vulnerable and marginalized, and never be just about maximizing financial returns.
Church teachings on economic justice include protection of what St. John Paul II affirmed as the “right to a safe environment.” All persons need this to be healthy and flourish. Pope Benedict XVI observed, “It is not hard to see that environmental degradation is often due to the lack of far-sighted official policies or to the pursuit of myopic economic interests, which then, tragically, become a serious threat to creation … When making use of natural resources, we should be concerned for their protection and consider the cost entailed – environmentally and socially.”
Climate group exodus is good for pensioners and taxpayers

Similar to ESG
These Vatican teachings on “Ecological Economics” echo the principles of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investment that consider more than profit – and which critics deride.
They are at the core of the U.S. bishops’ “Socially Responsible Investment Guidelines.” In Part 2.V, “Saving Our Global Common Home,” bishops discourage investments in companies that damage the environment. They recommend investing in companies whose activities and policies proactively care for our common home.
In 1931, Pope Pius XI declared it “an error to say that the economic and moral orders are so distinct from and alien to each other that the former depends in no way on the latter.” Nearly a century later, the Church still affirms that public and private economic choices should always consider ethics and never just profit.

,California,2025-04-22 07:01:00+00:00,CalMatters,California’s economy was already sluggish before Trump’s global tariffs,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/04/tariffs-hurt-california-economy-sluggish/,California's high unemployment rate and job losses in private industries predated President Trump's global trade crusade.,"Last week, Gov. Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta filed a lawsuit challenging the legality of President Donald Trump’s broad imposition of tariffs on imported goods.
“President Trump’s unlawful tariffs are wreaking chaos on California families, businesses, and our economy, driving up prices and threatening jobs,” Newsom said in a statement.
The tariffs could have all of those negative impacts, but California’s economy was already sluggish.
As Gabe Petek, the Legislature’s budget analyst, said in a January response to Newsom’s state revenue forecast, “These gains are not tied to improvements in the state’s broader economy, which has been lackluster, with elevated unemployment, a stagnant job market outside of government and healthcare, and sluggish consumer spending.”
California has more than a million unemployed workers and its unemployment rate is tied for second-highest among the states.
“Jobs growth remains concentrated in government and government supported health care and social services while other private industries in total continue to shed jobs,” according to the Center for Jobs and the Economy, an arm of the California Business Roundtable trade group.
Virtually every major segment of California’s economy has been facing stiff headwinds in recent years, but the only one enjoying political notice has been Southern California’s film industry, which is seeing other states and nations lure production away with lower costs and subsidies.
“Those business decisions have considerable consequences for the industry’s thousands of middle-class workers: the camera operators, set decorators and lighting technicians who make movies and television happen,” the New York Times reported.
Newsom and the Legislature are planning a major increase in state subsidies to keep production in California, but it may be too little and too late.
Meanwhile, “The substantial loss of technology jobs in the Bay Area so far this year is a huge shock to the Bay Area economy and labor market,” Scott Anderson, chief economist with BMO Capital Markets, recently told the East Bay Times. “The technology job loss trend has been in place for some time now, but the deterioration in the first two months of the year is concerning.”

Newsom takes on Trump over tariffs he says are hurting California 

by Alexei Koseff 





Tariffs could hit Southern California’s most important economic driver — the twin ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles and the warehouse complexes in the region’s interior — especially hard. But this sector was already facing rising costs that undercut its competitiveness.
The Goods Movement Alliance, a coalition of business groups, is backing Newsom’s challenge to tariffs, but also cites the state’s policies, industrial electricity rates twice the national average and high gasoline and diesel fuel prices as negative factors, as well as new pollution controls on ships and anti-warehousing legislation.
California’s largest-in-the-nation agricultural industry, including its famous winemaking sector, is also shrinking, largely due to uncertain water supplies, labor shortages and the same high costs for electricity and fuel that the logistics industry faces.
The Public Policy Institute of California has estimated that, “even in the best-case scenario, some 500,000 acres may need to be fallowed in the San Joaquin Valley” due to restrictions on pumping irrigation water from underground aquifers.
Finally, even though government has been California’s foremost employment driver — including government-financed medical services — in recent years, it is also facing bleak times. The state budget is mired in what fiscal experts call a “structural deficit” and virtually every major city, some counties and large school districts are in the same pickle. Los Angeles and San Francisco are particularly plagued after several years of of overspending and their leaders, such as Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, are warning that layoffs may be inevitable.
Trump’s tariffs might make things worse, but California’s economic woes predate Trump. Much of it was self-inflicted.

Jason Esteves announced his candidacy Monday with an introduction video highlighting his experience, including as a former teacher and chair of the Atlanta Public Schools Board of Education. In the video, titled “Underdog,” Esteves took aim at what he characterized as radical Republicans in the state government following the lead of President Donald Trump.
“I’ve had enough of families working harder than ever but still struggling and our kids falling behind instead of getting ahead,” Esteves said in his announcement video titled “Underdog.” “Yet extreme politicians in Georgia push Trump’s reckless agenda, rig the system for special interests and stick us with the bill.”
As Esteves read these lines, the screen flashed with images of Trump, Kemp, Lt. Gov Burt Jones and Esteves’ only announced Republican candidate, Attorney General Chris Carr, who became the first to throw his hat in the ring in November.

Carr’s campaign has highlighted his experience in law enforcement, especially operations targeting immigrants, gang members and human traffickers.
“For decades, we’ve been the best place to live, work, raise a family and build a business,” Carr said in his introductory video, “Keep Georgia Strong. “That hasn’t happened by chance. It’s happened because we’ve had leaders who are willing to make tough decisions, put Georgians first and stood strong in the face of adversity. Progressive activists are trying to radically transform our values and our economy. As your attorney general, I’ve made it my mission to keep Georgia safe.”
Carr has been a vocal supporter of Trump’s second-term agenda, but their relationship hasn’t always been chummy. In 2022, Trump called Carr “a disaster every step of the way” and backed a primary challenge against him after Carr declined to investigate Trump’s baseless allegations of widespread voter fraud in Georgia’s 2020 election.
Meet the maybe candidates
Lt. Gov. Jones, a Republican who is widely considered likely to enter the governor’s race, is considered a more steadfast Trump ally – Jones was one of Georgia’s so-called fake electors, who met at the state Capitol in 2020 to cast votes for Trump even after his loss to Joe Biden was officially certified.

Jones’ closeness to the president could benefit him in a Republican primary, but it’s less clear whether his tightness with Trump will help or hurt in a general race. How Trump shapes the race will likely depend on how Georgians’ view the chief executive during the buildup to next year’s election season.
“If the economy goes bad, if inflation is up, if unemployment is up, then some of the luster may be taken off of Trump,” said University of Georgia political science professor Charles Bullock. “Now, for the MAGA folks, it probably doesn’t matter, but for the critical element of independents and, in the general election, of white, college-educated voters, if Trump’s attractiveness has been substantially reduced, then that certainly works for the advantage of Democrats.”
Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, another rumored but unconfirmed candidate, could also make a reasonable play as someone Trump-skeptical conservatives and independents could back.
Raffensperger was on the other end of the now-infamous 2021 phone call in which Trump called on him to “find” enough votes to overturn Georgia’s 2020 election. Raffensperger declined, earning the ire of Trump and many of his supporters.
Firebrand conservative Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene is another member of the maybe column – she told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution’s “Politically Georgia” podcast back in February that she was open to either a run for the governorship or for Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff’s seat, which is also up in 2026.

On the Democratic side, one much-speculated candidate seems less likely to have her eyes on Kemp’s job than she did last year.
Democratic Congresswoman Lucy McBath hasn’t ruled out a run entirely, but she announced late last month that she was suspending her bid as she focuses on the health of her husband, who recently underwent surgery for cancer.
Former Atlanta Mayor and advisor to President Joe Biden Keisha Lance Bottoms told 11Alive News early this month that she plans to run for governor.
Former DeKalb County CEO Michael Thurmond has not ruled out a run – and neither has former state House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams, who became a household name after narrowly losing to Kemp in 2018 and again by a wider margin in 2022.
A crowded Democratic primary could be just the thing to dash the Dems’ dreams, Bullock said, if the intra-party attacks get too intense.
“If they get into it, then a lot of money will be spent within the primary, and sooner or later, even though they may start out simply singing their own praises, there would be a tendency to go negative, especially if at least three serious candidates get into it so you have a run-off. That’s when attacks really become strong.”
The elephant in the room
  Gov. Brian Kemp. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Kemp is reportedly considering a run at Ossoff’s seat.
Many Republicans would be thrilled to see Kemp’s name on the ballot next to Ossoff’s – Kemp enjoys relatively high approval ratings and has shown he can win statewide races in campaigns for governor and secretary of state.
But Kemp – whose name has also been floated as a potential presidential candidate in the future – may see moving to the Senate as a downgrade, Bullock said.
As governor, Kemp has sway over all aspects of state government, but he would be one of 100 in the Senate, and as a newly-elected senator, he’d be too low on the seniority rankings to chair any important committees.
“He’s going to be far less visible in that role, the scope of his influence is going to be tiny compared to what he has now,” Bullock said. “He’s not going to be living in a mansion, he’s going to be living probably in an apartment, maybe in the Watergate building. He’s not going to have an SUV and a state patrolman to drive him around.”
  Sen. Jon Ossoff. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Once Kemp makes a decision, expect plenty of dominoes to fall afterwards.
Georgia Fire and Insurance Commissioner John King has said he would consider a run for Senate if Kemp does not. Agriculture Commissioner Tyler Harper has also publicly teased the idea of running.
“Conceivably, virtually the entire hierarchy of statewide Republican officials could give up their current positions, which would be then just wildness in terms of primaries, probably on both sides, of candidates running for each of those statewide offices,” Bullock said. “You may well clear out a large share of the state Senate and some of the state House. It may be if you show up January of 2027 at the Capitol, you may not recognize anybody because they’ve all run for something, cleared out the state Legislature. So this could be an extraordinary election cycle in Georgia.”

Two reasons this is a terrible idea:

It is like returning to a world without money, a primitive barter economy.
Citizens and companies no longer buy and sell freely, but only when the government lets them.

On the first point, consider your household budget.  It is well balanced if your monthly income is close to your expenses.  If it’s not, the difference is savings or debt.  But it needn’t balance between any two parties.  I never bought anything from my employer, nor sold a thing to Stop & Shop.

James Stodder
But what if I had to barter my labor for everything?  If I worked in an old-time coal mine, I might “owe my soul to the company store.”
If instead, I bought groceries, gasoline, and housing from different companies, I’d have to figure out what to barter with each one.  That could get complicated. The volume of trade under barter is typically low – it’s hard to find a ‘match’ between would-be traders.  That’s why early civilizations invented money.
Similarly, if trade between every country has to ‘balance,’ even if only on an annual basis, we can expect the total volume of U.S. imports and exports to be much lower.  That would make us all poorer.
But it’s even worse than that, and here  we come to the second reason it’s a bad idea.  It’s one thing for a pair of individuals to keep trade balanced.  But how could we ensure that millions of individual trades between two countries balanced out at the end of every month or year?
Each government would have to tell “its own” companies when they could and couldn’t trade.  This is the opposite of a ‘free’ market, that Republican ideal.
It would be like the old Soviet Union, where I once studied.  At the end of the month, that economy fell into a kind of madness – shortages of the things people wanted most, but factories working extra shifts to make things few people wanted, just to meet their monthly quota.
Trump’s tariffs were not popular with the billionaires surrounding him.  They know they are bad for the economy – and their stock portfolios.   The New York Times reports that Musk lost $31 million in stocks right after Trump’s tariff announcement.
It is hard to feel too sorry for him.  The oligarchs’ libertarian commitment to free trade got put on hold when they kissed Trump’s ring.  But their ideas about why tariffs are bad were still correct, and they paid a price.  But the rest of us shouldn’t have to.
Trade wars also make real wars more likely.  People used to say China would never attack us.   “What would they do, bomb Walmart?”   They won’t have to worry about that now.  If we do get into a shooting war with China, Russia, and/or Iran, who’ll be on our side?   All those allies we just threatened?
If Trump puts back his tariffs on everyone, the U.S. will not remain “leader of the free world” for much longer.   We’ll be giving up much of our power – political, economic, even military.

That moment sparked a movement, one that gave us the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and the Environmental Protection Agency. It was a turning point.
Today, we face another. But this time, the stakes are even higher—and the threat is more urgent.
In 2025, the Trump administration is not just ignoring the climate crisis —it is actively undermining decades of progress. On day one, the administration re-withdrew the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement, signaling a dangerous retreat from global climate cooperation. Since then, it has opened over half of the country’s protected forests to logging, reversed bans on toxic PFAS chemicals, and propped up polluting coal plants with executive orders —all while stripping back core environmental protections under the guise of “energy independence.”
One of the most alarming rollbacks is the elimination of the Clean Power Plan, which essentially opens the door to continued use of coal-fired power plants —the most polluting energy sources. At the same time, the Environmental Protection Agency is moving to dismantle the Good Neighbor Plan, a vital policy under the Clean Air Act that helps prevent air pollution from drifting across state lines. This rollback has enormous consequences for Connecticut.
These decisions may feel far away from Connecticut, but their impacts land right here in our backyards. In August 2024, a few Connecticut towns faced deadly and historic rainfall and flooding. On August 18, peak rainfall amounts exceeded three inches of water per hour, and seven inches in three hours in a band from the Town of Monroe to the Town of Oxford. The estimated cost of damages from flooding in Oxford is around $20 million and over $10 million in Southbury.
More than any other eastern state, Connecticut has suffered from out-of-state air pollution, especially from upwind coal and industrial plants in the Midwest. The impacts of climate change are causing serious damage and costs to Connecticut communities. Just last summer, Connecticut farmers lost millions in crops after torrential floods wiped out growing fields —floods fueled by extreme weather patterns made worse by climate change. 
Coastal towns like Guilford, Fairfield, and Old Saybrook are contending with sea level rise and saltwater intrusion that threaten homes and infrastructure. Meanwhile, communities of color and low-income neighborhoods in cities like Bridgeport and Hartford are disproportionately exposed to dangerous heat and air pollution—conditions that will only worsen as the climate crisis accelerates.
This is Connecticut’s climate reality.
And yet, while the Trump administration rolls back environmental protections, Connecticut has a choice: we can follow them into failure —or we can fight forward.
Though the Connecticut General Assembly has failed to pass any meaningful climate legislation the past two years, this legislative session they have an opportunity to pass bills that will combat the dangerous and costly impacts of climate change. House Bill 5004, Senate Bill 9 and SJ 36 each contain key components needed to mitigate climate change impacts, increase climate  resilience, and establish long-term protection.
This Earth Day, we must say clearly and collectively: We cannot go back. Not on clean air. Not on safe water. Not on climate protection. Our state has the power and the responsibility to lead. That means protecting our most impacted and under-resourced communities. It means rejecting new fossil fuel infrastructure and holding polluters accountable. It means clean air, water, and healthy, renewable energy. 
We owe it to the farmers who are seeing their livelihoods washed away. To the children growing up with asthma in polluted neighborhoods. To the coastal families watching the water inch closer to their front doors. And to the next generation, who deserve a livable planet—not the burden of cleaning up our mess. 
Connecticut must lead where the Trump administration in Washington D.C. is failing. Let this Earth Day be one for bold state and local action. We cannot afford to wait. We cannot afford to move backward. And we will not let climate denial and corporate greed determine our future.

(Photo by Claire Stremple/Alaska Beacon)Alaska’s state House and Senate are scheduled to meet at 2 p.m. Tuesday to vote on whether or not to override Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s veto of a bill increasing the state’s per-student funding formula.
Multiple lawmakers have said that the Legislature likely lacks the votes for an override. Under the Alaska Constitution, the votes of 40 of the Legislature’s 60 members, meeting in joint session, are required to override the veto of a policy bill.
House Bill 69, which seeks to increase the base student allocation — core of Alaska’s per-pupil funding formula — passed the House and Senate by a combined vote of 32-25.
HB 69 proposes an increase of $1,000 to the BSA, or $253 million per year in total. 
Last year, legislators proposed a $680 increase to the BSA, and the related bill passed the House and Senate by a combined vote of 56-3. Legislators failed to override Dunleavy’s veto of that bill by a single vote.
Public education advocates say years of flat state funding has led to significant cuts to Alaska’s public schools, which have had to deal with inflation-driven cost increases.
The governor, and a decisive number of legislators who support him, say funding increases must be paired with policy changes intended to improve school performance.
Two years of negotiations have failed to result in a suite of policy changes that are acceptable to the governor and a majority of legislators. 
Without the formula change, the public-school funding level in the state’s annual operating budget will be decisive. 
The House has voted in favor of a budget that includes one-time bonus funding equivalent to a $1,000 BSA increase, but because the House’s budget also includes a significant deficit, the Senate may propose a smaller increase. 
The Senate’s draft budget has yet to emerge from the Senate Finance Committee.

CHICAGO — As prosecutors gave their closing arguments Monday in the trial of state Sen. Emil Jones III, they cast doubt on Jones’ testimony last week that red-light camera entrepreneur Omar Maani made him “uncomfortable” when he hinted at a bribe in the summer of 2019, asking the jury why — if that was true — did he keep meeting Maani for dinner and answering his calls and texts?

Maani, who’d been acting as an FBI cooperating witness for 1 ½ years by the time he and Jones kicked off what would eventually be a series of three dinners that summer, “littered” their meetings with words that should’ve been “screaming red flags,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Tiffany Ardam said.

She pointed to the times when Maani told Jones he wanted to get “creative” in how he’d pay a potential campaign contribution or otherwise “conceal” it from public reporting requirements — lest it look “goofy” or “funky” to either the media or other leaders inside his company, SafeSpeed.

“These words are giant red flags. These words should’ve had the defendant running for the hills,” Ardam said. “Instead, the defendant does the opposite.”

Jones, a Chicago Democrat, is accused of agreeing to accept $5,000 from Maani in exchange for changing legislation requiring a study of the red-light camera industry so it wouldn’t have any bearing on SafeSpeed’s extremely profitable business model. Jones also asked Maani to arrange for SafeSpeed to hire his former intern, which the feds allege was Jones furthering the bribe.

But in his closing arguments, Jones’ attorney Vic Henderson repeatedly emphasized that Maani never gave Jones the $5,000. He reminded the jury of the times during their secretly recorded dinners when Jones steered the conversation from the campaign contribution to the job for his intern. Jones last week testified that he was actively trying to avoid taking Maani’s money.

“Why would somebody on the take say, ‘Don’t give me any money?’” Henderson asked the jury. “Why would somebody who doesn’t know their calls are being listened to say, ‘Don’t give me any money?’ Why? Because he’s not on the take.”

But prosecutors argue it doesn’t matter that Maani never paid Jones, nor does it matter that the senator never amended his legislation in the way that Maani asked for.

“He doesn’t need to do it,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Prashant Kolluri told jurors during the government’s rebuttal arguments Monday afternoon. “The agreement is the crime.”

Henderson, though, reminded the jury that the only reason Jones was invited to multiple dinners with Maani was because the FBI directed it, accusing Maani of trying to “set him (Jones) up.” Since he began cooperating with the government in January 2018, Maani had secretly recorded “dozens and dozens and dozens” of others caught up in the feds’ public corruption probe.

The FBI also gave him $75,000, which he paid out in installments to then-state Sen. Martin Sandoval, D-Chicago, who’d been blocking Jones’ bill in Springfield as chair of the Senate Transportation committee. Maani handed over a stack of cash to Sandoval after Jones left a June 2019 dinner between the three, at which Sandoval had hinted at receiving benefits from Maani and told Jones that Maani “wants to be your friend.”

“If he was as dirty as they say he is, why not just give him an envelope of cash?” Henderson said of Jones. “Instead, what they did — your government, our government — they worked with Omar to get the senator to take a bribe. ...He doesn’t go to Omar; they send Omar to him.”

Maani, who admitted to the jury that he’d spent nearly his entire adult life paying bribes to get ahead in business, was eventually charged with one count of bribery in 2020 but after his three-year deferred prosecution agreement ended, the feds dropped the charge. Maani’s cooperation resulted in a handful of guilty pleas, including from Sandoval before he died in late 2020.

Henderson attempted to cast doubt on Maani’s testimony by bringing up his admission that he’d once forged one of his mother’s checks in service of a bribe.

“This is a guy who literally stole from his own mother,” he said. “Literally.”

Jury gets the case Monday afternoon

The jury was released to deliberate shortly after 2:30 p.m. and left the Dirksen Federal Courthouse about two hours later, having sent two notes to the judge asking for additional copies of transcripts for the secret recordings.

Jurors have already given the trial more time than the originally expected two-week timeframe, owing to both court delays and Jones’ surprise decision last week to testify in his own defense. He’s the first sitting state official in 20 years to do so.

But taking the witness stand opened Jones up to grueling cross-examination from Ardam, and both she and Kolluri on Monday accused the senator of lying in his testimony.

“When Mr. Jones was on the stand, he tried to have us believe that some pretty basic words in the English language don’t mean what we know they mean,” Kolluri said.

Kolluri pointed to Jones’ interpretation of when he relented to Maani’s insistence that he come up with a “goal” for him to give to the senator’s next upcoming fundraiser while the pair dined at a downtown Chicago steakhouse in July 2019.

“I don’t give folks numbers,” Jones said. “Just whatever you can raise for me, that’d be nice. I’m not greedy.”

But after Maani pressed him, Jones came up with $5,000.

“If you can raise me five grand, that’d be good,” the senator said between bites of his meal.

Jones last week said that he meant Maani could give him anything “between zero and $5,000,” which Kolluri scoffed at Monday.

The prosecutor also expressed skepticism at Jones’ explanations of why he’d repeatedly said things like “I get it,” “I feel you,” “you’re good” and “yeah” when responding to the same suggestions from Maani he said made him uncomfortable. According to Jones, “It’s just how I speak.”

“I wasn’t agreeing with anything he said, I was just hearing him out,” Kolluri said sarcastically, paraphrasing Jones’ testimony.

Kolluri pointed to Maani’s and Jones’ Aug. 8, 2019, dinner during which Jones suggested that instead of a campaign contribution, Maani could instead sponsor a job fair in his district.

After Maani asked whether that would have to be reported on state campaign finance reports, Jones said no; Maani could instead pay for food or “giveaways” at the fair. On the witness stand last week, the senator explained that anything under $150 doesn’t have to be itemized on his quarterly campaign finance reports and said he’d imagined Maani could pay for pizzas or a case of bottled water.

“Okay, that’s the most important thing. I just want to, uh, avoid at all costs,” Maani said of having his expenditures be publicly reported. “You know what I’m saying?”

“Yeah, yeah,” Jones said.

After Maani told Jones it was his “cardinal rule” that he had to “just kind of conceal” the contribution, Jones responded with, “I feel you.”

“Six years later, on the stand — after he’s been charged w bribery — Mr. Jones testified those words meant he heard Omar Maani but wasn’t agreeing,” Kolluri said. “Come on, in what world does that make sense?”

Prosecutors also hammered on what turned out to be a no-work job for Jones’ former intern, Christopher Katz. Earlier this month, Maani testified that Jones’ request that he hire Katz directly after Jones came up with the $5,000 figure at their July 2019 dinner caught him off guard.

“But most importantly, I have an intern working in my office,” Jones told Maani. “And I’m trying to find him another job, another part-time job.”

Read more: Sen. Jones sent spending money to former intern before getting him job feds say was a bribe

Jones testified that he’d made the request because he’d seen dozens of college students like Katz working for SafeSpeed when he took a tour of the company’s offices a few months prior. Katz actually hadn’t worked for Jones for more than a year at that point but the two were in touch about whether Jones could help him find employment.

But by their next dinner, Maani was expressing doubt to Jones that he’d be able to get Katz hired at SafeSpeed without attracting questions from his colleagues. Instead, Maani floated hiring Katz to work directly for him on a research project.

A few days later, Maani called Jones to tell him that he didn’t have much work for Maani but would put him on his payroll anyway. Jones raised no strong objections, only telling Maani, “Yeah, but um, let’s make sure we find him some work.”

“The defendant knew this was not a normal job,” Ardam said Monday, pointing out Jones had told Katz he “got the job” even before he’d sent Katz’s resume to Maani. “What that means is the defendant knew this was part of the bribe.”

Although Maani and Jones agreed that $15 per hour for Katz was fair, Jones denied knowing what Katz was being paid when a pair of FBI agents came knocking at his door on Sept. 24, 2019. It’s one of three lies the feds allege Jones told about the purported bribery scheme in that interview.

Read more: Feds set to rest case in Sen. Emil Jones III red-light camera bribery trial

The feds also say Jones lied about his promise to “protect” Maani and SafeSpeed from then-state Rep. David McSweeney, R-Barrington Hills, a friend of Jones who was also in favor of legislation to study red-light cameras but only because he wanted to see the industry abolished in Illinois.

Prosecutors also accused Jones of falsely telling FBI agents that he and Maani never discussed how a campaign contribution could be made without having it publicly reported.

Henderson, however, pointed out what Jones already testified to: He was nervous when the FBI agents were in his living room. The senator even flubbed the name of SafeSpeed’s CEO, Nikki Zollar, confusing it with former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley.

“Is he supposed to remember every single solitary word he said in a dinner 30 days ago, 60 days ago, 90 days ago?” Henderson asked the jury. “I guess according to the government, yes.”

But Kolluri encouraged jurors to listen back to the interview, which the agents secretly taped, as well as the recordings from each of the three dinners Jones shared with Maani.

“Sen. Jones put up his power for sale, as we saw on those recordings,” he said. “It was crystal clear.”

House Bill 121 would restrict access to bathrooms based strictly on biological sex. (Micah Drew/ Daily Montanan)Say a man who transitioned after being born a woman walks into a women’s bathroom, as House Bill 121 would require him to do.
The man has XX chromosomes but transitioned, and he outwardly presents as a man.
Monday, Missoula County District Court Judge Shane Vannatta asked lawyers in a dispute about HB 121 how Missoula County, for instance, should enforce  that situation.
House Bill 121 requires public restrooms and changing areas exclusively for males or females, requires people to use bathrooms based on “external genitalia present at birth,” and defines sex as strictly male and female.
It says a library or prison or museum, for example, “shall take reasonable steps” to provide individuals with privacy from members of the opposite sex.
Also, it says an individual who “encounters another individual of the opposite sex” in the restroom can file a civil lawsuit against the “covered entity,” such as a prison, domestic violence shelter or school.
In the court hearing on HB 121, Vannatta said in his hypothetical situation, a clerk who sees the transgender man walk into the bathroom might decide to sue the county.
The bill allows individuals to sue for failing to “take reasonable steps” to prohibit the other individuals from using the bathroom or changing room designated for the opposite sex.
Then what?
Thane Johnson, on behalf of the state, said it was the toughest situation he could think of related to the bill at issue in Perkins et al v. State of Montana.
“You raise a good hypothetical. I can’t deny that,” Johnson said.
But he also said the bill is “a little bit bigger” than being just a “bathroom bill.” He said the bill aims to protect women and young girls in facilities “where they have no choice,” such as detention centers.
“I think there are other issues that are dealt with by this bill that are important, and that’s my point,” Johnson said.
But Alex Rate, with the ACLU of Montana, said that situation is one of the “fatal problems” with the “disingenuous” law, and it’s one way harm starts to pile up for the clients of the ACLU and Legal Voice.
The plaintiffs allege the bill is illegal and violates the rights of clients under the state constitution, including “the rights to equal protection, privacy, to pursue life’s basic necessities, and due process.”
Rate said the clerk would sue Missoula County for failing to enforce HB 121, discovery would happen, and the transgender man just wanting to use the bathroom would be caught in the middle.
“That individual — who is doing nothing wrong and who is entirely removed from the dispute between the individual and the covered entity — would be dragged into a lawsuit,” Rate said.
In his remarks to the court, Rate also said the enforcement was problematic in that it created a “bounty hunter system.”
“It turns our state into a vigilante state, where ordinary citizens are incentivized to file lawsuits against state and local governments if they perceive that somebody is using the, quote, incorrect public facility,” Rate said.
Rate said the harm to people who are transgender and intersex starts immediately, although Johnson countered that the law needs time to be implemented. However, the lawyers agreed to Vannatta’s request for time to issue an order.
The bill landed in court on the same day Gov. Greg Gianforte signed it, and Vannatta issued a temporary restraining order soon after, halting implementation of the bill, but only for a matter of days.
With approval from the lawyers, however, Vannatta said Monday that he wanted to extend that expiring order through May 16 in order to give himself time to craft a new decision on the request to stop the bill through a final court decision.
The ACLU had asked for an order from the bench, or an immediate and verbal ruling, but Vannatta said he wanted to issue one in writing so the parties would have a rationale they could appeal.
In recent years, the Montana Legislature has approved numerous bills that affect people who are transgender, and in his arguments Monday, Rate said HB 121 is the most recent volley in a trend since 2018.
“This case challenges the latest manifestation of this state’s peculiar obsession with singling out transgender and intersex Montanans for discrimination and harassment,” Rate said.
Rate said the bill includes a definition of sex from an earlier bill, Senate Bill 458, which the same district court found had unconstitutionally treated cisgender individuals — whose gender aligns with their sex at birth — differently than transgender and intersex individuals.
But Rate said HB 121 is “particularly bigoted” because it bans trans people from using public restrooms, changing rooms and sleeping quarters — at domestic violence shelters — that correspond with their gender identity.
“It forces trans people to out themselves by using public facilities according to their sex assigned at birth,” Rate said.
He said it prevents intersex people from using public facilities altogether.
Rate said the case reminded him of the fight over a different bill, one that eliminated Election Day registration. He said the purported government interest was to prevent voter fraud, but the state’s lead witness had to search historical records to find any.
In the current case, he said, nearly 60% of people who are transgender report avoiding public restrooms to avoid confrontation given they are already vulnerable to violence, and his client’s declaration included evidence of fear.
And laws already on the books address other protections.
“We’ve got laws criminalizing indecent exposure,” Rate said. “We’ve got laws criminalizing sexual assault and violence.
“So there’s no need to adopt a law as draconian as HB 121 when individuals in public facilities are already protected.”
On behalf of the state, Johnson, however, said the law was the “Safe Space for Women and Girls Act,” a protection that resonated with his own experience.
Johnson said he recalled serving as a tribal court judge and seeing the number of young girls that became victims of sexual assault, and because federal prosecutors were slow in prosecuting, he saw juvenile offenders who were young girls.
“They acted out as a result of being a victim of sexual crime,” Johnson said.
He said he acknowledges people who are transgender are vulnerable, but he said they are not the only ones in that situation. He pointed to young girls, and especially those in a juvenile detention center, which the bill includes.
Johnson also said the Montana Supreme Court and the U.S. Supreme Court could help if they decided whether sex discrimination includes transgender discrimination, but the question is still an open one.
At the same time, Johnson said, some of the fixes are simple, such as privacy for bathrooms. 
He said at one campus, “single use” simply meant creating privacy in the form of porta potties and ensuring locks on doors.
Vannatta, though, imagined what might happen during a game if the University of Montana decided to turn a bathroom with multiple stalls into a single-use restroom with 40 people waiting in line.
However, the judge also said the issue Johnson raised about safety in corrections facilities resonated with him.
Vannatta said he had talked to many judges who are “perplexed” when it comes time to sentence people to jail or prison who are trans or in the midst of a transition in ways that keep them safe and keep the broader population safe.
The judge also asked Johnson questions about a couple of situations the lawyer raised, including a Helena girl scared by a man who followed her into a bathroom.
“Was that a trans man or transgender individual?” the judge said.
Johnson said he didn’t have any indication the person was transgender, but he said the person assaulted the girl.
Vannatta also asked if Johnson had evidence that trans individuals have committed sexual assault in bathrooms or changing areas, the areas the bill is intended to protect.
Johnson said not in Montana, but outside the state. In response to the judge’s request for statistics, Johnson said he believed a person in North Carolina was sexually assaulted in a school bathroom by a person who had claimed to be transgender.
However, he said he believes “there are probably statistics developing,” and if the case proceeds, the state would compile them as best it could.
In general, Johnson said it was too early to see how the law was working, and he urged the court to take a step back and allow it to take effect.
“My bottom line, your honor, is this case cries for some factual development. Let’s see how it plays out,” Johnson said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Bathroom-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-21 21:02:31.706806

The order, issued Monday, instructs the USDA to redo its environmental analysis to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), which requires the department to demonstrate its actions cause no significant harm to the environment. 
The ruling does not affect lethal predator control efforts employed by the Nevada Division of Wildlife, except those involving federally-protected lands. 
“The decision keeps native carnivores like mountain lions and coyotes from being killed across Nevada’s 65 congressionally-designated Wilderness areas and 62 specially-protected Wilderness Study Areas, an area spanning over 6.2 million acres of federally-managed public lands, or roughly 9% of the state’s total landmass,” WildEarth Guardians, an environmental organization, said in a news release.  
“As the agency attempts to fix its deeply flawed and now invalid environmental analysis, top predators can continue playing their vital ecological roles free of human control and persecution in the state’s most remote and rugged public lands,” Jennifer Schwartz, Senior Staff Attorney for WildEarth Guardians, said in a news release.  
“Nevada’s wilderness and other specially protected areas should be sanctuaries for wildlife and places where people can experience true wilderness—not landscapes laced with traps, snares, and cyanide bombs,” Paul Ruprecht, Nevada Director for Western Watersheds Project, said in a news release. “The court’s decision underscores that the public has a right to know where and how lethal predator control is happening, especially when it puts people, pets, and native wildlife at risk.”
WildEarth Guardians and Western Watersheds Project, in 2021, challenged a decision allowing USDA-Wildlife Services in Nevada to employ aerial gunning, poisoning, trapping, and shooting of foxes, bobcats, coyotes, mountain lions, beavers, badgers, rabbits, ravens, and other wildlife on Nevada’s federal lands. The ruling marks the second time USDA Wildlife Services has shut down its lethal predator control operations since 2016, when it agreed not to respond to requests for predator control while it conducted an environmental analysis. 
The effort resumed following a court order allowing the agency to protect livestock grazing on federal lands. Monday’s ruling from the Ninth Circuit invalidated that order. 
The court ruled USDA Wildlife Services’ environment analysis was too broad and failed to consider the potential impacts on public safety and health of lethal methods such as lead shot, poisons, and cyanide ejectors, which were approved by President Donald Trump’s first administration. 
The agency’s new analysis must rely on current scientific studies of the long-term efficacy of predator control methods.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/JoeBischopink-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-04-21 21:02:31.706806

(Photo by Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)Advocates from across the Navajo Nation gathered in front of the nation’s council meeting hall Monday, hoping to tell Navajo President Buu Nygren how frustrated and disappointed they are by his abrupt endorsement of Donald Trump’s executive order aiming to reinvigorate the nation’s coal industry.
But Nygren was in Washington, D.C. As part of his “engagement with our federal partners,” his office said on social media, he couldn’t address the Navajo Nation Council for its first meeting. That left advocates even more frustrated, they said, that they couldn’t speak to Nygren about their concerns.
Uranium transport through Navajo Nation sparks concerns in New Mexico

Advocates in speeches Monday pointed to the Nygren administration’s recent confidential agreement with uranium company Energy Fuels,, which allows the company to transport uranium ore across the Navajo Nation for a price and in exchange for the company’s promise to clean up abandoned uranium mines across the Navajo Nation.
Because of the late January agreement, several trucks carrying uranium ore and other material traverse the western side of the Navajo Nation most days, carrying the material from a mine near the Grand Canyon to a mill in Utah.
The agreement would also apply to the eastern side of the Navajo Nation, which falls in New Mexico, if a proposed massive uranium mine near Mount Taylor is ever approved for operation. That project, called the Roca Honda Mine, is now a “priority project” at the Cibola National Forest, thanks to Trump’s executive order seeking to boost domestic energy production.
In addition to the uranium transport agreement, advocates on Monday also noted that Nygren last week endorsed Trump’s “Reinvigorating America’s Beautiful Clean Coal Industry” executive order and took a selfie with him during the signing ceremony.

Advocate Percy Deal spoke at the rally Monday in English and Navajo, saying Peabody Energy’s coal mining operations beginning in the 1960s have drained an untold amount of water from aquifer vital to in his community on the Black Mesa plateau in northeast Arizona for generations, plus contributed to climate change.
So he was surprised and alarmed that Nygren, whom he called “Hastiin Bich’ah Lizhinigii” in Navajo or “the man in the black hat” in English, would endorse executive orders boosting coal production from Trump, “Mr. yellow hair,” without consulting people like him who have been so harmed by coal extraction.
“All these things probably are now in the hands of Mr. yellow hair. The sad thing is that Hastiin Bich’ah Lizhinigii never spoke to any of us. Never did,” Deal told attendees. “He’s got a vehicle here furnished by the tribe. He could have gone out to, for example, the Black Mesa and talked to us.”
Long-stalled NM uranium mines now ‘priority projects’ at Cibola Forest, leader tells employees

Nygren’s spokesperson, Alistair Bitsoi, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the group’s criticism Monday afternoon. But Nygren in a letter published Monday on social media defended his endorsement of Trump’s energy executive orders.
“I accepted the invitation [to the White House] because the three executive orders that President Trump signed are intended to advance America’s dominance in energy,” Nygren wrote. “The Navajo Nation shares the goal of American energy dominance because the Navajo Nation has for 100 years been a part of the energy framework of the United States.
“Our lands have natural resources and transmission lines, also known as the grid. We will forever be part of the American energy framework and therefore Navajo’s voice and involvement in these discussions is required,” he wrote.
Advocates said that Nygren’s latest endorsements are a stark contrast from language on his website listing his priorities for the environment, which begins by saying, “Mitigating the effects of climate change on Navajo land is our responsibility, and the Nygren Administration will ensure Navajo community voices are empowered in protecting our water, air and land.”

Larry J. King, who grew up in Church Rock, said at the rally that he once worked in uranium mines in New Mexico and in 1979 he witnessed the United Nuclear spill there, which is the largest accidental release of radiation in United States history. He told Source New Mexico that Nygren, who took office in January 2023, repeatedly promised during his election to clean up uranium mine waste from his community at Red Water Pond but then ignored his calls.
That’s one reason King said he does not believe Nygren’s promises that the new transport agreement will result in the cleanup of legacy uranium mines in areas like Red Water Pond. For one thing, he’s skeptical of “high-pressure slurry ablation,” which Navajo Nation officials have touted as an emerging treatment method for the cleanup process.
King noted that Nygren endorsed Kamala Harris and traveled with the Democratic delegation to the Democratic convention last year. He said he sees Nygren’s latest endorsements as a betrayal of his promises and his constituents.
“He’s just making a turnaround, and in support of all this industry wanting to come and desecrate,” he said. “A repeat of what we’ve been through trying to remedy the situation from the last 30 to 40 years. He’s just, he’s going back.”

Zack Fields, D-Anchorage, speaks Friday, April 26, 2024, on the floor of the Alaska House of Representatives. (Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Legislation passed Wednesday by the Alaska House of Representatives would require the state’s school districts to adopt policies that restrict the use of cellphones by students during school hours.
House Bill 57, which will advance to the Senate after a 34-6 vote, does not require districts to ban students’ cellphones altogether but does require them to regulate students’ use of phones during regular school hours, including during lunch and the time between classes.
An earlier version of the bill would have required the Alaska Department of Education and Early Development to draft a model policy as an example for districts to follow, but that requirement was eliminated in a floor amendment. 
The amendment also eliminated a requirement that school districts report their academic performance before and after the new cellphone policy.
Cellphones would be allowed for translation purposes, in emergencies, for medical reasons, and as needed for instruction.
Restrictions on cellphones in the classroom are growing in popularity across the country, and eight states — including Florida, California, Virginia and Indiana — have banned them altogether. 
Every state except Nevada and Wyoming has proposed or is considering a statewide ban or restriction, according to a tally kept by the Associated Press. Some members of Congress are considering national legislation.
The bans come amid a broadening base of research that shows smartphone and social media use can contribute to negative mental health and poor academic achievement among students in grade school and high school.
Several lawmakers, including Gov. Mike Dunleavy, proposed legislation this year that would restrict cellphone use in schools.
HB 57, from Rep. Zack Fields, D-Anchorage, became the leading bill. 
On April 11, Rep. Justin Ruffridge, R-Soldotna, proposed an amendment that rewrote the bill’s language to reflect a section of an education bill approved by the Senate Education Committee.
Ruffridge said he thinks Alaskans believe in local control of education.
“The language of Amendment No. 2 gives that ability to govern yourselves and be as strict or as permissive as possible at the district level,” he said. 
Fields spoke against the amendment, saying it turned HB 57 from a cellphone ban into “a cellphone discouragement policy.”
The amendment passed on a 19-18 vote.
Five days later, when the bill came up for a final vote, Fields voted for it.
“The amendment adopted to this bill substantially weakens it,” Fields said. “I’m still going to vote for the bill and send it to the next body because I think there’s an opportunity to resurrect better language.”
Other legislators also stood up in support, offering anecdotal stories about the way cellphones have affected their children and children they know. 
“Parents and our state are at war against these screens,” said Rep. Andrew Gray, D-Anchorage, speaking in favor of the bill.
A handful of legislators spoke against the bill, including Ruffridge, whose amendment significantly rewrote it.
Ruffridge said he supports giving local school districts the authority to make decisions like this.
“It’s not up to us to do,” he said.
Rep. David Nelson, R-Anchorage, said that there are plenty of reasons to be concerned about kids’ mental health, but that is a wider issue than just cellphones.
“If we’re going to be trusting young people and saying, ‘Hey, you are the future,’ why are we banning communication devices in public schools?” he said. 
HB 57 is subject to a reconsideration vote on the House floor before it advances to the Senate, but legislators said they don’t expect the tally to change much, if at all.
The bill has been tentatively scheduled for a hearing in the Senate Finance Committee on Wednesday.

(Courtesy of the Pennsylvania Association of Staff Nurses and Professionals)A California for-profit health care company said Monday it plans to close its remaining hospitals in Pennsylvania’s fifth most populous county and fire thousands of employees after failing to find a buyer.
Prospect Medical Holdings filed papers Monday in bankruptcy court seeking approval to close the two Crozer Health System hospitals in Delaware County before they run out of cash. The announcement was met with condemnation from state and local officials, who had provided a $40 million lifeline while the company worked to reach a solution to keep them open.
“Prospect’s decision to move forward with the closure of the Crozer Health System is a devastating and disgraceful blow to our communities, our healthcare workers, and every patient who has ever relied on our local hospital system,” state lawmakers from Delaware County said in a joint statement Monday. “Yet again, Prospect decided to put profits over patients by putting Crozer’s assets up for auction.”
The closures will affect Crozer Chester Medical Center in Upland and Taylor Hospital in Ridley Park, which remained open after Prospect closed two other Delaware County hospitals in recent years. Three ambulatory surgery and imaging centers will remain open pending a sale.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“Prospect Medical Holdings, the for-profit owner of Crozer Health, pillaged these hospitals for their own gain – and today, we see the result of their greed and mismanagement with the announced closure and loss of critical health care services for the people of Delaware County,” Gov. Josh Shapiro said in a statement.
Crozer Health System has received $5 million in annual state funding for the last decade. Shapiro said his office would continue fighting for the patients who have been harmed by the closures.
“Prospect caused this crisis, and they must be held accountable for their reckless actions that have led to today’s announcement,” Shapiro said, adding that the bankruptcy process should include a full review of the company’s conduct and mismanagement. He also called on lawmakers to pass legislation he has proposed to get private equity out of the health care business in Pennsylvania.
The closures will leave Delaware County, population 576,000, with only two hospitals, owned by Main Line Health and Trinity Health Mid-Atlantic. Prospect, with more than 2,600 employers, is one of the county’s largest employers. It owns 16 hospitals in California, Connecticut, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island.
A spokesperson for Prospect said it recognizes the impact its decision will have on patients and employees and that the company worked tirelessly with state Attorney General Dave Sunday and other officials but were unable to find a viable alternative.
“At this time, the focus at Crozer Health remains on seamlessly transitioning patients to other health facilities so that they can continue to receive the critical, uninterrupted care they require, and to support Crozer Health team members as they seek to identify other employment opportunities,” the spokesperson said.
Previously owned by Los Angeles-based private equity firm Leonard Green & Partners, Prospect was saddled with $1.3 billion debt as its owners took more than $645 million in dividends and fees, according to ProPublica.

Prospect filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January while it attempted to restructure. It sought approval to sell the hospitals to a new owner in exchange for assuming their existing liabilities. 
The following month, Prospect began working with Sunday to appoint a receiver and facilitate $20.2 million in state funding to keep the hospitals running while Prospect and the potential new owner worked to finalize the deal. The philanthropic organization, Foundation for Delaware County, provided another $20 million.
Sunday said in a statement that he was deeply disappointed by the closure announcement.
“Along with the Governor’s office and other state and local leaders, we worked tirelessly to avoid this outcome. Unfortunately, the damage inflicted by Leonard Green & Partners — the private equity owners of Prospect — who prioritized their own wealth over the wellbeing of a community, was too much to overcome,” Sunday said, adding that his office would continue working through the bankruptcy process to pursue the state’s financial claims and hold Prospect accountable.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/private-equity-picket-1024x768-1.jpg,,,2025-04-21 21:02:31.706806

Greg Gianforte.
Last week, House Bill 316 sponsored by Rep. Lee Deming, R-Laurel, failed to earn the minimum 100 votes out of 150 in the Montana Legislature needed to present a constitutional amendment to voters.
The bill came following the passage in November 2024 of Constitutional Initiative 128 to protect abortion. It passed with 58% of the vote.
In a statement Friday, Planned Parenthood Advocates of Montana CEO and President Martha Fuller said Montanans will rest easier knowing the attempt to ignore their wishes and “undermine the right to an abortion” has failed.
“The government is not now and never will be the expert on the lives, families or pregnancies of Montanans — it’s high time for politicians to respect the personal and medical privacy of their constituents,” Fuller said in a statement about HB 316.
The bill earned 58 “yes” votes in the House and 33 “yes” votes in the Senate on third readings.
The 2025 Montana Legislature has taken up other bills related to abortion, although legislators tabled a number of them. However, House Bill 388 and Senate Bill 154 both are headed to the desk of Gianforte.
HB 388, sponsored by Rep. Amy Regier, R-Kalispell, would allow pregnancy centers to operate without regulation.
Proponents including the Montana Family Foundation said those centers should not be punished for refusing to facilitate abortions, according to reporting from the Montana State News Bureau.
Opponents said those facilities are not required to provide legitimate medical information or protect privacy, and they misinform clients.
SB 154, sponsored by Sen. Daniel Emrich, R-Great Falls, prohibits the sale of whole human bodies and human fetal tissue, which is already illegal under federal law.
On the Senate floor earlier this session, Emrich said it was “a great bill” and makes sure bodies and fetal tissue are “being donated and not sold as a commodity inside the state of Montana.”
In the final debate on HB 316, which took place in the Senate on Thursday, Sen. Vince Ricci, R-Billings, said he couldn’t imagine a greater violation of human dignity or of privacy than abortion.
“The state has a compelling interest (in) protecting the lives of the most vulnerable human beings, and the human being … in the womb has … a life interest equal to that of his or her mother,” said Ricci, who carried the bill.
Sen. Jeremy Trebas, R-Great Falls, said those who supported the protection of abortion approved a measure that is “immoral and wrong.”
“I think abortion is murder, and I’ll catch heck for that I’m sure, but it’s the killing of a person, a formed, live person. Making it a right to privacy is baloney,” Trebas said.
He said the Montana Supreme Court made an inappropriate link to privacy when it extended it to abortion because “this is the child’s body that we’re talking about. And they have a right to life.”
Minority Leader Pat Flowers said Montanans don’t support the attacks against the right to privacy, and it was time to focus on other issues, such as tax bills.
“Call it baloney or not, it’s in the Constitution, and it’s an important right,” said Flowers, D-Belgrade.
Sen. Cora Neumann, D-Bozeman, said the bill would outlaw in vitro fertilization, and Montanans all love mothers and babies and want more of them in the state.
Neumann also asked if the state should control men’s bodies.
“If we’re going to try to have this type of control over women’s bodies, because the fetus is part of the woman’s body, are we also going to try to have this type of control over men’s bodies?” Neumann said.“Are we going to regulate ejaculation? This is what we’re talking about. We are talking about regulating the internal parts of bodies.”
Sen. Laura Smith, D-Helena, said the bill could create a “legal quagmire” for any doctor who needed to provide medical care to a pregnant woman who was experiencing a miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy.
“This legislation would effectively tie doctors’ hands rather than allowing them to treat their patients without fear or prosecution,” said Smith, a lawyer.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1422564336-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-21 20:04:26.147965

(Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate)The League of Women Voters of Arkansas filed a federal lawsuit Monday alleging that eight new laws governing direct democracy are unconstitutional.
Direct democracy is the process by which Arkansans can propose new laws or constitutional amendments and put them to a statewide vote. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, Arkansas is one of 24 states to allow this process, which involves collecting a minimum amount of signatures on petitions for proposed ballot language.
The Republican supermajority in the Arkansas Legislature passed a slew of bills during the 2025 legislative session, which ended last week, placing new restrictions on the solicitation, collection and submission of signatures for citizen-led ballot initiatives. Democratic lawmakers and members of the public said the restrictions will have a chilling effect on the people’s right to have a say in their own laws and Constitution.
The legal complaint lists the eight laws the plaintiffs consider violations of the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment right to freedom of speech and the Fourteenth Amendment right to due process under the law:

Act 153 clarifies that the certification of ballot titles for initiatives, referendums and constitutional amendments as well as the signatures collected for those measures would only be valid for the next general election.
Act 154 expands the attorney general’s existing authority to reject a proposal if it conflicts with the U.S. Constitution or federal statutes and prevents the sponsor of a measure from submitting more than one conflicting petition simultaneously.
Act 218 requires signature gatherers, known as canvassers, to inform potential signers that petition fraud is a criminal offense.
Act 240 requires canvassers to request a photo ID from potential signers.
Act 241 requires canvassers to file a “true affidavit” with the secretary of state, the executive branch office that oversees elections, certifying they complied with the Arkansas Constitution and state laws related to canvassing, perjury, forgery and fraudulent practices in the procurement of petition signatures. Signatures submitted without the affidavit would not be counted.
Act 273 disqualifies signatures collected by canvassers if the secretary of state finds “by a preponderance of evidence” that they violated state law collecting the signatures.
Act 274 requires potential signers to read a petition’s ballot title or have it read to them; failure to ensure this would result in a misdemeanor charge against the canvasser.
Act 453 requires canvassers who are paid to collect signatures to be permanent residents of Arkansas. A sponsor of a ballot measure would be fined $2,500 per paid canvasser hired who does not meet this requirement.

The plaintiffs also ask the court to block defendant Secretary of State Cole Jester from enforcing four of the challenged laws — Acts 218, 240, 241 and 274 — due to the Arkansas Constitution’s provision that ensures the right to direct democracy.
The complaint also asks the court to declare portions of existing ballot initiative law adopted since 2013 unconstitutional under the state and federal constitutions.
Supporters of the new laws said during the legislative session that they will protect the integrity of the ballot initiative process and discourage sloppy, misleading or illegal behavior by canvassers.
Instead, the laws “weaponize bureaucracy to suppress citizen participation and violate the fundamental rights guaranteed by both the Arkansas and U.S. Constitutions,” said David Couch, the plaintiffs’ lead attorney and a sponsor of multiple past direct democracy efforts, in Monday’s news release from the League of Women Voters announcing the lawsuit.
The laws also “will permanently dismantle the ballot initiative process in Arkansas” if they are not struck down in court, Couch said.
Six of the eight laws went into effect immediately upon Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ signature due to their emergency clauses. Acts 153 and 453 will go into effect in August, 90 days after the Legislature adjourns sine die in May.

 ‘Significant barriers’

Sen. Kim Hammer, R-Benton, was the Senate sponsor of all eight laws being challenged. He announced in January that he will run next year for secretary of state; Jester cannot run for the position because he was appointed, not elected.
Named as plaintiffs in addition to the League of Women Voters of Arkansas are its President Bonnie Miller, its Benton County chapter President Danielle Quesnell, and Save AR Democracy, a ballot question committee seeking to collect signatures for a proposed constitutional amendment for next year’s ballot.
“Let’s be clear: these laws spell the death of direct democracy in Arkansas,” Miller said in the news release. “For decades, Arkansans of all political persuasions have utilized the ballot initiative process to pass popular reforms in our state. Now, the legislature wants to kill the process.”
The League of Women Voters of Arkansas is a frequent participant in direct democracy efforts and “cannot qualify a measure for the ballot without the use of paid canvassers,” according to the complaint.
“The statutes sought to be declared unconstitutional have and will substantially restrict the ability of LWVAR and its members to participate in the initiative and referendum process,” the complaint states.
Acts 218, 240 and 274 in particular “impose significant barriers on sponsors’ ability to recruit canvassers — who may not want to risk potential criminal penalties resulting from an inadvertent failure to comply with the acts’ arduous and technical rules — and canvassers’ ability to gather signatures,” according to the plaintiffs.

complaint from LWV 
Couch has twice submitted ballot language on behalf of LWVAR and Save AR Democracy to amend the state Constitution’s initiative and referendum processes. Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin rejected the effort for a second time last week, calling the ballot language misleading.
Griffin’s office will represent Jester and is “reviewing the lawsuit and stand[ing] ready to defend the state,” spokesperson Jeff LeMaster said.
U.S. District Judge Timothy Brooks of the Western District of Arkansas has been assigned to the case.
 Past legislative action and ballot measures

State lawmakers have previously sought voter approval for changes to the direct democracy process.
In 2020, roughly 56% of Arkansas voters rejected a proposed constitutional amendment that the Legislature referred to the ballot in 2019. It would have required canvassers to gather signatures from at least 45 counties, and it would have moved up several petition deadlines, among other things.
Then in 2022, roughly 59% of Arkansans voted down an amendment put forth by the Legislature in 2021 to require a 60% majority to pass most statewide ballot initiatives.
The League of Women Voters of Arkansas publicly opposed the 2022 ballot measure. Rep. David Ray, R-Maumelle, introduced that measure and was the House sponsor of this year’s Act 153 and Act 154.
In 2023, the Legislature passed and Sanders signed a law increasing the number of counties where ballot initiative supporters must gather signatures from 15 to 50. Couch and the League of Women Voters challenged this law in Pulaski County Circuit Court, where the case is still pending. Rep. Kendon Underwood, R-Cave Springs, was the House sponsor of this law and of five of the eight new laws being challenged.

The higher threshold for secretary of state approval did not stop reproductive rights advocates from collecting more than 102,000 signatures in 53 counties in an attempt to put a proposed limited right to abortion on the November 2024 ballot. Citizen-led constitutional amendments require 90,704 signatures.
The proposed abortion amendment did not end up on the ballot after then-Secretary of State John Thurston’s office disqualified more than 14,000 signatures on a technicality and the state Supreme Court upheld this decision. Supporters of the amendment accused Thurston of abusing his power, while supporters of this year’s fleet of bills from Hammer publicly alleged fraud and misconduct by canvassers for the abortion amendment.
After Thurston was elected state treasurer in November, Sanders appointed Jester to succeed him, and Jester took office Jan. 2. In February, he expressed support for Hammer’s bills and claimed a “top-to-bottom security review” of Arkansas’ election procedures found “thousands of fraudulent signatures” on petitions for ballot measures.
Hammer sponsored an additional bill that would have created an enforcement agency within the Secretary of State’s office to investigate the validity of submitted ballot initiative documents. The bill died in a Senate committee after being voted down twice.
On Wednesday, the final day of the session, the House voted down a bill that would have placed a 500-word limit on ballot titles and given the Legislature the authority to overturn voter-approved constitutional amendments. Hammer supported the bill but was not one of its sponsors.
Hammer was among the 20 sponsors, including Ray and Underwood, of a new law not included in the League of Women Voters’ lawsuit. Act 602 requires ballot titles to be at an eighth-grade reading level or lower.

(Photo by Patrick Lohmann / Source NM)Advocates from across the Navajo Nation gathered in front of the nation’s council meeting hall Monday, hoping to tell Navajo President Buu Nygren how frustrated and disappointed they are by his abrupt endorsement of Donald Trump’s executive order aiming to reinvigorate the nation’s coal industry. 
But Nygren was in Washington, D.C. As part of his “engagement with our federal partners,” his office said on social media, he couldn’t address the Navajo Nation Council for its first meeting. That left advocates even more frustrated, they said, that they couldn’t speak to Nygren about their concerns. 
Uranium transport through Navajo Nation sparks concerns in New Mexico

Advocates in speeches Monday pointed to the Nygren administration’s recent confidential agreement with uranium company Energy Fuels,, which allows the company to transport uranium ore across the Navajo Nation for a price and in exchange for the company’s promise to clean up abandoned uranium mines across the Navajo Nation. 
Because of the late January agreement, several trucks carrying uranium ore and other material traverse the western side of the Navajo Nation most days, carrying the material from a mine near the Grand Canyon to a mill in Utah. 
The agreement would also apply to the eastern side of the Navajo Nation, which falls in New Mexico, if a proposed massive uranium mine near Mount Taylor is ever approved for operation. That project, called the Roca Honda Mine, is now a “priority project” at the Cibola National Forest, thanks to Trump’s executive order seeking to boost domestic energy production. 
In addition to the uranium transport agreement, advocates on Monday also noted that Nygren last week endorsed Trump’s “Reinvigorating America’s Beautiful Clean Coal Industry” executive order and took a selfie with him during the signing ceremony.

Advocate Percy Deal spoke at the rally Monday in English and Navajo, saying Peabody Energy’s coal mining operations beginning in the 1960s have drained an untold amount of water from aquifer vital to in his community on the Black Mesa plateau in northeast Arizona for generations, plus contributed to climate change. 
So he was surprised and alarmed that Nygren, whom he called “Hastiin Bich’ah Lizhinigii” in Navajo or “the man in the black hat” in English, would endorse executive orders boosting coal production from Trump, “Mr. yellow hair,” without consulting people like him who have been so harmed by coal extraction. 
“All these things probably are now in the hands of Mr. yellow hair. The sad thing is that Hastiin Bich’ah Lizhinigii never spoke to any of us. Never did,” Deal told attendees. “He’s got a vehicle here furnished by the tribe. He could have gone out to, for example, the Black Mesa and talked to us.”
Long-stalled NM uranium mines now ‘priority projects’ at Cibola Forest, leader tells employees

Nygren’s spokesperson, Alistair Bitsoi, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the group’s criticism Monday afternoon. But Nygren in a letter published Monday on social media defended his endorsement of Trump’s energy executive orders.
“I accepted the invitation [to the White House] because the three executive orders that President Trump signed are intended to advance America’s dominance in energy,” Nygren wrote. “The Navajo Nation shares the goal of American energy dominance because the Navajo Nation has for 100 years been a part of the energy framework of the United States. 
“Our lands have natural resources and transmission lines, also known as the grid. We will forever be part of the American energy framework and therefore Navajo’s voice and involvement in these discussions is required,” he wrote. 
Advocates said that Nygren’s latest endorsements are a stark contrast from language on his website listing his priorities for the environment, which begins by saying, “Mitigating the effects of climate change on Navajo land is our responsibility, and the Nygren Administration will ensure Navajo community voices are empowered in protecting our water, air and land.”

Larry J. King, who grew up in Church Rock, said at the rally that he once worked in uranium mines in New Mexico and in 1979 he witnessed the United Nuclear spill there, which is the largest accidental release of radiation in United States history. He told Source New Mexico that Nygren, who took office in January 2023, repeatedly promised during his election to clean up uranium mine waste from his community at Red Water Pond but then ignored his calls.
That’s one reason King said he does not believe Nygren’s promises that the new transport agreement will result in the cleanup of legacy uranium mines in areas like Red Water Pond. For one thing, he’s skeptical of “high-pressure slurry ablation,” which Navajo Nation officials have touted as an emerging treatment method for the cleanup process. 
King noted that Nygren endorsed Kamala Harris and traveled with the Democratic delegation to the Democratic convention last year. He said he sees Nygren’s latest endorsements as a betrayal of his promises and his constituents. 
“He’s just making a turnaround, and in support of all this industry wanting to come and desecrate,” he said. “A repeat of what we’ve been through trying to remedy the situation from the last 30 to 40 years. He’s just, he’s going back.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_9493-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-21 20:04:26.147965

Brian Kemp gives remarks before signing new lawsuit limits into law at the state Capitol Monday. Jill Nolin/Georgia RecorderGov. Brian Kemp signed new lawsuit award limits into law Monday that he argues will bring balance to Georgia’s legal environment and send relief to the state’s businesses.
The signing marks the end of a bruising fight at the state Capitol with both sides of the aisle feeling the fallout. But the debate over whether the pair of bills will help rein in costs rages on.
“Both of these bills accomplished our goal of leveling the playing field in Georgia’s courtrooms and ensuring our business environment remains the best in the nation,” Kemp said in remarks at the state Capitol Monday.
“(They) simply bring transparency and fairness to a process that has been abused for too long, that has driven up costs for businesses and consumers alike,” he added.
Some of the bills’ biggest supporters caution that it will take time for that relief to come.

Chris Clark, president and CEO of the Georgia Chamber of Commerce said he believed the changes would help the state’s small businesses and health care providers, especially in rural communities – but not overnight.
“It’s not an easy fix. It’s not going to lower rates for everybody tomorrow,” Clark said Monday. “But if it can stabilize them, I think that’s a huge win.”
Insurance Commissioner John King, a Republican who is seen as a potential U.S. Senate candidate, said Monday that he expects to see reduced rates. If not, King said he wants to hear insurers explain why rates are not decreasing.
“We’ve expended so much political currency in getting this done. Now I expect insurance companies to meet us in the middle,” King said.
In January, Kemp pledged to drag lawmakers back to Atlanta for a special session if “meaningful, impactful” changes were not made to the state’s civil litigation system. At one point, the governor’s top aide said the governor’s war chest would be used to back primary challengers for GOP defectors.
In the end, the votes did not fall neatly along party lines, with eight Republican lawmakers in the House voting against Senate Bill 68, which contained the bulk of the changes. It just barely cleared the House with a 91-82 vote after some changes were made.
The main bill includes provisions that would limit owners’ liability for injuries that occur on their property, restrict damages awarded for medical bills, and enable trials to more easily be split into multiple stages so that juries can determine liability and damages separately. 
Georgia Democrats blasted Monday’s bill signing.
“Congratulations to Brian Kemp for threatening and arm-twisting his way to the signing of his number one priority this year: shielding insurance companies from accountability to Georgians in court,” said Matthew Wilson, who is serving as interim chair of the Democratic Party Georgia and who is also a trial lawyer. 
Rep. Tanya Miller, an Atlanta Democrat and an attorney who was a leading voice of opposition to the bills this session, said Monday that if insurance rates do stabilize, it won’t be because the state limited lawsuits in Georgia.
Miller called the Kemp-backed package “a manufactured solution to a manufactured problem.”
“The truth is, this so-called reform was never about solving a real problem,” Miller said. “The tort reform campaign has long been run on half-truths, selective anecdotes, and outright misinformation. There was no crisis in our judicial system, and no credible data supports the claim that injured citizens seeking justice in a court of law caused insurance premiums to spike.”
The bill had faced opposition from crime victims and their families and the trial attorneys who represent them. In the House, the bill was changed to carve out greater protections for survivors of human trafficking, but lawmakers did not extend similar protections to other child, elderly and sexual assault victims.
Critics had argued that the last-minute changes didn’t go far enough.
“Our laws should stand up for injured Georgians, not give big corporations a free pass for turning a blind eye,” said Rep. Stacey Evans, an Atlanta Democrat and an attorney who also helped lead the Democratic opposition to the bill.
In the House, the focus on insurance rates will continue this year. House Speaker Jon Burns last week announced the creation of a blue-ribbon study committee on insurance rates.
“Throughout the interim, the House will take another look at something that’s important: a close look at our state’s insurance markets and premiums to ensure that our fellow Georgians and companies of every size have access to coverage and are not being subjected to unjustified rate increases,” Burns said in remarks at Monday’s bill signing ceremony.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)As higher education faces potential cuts to federal funding and grants, Rhode Island College (RIC) just received a prestigious recognition to help boost its cybersecurity program’s access to federal money and support. 
The National Security Administration (NSA) affirmed RIC as a Center of Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense, the school announced at an on-campus event Monday. The NSA award is given to schools that meet high standards for cybersecurity education, and gives schools additional grant opportunities via the Department of Defense and the National Science Foundation. 
Schools may choose from one of three specialties within the designation, and RIC’s program falls under the “cyber defense” banner. The specific program recognized at RIC is a Bachelor of Arts in computer science with a minor in cybersecurity. RIC’s cybersecurity major, which was added to the school’s offerings after the minor, is eligible to be considered for the NSA branding starting in 2026. 
“This recognition tells the world that Rhode Island College is the gold standard for cybersecurity education,” RIC President Jack Warner said at the event. “Our graduates will enter the workforce prepared to tackle the complex digital challenges of the next century.”
The cybersecurity minor is part of the school’s Institute for Cybersecurity and Emerging Technologies, which opened in 2023. Warner was joined by former U.S. Rep. Jim Langevin, who chairs the Institute, and a sampling of Rhode Island’s elected officials, including all four of the state’s Congressional delegates plus Gov. Dan McKee, state Sen. Lou DiPalma of Middletown and Marianne Raimondo, dean of the business school at RIC.
Langevin, who formerly sat on the U.S. House Subcommittee on Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Protection, was praised by his former colleagues as a keen observer and early evangelist of cybersecurity’s importance within government.    
“This day should probably be known as Jim Langevin Day,” Sen. Jack Reed said during his turn at the podium. “Jim was one of the first members of Congress to recognize the criticality of cyber in our daily lives.”
Delegates emphasized the need for a workforce well-trained in the art of defense. U.S. Rep. Seth Magaziner pointed to China, Russia, Iran and North Korea as significant sources of cyber threats. In his time on the Committee on Homeland Security as well as its cybersecurity subcommittee, Magaziner said he’s learned a lot about other nations’ interest in cybercrime.
“The Chinese government employs literally tens of thousands — not hundreds, not thousands, but tens of thousands of people — whose whole job is to go to work every day and try to hack into the systems of the United States,” Magaziner said. “And when I say hack into systems in the United States, I don’t just mean the Pentagon or government systems. I mean water, sewer, electrical grids, Air Force … just the scale of it is unbelievable.”
Langevin, himself a RIC graduate, acknowledged his emphasis on cyber during his time as a congressman. 
“I cannot think of a more meaningful way to continue my career in cybersecurity policy than to help craft the way we train the next generation of cyber security professionals, cyber defenders,” Langevin said.

The federal designation is another show of support for the institute, following voter approval last November of a ballot question that authorized bond spending for capital improvements at RIC and University of Rhode Island. RIC is using its $73 million share of the nearly $161 million bond to turn Whipple Hall into a dedicated home for the institute, which will include new spaces for students to learn cyber defense techniques. That includes an IBM Cyber Range, which simulates cyberattacks so students can learn how to respond in real time. Construction is currently underway and is expected to be ready by the time the academic year starts in the fall.  
After the speaking program, Suzanne Mello Stark, chair of the Computer Science and Information Systems department at RIC, called the designation “really exciting…It means that we are vetted. Our students are vetted,” she said. “So if they go apply for jobs in cybersecurity, they will see that they come from a school that meets the requirements of the National Security Agency.”
Stark pointed to the federal Scholarship for Service Program as one benefit of the designation. The program lets students get a scholarship, a stipend, and job experience working in government cybersecurity positions ranging from federal roles to tribal positions. 
Douglas Alexander, the institute’s director, said the designation was a bright spot amid recent funding woes nationwide. “When it comes to the military and cyber security, I think we’re all in agreement that this is an important program to keep going and to keep supporting the nation, and I don’t think there’s a lot of partisan politics involved in that,” he said. 
And it’s not just the federal government that needs workers with strong information technology skillsets, Alexander said. Smaller government entities often need competent IT professionals the most, and usually can’t afford dedicated cybersecurity positions like larger companies can. Having previously worked in a municipal role in Warwick Public Schools, Alexander said he “knows that feeling of being pulled in a million different directions.”
“The contrast between the commercial sector and the public sector is really stark, and we really need to do a lot to close the gap,” Alexander said. “Really fundamental IT skills are also something that the state lacks, just in head count, just in personnel. The IT folks that we have are brilliant. I know a lot of them, and they are working really, really hard … but we just don’t have enough of them.”
Students learn the ins and outs of basic network security in the school’s cyber program, Alexander said, with the hope they’ll be able to tackle positions ranging from municipal IT officer to cyber analyst at large corporate firms. And he hopes the new cyber range will facilitate more of these connections between industry, government and higher ed, especially once construction is complete and people know what the space is capable of.
“That kind of cross pollination … is our secret weapon here in Rhode Island, because we can all travel to one place in a day, unlike a lot of states, where you see each other once a year,” Alexander said.

(Courtesy of U.S. Attorney's Office, Southern District of New York)The wife of former Sen. Bob Menendez was convicted Monday of taking bribes and obstructing justice as part of the wide-ranging, international bribery scheme that landed her husband an 11-year prison sentence.
A Manhattan jury found that Nadine Arslanian Menendez, 58, accepted bribes like gold bars, cash, and a Mercedes-Benz in exchange for power and political influence, then tried to hide her actions from federal investigators. Bob Menendez was convicted after a separate trial last year.
Outside the federal courthouse in Manhattan, Nadine Menendez’s attorney Barry Coburn said they respect the judge and the jury, but said it’s a “very rough day for us.” Coburn said it’s “quite possible” they request a delay in sentencing, and declined to comment on whether she’s seeking a pardon. 
“I have no doubt in my mind that the jury did what they thought was right, and I don’t think there’s any point to my standing here and debating any of that, so I decline to do that,” he said. “But the case is not over. There will be other days. ” 
The jury deliberated for about seven hours over two days before finding Menendez guilty of all 15 counts, including bribery, obstruction of justice, extortion, and conspiracy to commit those crimes. Some of those charges carry a maximum sentence of 20 years.  
She is scheduled to be sentenced June 12. That’s six days after Bob Menendez is expected to report to prison for his 11-year sentence.
Bob Menendez was sentenced in January after he was found guilty of taking bribes from three New Jersey businessmen in exchange for political favors for foreign governments and meddling in two criminal investigations. 
Nadine Menendez, wearing a pink mask and a black shawl, did not speak to a crowd of reporters outside the courthouse Monday. Her attorney did not comment on why Bob Menendez didn’t attend his wife’s trial.
The two started dating in 2018 and married in 2020. Two years later, their Englewood Cliffs home was raided by FBI agents who uncovered hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash and gold bars.  
Nadine Menendez was first indicted in September 2023 alongside her husband and three businessmen accused of bribing them, Fred Daibes, Wael Hana, and Jose Uribe. She was diagnosed with breast cancer, requiring treatment that delayed her trial for months.
Hana and Daibes were convicted alongside the former senator in July, and are also set to go to prison. Uribe pleaded guilty to bribing the Menendezes so Bob Menendez would kill a criminal prosecution targeting Uribe. Uribe, who testified in both trials, has not been sentenced yet.",https://newjerseymonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Menendez-Hana-selfie-3.jpg,,,2025-04-21 20:04:26.147965

(Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)The Colorado Senate approved a bill on Monday that would put data protections in place for immigrants and limit where federal immigration authorities can physically access without a warrant. The legislation comes in direct response to the Trump administration’s mass deportation efforts.
Senate Bill 25-276 passed on a 22-13 vote and now heads to the House for consideration in the final weeks of the legislative session.
“The question of who actually gets to be an American, or who actually gets to be protected by the Constitution, is a matter of debate right now in this country and in this state. We’ve had conversations with teachers and with school districts that are concerned about students being too afraid to come to class and about parents being afraid to go to parent teacher conferences. We can do better than that,” said bill sponsor Sen. Julie Gonzales, a Denver Democrat.

The bill would prevent Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers from going into non-public spaces in jails, hospitals, schools and child care centers without a signed, valid warrant. An amendment on the Senate floor added libraries to that list of locations.
It also clarifies that local law enforcement cannot cooperate with ICE to land a person in custody through a detainer request by holding that person in jail beyond their ordered release without a warrant.
The bill also deals heavily with personally identifiable information, or data about a person that is not publicly available such as birthday, addresses, vehicle registration information and immigration status, which federal authorities might want access to in order to identify people to detain and deport. Local governments would not be allowed to share that type of information with ICE under the bill.
Additionally, immigrants would not need to sign an affidavit about their intention to pursue legal status in order to get a driver’s license or in-state tuition.
“We’re in unprecedented times, where people are being unjustly targeted, incarcerated, removed and deported, and we sit in a position where we might be able to push back and help out, to provide some sort of protection,” said Sen. Jessie Danielson, a Wheat Ridge Democrat. “It is a terrifying time for a number of people I know, and for a lot of people I don’t, and it doesn’t take much for me to empathize with that.”
GOP: Lawsuits likely
The bill comes three months into the second administration of President Donald Trump, who has followed through on a campaign promise to increase efforts to detain and remove immigrants who lack legal status. In Colorado, that has resulted in a series of highly-publicized immigration raids at a party in Adams County and residences in Denver and Aurora and in the detention of immigration rights activist Jeanette Vizguerra.
In addition to Gonzales, the bill is sponsored by Sen. Mike Weissman, an Aurora Democrat, Rep. Lorena Garcia, an Adams County Democrat, and Rep. Elizabeth Velasco, a Glenwood Springs Democrat.
Sen. Kyle Mullica, a Thornton Democrat, joined Republicans in opposition to the bill. Mullica said his vote was in response to a series of amendments offered during the final vote on Monday — usually amendments are considered during the initial debate and preliminary vote on a bill — and that he did not have sufficient time to read the amendments and consider their implications. One amendment on Monday, for example, clarified that SB-276 does not intend to ban the transfer of a person to and from federal custody if there is a valid warrant.
“This isn’t a position in cement that I’m not willing to move,” he said. “I want the opportunity to digest these amendments and see if there are any amendments that address potential concerns in the second chamber.”
If the House passes a version of the bill with other amendments, the Senate would need to sign off on those changes before the bill heads to the governor’s desk for a signature.
Republicans argued that the bill interferes with federal policy and impedes legal ICE operations, going against the supremacy clause of the U.S. Constitution. The bill’s passage would likely result in lawsuits, they said.
“This undermines federal immigration enforcement. The bill restricts cooperation between state, local entities and federal immigration authorities, potentially obstructing that of which is the province of the federal government — immigration laws,” said Minority Leader Paul Lundeen, a Monument Republican.
Debate on the bill lasted an entire day last week as Republicans offered amendments that ultimately failed to block it. The bill is likely to face a similarly protracted discussion in the House if chamber leadership decides not to limit the length of debate.

(Photo by Akchamczuk/Getty Images)The Iowa House passed legislation Monday to legalize the use of psilocybin, the psychoactive compound found in “magic mushrooms,” for psychiatric treatment through a state program.
House File 978, passed 84-6, would establish a Psilocybin Production Establishment Licensing Board within the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services, operating in a similar fashion to the existing Medical Cannabidiol Advisory Board that oversees Iowa’s medical cannabis program. The board would grant licenses for the production and administration of products with psilocybin to people with certain mental health needs in the state.
The bill also sets new requirements for who can access the substance, including an age 21 restriction and limit of 5,000 patients who can be recommended psilocybin treatment.

Rep. John Wills, R-Spirit Lake, the floor manager for the bill, said he would not have guessed that he would be involved in a bill on psilocybin before this year because “it’s just not something that I’m into.” But he said after learning more about the effectiveness of psilocybin treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder, he believed the program will help people suffering in Iowa, like military veterans, law enforcement officers and other groups that face high rates of PTSD.
He said the bill requires people to receive psilocybin in a clinical environment with psychiatric support. In this environment, he said, the drug has been shown to allow people to “relive” their trauma in a controlled, safe space, and be able to resolve or lessen the impacts of PTSD. Wills said he believes this method could help address the high suicide rates of veterans and others suffering from the disorder, and offers a better alternative to other forms of PTSD treatment currently available.
“I will tell you, right now the only option these veterans have, the only option these people with PTSD have, is to be on mind-altering, life-altering drugs for the rest of their life,” Wills said.
While several states have decriminalized the use of psilocybin, Oregon and Colorado are currently the only states with medical psilocybin programs.
Rep. Larry McBurney, D-Urbandale, said he supported the bill as a way to help veterans access needed mental health support after returning from their service. McBurney said he was diagnosed with PTSD after serving as an Iowa Air National Guard veteran, having been deployed three times.
“Like many other veterans across the state and across the nation, I didn’t know where to turn,” McBurney said. “I didn’t know what options were available to me, and it took me long enough to find what those options were for myself and what worked for me. I want to ensure that other veterans across the state have this option available to them.”
The original bill specifically called for psilocybin to be used to treat PTSD, but an amendment approved by the House Monday expands the ability of the board to approve other illnesses that could be treated with psilocybin, and would allow for more psilocybin compounds to be added as legally available.
Wills said the amendment was added as a way to ensure the board can make this psychiatric treatment available for other mental illnesses or disorders when research can prove if it is effective. Wills said there have been “promising” early studies showing psilocybin may be an effective treatment for people recovering from substance use disorders related to alcohol and opiates.
“By taking PTSD out of the equation, what we’re doing is we’re allowing that board, that medical board, to be able to make decisions,” Wills said. “So initially, of course, PTSD is the treatment that we know works, because there’s peer-reviewed studies or peer-reviewed data. But as these other ailments, these other things (are studied) and have proof, then the board can add them.”
Rep. Jeff Shipley, R-Birmingham, has advocated for similar measures related to the legal use of psilocybin in previous sessions.
“(It) looks like mushroom season has officially arrived in Iowa,” he joked as the bill passed the House. “Our love and prayers are with everyone pursuing the elusive morel mushrooms, but perhaps more urgently, our love and prayers are with those suffering from intractable psychiatric conditions.”
He praised the measure as opening up a new method for mental health care in Iowa that has shown “tremendous promise” in the management of psychiatric conditions like PTSD.
“The state of Iowa has a lot of responsibility in ensuring Iowans not only have access to mental health treatments, but they have access to treatments that are actually effective — treatments that will actually alleviate the symptoms that patients are suffering from,” Shipley said. “And so again, House File 978, will go a long way in ensuring that the state of Iowa is fully fulfilling their obligation.”
The measure moves to the Iowa Senate for further consideration.

(Photo by Corrie Boudreaux for Source NM)Drought, lawsuits and federal funding for New Mexico’s largest river will be some of the topics discussed at the Rio Grande Compact Commission’s annual governance meeting this week.
A three-member governing board representing New Mexico, Colorado and Texas, the Commission convenes in Alamosa, Colorado on Friday for an annual meeting that will include: an annual report of how water flowed between the states; the budget for the upcoming year; reports from federal agencies on issues including endangered species and dam repairs; and an update in the case before the U.S. Supreme Court over Rio Grande water.


How to watch
The meeting will be livestreamed starting at 9 a.m. at the following link: https://us02web.zoom.us/j/89726541298
The meeting agenda can be found online here.


New Mexico is facing a future with 25% less water due to climate change and continuing drought, Chris Shaw, a legal advisor to the commission and deputy general counsel at the New Mexico Interstate Stream Commission, told Source. The whole basin will feel the impacts of smaller snowpacks, he noted, and efforts to cut water use in agriculture and in cities may still not make up the difference.
“This year is going to be particularly difficult,” Shaw said. “Not everybody is going to get all of the water that they need or want, and that puts strains on the social, hydrologic and political fabric here.”
As for the pending Rio Grande legal case, Bobby Skov, the commissioner appointed to represent Texas, told Source he expects a limited update, as a judge recently scheduled a June court date for the case, while parties continue settlement talks.
“The parties are in mediation, so there’s probably not going to be any in-detail type updates, just a quick overview of the case,” he said.
In addition to water concerns and presentations from federal officials, the commission also has some necessary housekeeping to replace a for a replacement of a non-voting member. of the commission.
Friday’s meeting will be the last for long-time chair Hal Simpson, a former Colorado state engineer, appointed by the Obama administration.
Shaw said the commission will discuss the recommendation for former New Mexico State Engineer Scott Verhines to take the spot, but that the position is ultimately a presidential appointment.
Friday will also be New Mexico State Engineer Elizabeth Anderson’s first meeting as a commissioner representing the state, following Mike Hamman’s retirement last year. Anderson was unavailable for comment Monday.
Skov encouraged the public to watch the meeting.
“The Rio Grande is vitally important to all three states,” he told Source NM in a call. “Having the public involved, educated in what’s going on, is better for everyone.
Pueblos seek direct representation 
A six-pueblo coalition — Cochiti, Santo Domingo, San Felipe, Santa Ana, Sandia and Isleta — is again requesting to address Rio Grande Compact commissioners directly, rather than through the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs. The coalition first made the request in 2022, and last year, the commission ordered the legal advisors to examine the issue.
Josh Mann, a Pueblo water rights attorney, said coalition members are still seeking a change to the rules of the commission.
“They’re really just asking for a process to communicate,” Mann said. “The Rio Grande Compact has a big impact on the Pueblos’ water use, and as sovereign nations, they’re looking for that communication and to be recognized.”
Juan Rey Abeita, the 2nd lieutenant governor for the Pueblo of Isleta, and a member of the coalition, will likely make a statement on Friday, Mann said.
The Pueblos have unique water rights. In 1928, the U.S. recognized the Pueblos’ “prior and paramount” rights to water through a total 20,000 acres of Pueblo land.
There’s still been no formal determination of water rights in the Middle Rio Grande, although the Pueblos and federal government took initial steps in 2022.
Shaw, the commission’s legal advisor,  said the commission’s official position remains unchanged at this time.
“The position the compact commission takes is that the Pueblos [do] have representation through the Bureau of Indian Affairs and that’s the proper process for them to provide their input,” Shaw said.
However, Shaw said legal advisors are still developing a more expansive protocol for additional tribal input during the Rio Grande Compact Commission meetings.
“If there’s a protocol, it needs to include all the pueblos, tribes and nations, not just the six Middle Rio Grande” Shaw said. “We’ve discussed that with them, so we’re working on a process for this summer to convene that larger group.”

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota educational options are set to expand as House lawmakers advanced a private school voucher bill Monday and the governor signed a bill establishing public charter schools.
The House in a 49-43 vote agreed to changes made by the Senate to House Bill 1540, which establishes Education Savings Accounts for private school students.
The bill will now go to Gov. Kelly Armstrong’s desk for his signature or veto. If signed into law, the new private school vouchers would be available for the 2026-27 school year.
Armstrong also signed a bill Monday that establishes the framework to implement public charter schools in North Dakota.
“Expanding school choice is a win-win for North Dakota families and for our state’s workforce and long-term success,” Armstrong said in a statement. “The public charter schools authorized by this bill can drive innovation, improve student outcomes and increase parent satisfaction.”
House passes bill authorizing charter schools in North Dakota

Lawmakers have been fairly split on bills related to Education Savings Accounts. House Bill 1540, which passed the Senate last week on a 27-20 vote, only benefits families with children attending private school. 
As amended, the bill provides private school vouchers in an amount that varies depending on household income. Students from families in the lowest income category could receive about $4,000 per year, while students from the highest income category could receive a little over $1,000 per year. 
The bill is estimated to cost about $20 million in the first year, though the exact amount will depend on how many students use the vouchers. The state projects that about 8,000 students will attend North Dakota private schools in 2026-27, according to a fiscal analysis of the bill.
House Majority Leader Rep. Mike Lefor, R-Dickinson, who voted in favor of the bill, said it allows parents to shape the educational futures of their children.
North Dakota Senate passes Education Savings Accounts for private school students

“Beyond academics, House Bill 1540 ensures equality,” Lefor said. “Parents know their children best. It’s not the government, but families who should have the final say in their children’s education.”
Rep. Liz Conmy, D-Fargo, voted against the bill and told lawmakers the North Dakota Constitution prohibits the use of public school tax dollars to support a sectarian school.
“We are obligated, constitutionally, to fund and strengthen public schools and specifically directed to not subsidize private education,” Conmy said. “We don’t get to pick and choose what part of the constitution we want to go with or not.”
A competing Senate Education Savings Account bill, Senate Bill 2400, proposed to benefit public school and homeschooled students in addition to private school students. It passed the Senate but received a do-not-pass recommendation by the House Education Committee in March. The bill has not been forwarded for a full chamber vote.
Sen. Michelle Axtman, R-Bismarck, chief sponsor of the Senate bill, prepared an amendment to her Education Savings Account bill Monday for a House Education Committee hearing. She sought to introduce an amendment to remove the private school portion of her bill and advance an Education Savings Account of $500 for educational expenses for public school and homeschooled students.
However, committee members denied a motion to reconsider the bill. It will advance to full chamber.
After the committee hearing, Axtman said the bill that passed the House is leaving out a “key component” of school choice – public school students. She said she also worries about rural students with limited choices because new charter schools probably won’t make their way into deeply rural areas. 
“I think we are missing a huge segment of choice for those students,” Axtman said. “I’ve always from day one been a supporter of a universal program that is truly universal so I’m disappointed we couldn’t get there.”
Armstrong recommended $44.3 million in his preliminary budget in January for a potential Education Savings Account program that would cover public, private and homeschooled students. 
North Dakota United, a union representing public school teachers and other state employees, opposes Education Savings Accounts. Nick Archuleta, president of North Dakota United, said the private school vouchers will only benefit a small selection of North Dakota students.
“I think the governor is going to look long and hard at it and, ultimately, the voters will,” Archuleta said. “We don’t believe it provides school choice. We believe that it’s the school’s choice to educate whom they choose to educate in that particular bill, so we weren’t in favor of that bill and still aren’t.”

The measure (SB 1242) sponsored by North Central Florida Republican Stan McClain, originally would have prohibited creation of any new CRAs, but he said that after receiving input from both Republican and Democratic lawmakers he would agree to allow them.
“CRAs may continue to operate under their redevelopment plan but must sunset on the termination date outlined in those plans,” McClain said Monday in introducing the change. “No extensions will be permitted. The original intent was for CRAs to have lifespans of approximately 40 years, and this amendment aims to re-align with that original vision.”
Since 1969, Florida cities and countries have been empowered by state law to create CRAs in districts designated as “blighted areas.” They are funded by tax revenues collected in those specific districts through what is known as tax increment financing (TIF). TIF funds collected from a specific CRA are then invested back into that specific area.
There are more than 200 such CRAs in the state at the moment (Tampa has eight).
There has been a push by some lawmakers to kill CRAs because of reports that they have misappropriated funds. To answer those concerns, the bill prohibits CRAs from extending their boundaries or spending on events such as concerts, festivals, holiday events, parades, “focusing CRAs on tangible brick and mortar redevelopment efforts,” McClain said.
That language is important, said North Florida Republican Corey Simon.
“I think the warning should be for our CRAs to operate and do what they’re supposed to be doing,” he said. “Those dollars were for blighted areas, not to put on concerts and not to put on things that are not targeting those blighted areas. And so I think the warning shot needs to be that our CRAs need to be operating to improve these communities that have been set aside.”
The amended bill requires that either city council members or county commissioners must be the same representatives legislating over the CRA. It also says that all CRAs in existence as of Oct. 1, 2019, will end at the termination date  already listed in the respective CRA’s charter.
Speaking on behalf of keeping CRAs was Panama City Beach Mayor Stuart Tettemer, who noted that his city is one of the few in the state that doesn’t collect ad valorem taxes. “Our CRA keeps taxes local and efficient,” he said. “Keep our town affordable for visitors and our residents.”
McClain’s bill now heads to the full Senate for a vote. A companion bill (HB 991) in the House sponsored by Cape Coral Republican Mike Giallombardo still has a committee stop before reaching the floor of that chamber.

(File photo by Getty Images)COLUMBIA — Despite the Senate’s seemingly renewed focus earlier this year on curtailing drunken driving deaths, the effort is again being pushed to next year.
Bi-partisan legislation that aims to close the loopholes allowing people to escape convictions for driving under the influence won’t even reach the Senate floor before the 2025 session ends next month. After postponing debate on the bill at multiple meetings, the Senate Judiciary Committee decided last week to carry it over until 2026.
“It may be something that we have to make a big push for in January of ’26 as opposed to May of ’25,” said Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey, R-Edgefield, who sits on the full Judiciary Committee but wasn’t on the panel that advanced the bill in March. “I’m frustrated by that, but I think that’s where we are.”
In 2022, 474 people died in South Carolina as a result of drunken driving, ranking the state fifth highest nationwide in total numbers and the worst rate by population. The tally represents a 72% increase since 2019, according to a July 2024 report by South Carolina’s chapter of Mothers Against Drunk Driving.
“The designation of worst state in the nation for drunk driving is clear,” the report reads.
Part of the problem is the state’s video requirements. By law, officers must start recording as soon as they turn on their blue lights. And recordings must include the entirety of field sobriety tests, arrests, breath tests, and suspects being advised of their Miranda rights, which start with the right to remain silent.
Any technicality — such as faulty audio that causes the Miranda rights not being heard, video that’s too dark, or somebody’s feet not being captured on camera — can lead to a case being tossed, according to proponents for changing the law, who include solicitors, sheriffs and victims’ advocates.
The proposal — lawmakers’ latest attempt at making the roads safer — would, among other things, change state law so that the video can be less than perfect. Under the bill, evidence could be suppressed if the officer fails to “substantially comply” with video recording requirements, to include “reasonably” documenting officers advising suspects of their rights.
Solicitors have been pushing for legislation de-emphasizing video in DUI cases for a decade.
“There are so many loopholes in our drunk driving laws that it’s very difficult for solicitors to successfully prosecute those cases,” said Sen. Tom Davis, R-Beaufort, the bill’s lead sponsor.
Tougher DUI law meant to curb drunk driving in SC takes effect Sunday

His bill could bring the biggest changes to South Carolina’s DUI laws since 2008, when the Legislature passed legislation escalating penalties for higher alcohol concentrations and for multiple convictions. Passage came after then-Gov. Mark Sanford publicly accused senators of blocking the bill in a YouTube video featuring a South Carolina mom whose 5-year-old son was killed by a drunken driver.
A 2014 law required repeat offenders or first-time offenders who had a blood alcohol level of more than 0.15 to install ignition interlock devices, which prevent someone who has been drinking alcohol from starting the vehicle. A 2023 law that took effect last May expanded the requirement to anyone convicted of a DUI, no matter how high their blood alcohol level.
But, according to those pushing for change, getting a conviction is tough. In the past, defense attorneys have argued DUI cases aren’t pleaded down or dismissed due to video technicalities nearly as often as advocates for change suggest. And no agency kept track to prove it either way.
Between January 2019 and March 2024, MADD monitored the courts in seven large South Carolina counties: Berkeley, Charleston, Greenville, Horry, Lexington, Richland, and Spartanburg. In those seven counties, the conviction rate on first-offense misdemeanor DUI cases ranged from a low of 18% in Richland County to a high of 65% in Spartanburg County. Whether cases were dropped altogether or pleaded down to something else, often reckless driving, varied by county.
“Clearly, South Carolina falls behind most of the nation,” MADD concluded.
“We have got to address it and make sure we address it right,” Sen. Brian Adams, a co-sponsor of the bill, told the SC Daily Gazette.
The bill would also create enhanced penalties for DUI wrecks that cause “moderate bodily injury,” such as a bone fracture or dislocation. Under existing law, people can be charged with felony DUI only if they cause “great bodily injury” or death. The proposal would also increase penalties for convictions and for refusing to take a breath test.
“I thought we had a good bill,” said Laura Hudson, the executive director of the South Carolina Crime Victims Council.
Hudson, who has been advocating at the Statehouse for crime victims for more than four decades, said she was disappointed the bill didn’t get traction this year.
“It’s not like they didn’t have the time,” she said, noting the Senate bill was pre-filed in December for this year’s session.
She’s hopeful senators will keep their pledge to make it a top priority for 2026. Since this is the first of a two-year session, the bill does not need to be reintroduced.
Steven Burritt, the state director for MADD, said it’s a letdown that the bill he considers a game changer for DUI in South Carolina won’t pass this year. If more people are held accountable, South Carolina will be a safer place to drive, he said.
“I think all these things are connected,” Burritt told the SC Daily Gazette. “If we make the law easier to prosecute and enforce, I think we’ll hold people accountable for their actions. They’ll get more of the penalties that actually reduce the likelihood that it’ll happen again, and I think that is a very reasonable cause and effect that should lead to safer roads.”
If the Legislature truly passes a bill next year, the wait will have been worth it, he said.
“If the right bill gets passed for DUI reform, I’ll gladly wait until 2026,” he said. However, he added, he’s concerned the motivation will dissipate by January.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/car-theft-1024x683-1-1.jpg,,,2025-04-21 19:05:35.848576

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A Kansas City suburb rose to the top in a major e-commerce company’s nationwide search for a new hub through hefty property tax incentives.
Fortune 500 company Fiserv plans to open a new location in Overland Park, the Kansas governor’s office announced Monday, touting the addition of 2,000 job and a 10-year, $6.5 billion economic impact.
Gov. Laura Kelly’s office called the deal the largest office recruitment in the state’s history.
Frank Bisignano, chairman and CEO of Fiserv, said the planned Overland Park hub is an opportunity to expand the company’s footprint in the U.S. and foster innovation in the financial services field on behalf of its clients.
“The greater Kansas City metro area offers a dynamic environment with a growing population of tech talent, making it the ideal location for Fiserv’s next strategic fintech hub,” he said.
The company’s announcement came less than a week after Overland Park’s Finance, Administration and Economic Development Committee unanimously gave preliminary approval for a property tax rebate program for a “Project Turtle,” which has been connected to Fiserv.
The Overland Park City Council is set to take up the issue Monday, but the project has already earned Mayor Curt Skoog’s unofficial approval.
“This is the biggest job-creating project that we’ve worked on in my time,” he said at the economic development committee’s Wednesday meeting.
In Skoog’s 20 years of involvement with the city, he said, he has witnessed significant growth successes and attractive additions to the community
“But this one is a really, really amazing win for us,” he said.
If approved, Project Turtle would receive a rebate on city, county and Blue Valley Recreation Commission property taxes. The company would pay full property taxes to the Blue Valley School District and the Johnson County Community College levies.
Under the rebate agreement, taxes will be paid, and then the company would submit an application to the city to be reimbursed for about 40% of those taxes, or an estimated $1.3 million over 10 years of the company’s 15-year lease.
But the rebate is contingent on meeting certain conditions.
Those conditions include a $125 million investment in renovations and improvements and maintaining 2,000 full-time employees by 2030. The governor’s office said those employees will earn an average salary of $102,000 annually. The state anticipates Fiserv will contribute up to $4 billion in payroll investment over the next decade.
 The company also would be required to participate in community engagement, invest in memberships with the Overland Park Chamber of Commerce and the Overland Park Economic Development Council and commit to using Overland Park hotels and facilities for conventions and meetings.
The governor’s office said Fiserv has committed $175 million for the project but neither the office nor the Kansas Department of Commerce answered questions about the project’s total cost or if state funds will be pledged.
The economic development committee liked the idea of reusing existing space and increasing the long-term property value at the 200-acre Aspiria campus, which was considered at one point for a new location for the Kansas City Royals. After Sprint sold the campus in 2019, it was envisioned as a live-work-play environment tailored to businesses and entrepreneurs. It’s one of the largest corporate campuses in the U.S., second only to Microsoft’s campus in Washington state.
Fiserv is expected to lease two buildings on the campus, totaling 427,000 square feet.
The tax incentives are an “important component” of the deal, said Alex Leath, an Alabama attorney with the international law firm Bradley Arant who helped bring Panasonic to De Soto.
The Kansas City area wasn’t initially a contender for Fiserv, Leath said.
“What I saw first and foremost — what I do see — is the quality of the people, the work ethic of the people,” Leath told the economic development committee. “This is a company that expects people to be in the office five days a week … and Kansans struck me as people who would enjoy that, or embrace that.”
Overland Park beat out Nashville, Phoenix, Dallas, Fort Worth, Atlanta and the South Florida area in the company’s search.
The governor said the new hub is making good on her administration’s promise to “modernize and diversify” the state’s economy.
“Fiserv’s new strategic hub in Overland Park is a significant step forward as we continue to elevate Kansas to new heights,” Kelly said. “Fiserv will create high-value career options, including opportunities for military personnel transitioning to civilian life and graduates of our higher education system.”
Fiserv chose Overland Park, the announcement said, because of its central location in the United States, proximity to clients in the Midwest, affordable cost of living and the opportunity to recruit talent in the tech field.
Tim Cowden, president and CEO of the Kansas City Area Development Council, called the investment “monumental.”
He added: “And so is the Kansas City region’s ability to deliver.”

But while Gov. Glenn Youngkin and federal partners hailed the operation as a national model, some researchers and critics warn that the data used to justify such crackdowns often paints an incomplete — and potentially misleading — picture.
Launched through a partnership between the U.S. Department of Justice and Virginia, the VHSTF is a sprawling initiative involving more than 200 officers from agencies including the FBI, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Virginia State Police and the Department of Corrections, among others.
The task force has made 521 arrests to date, according to Youngkin’s office. Of those, 132 individuals were identified as gang-affiliated, including members of MS-13 and Tren de Aragua.
“Thanks to the brave men and women of our federal and state law enforcement, more than 500 criminal illegal immigrants, including more than 130 gang-members, are off of Virginia’s streets and facing justice for their crimes,” Youngkin said in a statement Monday. “All Virginians should be proud. … What’s happening in Virginia is a model that should be replicated all across the country.”
U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi echoed that sentiment, calling the effort “the product of unprecedented collaboration” between state and federal law enforcement and praising the Youngkin administration’s alignment with President Donald Trump’s “Make America Safe Again” agenda.
FBI Director Kash Patel said the task force’s early results had been “a tremendous success,” while ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons highlighted the expansion of ICE’s controversial 287(g) program in Virginia. 
That program, which allows state and local officials to enforce federal immigration law, was authorized in Virginia through Executive Order 47, signed by Youngkin on Feb. 27 and approved by ICE within 20 hours — a turnaround the governor’s office touted as a record.
Yet amid the political fanfare, some experts say the celebratory tone doesn’t align with the broader data.
A 2024 report funded by the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) found that undocumented immigrants are arrested at significantly lower rates than U.S.-born citizens. 
The study, which examined six years of Texas criminal records between 2012 and 2018 that included verified immigration status, found that undocumented immigrants were arrested at less than half the rate of native-born Americans for violent and drug crimes, and at only a quarter of the rate for property crimes.
“The question of how often undocumented immigrants commit crimes is not easy to answer,” the study’s authors wrote, noting that arrest rates often reflect law enforcement priorities rather than actual crime rates. 
Still, their data showed that native-born citizens had the highest offending rates across most felony categories, with undocumented immigrants consistently showing the lowest.
The findings challenge an unproven core assumption underlying the rhetoric around initiatives like the VHSTF — that undocumented immigrants pose an outsized threat to public safety.
Virginia Secretary of Public Safety and Homeland Security Terry Cole, however, called the task force’s approach “a proven model” for tackling transnational criminal threats. 
“The significant number of arrests and ongoing investigations highlight the effectiveness of a collaborative approach to complex enforcement challenges,” Cole said.
But critics argue that such high-profile sweeps often overstate the role of immigration status in violent crime — and underplay the potential for racial profiling and civil rights violations when local law enforcement is deputized to enforce federal immigration laws.
For now, VHSTF operations are expected to continue, with law enforcement agencies conducting long-term investigations into narcotics trafficking, organized crime and gang-related violence.

(Photo courtesy of Iowa Corn Growers Association) Iowa farmers made headway planting corn, soybeans and oats early last week, but were slowed by storms that caused destruction in southwest Iowa, according to the Iowa crop progress and condition report.
The report, covering April 14 through April 20, shows Iowa has 68% of oats planted, 18% of corn and 11% of soybeans. Planting rates for all three of these crops are ahead of the five-year average. 
Topsoil and subsoil moisture conditions improved slightly from the week prior, though both have more than 60% rated as adequate moisture. Soil moisture conditions are slightly better than last year at this time. 
Soil temperatures measured at a depth of four inches show the ground has warmed up, with most counties measuring in the upper 40s to low 50s. Other field activities for the period included tiling, building waterways and spraying. 

Iowa crop progress and condition reports are released weekly by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Agricultural Statistics Service during planting season and through harvest season. 

Average precipitation for April 14-20 was 0.35 inches across the state, though several areas measured more than an inch and up to nearly 2.5 inches following thunderstorms April 17. 
Some counties observed hail as large as 4 inches during the storms and two tornadoes touched down, one in Fremont County near Tabor, and the other moved across Fremont and Page counties. 
According to State Climatologist Justin Glisan, hail and wind damage was reported in Sioux City, Storm Lake and Waverly, in addition to the counties that saw tornadoes. 
Gov. Kim Reynolds issued a disaster proclamation, in response to the severe weather, for Buena Vista, Fremont, Page, and Plymouth counties. The proclamation opens up state resources to respond to the damages and gives eligible Iowans 45 days to apply for the Iowa Individual Assistance Grant Program to help with associated repairs and other costs.
Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig visited some of areas hit by the storms. 
“I visited southwest Iowa over the weekend, where I saw firsthand some of the damage caused by the tornadoes and large hail,” Naig said in a statement. “My heart goes out to all the Iowans who were impacted by these storms.” 
Precipitation predictions for the coming week suggest Iowa will have above average rainfall across most of the state, which Naig said might slow spring planting progress as it did the week prior. 
“While more delays may occur, the rain will help replenish soil moisture, which would be a welcome development in many areas,” Naig said.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-21 22:02:04+00:00,CT Mirror,Why CT special education funding bills are dividing advocates,Jessika Harkay,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/21/ct-special-education-funding-bills/,The controversial bills would change how Connecticut’s private special education programs are funded and may bill for services.,"Special education advocates are split on whether two proposed bills are the best steps forward in tackling concerns about the quality of student services, cost and accountability.
Leaders of the Select Committee on Special Education described House Bill 7277 and Senate Bill 1561 at a news conference Monday morning as “a historical way for Connecticut” to pay for special education and make the school systems and their services more equitable for students with disabilities.
“Through this bill, we make sure that special education is real and not just on paper and not just in certain communities — that special education for students with special needs, and all learning needs, is equal and accessible in any district that you live in,” said Committee Co-chair Rep. Maryam Khan, D-Windsor. 
Her fellow co-chair Sen. Sujata Gadkar-Wilcox, D-Trumbull, added that special education is “at a point” where it’s “not sustainable, and we need to have better oversight.”
“Part of what the bill will do is to provide us the oversight and the data that we don’t currently have, to understand why costs are what they are, why we’ve seen a continuing rise in costs and what we can do to help maintain those costs while always maintaining a commitment to our students,” Gadkar-Wilcox said Monday.
Not everyone was so optimistic. Even other lawmakers on the committee had reservations about the bills Monday and said they needed more work, time and revisions in certain sections to ensure they didn’t have unintended consequences.
“We have to be very careful what we do here, because this will have a long-term impact on our children, not just the ones in school today but the ones in school tomorrow and the ones in school decades from now,” said Sen. Cathy Osten, D-Sprague, a member of the select committee and co-chair of the state legislature’s Appropriations Committee.
Cost changes
The two omnibus bills each contain more than 50 sections and 60 pages, with several provisions that would require more oversight from the Office of Policy and Management and would change how private special education programs are funded and may bill for services.
The bills would prohibit any tuition raises for private special education providers in the 2025-26 academic year and would pause the opening of any new programs until 2027, a change that generated some fierce pushback.
But the bills also would require OPM and the state Department of Education to “collect and analyze the tuition, rates and other fees for special education” when students are outsourced from their home school district and then create what they believe are appropriate fixed costs for services.
Establishing those fixed costs would involve “establishing a universal special education and related services rate schedule” that would include “an individualized rate for each special education service provided to a student pursuant to an individualized education program and standards for how a charging entity may include its operating expenses into the total costs for services charged to a local or regional board of education,” according to House Bill 7277.
Connecticut public schools spend nearly $2.7 billion annually on special education services. For some districts, special education costs make up a significant portion of their budgets. For example, in Hartford, which educates more than 4,000 students with disabilities, about 33% of its total education budget, or around $151 million, goes toward special education, Mayor Arunan Arulampalam said Monday.
“Of that $151 million, $80 million is in tuition and $22.8 million is just in transportation of special ed students,” Arulampalam said in support of the bill. “Less than a third of our special ed costs are being spent on in-district special ed services for Hartford Public School students, and that number is ballooning.”
Advocates supporting the bill include the Connecticut Education Association, the largest teacher’s union in the state, and local superintendents and municipal leaders from across the state.
“When the city of Hartford comes, and other cities like us come to you, it’s not asking for a handout,” Arulampalam said. “It is an ask for a partnership to work together to create a strong foundation for our students and to create a better and stronger state in the future. I think this bill creates a pathway toward that, both with funding the short term … but also, importantly, a real structural impact by capping the cost of outplacement services.”
Hundreds opposed
But more than 700 written statements were submitted opposing the bill and tuition caps. Many who opposed the bill, whether in writing or at the public hearing Monday, were parents, special education lawyers and some lawmakers who were on the committee.
“This is not a good bill, or at least, needs a tremendous amount of work,” said Andrew Feinstein, a longtime special education attorney and legislative chair for the advocacy group Special Education Equity for Kids of Connecticut. “There are some good sections, which we support, but by and large, this effort to destroy private providers, which is absolutely what this bill will do, is just unacceptable.”
Feinstein also served as a tri-chair on the Task Force to Study Special Education Services and Funding, which was convened in 2021 by state statue, and presented its findings and recommendations earlier this year. 
On Monday, he said the committee’s effort to impose fixed special education rates would “destroy private programs” and in turn cause great harm to the state’s students with the most severe disabilities.
“The critical fact is that we need these placements as a part of the continuum of educational placements. Many have long waiting lists. For example, Hubbard North, which opened recently in Rocky Hill, has 20 enrolled students and a waiting list of 50. It takes time, money and staff to build up capacity,” Feinstein wrote in his testimony. “District special education directors do not lightly outplace students. They do so when there is no way that the student can be educated within the district. There can be no doubt that this bill, if enacted, would reduce the number of slots for disabled students to be outplaced. A rate schedule, designed to reduce costs, will convince many operators that the income available from tuition and fees is insufficient to cover costs and [will] close up shop.”
Osten agreed at the public hearing. She said staff members, like paraeducators in public school districts, often make minimum wage and that she hopes the proposed legislation is “not saying that we want to get those outplacement schools to a level that we’re giving them minimum wage to take care of those kids.”
“When we talk about capping programs and monitoring expenses, I worry about what we think is the right things to do — by having the Office of Policy Management oversee some of these things and come up with a plan in a short timeframe,” Osten said, adding that in the 1980s and ’90s, a similar initiative resulted in the closure of education programs.
“Back then, we said, ‘We are not going to fund these types of [special education] programs,’ and programs that were successful for my family are no longer in business anymore,” Osten said, referring to her family’s personal experience navigating special education systems decades ago. “They went out of business a long time ago.”
Grants
In another effort to help local municipalities with special education costs, the two bills propose at least three state-funded grants, including a “special education offset grant,” another that would provide $50 million in transportation reimbursement and a third that would give additional funding for districts to expand or improve in-district or regional special education programming.
Gov. Ned Lamont recently supported funding for more in-district programming, allotting $14 million in his proposed budget for a grant program to help districts develop ways to educate more students with disabilities in-district rather than sending them to private programs outside the district. 
And while the bills proposed special license plates to raise money for special education costs, it’s uncertain whether that would be enough to fully fund the grant programs.
Education Commissioner Charlene Russell-Tucker strongly opposed the bills and said the state Department of Education didn’t have the capacity or resources to carry out the grant proposals. 
“We believe that there are sections of this proposal that the department can support, however, there are many that we cannot,” Russell-Tucker said in written testimony.
The special education offset grant alone would cost the state Department of Education approximately $190 million, Russell-Tucker said, “not including the 14 additional full-time employees we are estimating that we will need to carry out the work of the entire bill proposal, none of which are included in the governor’s budget.”
In testimony, some supported increasing state support for special education through these grant programs, but some stakeholders also wondered whether they were feasible.
“We’re totally for this offset grant, but where’s the money coming from?” Feinstein said at the public hearing. “We know that this isn’t happening. This is another shell game that the legislature loves to play.”
“My thoughts exactly,” said Rep. Lezlye Zupkus, R-Prospect, a ranking member of the Education Committee and member of the Select Committee on Special Education, in response to Feinstein’s criticism. “Where is all the money coming from for this piece of legislation?”
Possible parent support
Parents navigating the special education system have consistently referred to it as a “battlefield,” full of legal and educational jargon and uncertainty about the full extent of rights.
The legislation offers extra support to families by proposing the creation of an educational ombudsperson that would be tasked with:

Receiving, reviewing and solving complaints from students and their families;
Gathering and analyzing data “on students and young people” to help public agencies and lawmakers develop policy;
Assisting student loan borrowers understand their rights and responsibilities;
Analyzing implementation of federal, state and local laws.

The bills also calls on the state Department of Education to work to simplify Individualized Education Program forms and create a parent guide on special education rights and timelines.
The proposals will be taken up for vote by the Select Committee on Special Education Friday.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/thumbnail_IMG_7737-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-21 18:11:50.963633

(Getty Images)Years ago, when I worked as a newspaper opinion editor, a conservative reader sent a letter to argue that 21st-century America was a post-racial society. I don’t recall the details of his email except that his case was built around individual accomplishment, particularly the success of Black entertainers (including Bill Cosby) and the election and reelection of President Barack Obama.
His point, no doubt in response to something I had either published or written myself, was that structural racism — to the extent it ever existed — most certainly did not exist now.
I’m not sure how I responded exactly, but I do remember being baffled by the evidence he offered for his conclusion. To arrive at “post-racial society” via Cosby and Obama seemed both absurd and dangerous — a reductionist presentation of recent history, yes, but also a stubborn refusal to seek out the realities of other eyes.
And I’m not even talking about empathy — that’s like the advanced course. I mean just seeing through the experiences of others that there is not one America, that this nation exists differently for different people, and that opportunity is not a single, shared thread. 
While we have struggled mightily as a nation to even chip away at yawning opportunity gaps — not just for Black and Indigenous people but women, immigrants, the working poor, the list goes on and on — historically there seemed to me, naively as it turns out, to at least be agreement that the gaps existed. The frequent and sometimes violent conflict over that reality and its causes could be offered as ample proof, I thought. But now, an entire political party has built its brand on denialism and erasure — and found in its followers a population more than willing to sacrifice their future if it means the relief of forgetting the past and averting their eyes from the present.
My letter writer from years ago wasn’t a fringe anomaly but a harbinger. 
The most obvious example nationally is the Trump administration’s carpet-bombing of diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, and the countless ways those attacks have rippled out and laid waste to lives and livelihoods. Meanwhile, New Hampshire is mimicking the efforts and with the same toe-deep understanding of what purpose the programs actually serve. In one memorable February exchange, Auburn Republican Rep. Jess Edwards had to talk down fellow Republican Rep. Mike Belcher from his superficial hatred of the Department of Health and Human Services’ “Office of Health Equity,” which Belcher had targeted for elimination.
“The word ‘health equity’ has jumped out at me as well,” Edwards told Belcher sympathetically during a hearing for the since-retained bill. “I think we’ve got a situation where whoever came up with the name of that department really regrets it, because they couldn’t forecast how the name would basically become synonymous with actual discrimination.”
Truly, how could anyone have predicted that the Republican Party would successfully sell its supporters on the idea that “equity” is synonymous with its antonym?
This is the same genre of illogic and enforced ignorance that has given New Hampshire its “divisive concepts” law, the subject of a legal battle now being fought in the First Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston. Although part of the legal problem with the law is that it’s overly (and purposely) vague — an extension of the first Trump administration’s “critical race theory” mass hallucination — the goal was and is to make teachers afraid to tackle the uglier, less “shining city on a hill” chapters of America’s past and present. 
But why? 
Why is the modern Republican Party so invested in reframing American history, which they are accomplishing through educator threats and a transparent effort to make “equity” and “inclusion” mean their opposites? What is it that links the party’s stop-teaching-about-slavery Project 1776 to the implementation of its anti-democratic, pro-wealthy Project 2025.
Those are the questions you have to ask. 
“History is not inert,” Ta-Nehisi Coates wrote in Vanity Fair last year, “but contains within it a story that implicates the present.”
And that, eloquently, is the answer. 
Nothing is more dangerous to the powers behind a nation as historically unequal as our own than to have the citizens start asking the right questions of the right people. 
But with the pitchfork mobs so blindly dedicated to the eradication of all things DEI and “divisive concepts,” the powers needn’t worry. In Donald Trump’s America, we’re a million miles away from the right questions. 
And that, as any right-wing politician can tell you, is and always was the point.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/usaoath-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-21 18:11:50.963633

Rep. Beth Wessel-Kroeschell, D-Ames, said she’s seen this bill many times during her tenure as a lawmaker, and current law allowing courts to order payment for postsecondary education is not equitable. Married parents and parents who never married get to have the choice of how their child’s college will be paid for, but right now those going through a divorce have no choice.
“I am concerned about the rising cost of an education for our young people and taking away one option for them to get paid, but it needs to be done equitably, and therefore I support the bill and recommend a yes vote,” Wessel-Kroeschell said.
Floor manager Rep. Steven Holt, R-Denison, agreed with Wessel-Kroeschell in his closing comments, saying it is “not acceptable” that a judge gets to decide if a parent will help pay for college instead of the parents themselves if they’re going through a divorce.
“I would also mention that different parents have different philosophies regarding what should be paid for once their children become young adults, and how that is handled,” Holt said. “So I don’t think it’s appropriate that a court put that upon parents going through a divorce.”

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout © 2025)Tennessee’s legislature put the state’s private-prison operator on notice to keep death rates down or face a reduction in inmates, a move that could cut its state payments.
House members voted 93-0 Monday in favor of House Bill 1144 by Republican Rep. Clark Boyd of Lebanon, which would require the inmate population at each CoreCivic-run prison to be reduced 10% if the death rate there is twice as high as the rate at a comparable state-run prison. The Senate previously approved its version of the bill, sponsored by Republican Sen. Mark Pody of Lebanon.
Boyd told lawmakers the bill is designed to bring “accountability to the number of inmate deaths and violence” in Tennessee’s private prisons. Inmates would be “absorbed” by state prisons without an increased cost to the state, he said.
“Just losing 10% of their inmate population would hit them hard financially,” said Boyd, who worked with Lebanon resident Tim Leeper, whose son died of an overdose at privately-run Trousdale Turner.
Tennessee levied $44.78 million in penalties against private prison operator in three years

CoreCivic, a publicly-traded company that runs four state prisons, has struggled to keep its facilities staffed at the level required by state contracts. The Department of Correction penalized CoreCivic numerous times over the last few years, levying $44.78 million in liquidated damages for contractual shortfalls, mainly related to low staffing.
A State Comptroller audit showed Trousdale Turner had a 146% employee turnover rate in 2023, making it harder to oversee inmates. The prison, which is under a civil rights investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice, had a 33.7% staff vacancy rate most recently, compared with 26% at state-run prisons, officials said.
Trousdale Turner has had the highest number of deaths in a state prison for men the past few years, with 98 confirmed by death certificates from 2019 through 2022, including 30 overdoses, according to state figures. Whiteville Correctional Facility in Hardeman County had 53 deaths, 21 of those by overdose, in those four years. South Central Correctional Facility, also run by CoreCivic, reported 46 deaths, nine of them by overdose in that time frame.
In comparison, Morgan County Correctional, a state-run facility, had 41 deaths, including 11 overdoses. Northwest Correctional Facility reported 44 deaths with 19 overdoses in those four years.
Despite the shortcomings, the Department of Correction defends the prison company, calling it a valuable state “partner.” The state has had trouble staffing the remaining 10 prisons, as well.
CoreCivic says prisoner safety, health and well-being are “top priority” and that each facility has an emergency response team to handle medical care. The company also says all prison deaths are reported immediately for investigation.

(Photo by Leah Romero for Source NM)New Mexico’s highest court on Monday clarified a question posed by a federal court about which law to consider when weighing an emergency dispatcher’s legal immunity from allegations of a mishandled 911 call.
The ruling stems from the death of a 16-year-old boy who was hiking with his family in July 2020 in the Organ Mountains in Doña Ana County when he started suffering from heat stroke. His mother called 911, which a Mesilla Valley Regional Dispatch Authority 911 dispatcher answered and then routed to the New Mexico Department of Public Safety.
In a wrongful death lawsuit, the child’s estate and family alleged that the Mesilla Valley dispatcher made a series of missteps that delayed the emergency medical response, and that DPS’ dispatch center incorrectly noted their location that day.
The Mesilla Valley Regional Dispatch Authority and DPS each asked the judge to dismiss the case, pointing to a New Mexico law called the Enhanced 911 Act that provides legal immunity to local governments and their contractors who run 911 dispatch systems “except for intentional acts.”
The federal court delayed a decision to dismiss the case and asked the New Mexico Supreme Court to weigh in.
In a unanimous decision published on Monday, the New Mexico Supreme Court found that the Enhanced 911 Act, “has no bearing on the 911 dispatchers’ immunity from liability for the allegedly mishandled 911 emergency medical calls.”
Instead, the justices wrote, immunity for dispatchers is governed by a law the Legislature passed six years prior to the Enhanced 911 Act: the Enhanced Medical Services Act, which provides immunity for dispatchers except for damages caused by negligence.
“Succinctly stated, important changes in statutory law are not generally made through inconspicuous means,” the justices wrote. “Applying that principle here, we cannot conclude that the Legislature would announce a new rule more broadly immunizing 911 dispatchers from liability except for intentional acts in the space of one phrase in a statute primarily addressing enhanced 911 infrastructure and funding that makes only isolated and generalized references to 911 dispatchers or their equivalents.”
The justices wrote that their ruling is only meant to clarify for the federal court which law to apply; they made no findings as to how it should apply the law to the boy’s death.
Under a new statewide emergency dispatch system expected to launch in August, dispatchers won’t have to rely on callers to determine their location and instead will be able to track the cell phone’s location data.

(Photo by Janine L. Weisman/Rhode Island Current)The state agency responsible for overseeing the Pell Bridge will need about six months to assess the safety of the bridge connecting Newport to Jamestown should it get hit by a large ship, according to a letter sent to federal transportation officials late last week.
Rhode Island’s suspension bridge was one of 68 bridges flagged by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) for evaluation in March as part of its ongoing investigation of the March 2024 collapse of Baltimore’s Francis Scott Key Bridge.
Bridges on the NTSB’s list were not necessarily at risk of collapse, but were flagged for review because they were built before the establishment of safety guidelines in 1991. NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy wrote to the Rhode Island Turnpike and Bridge Authority (RITBA) asking the state to develop and implement a comprehensive risk reduction plan. 
The agency had 30 days to send an official response, which RITBA Executive Director Lori Caron Silveira filed Friday. 
Silveira wrote that RITBA has taken initial steps for a risk assessment, including identifying engineering firms with “expertise in vessel strike risk analysis.” The assessment will include an analysis of historic vessel traffic using data collected by the Coast Guard about the vessel, waterway characteristics, navigation procedures, geotechnical and underwater depth measurements, and structural engineering specifications of the bridge. 
A final report is expected to be completed in approximately six months, Silveira wrote.
She wrote that the agency had conducted an internal review to assess the vulnerability of its infrastructure in the immediate aftermath of the Francis Scott Key Bridge’s collapse last spring. Internal research suggests the Pell Bridge is unlikely to be struck by a vessel as large as the one that hit Baltimore’s Key Bridge, according to Silveira.
“The vessels navigating this area are smaller than the container vessel involved in the Key Bridge incident,” Silveira wrote. “Furthermore, existing pilot practices, navigational controls, and the design and construction of the main Pell Bridge piers, which extend approximately 100 to 150 feet below mean high water, constitute additional protective factors.”
If the new vulnerability assessment shows there’s a risk, Silveira said RITBA will work to come up with a safety plan that aligns with federal recommendations.

(Alliance Defending Freedom photograph)LOUISVILLE — The University of Louisville and former professor Dr. Allan M. Josephson have settled a years-long legal battle over Josephson’s comments about how to treat gender dysphoria and the punishment he alleges followed those comments. 
A Monday court document says both parties agreed “this case should be dismissed with prejudice as the parties have settled all claims raised in this litigation.” 
The Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), a conservative Christian law firm that represented Josephson in his lawsuit against the university, said UofL agreed to pay almost $1.6 million in “damages and attorneys’ fees.”
Fired University of Louisville professor claiming free-speech violation argues for jury trial

A university spokesperson said he could not comment “as this settlement is related to a personnel matter.” 
“After several years, free speech and common sense have scored a major victory on college campuses,” Travis Barham, an ADF lawyer who represented Josephson, said in a statement. “Public universities have no business punishing professors simply because they hold different views.” 
“Hopefully, other public universities will learn from this that if they violate the First Amendment, they can be held accountable, and it can be very expensive,” Barham said. 
Josephson, formerly chief of the UofL medical school’s Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Psychology, made the comments in question during a Heritage Foundation panel discussion in 2017, which his colleagues found to be anti-LGBTQ and “demanded that the University take disciplinary action against” him, according to court filings by Josephson.
Those comments included: 

The “notion that gender identity should trump chromosomes, hormones, internal reproductive organs, external genitalia, and secondary sex characteristics when classifying individuals is counter to medical science.”
“Transgender ideology neglects the child’s need for developing coping and problem-solving skills necessary to meet developmental challenges.” 
Parents should “use their collective wisdom in guiding their child to align with his or her biological sex.”

Within seven weeks of the comments, “defendants demanded that he resign his position as division chief and effectively become a junior faculty member,” Josephson alleged in court documents. Josephson was “demoted, harassed, and ultimately fired for speaking out on the harms of ‘transitioning’ children,” his lawyers said.
After Monday’s settlement, Josephson said in a statement “I’m glad to finally receive vindication for voicing what I know is true.”

Over the last few elections, the observation process of elections has become more popular — and more polarizing — as Republicans have grown increasingly skeptical of the election process since President Donald Trump’s baseless allegations of fraud in the 2020 presidential contest. 
The rule, proposed by the Wisconsin Elections Commission (WEC), provides more detail for what observers are allowed to do and where they are allowed to position themselves at polling places, and lays out the process for how an unruly observer can be removed. The rule’s final text was created with input from an advisory committee consisting of representatives of major and minor political parties, election clerks, disability rights groups and right-wing election conspiracy groups. 
The two most recent WEC chairs, Ann Jacobs, a Democrat, and Don Millis, a Republican, opened the testimony with each saying they have individual quibbles about the rule but the final text is the result of two years of consensus building and that legislators shouldn’t reject the rule because it isn’t perfect.
Millis said that the current statute guiding election observers is vague and this rule is the best chance of clarifying regulations to protect the rights of voters and observers because passing new legislation into law is challenging under the state’s divided government, with Republicans in control of the Legislature and a Democratic governor. 
“In the end, we can debate about whether the rule provides enough latitude or protection for observers, I agree,” Millis said. “I don’t agree with everything in the rule, but I don’t want the perfect to be the enemy of the good. Without this rule, municipal clerks have wide ranging authorities to manage polling places as they see fit. There’s no reasonable argument that observers are better off without this rule. Now certainly the Legislature could come up with an improved observer statute through legislation, but of course, that has to be signed into law. And there’s the rub.” 
Earlier this year, Republicans in the Assembly voted against an emergency rule that was broadly identical to the permanent rule being considered on Monday. In the hearing, Rep. Adam Neylon (R-Pewaukee) complained that legislators were not involved earlier in the rulemaking process. 
“I feel a little bit like you didn’t even try here,” Neylon said. “You didn’t even try to do legislation. You’re choosing a rule and then telling us, ‘We can’t even work with you guys. This is what we got to do.’ And I find that a little bit insulting.” 
Despite the inclusion of election skeptics on the advisory committee process, much of the testimony in the more than three-hour hearing came from election conspiracy theorists who oppose the rule’s adoption. One opponent of the bill said there needed to be observers at Wisconsin’s central count location for tabulating election results because the internet routers that transmit the results are manufactured by the “Chinese Communist party.” 
Wisconsin’s election results are tabulated at the local and county levels, not by the state, and while unofficial results get sent over the internet, official results are determined using the physical tapes obtained from the voting machines. 
Former state Rep. Janel Brandtjen, who was one of the Legislature’s most prominent election deniers, complained that when she has tried to observe voting in the past, she’s been denied access because limited seats are taken up by people “playing Candy Crush all day.” 
Brandtjen also talked about Janet Angus, a Green Bay woman who was charged with disorderly conduct after berating a woman who was attempting to return her husband’s absentee ballot during the April 2022 election. Angus, the Wisconsin Examiner reported, was involved in a Republican effort to influence the Green Bay mayoral election through a lawsuit against the city’s use of audio recording equipment in its security system. 
Brandtjen also objected to the rule’s provisions that treat members of the news media differently than observers — mostly by allowing them to take videos and photos inside polling places. Brandtjen said she found that “distasteful.” Jacobs explained that allowing the public to learn about the voting process through the media is important and allowing reporters to do their jobs is necessary. 
“We balanced the First Amendment right of the press with the limitations we’re putting on observers, and we felt that was a reasonable accommodation,” Jacobs said. 
Elections commissioner Robert Spindell, a Republican, voted against the rule’s passage when the commission considered it and testified against its passage on Monday. Spindell said he was against the rule because it doesn’t allow observers to record video or audio at polling places, which he said would allow clerks to remove observers from polling sites without the observers being able to protect themselves. 
Rep. Lee Snodgrass (D-Appleton) said that as members of the committee were talking about large portions of the public being skeptical of election results, it was “beyond the pale” that Spindell would be testifying to the committee because of his involvement in the fake electors scheme to overturn the results of the 2020 election. 
“Honestly, when members of this committee are talking about people still being concerned about election integrity, and we have somebody testifying who was a part of trying to overturn the 2020, election, I mean, if ever there was an unreliable witness on anything, I feel that that person is sitting in front of us today in this committee,” Snodgrass said.

David Bullard, R-Durant, sits at his desk on the Senate floor during the chamber's organizational day on Jan. 7, 2025. (Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – A Senate panel on Monday advanced a measure to prevent the use of popular abortion-inducing drugs, including mifepristone.
House Bill 1168 makes it a felony to intentionally deliver abortion-inducing drugs in the state.
“We are stopping the pill from the abortion side of this just because of the damage it does to an unborn person, primarily, but also because of the damage it does to women and mothers,” said Sen. David Bullard, R-Durant, the Senate author of the measure.
Abortion in Oklahoma is already illegal, except to save the life of the mother.
Abortion-inducing drugs, like RU486, better known as mifepristone, are not the same as the morning after pill. Abortion-inducing drugs end a pregnancy while the morning-after pill prevents pregnancy.
“RU486 has one intent and that intent is to murder an unborn child,” Bullard said.
Bullard said the measure would also prevent it from being shipped into Oklahoma through major carriers.
The measure would make it a felony with a fine not to exceed $100,000 or up to 10 years in prison or both.
“I simply cannot believe that we are continuing to try and create new felonies for substances that are legal, that do provide valid medical relief to individuals here in our state,” said Sen. Carri Hicks, D-Oklahoma City.
Hicks said she was appalled that the state continues to push the envelope when mothers are going into sepsis and experiencing fatal conditions before they can get medical intervention.
“This is the only medical procedure in the world that the success of the procedure depends on the death of the patient,” Bullard said.
The measure passed the Senate Health and Human Services Committee by a vote of 7-3. It is available for consideration in the Senate.

Speaking after several meetings in the state Capitol and on his way to talk with students at Michigan State University, Duggan took a moment to share with media some of his thoughts on his separation from the Democratic Party and his outlook of a state government that can cross the heightening political divide.
After Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer incurred the wrath of many within the Democratic Party for meeting with Republican President Donald Trump earlier this month, where Trump publicly offered her praise, Duggan said the situation is a prime example of how toxic and ineffective politics has become.
“My intention running independent is I’m going to work with everybody, and I’m going to work with people of good will on all sides, so the governor’s at a disadvantage because she ran as a Democrat, and Republicans had to line up against her and criticize her. It’s in a strange situation now that you got Democrats criticizing her too,” Duggan said.
Formerly calling her the ‘woman in Michigan’, Trump praises Whitmer during Oval Office visit

Whitmer as a leader went to Washington D.C. to advocate for Michigan, Duggan said, to push for a fighter aircraft mission that would help keep Macomb County’s Selfridge Air National Guard Base in operation and advocate to bring more manufacturing jobs to Flint.
“Democrats are tearing her down for trying to help Michigan,” Duggan said. “We need more people to push back on that and it’s one of the things I’m going to do.”
Duggan was expected to run for governor, but it came as a surprise in December when the three-term official broke from the Democratic Party to campaign as an independent candidate for the 2026 race.
A disgust with “toxic” politics was one of the driving forces behind his decision to run for the governor’s seat, Duggan has said since announcing his campaign to replace Whitmer, who will reach her term limit in 2026.
The gubernatorial race is becoming crowded early on across the ballot with Michigan Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt (R-Porter Township), U.S. Rep. John James (R-Shelby Township), former Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox, Genesee County truck driver Anthony Hudson and Traverse City native Evan Space putting their hats in the ring for the Republican bid and Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist, Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson and Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson in the running for the Democratic side.
Duggan, who has long been affiliated with the Democratic Party, joining former Vice President Kamala Harris on several of her presidential campaign visits to Michigan, is raising concerns within the Democratic party that he’ll be a spoiler candidate, leeching votes away from the eventual Democratic nominee.
“Democrats say that I’m splitting the party, but… the Democrats are doing just fine at attacking each other,” Duggan said. “What I hear up here and I’ve talked to a number of associations dealing with the Legislature, every one of them said they’ve never seen the partisan hostility as bad as it is today. You can’t get simple bills done because the Republicans and Democrats are constantly fighting and I think there’s a lot of enthusiasm for my candidacy. For everybody who deals with the legislature.”
Michigan’s GOP House Speaker and Mayor of Detroit push for expanded public safety funding

 
At the end of the two-year legislative session where Democrats held a first in decades bicameral majority in the Legislature, lawmakers reached a stalemate where House Republicans boycotted session over tipped wage and sick time leave bills not being put up for a vote, only for those policies to be addressed at the start of this year during a new session. In the meantime, many legislative efforts died in the crossfire and chaos of the lame duck session, including bills that would have made a Public Safety and Violence Prevention Fund to finance community law enforcement efforts statewide, a reality.
Detroit and other cities in Michigan, including Lansing saw spikes in violent crime during the COVID-19 pandemic that law enforcement and community violence intervention programs are still working to combat. Duggan has been a vocal supporter of the fund, which he believes will see movement in the state House this week.
Values like public safety and improving Michigan’s childhood literacy rates should be bipartisan efforts, with everyone in Lansing eager to lend a hand, Duggan said. And should he be elected, Duggan said that on his first say he’s sitting leaders down from around the state to address school funding and attracting tech companies and other economic partners to grow Michigan into a place where young people want to stay, noting Michigan’s stagnant population growth.
“I’m going to every corner of the state and talking to people who feel like they’ve been left behind and whether it’s rural areas up north or areas in southeastern Michigan that aren’t doing as well and I’m doing as much listening as talking right now,” Duggan said.
Ultimately, Duggan said Michigan needs to focus on the future and what could be rather than stay stuck in what has been under the ever-changing partisan control of swing-state Michigan.

SPRINGFIELD — Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul is asking state lawmakers for a $15 million increase in his General Revenue Fund budget for the upcoming year, saying his office needs a more “stable” system of funding as it takes on greater responsibilities, including the growing volume of litigation against the Trump administration.

In appearances before House and Senate budget committees in recent days, Raoul said the funding method that has traditionally been used for his office — one that relied heavily on fees and settlements generated by cases the office was involved in — no longer is sufficient to sustain its operations.

“This funding structure has evolved over the years as progressive court reforms have made fines and fees a less stable source of funding,” he told the House appropriations committee that oversees his office’s budget. “Also, proceeds from settlements or lawsuit damages are unreliable from year to year.”

In Fiscal Year 2019, the year Raoul took office, the attorney general’s budget totaled $87.7 million, according to state budget records. That included $32.2 million in general revenue funds and $54.5 million in “other state funds,” such as fees and settlements. Another $1 million came from federal funds.

Since then, the attorney general’s office has more than doubled. For the current fiscal year, the total budget stands at more than $193.7 million, including $105.5 million in general revenue funds and $74.9 million in “other state funds.” Federal funds are projected at $13.5 million.

Raoul’s proposed increase would bring next year’s general revenue fund budget to more than $120 million.

Since 2019, Raoul said, his office’s responsibilities have grown substantially. He said the General Assembly has passed 101 new laws — including some at Raoul’s own request — that either have added new duties or expanded existing duties of the office while his office has also been busy defending other laws passed by the General Assembly against legal challenges.

“The Attorney General's Office is the sole enforcement agency for violations of the Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act and parts of the SAFE-T Act,” he told the House panel. “Our office is working diligently to defend both new and long-standing laws against constitutional challenges. Each of these cases require significant resources, including costs associated with our attorneys, travel to courts across the state, lengthy discovery processes, as well as expert with witness retention.”

In addition to those challenges, however, Raoul has taken on additional legal work in recent months challenging actions of President Donald Trump’s administration.

Since Trump was sworn into office for a second term on Jan. 20, Raoul has joined in filing 11 federal lawsuits challenging administration actions and has filed another 14 amicus briefs in support of other legal challenges. It is also defending the state against two lawsuits that the Trump administration has filed against Illinois.

“This budget will support supplying the requisite attorneys to step up where the federal government is stepping away, as well as attorneys involved in critical cases to protect our state's interests,” Raoul said.

Raoul’s office would not provide specific information about the number of attorneys or other staff it would hire with the additional money. A spokesperson in his office told Capitol News Illinois in an email that the money would allow the office “to hire additional attorneys to perform our growing statutorily-required responsibilities in addition to the critical work of vigorously defending the rights of Illinois residents from unconstitutional attacks by the Trump administration.”

Raoul also did not provide specific answers to questions from Republican lawmakers about how much his office has spent, or how many hours his attorneys have worked, pursuing litigation against the Trump administration.

“Our attorneys are, you know, they're not billing hours. They're on salary,” he said. “And so whether they work 20 hours in a day or eight hours in a day, they are compensated.”

Legislative committees are still in the process of holding hearings on each state agency’s budget request for the upcoming year. A final budget is expected to be voted on by the end of May.

How?,CT Mirror's Long Story Short,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/21/podcast-chris-murphy/,CT Mirror's Mark Pazniokas discusses his story about Sen. Chris Murphy becoming one of congressional Democrats' most outspoken anti-Trump voices.,"U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) has become one of congressional Democrats’ most outspoken anti-Trump voices. What is he doing differently from his colleagues?
WSHU’s Ebong Udoma spoke with CT Mirror’s Mark Pazniokas to discuss his article, “Chris Murphy, a new ‘pugilistic populist,’ maps resistance to Trump,” as part of the collaborative podcast Long Story Short. Read Mark’s story here.
WSHU: Hello, Mark.
MP: Hello.
WSHU: You say U.S. Senator Chris Murphy (D-CT) is at the forefront of Democratic resistance to the Trump administration. Is that what prompted you to spend some time with him?
MP: Yes. I mean, this is something that has been evolving since the week after the election. He had that kind of heart-to-heart chat via video on Twitter (X) with people, issuing a bit of a mea culpa on behalf of the Democratic Party for losing touch with its working-class base, praising Bernie Sanders, saying that he had been wrongfully described as having fringe positions. And ever since then, he has really been trying to assert a role as somebody leading the resistance to President Trump, but also offering Democrats some suggestions on how to proceed. Unlike Senator Sanders, he does not really have a fiery mass rally type of approach to this. You know, I likened him to somebody who is more appropriate for a TED talk. His style is almost like he’s coaching the party.
So anyway, we decided it was time to spend a little time with the senator who’s been raising a boatload of money and promising to go out on the road to bring this message to Republican districts. And anyway, that was just it was his time to spend a little bit of time with the Senator in Washington. So I spent a couple of days with him in DC, and a little bit more in Connecticut.
WSHU: One fascinating aspect about him is his social media savvy. What were you able to observe?
MP: Yes, he is very much of the generation who’s comfortable on social media, both short form and long form messaging. What I mean by that is he also has a Substack account, and he will write longish pieces going a little bit deeper about what he’s talking about. He is not averse to being repetitive. He repurposes his messaging, and he adds to it, which is considered to be the bedrock of modern political communication. One should not be shy about repeating oneself. That is the advice that politicians get these days, and he does so in different venues. He’s on Instagram. He is on really every social media platform. When I was in Washington, he delivered a floor speech outlining what he saw as the President’s approach to establishing an autocracy, and he gave a different version of that on Instagram just Thursday, which has gotten a fair amount of attention. Again, it’s a different demographic. It’s a younger audience. And he is not trying to shake the rafters of an old school speech, but he is really coming across as somebody giving a heart-to-heart in a more intimate setting. And that’s what these videos are. So he is very much a politician of the moment, as far as how you communicate with the base and try to expand the base.
WSHU: Talking about not being formal, I mean, he’d play a basketball game, and right after that, he’d get online and do something. And it’s woven into everyday living for him.
MP: It is, and he handles his own social media accounts, and he does most of his own writing for speeches, which is what he has told me. And and so he’s very comfortable as a communicator, but again, a communicator that is trying to make a substantive point in a way that the temperature is a little bit cooler than what we get from Bernie Sanders or AOC, who are having a very successful series of rallies that have attracted upwards of 30,000 people at times, which is bigger than Kamala Harris did during her campaign. So it’s a very impressive turnout, representing something as far as the cord they are striking with people who are upset with President Trump. At this point, Senator Murphy is raising money much the same way Bernie Sanders does. It’s small-dollar contributions casting a national net, and in the first quarter of this year, he raised $8 million that way, which, as far as among the senators who are not facing an immediate re-election challenge, made him second only to Bernie Sanders in raising money.
WSHU: Bernie Sanders has run for president a couple of times now. Does Murphy have that as an ambition?
MP: That’s always a question with Senator Murphy. When you are raising money and it’s off cycle, and whether you have the profile that he does on social media, inevitably, those questions come up. He continues to duck those questions. He insisted to me that he is motivated by rallying the troops, as it were, against what he sees as a threat to democracy. He said he does not have any plans for higher office, but you know that’s always in the back of your mind when you’re looking at somebody like Murphy. The party, obviously, is struggling over who will be the new generation of leadership.
Bernie Sanders is very popular, but he is 83 years old. He is not talking about running again when his term expires, which is the same time as Senator Murphy; his term would be up in 2030. So you know Cory Booker, who had that record-setting filibuster, Booker is a friend of Murphy’s. He’s a contemporary. They are in that same group of folks that people are looking at. Booker ran for president once before. Murphy is one of those people who is always on the list of people who are mentioned, you know, the Washington Post over the years mentioned him as a likely candidate for president in different cycles, even putting him up with people who had already created campaign committees and were actively running. Murphy has never done that. You know, he has to decide what he wants to be over the long term.
WSHU: But it is interesting that he’s going on this, he’s going out to red states to do some events with the youngest member of the House, which is Maxwell Frost, I believe.
MP: Correct.
WSHU: Who’s 28 years old? You have Bernie Sanders going with a 35-year-old AOC, so what’s going on there?
MP: Well, yes, that’s a great question. He said, you know, Congressman Frost shares his sense of urgency, but clearly there are some programming considerations, you know, a little bit of diversity, as far as age appeal, racial diversity.
WSHU: Frost was supported by Bernie Sanders.
MP: He was, and in fact, he has appeared on stage with Bernie Sanders.
WSHU: He introduced him at Coachella. I believe.
MP: Yes, he did. But you know, when it comes to Murphy’s ambitions, you have to remember that this is somebody who was elected to the State House of Representatives at the age of 25, he was elected to the State Senate age of 29, to the U.S. House of Representatives at 33, and to the Senate at 39. So now he’s 51, and the Senate is a place where, as an individual legislator, you can have great influence. But the question is, is that enough for Chris Murphy?
When people speculate about presidential ambitions, you know, they overlook whether or not maybe he’s more interested in being the Senate Democratic leader at some point. He very publicly broke with Chuck Schumer over the question of Schumer’s voting with Republicans to keep the government open. Murphy is preaching that the Democratic members of Congress need to be more risk-tolerant and to really take some dramatic steps, and letting the government shut down on the Republicans’ watch would be one of those steps. It would be risky, Murphy acknowledges, but yeah, that is another potential career path for him. But again, he is very close to the vest on whether he has that ambition; he really waved off any questions about his future when I was chatting with him in his office the other day.
WSHU: In the meantime, he’s emerged as a leader in the resistance against President Trump.
MP: And it’s a position he’s been very comfortable in taking, since really the week after the election, and building on it ever since. So again, when it comes to his personal ambition, it’s natural to look at this activity and say, where does he want to go with this? For the time being, he says, really his only goal is to get the party back on track, where it’s speaking to working-class people and also resisting what he is describing as President Trump’s efforts to establish a de facto autocracy.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MURPHY-PROFILE-8-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-21 18:11:50.963633

Arraj United States Courthouse in Denver on Monday. Macdonald represents plaintiffs who are suing the Trump administration over their potential deportation under the Alien Enemies Act. (Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)A federal judge in Denver will soon decide whether to issue a temporary restraining order that would bar the Trump administration from removing from Colorado people who could be deported under the Alien Enemies Act.
At least 11 people have already been deported from Colorado to a brutal prison in El Salvador, a lawyer for the plaintiffs in the case said Monday.
The case was brought as a habeas corpus petition by two Venezuelan nationals held at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Aurora. They sued President Donald Trump and other federal officials earlier this month, challenging the government’s authority to remove them from Colorado.
Represented by lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union, the plaintiffs also ask U.S. District Judge Charlotte Sweeney to declare Trump’s use of the Alien Enemies Act unlawful, and they ask the court to certify the lawsuit as a class action, so that it would cover many other immigrants who are in custody in Colorado and could be removed from the country to the CECOT prison in El Salvador, where the Trump administration has already sent scores of detainees.
Sweeney heard arguments in the case Monday morning and said she would issue a ruling within 24 hours.

Tim Macdonald, legal director of the ACLU of Colorado, represented the plaintiffs during the hearing. He pointed to recent government behavior in Texas and elsewhere, as well as an emergency ruling early Saturday by the U.S. Supreme Court, as indications that swift protections against removal for his clients were necessary.
He said that despite a Supreme Court ruling earlier this month that immigrants subject to Alien Enemies Act removal must be given “reasonable notice” to challenge their deportation in court, the Trump administration has engaged in a game of “whack-a-mole” by moving immigrants out of districts where deportations were temporarily barred to a facility in north Texas, where deportations were not barred. Macdonald said the Trump administration has interpreted “reasonable notice” in a way that gives no realistic opportunity for detainees to challenge their removal.
The Supreme Court in a rare early morning ruling Saturday halted deportations in the north Texas district, after it appeared authorities at the detention facility there were preparing detainees for removal.
Detainees in Colorado face a similar risk without the protection of a temporary restraining order, Macdonald argued.
“This has life or death consequences,” he said.
Lawyers for the Trump administration argued that Sweeney lacks jurisdiction to hear the case, because federal authorities have determined so far that the plaintiffs are not subject to deportation under the Aliens Enemies Act. The plaintiffs argue, however, that their status could change, and federal authorities in other cases have acted within hours to deport immigrants under the act and have failed to provide detainees due process.
Macdonald told reporters after the hearing that at least 11 people who were detained in Aurora have already been removed to the prison in El Salvador. The prison, which is alleged to keep detainees in inhumane conditions, is where U.S. authorities mistakenly sent Maryland resident Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia.
Macdonald estimates that more than 100 people detained in Aurora would qualify as members of the class that’s proposed in the lawsuit.
Trump proclaimed on March 15 that all Venezuelans who are not permanent U.S. residents, are 14 years or older, and are members of the gang Tren de Aragua, or TdA, can be removed from the U.S. under the Alien Enemies Act, a 1798 law that has been invoked on only three previous occasions and only during war. The Trump administration says 137 people have been deported under the Alien Enemies Act.
Plaintiffs in the Colorado case are identified by their initials, D.B.U. and R.M.M. They both deny being members of TdA.
D.B.U. is a 32-year-old asylum seeker who has lived in Colorado with his wife and two children. R.M.M. is also a Colorado resident who is seeking asylum. He says that he fled Venezuela to escape TdA, which killed his wife’s father and uncle and which he fears will kill him and his wife and children. 
Last week, Sweeney issued an initial order that halted Alien Enemies Act deportations in Colorado.

SPRINGFIELD — When Illinois named small farmer Nathan Ryder a finalist for a federal $100,000 Local Food Infrastructure Grant, he made big plans for his farm in the southeastern tip of the state. Then the U.S. Department of Agriculture cut his funding.

The Ryder family farm, a 10-acre operation in Pope County that produces chicken eggs, sheep and some fruits and vegetables, would have used the money to purchase a refrigerated truck.  Ryder said he wanted to use the truck to sell his own products farther away. He was also going to transport other farmers’ food back to Southern Illinois, expanding that rural region’s access to healthy, affordable food.

“Why is it that [people’s access to fresh fruits and vegetables] is somehow considered optional?” Ryder asked in an interview. “We should be able to feed the people around us.”

Illinois was approved for $43 million in federal reimbursement funds for two food programs designed to strengthen statewide food systems, but when the Trump administration took office it informed the stated, without explanation, that the remaining $17.8 million in federal agriculture reimbursements still owed to Illinois would cease after Jan. 19, 2025.

Farmers like Ryder have asked the state to consider new models for subsidizing, planning and regulating agriculture to help them keep Illinoisans fed. Illinois lawmakers are trying to help by pushing two bills through the legislature.


The first, HB 3701, would reallocate state funds to purchase farm food locally.
The second, HB 2196, would help poultry farmers sell more of their products directly to consumers.


Both the Illinois General Assembly and Gov. JB Pritzker have shown some reluctance to spend state money on this issue, citing budgetary concerns. But the two bills that soared through the House Agriculture Committee recently both demonstrated dedication to supporting local farmers amid turbulent changes in the federal government.

The first bill, the Good Food Purchasing Law (GFPL), proposed by Rep. Sonya Harper, D-Chicago, would reestablish the Good Food Purchasing Policy Task Force with a new mandate to find between one and three Illinois-run institutions (public colleges, for example) that would begin purchasing from small local farmers like Ryder. Currently such institutions are fiscally obligated to purchase food from the lowest bidder, often larger companies in places outside Illinois that have more agriculture capacity.

“I represent communities on the South Side of Chicago, where healthy access to food has never been guaranteed,” Harper said at a press conference in Springfield earlier this month. “And so this bill addresses issues that I’ve seen firsthand in my district.”

Currently 3 million Illinoisans, roughly 1-in-4, live in food deserts, defined by the USDA as areas with little access to healthy food.

If the bill passes, Illinois would be the first state in the country to promote purchasing locally sourced ethical food within its own state departments. Such programs already exist in 72 institutions across 26 cities, funded through a combination of local and federal dollars, including in Cook County since 2017.

The Good Food Purchasing Law that made it past the House Agriculture Committee is a watered-down version of a more-significant bill that would have required some state agencies to immediately start purchasing local, ethically sourced food. That version was opposed by a number of state departments, including the Department of Agriculture and Department of Corrections.

The House Agriculture Committee voted in favor of the stronger GFPL bill 6-3 on March 18th, along partisan lines, with Republican lawmakers opposing it. The amended version passed unanimously in committee last week on April 8.

However, last week the bill was sent back to the Rules Committee, because it was growing late in this legislative session to push it through. In the bill’s place, Harper put forward HJR 0027, a nonbinding resolution that calls for Illinois departments to implement this measure as soon as practicable. The resolution calls for recreating the Good Food Purchasing Policy Task Force and urges, but does not require, state agencies to investigate their potential for a good food purchasing pilot program.

The other bill deals with poultry. In addition to expanding local farmers’ industry by reallocating state funds to purchase local farm food, legislators hope to loosen rules on self-processed poultry in order to help local farmers sell more of their products directly to consumers. The House Agriculture Committee on April 8 also unanimously passed this second bill, an amendment to the Meat and Poultry Inspection Act (HB 2196), sponsored by Rep. Charles Meier, R-Okawville.

Should the bill become law, self-processed chicken would be available at local farmers markets, both decreasing Illinoisans’ reliance on large chicken growers and opening more of an industry for local farmers.

This bill also raises the annual cap for on-farm poultry processing from 5,000 head to 7,500 head. Most of Illinois’ neighboring states have higher limits, and 40 states have caps of 20,000.

Illinois currently has only four poultry processing facilities, according to farmer Ed Dubrick of DuChick Ranch in Cissna Park in Iroquois County. As locally grown meat grows more popular, Dubrick has to book very far in advance to get processing time slots, which means he’s often not selling his product at its best. Further, the hours-long drives to processing plants can be hard on the animals, says Dubrick.

Larger companies that can afford their own processing facilities don’t face the same burden.

For niche poultry products like quail, Illinois has no poultry processors at all, Dubrick said. Some farmers must drive to the East Coast to process their product, a risky trip for the quails and a financial burden for small farmers, who often benefit from selling niche products.

Harper raised a concern during the Agriculture Committee meeting that it might be best to hold off on loosening poultry regulations until after the current bird flu outbreak subsides. But witnesses testified that they believe this bill wouldn’t increase the risk of flu spreading, and Harper has since been supportive.

The poultry bill passed through the House earlier this month without opposition.

Both HB 3701 and HJR 0027 are still under review by the Pritzker administration, which has yet to take a position on either, according to a statement from the governor’s press secretary, Alex Gough.

HB 3701 still needs to make it through the Senate, where it’s currently waiting to be assigned to a committee for review.

Mike Bousselot, R-Ankeny, announced Monday he is exploring a 2026 gubernatorial bid.
His announcement, posted on the social media platform X, comes less than two weeks after Gov. Kim Reynolds said she would not seek another term as governor in the upcoming election.
Reynolds has held office since 2017, taking the position after former Gov. Terry Branstad vacated the governor’s office to serve as U.S. ambassador to China during President Donald Trump’s first term. As Branstad had held the office since 2010, Republicans have not had an open primary field heading into a gubernatorial election for over a decade. The 2026 election will be the first time for several Republicans interested in the position to compete without an incumbent in the race.
Bousselot is one of the Republicans interested in competing for the governorship. He said he launched an exploratory campaign for the Iowa governor’s race Monday, thanking Reynolds for her leadership in a statement and saying he has received encouragement from others to run.

“The next governor has big shoes to fill,” he said. “I am honored by the calls asking me to consider running for governor. I am exploring this run because our next governor of Iowa should be a leader who listens to the people, acts on principle and works tirelessly to deliver results.”
Bousselot has served as state senator for Iowa’s Senate District 21 since 2023. He first took elected office in 2021, winning a special election to represent House District 37 from 2021 through 2023. Before his election, Bousselot served as the director of the Department of Management under Reynolds and as Branstad’s chief of staff in the governor’s office.
Branstad was one of the people who have encouraged Bousselot to run for governor, according to the news release. The former governor said in a statement he was “pleased Mike Bousselot is considering running for governor.”
“I have known Mike since 2009,” Branstad said. “… Mike worked hand-in-hand with President Trump’s team during the president’s first term, and he will be a fighter for President Trump again. Mike has the work ethic, vision and character necessary to lead Iowa to an even brighter future.”
Alongside Bousselot, several other Republicans have expressed interest in the position. Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird indicated in a statement she is considering a run, and House Speaker Pat Grassley told reporters last week he is “not ruling anything out” when considering a 2026 gubernatorial bid. The Des Moines Register reported State Rep. Bobby Kaufmann, R-Wilton, is also considering running for the position. One Republican, former GOP state Rep. Brad Sherman, announced his gubernatorial campaign prior to Reynolds announcing she would not run for reelection.
Iowa Auditor Rob Sand, the sole Democrat to hold statewide elected office, has not officially announced plans to run for governor in 2026, but is widely expected to join the race after having raised significant funds leading into the upcoming election season.

(Courtesy of the New Jersey Governor's Office)State education officials are working to launch a new computerized student proficiency exam that could be implemented as early as next year, Education Commissioner Kevin Dehmer told the Assembly Budget Committee Monday.
Dehmer told the budget panel he expects the department to begin implementing the new assessment in the spring of 2026, adding that its electronic nature will allow for speedier data analysis that could help educators address underperformance on specific topics and subjects.
“One of the big things is we’re able to gain more information with less seat time, and because of the accessibility of data, we can translate that back so that teachers can focus on core areas for students so they understand where students might be struggling,” he said.
The electronic test, referred to only as “next-gen” or the “next generation assessment” Monday, could also be tailored to student performance, allowing more advanced students to tackle tougher questions.
Less advanced students could see simpler questions, Dehmer said, to better identify areas in need of improvement.
“Maybe it’s with a certain teacher. It comes out they didn’t emphasize something enough, they can go back and change how they’re doing things to make sure students are picking that subject matter up a little bit better,” the commissioner said.
The changes would come as schools are fighting to overcome learning losses incurred during the pandemic.
Results from the New Jersey Student Learning Assessment released in December showed some improvement in math and English test scores, but proficiency continued to lag behind prepandemic levels in both subjects.
That year, 52% of tested students met or exceeded expectations on the English language arts exam, compared to 58% in 2019, while 40% met or exceeded expectations on the math assessment, compared to 45% five years earlier.
 School funding

Some committee member raised concerns about proposed changes to the state’s school funding formula that would allow and incentivize districts raising too little locally to seek higher property tax increases to meet their fair share — the portion of funding a school district is responsible for raising through property taxes.
“Our fear … is that we allow that to happen just for one year, which was last year, and then this kind of opens the gate to something else that we really don’t have control of, of how much a district may be able to raise. It puts us in a precarious position,” said Assemblywoman Eliana Pintor Marin (D-Essex), the panel’s chair.
As lawmakers move to finalize a new state budget by June 30, Gov. Phil Murphy has proposed a $20 million pool of funding to encourage districts taxing beneath their local fair share to seek tax increases above the state’s 2% cap on property tax growth. Murphy also wants to limit decreases in state aid to 3% and increases to 6%.
Under budget language proposed by the administration, districts that raise taxes above the 2% cap would receive $1 million or 5% of the tax increase that fell above the cap, whichever is less.
In recent weeks, some school districts have proposed staggering property tax increases, but Dehmer, speaking generally, said such plans could overstate the level of tax increases a district would eventually seek.
“What they chose to do was say, ‘We’re going to pass a resolution for the maximum amount, and we’re going to work through this from there,’” Dehmer said. “I think there was some reporting on those resolutions saying, ‘We’re going to go up this high,’ and that may not be the final version that comes to pass.”",https://newjerseymonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/42712297215_30935ab2e2_c.jpg,,,2025-04-21 18:11:50.963633

More than 5 million borrowers sit in default on their federal student loans, and just 38% of borrowers are current on their payments, the department said.“American taxpayers will no longer be forced to serve as collateral for irresponsible student loan policies,” U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon said in a statement Monday.During last year’s presidential campaign, President Donald Trump criticized his predecessor and successor, President Joe Biden, for his efforts to erase student debt. McMahon resumed that line of attack Monday, blaming Biden’s administration for unreasonably raising borrowers’ expectations of forgiveness.“The Biden Administration misled borrowers: the executive branch does not have the constitutional authority to wipe debt away, nor do the loan balances simply disappear. Hundreds of billions have already been transferred to taxpayers,” McMahon said.She added that “going forward, the Department of Education, in conjunction with the Department of Treasury, will shepherd the student loan program responsibly and according to the law, which means helping borrowers return to repayment — both for the sake of their own financial health and our nation’s economic outlook.”The department said the Office of Federal Student Aid will restart the Treasury Offset Program, which the U.S. Treasury Department administers, on May 5.The Education Department statement said all borrowers who are in default will get emails over the next two weeks “making them aware of these developments and urging them to contact the Default Resolution Group to make a monthly payment, enroll in an income-driven repayment plan, or sign up for loan rehabilitation.”The department said the Office of Federal Student Aid will “send required notices beginning administrative wage garnishment” later this summer.More than 42.7 million borrowers owe more than $1.6 trillion in student debt, according to the department. The administration claims that “instead of protecting responsible taxpayers, the Biden-Harris Administration put them on the hook for irresponsible lending, pushing the federal student loan portfolio toward a fiscal cliff.”",,,,2025-04-21 18:11:50.963633

Kevin Stitt’s desk Monday after over an hour of discussion on the House floor. 
Senate Bill 672, authored by Sen. Julie McIntosh, R-Porter, and Rep. Kevin West, R-Moore, would require “scientific evidence” that a business contributes to spreading disease during a declared pandemic before a governor can order businesses closed. The governor would also need to provide notice and an opportunity for a hearing to “nonessential” businesses.
Critics of the bill, all Democrats, said the legislation would prioritize protecting businesses over human life and fails to create clear processes for hearings or define what is considered “scientific evidence.” Supporters said the measure, which passed 74-15 along party lines, was “preventative maintenance” that protected due process for businesses. 
“This is not an indictment of what’s happened in the past, but it’s all about what we’re gonna do moving forward … that we’re going to use due process,” West said. 
Rep. John Waldron, D-Tulsa, said during the COVID-19 pandemic best practices to mitigate the spread were not known and this measure could prevent “erring on the side of caution.” 
But Rep. Chris Sneed, R-Fort Gibson, said this measure will protect small businesses from “government overreach.” 
Stitt said Wednesday he supported the measure “on the surface,” but would fully review its contents when it came to his desk.

(Photo by Jackie Llanos/Florida Phoenix)The federal government is blaming a U.S. citizen for his arrest during a traffic stop in Leon County last week under a temporarily blocked state immigration law.
A senior official with the Department of Homeland Security said Monday that Juan Carlos Lopez-Gomez, a 20-year-old born in Georgia, was detained Wednesday after he told a Florida Highway Patrol trooper that he was in the country illegally.
“Immediately after learning the individual was a United States citizen, he was released,” a DHS senior official said in a statement Monday. “When individuals admit to committing a crime, like entering the country illegally, they will of course be detained while officers investigate.”
The trooper charged Lopez-Gomez following a traffic stop with illegally entering the state as an “unauthorized alien,” under a new state law that a federal judge temporarily suspended on April 4. Lopez-Gomez, released from Leon County jail Thursday evening, insists he told the trooper he was a U.S. citizen born in Georgia, handed over his Social Security card and Georgia ID, which meets federal security standards under the REAL ID Act of 2005.
The case garnered national attention following Florida Phoenix’s reporting on Thursday.
Differing accounts
The arrest report states that Lopez-Gomez said he was in the country illegally and had entered Florida illegally, but turned over his ID. However, the arrest report doesn’t mention the Social Security card. The trooper stopped the car Wednesday morning because the driver was going 78 mph in a 65 mph zone, according to the report. Lopez-Gomez was a passenger in the car with two others on his way to a flooring job from Cairo, Georgia, to Tallahassee.
Amilcar Sales-Lopez, a family member of the driver and boss of the crew, said he arrived at the scene on U.S. Highway 319 because the men called him as they were getting pulled over. Sales-Lopez told the two troopers that Lopez-Gomez was a U.S. citizen, but first had to hand over his Florida driver’s license, he said in a phone interview with Florida Phoenix.
“He said I had to verify who I was or that they would arrest me,” Sales-Lopez said in Spanish.
“They wanted to intimidate me,” he added.
The arrest report doesn’t mention that Sales-Lopez was present during the arrest.
The 20-year-old’s first language is Tzotzil, a Mayan language, his mother told the Phoenix. He lived in Mexico from the time he was 1-year-old until four years ago, when he returned to Georgia.
The Phoenix has requested video footage of the arrest from the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles. A spokesperson from the department repeated in a statement to the Phoenix Friday that Lopez-Gomez had stated he was in the country illegally and that he had a federal detainer issued on him.
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement issued a detainer asking the jail to hold Lopez-Gomez for 48 hours after his arrest. A Leon County judge cited the ICE hold as the reason she lacked jurisdiction to release Lopez-Gomez, even though she found no probable cause for the arrest after inspecting the Georgia birth certificate and Social Security card his mom brought to court.
The ICE hold states that DHS determined Lopez-Gomez could be deported based on biometric confirmation of his identity and his statements to an immigration officer or “reliable evidence.”
DHS did not respond when the Phoenix asked whether the arresting trooper had federal authorization to act as an immigration official. Approximately 1,400 troopers have completed 40 hours of training to question and arrest people they suspect are in the country without authorization.
Although Attorney General James Uthmeier argues the federal prohibition on enforcement of the law, SB 4C, doesn’t apply to law enforcement, he sent a memo Friday to FHP, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, police chiefs, and sheriffs stating that they shouldn’t arrest or detain anyone under the suspended law.
U.S. District Court Judge Kathleen Williams extended her prohibition on the enforcement of Florida’s immigration law until April 29.

(Julia Goldberg/Source NM)In advance of an expected executive order on Tuesday, New Mexico’s federal delegation, led by U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), the top Democrat on the U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, sent a letter on April 21 to U.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum requesting the federal government leave the state’s monuments intact.
“National monuments are vitally important to our history and any proposals to reduce their boundaries will not  be reflective of the voices of New Mexicans,” the delegation wrote. “Each monument in New Mexico represents years of community  advocacy and support for the protection of the value they hold. In New Mexico, we have a $3.2 billion outdoor  recreation sector and monuments are a significant contributor to this robust economy.”
The letter particularly singles out Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks National Monument, Rio Grande del Norte, and Kasha-Katuwe Tent Rocks, which the letter says “are under consideration for  reduction or elimination.”
Organ Mountains in the southern part of the state hosts “significant petroglyph and archeological sites,” the letter notes, while Rio Grande del Norte “boasts some of  New Mexico’s most prized recreational opportunities in an area where the Rio Grande carves an 800-foot gorge through historic volcanic activity” and “provides access for traditional use like piñon nut collection.” Regarding Tent Rocks, the delegation notes that TIME included it on its list of the World’s Greatest Places of 2025. “Not only is Tent Rocks ‘geologically surreal,’ the letter says, “but it is  also a sacred landscape to the Cochiti Pueblo.”
“There is no greater value to these natural landscapes than what is brought to the community through their continued protection,” the letter concludes. “Withdrawing protections from these sites would threaten the economic benefits associated with New Mexico’s outdoor recreation economy and it undermines our community and tribal voices.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/tentrocks3-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-21 17:06:42.551649

Bob Ferguson in his first bill signing event on Friday, April 4, 2025. (Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)During his inaugural address in January, Gov. Bob Ferguson highlighted his support for a bill that would grant the governor authority to limit other states’ National Guard troops from entering Washington, unless they are mobilized by the president. 
On Monday, Ferguson signed the policy into law.
“We cannot allow as a state to have armed forces come into our home and enforce policies that are against our core values,” Ferguson said. “State autonomy is the foundation of our federalist system. This bill is a simple but very important expression of that system.”
House Bill 1321 came after Republican governors put out a statement in December saying they were “ready to utilize every tool at our disposal,” including the National Guard, to enforce President Donald Trump’s immigration policies. 
Lead bill sponsor Rep. Sharlett Mena, D-Tacoma, has said that without the bill, “there is nothing to prevent other states from sending their National Guards here to carry out their own agendas.”
Democrats say they consulted with the state’s Military Department, the Office of the Attorney General, and others to ensure the bill didn’t create unintended consequences, like undermining military readiness or disaster response. 
The law will take effect immediately. 
Republicans questioned the need for the legislation, with state Rep. Jim Walsh, R-Aberdeen, calling it “pointless” during floor debate.
The National Guard is a state-based military force when not activated for federal service and is under the command of the state governor and the president of the United States. Some states also have State Guards, which are under state control. 
Many states, including Republican strongholds like Texas, Idaho and North Dakota, already have laws on the books similar to the new Washington law. 
States have previously sent National Guard troops to other states to support immigration enforcement. In 2021, Texas launched an operation to increase security along the state’s section of the southern border with Mexico. Other Republican states, like Florida and Montana, have sent their own National Guard troops to support Texas.

DemasMembers of the University of Michigan Faculty Senate voted overwhelmingly in support of a resolution to establish a mutual defense compact with other universities in the Big Ten Academic Alliance according to results posted on Monday. 
The faculty Senate voted 92.8% in favor of the resolution, which was introduced at its meeting last Thursday, and was voted on by faculty members through the weekend. It calls on university President Santa J. Ono to propose and help establish a mutual academic defense compact among all members of the Big Ten as President Donald Trump cracks down on American Universities, pulling funding from research and threatening further cuts against institutions that do not comply with the administration’s orders. 
Throughout last year’s campaign trail, Trump threatened to cut federal funding “for any school pushing critical race theory and radical gender ideology.” As Trump works to eliminate federal diversity, equity and inclusion efforts several universities, including U of M, have shuttered or restructured their DEI offices.
The Trump administration has also sought to silence Pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses, while more than 1,500 international students — including students at several Michigan universities — have had their visas revoked by the administration.
“Whereas recent and escalating politically motivated actions by governmental bodies pose a significant threat to the foundational principles of American higher education, including the autonomy of university governance, the integrity of scientific research, and the protection of free speech;”
“Whereas the Trump administration and aligned political actors have signaled a willingness to target individual institutions with legal, financial, and political incursion designed to undermine their public mission, silence dissenting voices, and/or exert improper control over academic inquiry,” the resolution reads, calling for solidarity between the 18 universities which make up the Big Ten. 
Under the compact, the universities would contribute to a shared or distributed defense fund for “immediate and strategic support to any member institution under direct political or legal infringement.”
The compact also asks that the participating institutions share their legal counsel, governance experts and public affairs offices at the request of any member facing political infringement to coordinate a “a unified and vigorous response.” 
This response would include but not be limited to legal representation and countersuit actions; strategic public communication; amicus briefs and expert testimony; legislative advocacy and coalition-building and related topical research as needed. 
Michigan State University, Indiana University, Rutgers University and University of Nebraska-Lincoln have adopted similar resolutions with Ohio State University slated to vote on a resolution this week, while the University of Southern California will hold its vote on May 7. 
According to a report from the Daily Bruin, the University of California, Los Angeles academic senate will consider a resolution in defense of the University of California, alongside an endorsement of a “shared values of higher education” statement assembled by senate leaders within the Big Ten Academic Alliance. However, UCLA Academic Senate Chair Kathleen Bawn did not confirm whether the university would take up a mutual defense compact resolution. 
While not a member of the Big Ten, University of Massachusetts Amherst has passed its own mutual defense compact resolution aiming to partner with the nation’s nearly 250 public land grant universities alongside other Massachusetts higher learning institutions.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_0011-2-scaled-e1745267718418-1024x623.jpg,,,2025-04-21 17:06:42.551649

(Photo courtesy of University of Northern Iowa)The University of Northern Iowa’s business school has made its first international partnership to bring students from Thailand to Cedar Falls to study, the university has announced.
According to a news release, UNI and Assumption University in Bangkok signed an agreement last week to form a 2+2 program for students to complete the first two years of courses at Assumption then finish a business degree at UNI.
The partnership has been in the works for almost two years, according to the release, and students participating in the 2+2 program are expected to start heading to UNI in 2026. Founded as the Assumption School of Business in 1969, Assumption University of Thailand is a private, nonprofit university overseen by global Catholic order the Brothers of St. Gabriel.

UNI Global Opportunities Coordinator Chris Schrage taught graduate marketing management courses at Assumption during the fall 2024 semester, the release stated, and nine countries were represented among the 40 students she taught.
“We really like what they have to offer: the rigor of their classrooms and the fact that they have such a wide range of students asking about international opportunities when they aren’t even from Thailand,” Schrage said in the release.
According to the release, the two institutions are also working on programs to offer students international study for shorter terms. A release from Assumption University stated this initial agreement could pave the way for more “shared learning experiences,” including further student and faculty exchanges and joint programming.
Wilson College of Business Associate Dean Mary Connerley said in the release the new partnership will help students from both schools broaden their horizons and global knowledge.
“Bringing international students to UNI helps our students be exposed to different ways of thinking, different cultures and different ways of living,” Connerley said in the release. “We have a lot of students who like to travel on study abroad programs. We want to continue to offer those programs, but not all of our students can do that. So I think it’s great when we can bring more students here from different cultures. It can lead to our students developing some really deep friendships.”

(Photo by Corrie Boudreaux for Source NM)Arizona’s top state prosecutor is seeking more information about immigration officials’ arrest of a U.S. citizen from New Mexico earlier this month.
A federal prosecutor with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Arizona on April 9 filed a criminal complaint against 19-year-old Jose Hermosillo, of Albuquerque.
The complaint alleges that on April 8, immigration agents found Hermosillo “without proper immigration documents” near Nogales, Arizona.
Arizona Public Media reports that Hermosillo and his girlfriend were visiting from Albuquerque to see family in Tucson, Arizona. The radio station reports that Hermosillo said he has never been to Nogales and that he was held in the Florence Correctional Center for 10 days.
A few days after the U.S. Marshals took Hermosillo to Florence, his family presented documents showing his U.S. citizenship, according to a statement provided to Source on Monday in response to an emailed inquiry to its Office of Public Affairs email address. The statement is attributable to a “senior U.S. Department of Homeland Security official,” the unsigned email said. 
On Monday morning, Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes posted on X that her office had reached out to ICE for more information about Hermosillo’s arrest, “for answers on how this was allowed to happen to an American citizen.”
“It is wholly unacceptable to wrongfully detain U.S. citizens,” she wrote.
A spokesperson for Mayes’ office told Source NM in an email that the request was made over the phone but declined to comment further.
The complaint, signed by a U.S. Border Patrol agent and a prosecutor, alleges that Hermosillo “admitted to illegally entering the United States from Mexico” on April 7. It also wrongfully states that he is a “citizen of Mexico.”
According to the DHS official, Hermosillo “said he wanted to turn himself in and completed a sworn statement identifying as a Mexican citizen who had entered unlawfully.”

“This arrest was the direct result of Hermosillo’s own actions and statements,” the DHS official said.
A federal judge dismissed the case on April 17, court records show. The DHS official said Hermosillo was then released to his family.
The judge’s dismissal order states that the government moved to dismiss the case. In an email on Monday, a spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Arizona declined to answer Source NM’s questions about the case, and wrote, “The U.S. Attorney’s Office does not have anything to add beyond what is found in the public record.” 
The case against Hermosillo is absent from a news release the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Arizona published three days after his arrest, in which the agency touted “immigration-related criminal charges” it had filed in the previous week.
Requests for comment from ICE and Hermosillo’s attorney were not returned on Monday.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The Kansas Supreme Court reversed a district court by declaring separate husband-and-wife annuities created to settle legal claims after a man was catastrophically injured in an explosion must be considered marital property in a divorce proceeding.
Justices of the Supreme Court, echoing a three-judge panel of the Kansas Court of Appeals, said a Johnson County District Court judge erred by concluding annuities held by accident victim Aaron Meek and his spouse at time of the accident, Nancy Karanja-Meek, weren’t martial property.
Both appellate courts said all property, including confidential cash awards and deferred payments, had to be treated as marital property when a marriage ended.
“We affirm the Court of Appeals and remand to the district court for it to conduct equitable division of the marital estate with both annuities considered marital property,” Justice Caleb Stegall said in the opinion published Friday.
Meek was compensated due to a traumatic brain injury he suffered Feb. 19, 2013, when a Time Warner Cable contractor installing underground fiber optic cable in Kansas City, Missouri, struck a high-pressure natural gas line with a boring drill. Escaping gas migrated to JJ’s Restaurant, which exploded and leveled the building. One person was killed and 15 injured.
Karanja-Meek had brought a claim for loss of companionship after her husband’s accident because “I lost Aaron, the Aaron that was there before he got injured.”
Both resolved their personal-injury claims in 2015 and received lump-sum payments as well as separate annuities with payments until 2045.
In 2017, Karanja-Meek filed for divorce. A question that wasn’t settled through negotiation was division of the annuities. Karanja-Meek said the annuities were awarded individually and shouldn’t be divided by the court, but Meek contended the court should award him “all or the vast majority” of his wife’s annuity because she was “supposed to be my caretaker.”
District Court Judge Christopher Jayaram entered a divorce decree in 2022 and ruled the annuities were separate property. In response, Meek turned to the Court of Appeals because he wanted Karanja-Meek’s annuity — not his own — declared marital property.
The Court of Appeals concluded both annuities were marital property subject to division. Meek appealed to the Supreme Court and claimed the Court of Appeals relied on flawed legal analysis.
Justice Stegall said Karanja-Meek, who had clearly lost before the Court of Appeals, in a “rarely seen turn” suddenly realized the Court of Appeals was correct to view all property as marital.
Stegall, an appointee of Republican Gov. Sam Brownback, said the lower court’s consideration of “mechanical” and “analytical” approaches to property division in divorce cases was “disapproved.”
“We find it simpler to follow the plain text of the statutory scheme without the need for labels,” he said. “If a label is required, one might term it the ‘statutory approach’ — which has the added benefit of preserving the court’s role in Kansas to interpret the law, not write it.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/P1242546-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-21 16:11:22.060978
,DC,2025-04-21 20:08:51+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Advocates urge restart of suspended refugee resettlement program,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/advocates-urge-restart-suspended-refugee-resettlement-program,,"WASHINGTON — State and local leaders and advocates from across the country called on the Trump administration Monday to immediately restart the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, saying the program’s suspension has harmed communities.Trump signed an order suspending the program on his first day back in office and the administration withheld funds appropriated by Congress for those services. Federal courts have partially rejected that order, but the Trump administration has still not resumed the program, the advocates said.By indefinitely halting the program and subsequently defunding its infrastructure, Trump “stranded” more than 100,000 refugees “who had already been interviewed by Homeland Security and received written notices from the U.S. government that they were eligible for resettlement,” Mark Hetfield, president of the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, or HIAS, said at a press conference hosted by several refugee advocacy groups Monday.‘More than a program’Aisha Koroma, a Refugee Congress delegate for Washington, D.C., said the Refugee Admissions Program “is more than a program.” Refugee Congress is a national organization advocating for people who are forcibly displaced. “It represents lives, dreams, resilience, hope — it is a gateway for future change-makers, doctors, engineers, artists, tradespeople — people who are ready and eager to become assets to America’s workforce and to contribute meaningfully to its economy and communities,” Koroma said. “Pausing this program doesn’t just delay paperwork, it delays possibilities, it ensures tragedies, it tears families apart, and it leaves people vulnerable, but most importantly, it sends a painful message that America is closing its doors, not only to those who need it most, but also those who fill jobs, those who open stores and people who sat on our school boards,” Koroma added.Rev. Noel Andersen, national field director at Church World Service and faith leader with the United Church of Christ, said the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program “has signified a space of refuge and hope for the world as a beacon of light for democracy.”“Now, because of the increased discriminatory attacks on all immigrants, including refugees, we’re in a dire place for this program, even as it is clearly represented in our laws written by Congress and with a recent court order to resume the refugee program, yet it has not happened, and now our own democracy is in danger,” he said.Legal challenge ongoingThe International Refugee Assistance Project filed a lawsuit on behalf of HIAS, Church World Service, Lutheran Community Services Northwest and refugees  impacted by the order in February.A federal judge in Washington state granted a nationwide injunction in February requested by the groups who challenged Trump’s executive order suspending the program and the withholding of funds for those services.The faith groups then asked the federal judge for an emergency hearing after the U.S. State Department terminated their contracts despite the earlier injunction. The court ordered in March that the administration offer a status report on their efforts to resume the processing of refugees.The administration quickly appealed the judge’s subsequent order requiring the State Department to restore contracts to nonprofits that help with resettling refugees. An appeals court denied part of the administration’s request to halt the lower court’s earlier preliminary injunction. The federal judge on April 11 granted the groups’ motion to enforce the first preliminary injunction issued. Hetfield said the administration defied the February injunction effectively ordering the administration to restart the program and the federal appeals court upholding the part of that order focused on admitting more than 100,000 conditionally approved refugees.“Yet two months later, the administration has continued to defy the court order, noting in its filings last week that it intends to admit only a fraction of a fraction of conditionally approved refugees, and, in fact, has taken no visible steps yet to even do that,” he said.Trump’s January executive order also instructed officials at the State and Homeland Security departments to submit a report to Trump 90 days from the order — April 20 — “regarding whether resumption of entry of refugees into the United States under the (U.S. Refugee Admissions Program) would be in the interests of the United States.”Trump also instructed the departments to submit further reports every 90 days thereafter until he determines whether resumption of the program “is in the interests of the United States.”Advocates said Monday they have yet to hear whether the administration’s first 90-day report regarding the potential resumption of the program was delivered to the White House.Asked for a comment on the issue, a White House spokesperson acknowledged receiving the inquiry but did not immediately provide a substantive response.",,,,2025-04-21 16:11:22.060978

In a complaint filed last week, the students accused officials from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement of unlawfully terminating their student status, stripping them of their ability to pursue their studies and maintain employment in the United States.
The plaintiffs, who are among more than 100 international students who joined the suit, say they’re now at risk of arrest, detention and deportation.
“This is all part of the Trump administration’s plan to get rid of all immigrants in America, not just undocumented immigrants,” said lawyer Charles Kuck, who is representing them in court. “And nobody should be surprised by that.”
According to court documents, three of the Connecticut students are from India and live in New Haven. A fourth is a Chinese citizen living in Vernon and attending the University of Connecticut. They filed the suit anonymously in a federal court in Georgia, which is set to hear arguments next week on their request for a preliminary injunction.
[CT student’s visas revoked: As details emerge, fears escalate]
The students allege immigration officials unlawfully terminated their records in a government database that tracks compliance with the F-1 visa program, which allows nonimmigrants to stay in the United States while pursuing academic studies.
Terminating the records “effectively ends F-1 student status” and serves to revoke their student visas, the plaintiffs argue. Kuck said the students have received no explanation for the move, and no notice, as required by the program.
In a written statement, U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin pushed back on the lawsuit’s allegations. McLaughlin did not directly address the circumstances of the students in Connecticut, but suggested criminal activity and advocacy for “violence and terrorism” were a focus for enforcement.
“It is a privilege to be granted a visa to live [and] study in the United States of America,” McLaughlin said. “When you break our laws and advocate for violence and terrorism that privilege should be revoked, and you should not be in this country.”
According to the lawsuit, all four Connecticut residents previously faced criminal charges, which were ultimately disposed of or dismissed.
The University of Connecticut student, identified in court as John Doe, was involved in a 2017 domestic dispute where he was arrested and charged along with the other party, according to the complaint. The student was not convicted, and all charges were dismissed the following year, the complaint says. The student planned to graduate from UConn in August 2025. He learned April 9 that his status was terminated.
A student in New Haven said in court he was charged last year with a series of driving offenses, including driving without a license, but those charges were dismissed. The student planned to graduate in May, but received an email from a U.S. Embassy in India informing him his visa was revoked, according to the suit.
Two other New Haven residents completed their studies, but remain in the country on valid visas, which allow students to keep working in their field for a period of time after graduation.
One was arrested for evading the scene of a car crash. The case was disposed in October 2024, and the student graduated the same month, the complaint states. He learned via an April 9 email from his college that his student record was terminated, according to the suit.
The other was notified April 4 by a US embassy in India that his visa had been revoked, according to the suit. He was later informed his student record was terminated due to a criminal record check, according to the suit. The student was previously arrested on domestic violence related charges, which were dismissed April 8 after he completed a diversionary program, according to the suit.
Kuck said uncertainty is adding to his client’s anxiety as they wait for a decision from the court in Georgia.
“Think about yourself, going to a foreign country, trying to get an education there, and then being told that the enforcement authorities want you to leave,” he said. “What would you do?”
At least 50 international students in Connecticut have had their visas revoked, according to officials at UConn and other local colleges. DHS has not disclosed the total number of students affected.
In a statement posted online, UConn said previously that “while the number of impacted students here is small, consequences for those impacted are significant.”
UConn says it is regularly monitoring the database of international students used by DHS. Once UConn notices a change on a student’s status, the university alerts the student or visiting scholar and offers them support services. The university also notifies the student or scholar’s department head and dean.
In February, UConn also established a “rapid response team” to address immigration policy changes that could affect colleges and universities.

(J. Alex Wilson | Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia)West Virginia Supreme Court Justice Beth Walker will retire June 27 after more than eight years on the bench. Walker wrote of her retirement in a letter to Chief Justice William Wooten on Monday. 
“While serving the people of West Virginia has been the greatest honor of my life, I now do my part to usher in a new generation of leadership while spending more time with my family, friends, and pursuing other interests,” Walker wrote. 
Walker was elected to the high court May 10, 2016, the first in a nonpartisan race, and took office Jan. 1, 2017. 
Walker is currently the longest-serving justice on the court. She’s the last remaining justice who was part of the court in 2018, when all four sitting justices faced impeachment charges relating to the misuse of public funds. Walker was charged with maladministration. The state Senate censured Walker at the time but voted not to remove her from office. Former Justice Allen Loughry was ultimately sentenced to two years in federal prison after pleading to 10 federal charges, including wire and mail fraud. 
Walker served as chief justice in 2019 and 2023.
In her letter Monday, Walker wrote that during her tenure, the Supreme Court restored public trust in the judicial branch by “increasing transparency, accountability and impartiality while returning the focus of the judiciary to the rule of law.”
“We have established a cooperative and functioning relationship with both the legislative and executive branches, which I hope endures for years to come,” she said.
Walker was raised in Huron, Ohio, and graduated from Hillsdale College and the Ohio State University, where she earned her law degree. Prior to becoming a judge, she worked for the Bowles Rice law firm, practicing in labor and employment law and mediation. 
In a news release Monday, Wooten called Walker an “outstanding member” and a leader of the Supreme Court. 
“This is in part due to her institutional knowledge, being our longest-serving justice, but the real foundation of her leadership is her judicial temperament and intellect,” Wooten said.
“In some appellate courts in other jurisdictions — and in this court at different times — the internal deliberations have been caustic and acrimonious.That has never happened in our court because Justice Walker has been a force insisting on collegiality and civility among our members. 
“Her leadership in this area has been a real strength of our court,” he said. “While I would like to persuade Beth to remain on the court, I will respect her judgment. Nonetheless, I sincerely regret that Justice Elizabeth Walker will very shortly cease to be a member of the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia.”
Walker’s term was set to expire Dec. 31, 2028. Gov. Patrick Morrisey is expected to appoint someone to fill Walker’s seat until her replacement can be elected during the next judicial election in 2026. 
Prior to the appointment, the state’s Judicial Vacancy Advisory Commission will collect applications, conduct interviews and make recommendations to the governor, a spokesman for the Supreme Court said.

(Matthew Perschall for Louisiana Illuminator)The Louisiana Legislature is considering several proposals that would create tax breaks and new revenue streams for college athletes and their sports programs. 
If passed in their current state, the proposals would exempt college athletes from income taxes on their name, image and likeness (NIL) deals and would create a new fund to give tax dollars to NCAA Division I athletics programs like LSU’s. 
But critics say the Republican-backed proposals are doing something antithetical to their party’s free-market philosophy. They also argue the bills could further widen the divide — cultural and fiscal — between academics and athletics.
The change could also come at the expense of priority services the state provides, such as early childhood education
‘The need is so high’ 
House Bill 639 by Rep. Neil Riser, R-Columbia, would increase the tax on sports gambling from 15% to 32.5%, aligning it with the tax on video poker machine wagers. Increasing the tax rate on sports gambling has support from both conservative and progressive corners, both of whom want to use the revenue to offset the “social ills” of gambling.
But Riser’s bill goes further, altering the revenue split and putting 25% into a fund that would benefit student-athletes at public schools that compete at the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision and Football Championship Subdivision levels. That includes UL Lafayette, UL Monroe, Louisiana Tech, LSU, Grambling, McNeese, Nicholls, Northwestern, Southeastern and Southern. 
The University of New Orleans, which does not have a football program, would be left in the cold. 
“The need is so high,” Riser said in an interview with the Louisiana Illuminator and Tiger Rag. “When you start talking about the SEC, talking about any level of athletics right now, it’s changed so dramatically.” 
“Even like ULM … just to be competitive [in recruiting], it takes facilities, when you’re dealing with [athletes] they require you to have all those things,” Riser said. 
A frequent adage about LSU athletics is that it doesn’t get any state funding, which isn’t strictly true. The department notably received $1 million in cash from the state in 2023 to plan for improving or replacing the Pete Marravich Assembly Center and occasionally receives small-dollar amounts for various state-funded projects. 
But Riser’s fund could change that. The state currently brings in approximately $54 million annually in sports gambling revenue. If his bill passes, the state’s take would increase to approximately $116 million, with about $30 million dedicated to college athletics. 
That’s a huge amount of money in the context of college athletics in Louisiana. Only LSU has a budget larger than that, with most other FBS and FCS schools in Louisiana bringing in only half or a third as much. 
Even with heavy subsidies to small programs like Nicholls and Grambling, you can expect LSU to line up to receive its share of the revenue. 
Presently, the state’s split for sports gambling tax revenue calls for 25% to go toward early childhood education, 10% to local governments and the rest goes to gambling addiction programs and other projects. 
Under Riser’s bill, after college athletic departments get their 25%, an additional 3% goes to the Louisiana Postsecondary Inclusive Education Fund, which finances programs for students with disabilities, and the rest goes into the state general fund that can be used for a variety of government needs. 
Taking money away from early childhood education and gambling addiction programs is certain to ensure a fight over Riser’s bill. 
“Legalized mobile gambling has created or exacerbated many social and cultural problems, including addiction, bankruptcies, and even increases in domestic violence,” said Peter Robins-Brown, executive director of the progressive organization Louisiana Progress. “New tax revenue should be used first and foremost to address some of those problems before we talk about spending more money on college sports.” 
And dedicating state money to college athletics might be a hard sell at a time when lawmakers are digging into couch cushions to find the change necessary to prevent a K-12 teacher pay cut.

NIL tax breaks
Two pending bills would exempt athletes’ NIL compensation from state income tax. 
The most notable proposal is House Bill 166 by Rep. Dixon McMakin, R-Baton Rouge, which would exempt the entirety of athletes’ NIL income from the state taxes. McMakin, an LSU alum whose father played baseball for the Tigers in the 1970s, said he proposed the legislation because LSU is competing for athletes against states like Texas that don’t have a state income tax. 
McMakin said the measure is appropriate in light of the economic impact athletes have on the state. LSU athletics generated $500 million for the state in the 2021-22 academic year, according to a university study. 
But what might be considered the academic parallel to paid student-athletes — graduate assistants — would still be subject to state income tax. 
Several graduate students interviewed raised objections to this double standard, which Jan Moller, executive director of Invest in Louisiana, said is a valid concern. His organization advocates for policies that benefit lower- and middle-class citizens. 
LSU covers tuition for graduate assistants and pays them a stipend for the work they do, such as teaching freshman classes and conducting research. Unlike student-athletes, grad assistants have to pay for their own housing, meals and health care on their meager stipends – expenses that are all paid for college athletes on full scholarships. 
“They are subsidizing entertainment over academics at the expense of academics,” said biology graduate student Cullen Hodges. 
“It’s not the government’s role to subsidize millionaire college athletes when we can’t provide basic services to our citizens,” Moller said. 
McMakin said if graduate assistants wanted to present evidence of their economic impact, he’ll “happily” add them to his bill. In 2022, LSU research, much of it done or assisted by graduate students, had a $1.3 billion economic impact. 
The proposal is bad tax policy, Moller said. 
“It’s conservatives who will always say that we shouldn’t pick winners and losers with our tax policy,” Moller said. “What is this if not picking winners and losers?” 
A second proposal, House Bill 168 by Rep. Rashid Young, D-Homer, would exempt the first $12,500 of athletes’ NIL income from state taxes. That aligns the exemption with the standardized deduction offered to every other Louisiana resident. It’s not clear if this legislation is necessary for the athletes to receive the deduction, but Young said he wanted to make sure they get it. 
Young, a former Grambling football player, said he also supports McMakin’s bill. 
“Top athletes are leaving the state of Louisiana because they’re getting better deals in other states that … don’t have any income tax,” Young said in an interview. “We need to start trying to get in the game.” 
Young’s bill also creates an income tax deduction for taxpayers who enter into NIL deals with college athletes. It was designed to encourage small businesses to get in the name, image and likeness game, he said 
Young has also proposed a resolution that would create a task force to study the need for increased transparency on NIL and related issues. LSU Athletic Director Scott Woodward, and other Division I athletic directors in Louisiana, would be members of the task force, as well as student-athletes, state legislators and three representatives of the private sector. 
Other athletics proposals
Sen. Jeremy Stine, R-Lake Charles, wants to “Make American Athletics Great Again.” His proposed Senate Bill 200 would prohibit athletic departments in Louisiana from giving more than 25% of their scholarships and financial assistance to international athletes. 
About 23% of LSU’s scholarship athletes are international students, according to data LSU athletics spokesman Zach Greenwell provided. 
Just three schools — McNeese, ULM and UNO — are above the proposed 25% rate. Stine’s bill does not address what would happen to these athletes. He did not respond to an interview request for this report. 
House Concurrent Resolution 13 by Rep. John Illg, R-River Ridge, calls on the Southeastern Conference to schedule LSU home games in September after 6 p.m. to account for the intense heat. Illg’s resolution only mentions LSU, ignoring the other football programs in Louisiana that also compete in the heat.

While off-year elections typically draw less attention than those on even-numbered years, the upcoming primaries will determine which candidates advance in a host of local and statewide races that will be held in November.
Pennsylvania has a closed, partisan primary system. That means only voters registered as Democrats or Republicans, respectively, will have a chance to cast a ballot for which of their party’s candidates will advance to the general election in November.

What’s on the ballot
Which elections are being held this year will vary across different parts of the state. Many municipalities will hold elections for city and county commissioners, school board members, township supervisors, Court of Common Pleas judges and other elected positions. 
In some cities, like Pittsburgh, Lancaster and Harrisburg, voters will be able to cast a ballot in their Mayoral primary.
Some counties will also have judicial elections for their Court of Common Pleas, the state’s lower courts.
Residents in counties like Allegheny, Montgomery and Philadelphia will be able to decide on several “ballot questions” in May. Voters do not have to be registered with any particular political party to cast these votes.
There are also statewide races. 
On May 20, voters in their respective parties’ primaries will choose who to nominate for seats on the Commonwealth and Superior Court. These are the appellate courts in Pennsylvania’s judicial system — the ones that rule on appeals and decisions from the lower courts, but sit beneath the state Supreme Court. Justices serve 10-year terms.
Three Democratic state Supreme Court justices are also up for retention elections this year, but not until November. Then, voters will be able to decide whether those justices should keep their seats on the bench.
Voters can check what will be on their ballots by contacting their local election offices, listed here. 
How to register and who can vote
Eligible voters can register to vote at vote.pa.gov. Registered voters can also check where they are registered and with what party.
Primary voters must be 18 years-old and residents of the district they wish to vote in for at least 30 days ahead of the primary. Voters must also be U.S. citizens for at least a month before the election.
Pennsylvanians can also register at their county’s registration offices, and some other locations like Women, Infants and Children (WIC) program offices, armed forces recruitment centers and some PennDot offices when obtaining a new driver’s license or state ID.
Because primaries are closed and partisan, voters must also be registered to the party they wish to cast ballots for in these elections. Non-partisan ballots will be available for voters not registered to any party in locations with ballot questions or other non-partisan elections.
Prospective voters with questions should contact their county’s election offices.
How to vote
Registered voters who wish to cast their ballot in person on May 20 can find their polling place at this website. Voters casting a ballot for the first time in their district will need to show a valid ID.
Voters may also register for absentee or mail ballots, which every voter is eligible for. In order to vote in the May 20 primary, however, voters must have their completed absentee ballot registration received by their county election office by 5 p.m. on May 13. 
To apply for an absentee ballot, voters must provide a valid driver’s license or PennDOT ID. If they don’t have those, they must provide the last four digits of their social security number and a signature, which can be uploaded online. 
Applications for mail ballots can be submitted online at this website.
All mail ballots must be returned by 8 p.m. on May 20.

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)On Sunday, U.S. House Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota’s 6th Congressional District repeatedly dodged straightforward questions about whether the U.S. president has the legal power to “deport” U.S. citizens, or whether he would be supportive of such a move.
The question has arisen recently, as President Donald Trump suggested his administration could “deport” U.S. citizens. 
“The homegrowns are next,” Trump said last week during a meeting with El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele. 
CNN’s Dana Bash asked Emmer, who is also the House GOP whip, about the issue during his appearance the network’s State of the Union talk show.
“Do you think the federal government has any legal authority to [deport] American citizens?” 
Emmer declined to answer the question, instead offering a lengthy response about the administration’s ongoing enforcement actions against non-citizens.
Bash tried several times to steer Emmer back to the question of U.S. citizens. “What about the idea that the White House says it is looking into, whether or not U.S. citizens who are convicted of violent crimes can be imprisoned in El Salvador?” she asked. Emmer once again dodged and attempted to steer the discussion back toward the treatment of non-citizens.
Bash gave it one more try: “I just want to give you one more chance to say whether or not you’re okay with U.S. citizens — the idea of it. I know it’s not happening. But he has actively said more than once that they are looking into it. Would you be okay with that?”
Emmer, for a third time, refused to answer.
To be perfectly clear: The Constitution does not grant the president the power to “deport” U.S. citizens or imprison them in foreign countries.
“It is pretty obviously illegal and unconstitutional,” said Ilya Somin, a professor at George Mason University’s Antonin Scalia Law School.
“It’s obviously unconstitutional, obviously illegal,” said David Bier of the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank based in D.C.
“The U.S. government cannot deport a U.S. citizen for any reason,” said U.C. Davis law professor Gabriel Chin.
The episode represents a remarkable about-face on civil liberties for Emmer, a man who used to commemorate Constitution Day on social media, and who once took to the floor of the U.S. House to read the portions of the 6th Amendment that protect the rights of the criminally accused. 
Not long ago, Emmer publicly argued that efforts to protect Americans’ safety needed to be balanced against Constitutional safeguards of individual liberties. “We must protect this country, but cannot do so by circumventing the Constitution,” he said in a July 2016 explanation for why he voted against renewing the Patriot Act.

Last fall, Iowa joined 19 other states and representatives of the nursing home industry in suing the Biden administration to block the implementation of new staffing requirements for taxpayer-funded nursing homes.
The new standards would eventually require homes to conduct assessments of their residents’ needs, provide 3.48 hours of direct nursing care per resident, per day, and require then to have a registered nurse available 24 hours per day, seven days a week.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa, seeks to overturn those requirements, which were approved last year by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
In their court petition, the 20 states and more than a dozen industry associations argue that the staffing requirements pose “an existential threat to the nursing home industry as many nursing homes that are already struggling will have no choice but to go out of business. And the main victims will be the patients who will have nowhere else to go.”

Nursing home staffing lawsuit
Other plaintiffs in the Iowa-led lawsuit over nursing home staffing include: Nebraska, Kansas, South Carolina, Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Missouri, Montana, Oklahoma, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, Virginia, and West Virginia.
Co-plaintiffs include the LeadingAge lobbying and professional associations in Iowa, Nebraska, South Dakota, Kansas, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Missouri, New Jersey, Ohio, Colorado, Delaware, Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Michigan.

Texas judge says CMS lacks authority
The Iowa lawsuit is nearly identical to a suit filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas where, on April 7, District Court Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk vacated the new requirements.
Kacsmaryk ruled that while the goals of the new rules were “laudable,” they were not consistent with congressionally approved statutes.
“CMS lacks authority to issue a regulation that replaces Congress’s preferred minimum hours with its own. That is exactly what the 24/7 requirement does,” Kacsmaryk stated in his ruling. “Congress took it upon itself to set the minimum hours nursing homes ‘must use the services of a registered professional nurse.’ It set that level at ‘at least eight consecutive hours a day.’ The 24/7 requirement in effect amends the statute because it strikes Congress’s ‘eight,’ and replaces it with the agency’s ’24.'”
The ruling was not unexpected. When the Texas case was filed, consumer groups noted that Kacsmaryk, who was the only judge to whom it could be assigned, had previously presided in multiple health care cases in which he had ruled against government regulators.
In the Iowa case, which remains active, a judge in January denied the states’ motion for a preliminary injunction to block implementation of the rule. Three weeks ago, CMS filed a brief in the states’ appeal of that decision — signaling that CMS, at least to a certain extent, still backs the new rule, despite the change in administration that took place in January when Donald Trump took office as president.
On the same day CMS filed its brief with the appeals court, the State of Iowa and its co-plaintiffs filed a brief in the underlying case, arguing that even if CMS had been granted the statutory authority to enact such rules, Congress’ delegation of that authority was unconstitutional. “If that authority justifies the rule, there is no limit on what CMS can do,” the plaintiffs argued. “The rule imposes billions of dollars in costs, overrides state laws, and effectively rewrites other provisions of the Medicaid and Medicare statutes.”
Congress poised to block rule 
Some consumer advocates believe CMS, now headed by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is angling for congressional action to block the new rules, so that government savings from repealing them can be used to partially offset a proposed $880 billion cut in the Medicaid budget.

Given that, as well as the potential for an Iowa court ruling that might conflict with that of Kacsmaryk’s decision, industry officials and GOP lawmakers are pushing for CMS to administratively repeal the rule or for Congress to simply block it.
U.S. Rep. Michelle Fischbach, a Minnesota Republican, told industry lobbyists recently that she believed the staffing mandates threatened rural nursing homes, adding that despite the Texas court ruling she would be pursuing “legislation because we need to make sure this rule is overturned.”
Fischbach first introduced the Protecting Rural Seniors Access to Care Act in 2023, shortly after a preliminary version of the rule was proposed by CMS. U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra of Iowa was a co-sponsor of the bill.
Fischbach reintroduced the bill in February of this year. In the Senate, James Lankford, an Oklahoma Republican, and Deb Fischer, a Nebraska Republican, have introduced a similar version of the bill.
Iowa homes cited for lack of staff 
Last year, the Iowa Capital Dispatch reported that Iowa nursing homes had compiled the sixth-worst record in the nation for staffing-level violations. Data from CMS showed that 14% of the state’s 422 nursing facilities were cited for insufficient staffing in fiscal year 2023. That was more than double the national average, which was 5.9%.
Only five other states — Hawaii, Michigan, Montana, New Mexico and Oregon — had a worse record of compliance with the sufficient-staffing requirement.
Des Moines’ Fleur Heights care facility compiled Iowa’s worst record of compliance.  Over a nine-month period between May 2023 and February 2024, Fleur Heights was cited, but never fined, five times for insufficient staff — more than any other facility in the state.
Federal data suggest many care facilities already meet the new standards, but industry officials allege nursing homes will need to hire an additional 27,000 full-time registered nurses and 78,000 full-time certified nurse aides, at a cost of more than $7 billion, to meet the requirements.
A report from the Long-Term Care Community Coalition earlier this year showed that 6 in 10 of all U.S. nursing homes would have met the new nurse-staffing standard of 3.48 hours in the fourth quarter of 2023.
The fact that a majority of facilities already meet the new minimum standard while still facing quality-of-care issues has been a concern for many advocates who say the new standards don’t go far enough. They point to a federal study that shows each resident needs at least 4.1 hours of nursing care each day – a standard met by only 26% of all nursing homes nationally.
A University of Pennsylvania study recently concluded that the new staffing mandates, if left in place, would save roughly 13,000 lives per year. In Iowa alone, the researchers said, the mandates would save 101 to 250 lives per year.

Ron DeSantis's social media)Two recent top agency appointments by Gov. Ron DeSantis, both of whom have been grilled by legislators over a charity linked to First Lady Casey DeSantis’ Hope Florida initiative, appear unlikely to win confirmation this session from the Florida Senate.
Sen. Don Gaetz, chair of the committee responsible for screening appointees, told the Florida Phoenix in a phone interview Monday that of the more than 200 gubernatorial appointees for the Senate to consider this session, roughly 150 are still awaiting action.
He said the committee lacks time to consider the appointment of Shevaun Harris as head of the Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA) or Taylor Hatch as secretary of the Department of Children and Families (DCF).
Under Florida law, if the full Senate fails to take action on a confirmation the governor must reappoint them to that post within 30 days. The Senate would then consider the appointment during its next session. Appointees who fail to win confirmation a second time must leave their positions.

“I know this: That because we won’t be able to get to her, her term of office will end and he’ll [DeSantis] have to reappoint her,” Gaetz said of Harris’ future as AHCA secretary.
When asked whether he would vote to confirm Harris at AHCA, the largest of the state’s health care agencies, Gaetz said: “I’d have a hard time voting for Secretary Harris unless she came clean and had a very different story than what she’s telling the House.”
Gaetz also told the Florida Phoenix that he has “serious questions for both of them. They both know it.”
 The process
Gaetz, himself a former Senate president, and committee vice chair Mack Bernard, a Democrat from West Palm Beach, issued a memo outlining how the Senate confirmation process would proceed under Senate President Ben Albritton for the next two years.
The memo explains that every gubernatorial appointee will be considered by their substantive committee as well as the Ethics and Elections Committee.
“A favorable vote of the Ethics and Elections Committee will be required in order for a nominee to be recommended for confirmation by the full Senate,” the memo says. “However, the President always has the prerogative to move any nomination to the full Senate.”
The committee didn’t begin considering gubernatorial appointments until its March 31 meeting, having spent its previously scheduled hearings discussing substantive legislation instead.
“Tuesday comes before Wednesday. Nominees come to us as they come to us,” Gaetz said, noting that he doesn’t get to “pick and choose” the names on the agenda.
Katherine Betta, a spokesperson for the Senate President Ben Albritton, said the governor’s office is aware of the situation.
“The President’s goal is to have a more thorough process for confirmations by broadening the opportunities for Senators to engage in the confirmation process. There is insufficient time remaining this session to move forward with confirmation proceedings for Secretary Harris and Secretary Hatch. The President has great respect for their dedicated and longstanding service to the state, specifically to the vulnerable populations they have both served and continue to serve over their respective careers in state government. The confirmation process provides the opportunity for reappoint and certainly if that occurs, there would be time more time this fall during interim committee weeks and next session for consideration.”
 Backstory
DeSantis put Harris in charge of AHCA in February after he tapped Jason Weida, who had been secretary of that agency, as his chief of staff. Before that, Harris had run DCF, the agency that created the nonprofit Hope Florida Foundation to help Ms. DeSantis’ Hope Florida. DeSantis then appointed Hatch, who had been director of the Agency for Persons with Disabilities (APD) to serve as head of DCF.
The Hope Florida Foundation, a direct support organization, has been at the center of a growing controversy surrounding a $10 million “one time donation” health care giant Centene made to it. The money was part of a $67 million settlement the managed care plan signed with the state over Medicaid overpayments.
The foundation than gave $5 million grants to Secure Florida’s Future, a nonprofit tied to the Florida Chamber of Commerce, and Save our Society, another political committee. Within days, those groups made contributions to Keep Florida Clean, which opposed last year’s marijuana-legalization initiative. James Uthmeier, the governor’s former chief of staff, now Florida attorney general, controlled Keep Florida Clean.
House Health Care Budget Subcommittee chair Alex Andrade told members of the Hope Florida Foundation during their board meeting last week that the contributions could jeopardize the foundation’s 501(c)(3) status and that the foundation should try to recoup the funds.
The Senate Committee on Children and Families voted up on Hatch on March 25, but she still needs the ethics committee’s nod.
The Senate Health Policy Committee approved Harris’ nomination as AHCA Secretary in April 1. At that same meeting, the committee approved DeSantis’s choices as heads of the boards of Chiropractic Medicine, Medicine, Optometry, and Physical Therapy Practice.
Likewise, the ethics committee will consider a spate of higher education appointees (some of whom are controversial) Tuesday that were considered by the Senate Appropriations Committee on Higher Education on April 15 and April 10, well after Harris and Hatch were initially considered by their substantive Senate committees.

Whalen has to buy materials overseas, often from China, and he said the tariffs could force him to triple his price on some workstations to $12,000.
Tariffs are the main tool President Donald Trump is wielding to try to boost manufacturing in the United States, calling the achievement of that goal “an economic and national security priority.” But the higher levies have led to retaliation and suspended shipments, and Whalen said they are just one of several Trump administration actions squeezing his small manufacturing business.
The wave of federal spending cuts, which has affected grants to state and local governments, could make his customers put off purchases. And the administration has moved to cut off funding for a $175 million state-based program that provides expert advice to smaller factories like his.
The Delaware version of that program, the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, helped Sumuri fit expanded product lines into the limited space in its small-town factory.
“We were really having a tough time trying to figure out how to utilize our space efficiently,” Whalen said. “They came here and helped us organize and optimize, and it made a huge difference.”
On April 1, the Trump administration cut off funding for 10 such manufacturing programs that were up for renewal in Delaware, Hawaii, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota and Wyoming. Other state MEP programs will expire over the next year.

Iowa program loses federal funds
The Iowa program that was cut was the Center for Industrial Research and Service at Iowa State University, which partners with other organizations and communities to provide customized services to help businesses grow, according to its website.

The administration gave a reprieve to those 10 states until the end of the fiscal year after objections from Democrats in the U.S. House and Senate. The National Institute of Standards and Technology, which manages the program, extended funding for the 10 states “after further review and consideration” and will “continue to evaluate plans for the program,” said agency spokesperson Chad Boutin.
The program has come under fire from Republicans since the George W. Bush administration first tried to end it in 2009, and again during the first Trump administration, but Congress has continued to fund it. The conservative Heritage Foundation said in a 2023 book that MEP’s functions “would be more properly carried out by the private sector.”
‘Dots don’t quite connect’
Buckley Brinkman, executive director of the Wisconsin Center for Manufacturing and Productivity, which works with his state’s MEP program, said it didn’t make much sense for the administration to shutter the program as it seeks to boost the number of U.S. manufacturing jobs.
“It’s one of those things where the dots don’t quite connect,” Brinkman said. “I mean, jeez, here’s a part of government that doesn’t cost a whole lot, in the grand scheme of things — less than $200 million a year — that’s returning 10-to-1 to the national treasury, working on a priority for the president.”
A 2024 Upjohn report found an even higher return: 17-to-1 on $175 million in the 2023 fiscal year, creating $3 billion in new federal tax revenue.
In Wisconsin, which has lost more than 138,000 manufacturing jobs since 2000, some parts makers report that business is booming as manufacturers seek to avoid tariffs by finding U.S. alternatives to Chinese manufacturers, Brinkman said. But more broadly, he doubts that the tariffs will spark a manufacturing boom in the state.
“Do we want all this manufacturing back? Do we have the will to get it back? The answer to both those questions is ‘no,’” Brinkman said. “Even without the tariffs we don’t really want Americans doing a lot of those jobs that are in Chinese factories right now.”










I mean, jeez, here’s a part of government that doesn't cost a whole lot, in the grand scheme of things … that's returning 10-to-1 to the national treasury.


– Buckley Brinkman, director of Wisconsin Center for Manufacturing and Productivity


In Delaware, the MEP helped Sumuri manage its expansion, but unpredictable tariffs and budgets are now a bigger danger, said Jason Roslewicz, Sumuri’s vice president of business development. He’s had to devote two employees to monitoring supply lines, tariff news and competitor pricing to stay afloat.
“We went from putting things together in a basement to a 19,000-square-foot facility, doing exactly what we’re supposed to do here in the U.S., and it’s all in danger of coming apart because of this problem,” Roslewicz said.
Other small manufacturers express similar concerns. TJ Semanchin, who owns Wonderstate Coffee in Madison, Wisconsin, said his business roasting and distributing coffee is in crisis because of the tariffs.
Wonderstate’s costs have almost doubled between tariffs on imported coffee and packaging materials from China, plus a cyclical rise in coffee prices. “I’m borrowing money to pay for this and at some point we’ll have to raise prices. We’ll have no choice,” Semanchin said.

But many Republican state officials, and even some Democrats, have backed Trump’s tariff push, including Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who credited the Trump administration with “reshoring manufacturing and restoring this middle class which has been eviscerated over the last 20 years.”
“There’s dislocation in the short term, there’s long-term opportunity,” Youngkin said in an April 15 interview on CNBC. He said his state is hearing more interest from manufacturers looking to build or expand local factories since Trump took office. For instance, Delta Star recently announced a plan to add 300 jobs building power transformers in Lynchburg.
“The president has been clear that there will be some level of tariffs, and folks are coming, and that’s good for Virginia,” Youngkin said in the CNBC interview.
Virginia’s MEP program, called Genedge, claims successes in streamlining production and quality control for local factory products including TreeDiaper, an automated tree watering device made in Ashland, and for advising EDM, a Lynchburg plastic product assembler that needed more efficient production to keep overseas competition at bay. But Virginia’s MEP is one of the state programs slated to expire in the next year.
Long-term trend
The slide in U.S. manufacturing jobs has continued on and off since 1979, and many experts say tariffs will not bring them back. Despite a modest bounce back under the Biden administration, the number of manufacturing jobs has declined from nearly 20 million in 1979 to less than 13 million today, even as the total U.S. workforce has grown from 89 million to 159 million during that period.
Manufacturing faces labor shortages, with many factories operating below capacity because they can’t find enough workers, according to Jason Miller, a professor of supply chain management at Michigan State University.
That doesn’t bode well for a mass reshoring of factories from China and other countries, but Miller doesn’t expect that to happen anyway.
“Firms are not planning on reshoring much of the work that was offshored 20 to 25 years ago,” Miller said. “I’m not concerned about having enough workers for manufacturing jobs that would be reshored because this isn’t going to happen.”
In a 2024 survey by the libertarian Cato Institute, 80% of Americans said America would be better off if more people worked in manufacturing, but only 25% said they personally would be better off working in a factory. The Chinese government has poked fun at the idea with memes of American workers struggling to make Nike sneakers with sewing machines.
Joseph McCartin, a labor historian at Georgetown University, said the idea of a manufacturing rebirth is a “mirage being conjured to attract the support of workers who have been underpaid in an increasingly unequal economy for the last 40 years, and are desperate for some hope of renewed upward mobility.”
Manufacturing “isn’t the magic wand to make that happen,” McCartin said.
“What we need is to raise workers’ wages and make the economy less prone to producing inequality,” McCartin said. “That mission is not at all what Trump is about. He is dealing in stale nostalgia.”

Bill Ramos, D-Issaquah, speaking on the floor on April 16, 2025. (Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)Washington state Sen. Bill Ramos died suddenly Saturday while on a trail run near his home in Issaquah. He was 69.
Colleagues remembered Ramos, a Democrat representing Washington’s 5th Legislative District, as a kind and dedicated public servant. 
“He never let even the most serious matters get too serious,” said Senate Majority Leader Jamie Pedersen, D-Seattle. “He made you like him the moment you met him.”
“Bill’s passing is a devastating loss for our caucus and for our state,” Pedersen added.
Ramos, a member of the Latino Democratic Caucus, served in the U.S. Forest Service, Federal Transit Administration and on the Issaquah City Council before joining the Legislature. He was also the longtime leader of Dance All Night in the Cascade foothills, where he taught ballroom, salsa and swing dancing.
His wife, Sarah Perry, is a King County Council member. She called Ramos her “dance partner in life.”
“Bill was a mentor and friend to all who asked, quick with a smile and reassuring word, and always willing to drop whatever he was doing to be of service,” Perry said in a statement. 
She said he often would run through Issaquah’s many trails to “relieve stress during a busy legislative session” and “reconnect to the forests and hills he loved that shaped his career.”
Elected to the state House in 2018, he quickly became one of the Legislature’s leading voices on transportation issues. In the House, he helped author a nearly $17 billion transportation funding package. And in the Senate, to which he was elected in November, he was one of the lead negotiators over the state’s next two-year transportation budget.
Ramos grew up in East Oakland, California. He received his degree in forest sciences from Humboldt State University in California. With the Forest Service, he worked in Washington state, in North Bend and Enumclaw, serving in leadership roles focused on timber and ecosystem management as well as recreation, according to a biography on his legislative website.
From 2005 to 2013, Ramos worked in the Federal Transit Administration as a community planner focused on the Tribal Transit Program. He was also the tribal liaison to the Pacific Northwest’s Indigenous communities.
And directly before joining the Legislature, he was an Issaquah City Council member from 2016 to 2019. In the House, Ramos served as the chair of the State Government and Tribal Relations Committee.
House Speaker Laurie Jinkins, D-Tacoma, said Ramos worked on legislation “to ensure more effective, accountable, and equitable government for all people in Washington.”
“He was also a tireless champion for improving our transportation system, making our communities safer, and protecting Washington’s natural resources and outdoor spaces,” Jinkins continued.
Tributes poured in for Ramos over the weekend, including from members of Congress and Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson. 
Ferguson remembered last seeing Ramos and Perry a week ago at an event.
“It was a typical conversation with them — big hugs, wide smiles, and lots of laughter,” the governor said. “I will so miss him.”
The Senate began its floor action Monday morning with a moment of silence in honor of Ramos. His desk was covered with flowers.
He is survived by Perry and two adult children, Max and Maya, among others. His wife said she will share more details on services later.
The King County Council has 30 days to appoint Ramos’ replacement from a list of candidates from the local Democratic Party.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_1403-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-21 16:11:22.060978

(Getty Images)Looking ahead to Utah’s hot and dry summer months, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox issued an executive order on Monday to encourage wildfire preparedness across the state. 
The order, according to Cox’s office, is meant to “improve coordination among state, local, and federal partners ahead of the 2025 fire season.”
“I’m incredibly proud of Utah’s firefighters and first responders,” the governor said in a prepared statement. “Their courage and dedication set the standard — and this executive order builds on their work by improving coordination and focusing our efforts where they’re needed most. This is about making sure we’re ready before the next fire season begins.”
The executive order establishes a new working group focused on wildfire management, made up of leaders from state agencies including the Department of Natural Resources, the Division of Forestry, Fire and State Lands, the Department of Public Safety, and the Division of Emergency Management.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXCox tasked the group with identifying the highest-risk areas, improving coordination across jurisdictions, and submitting a report that includes recommendations for the governor. He set a deadline of June 1. 
“When it comes to wildfires, the unexpected has become the new normal,” said Jamie Barnes, state forester and director of the Division of Forestry, Fire and State Lands.”Improving the effectiveness and efficiency of our planning efforts can help reduce risks to watersheds and landscapes across the state – and strengthen our overall wildfire preparedness.”
In his order, the governor also included a call to Utahns to prepare their own families and households for wildfire danger. He recommended:

Have an emergency supply kit, make a plan, and be informed
Review the Utah Fire Sense and Be Ready Utah preparedness campaigns 
Sign up to receive local emergency alerts by visiting your county and city websites
Review and understand your insurance coverage
Know evacuation routes
Don’t forget to include pets and other animals in emergency planning
Gather and protect important documents 
Create a defensible space around your property
Ensure fire hydrants are accessible during all times of the year 
Maintain, update and test smoke detectors and fire suppression systems. 

“In addition to the immediate dangers wildfires pose, Utah also faces serious post-fire risks — including flooding and debris flows — that can devastate communities long after the flames are out,” Cox’s office said in Monday’s news release. “The order acknowledges these threats and calls for a comprehensive, forward-looking approach to mitigation and preparedness.”
The governor’s office also said the executive order “builds on the success” of the Utah Fire Sense Campaign, “which helped reduce human-caused wildfires by nearly 75% from 2020 to 2023.”
“It also reflects the administration’s deep appreciation for the bravery and commitment of Utah’s state, local, and federal firefighters — whose efforts help protect both lives and natural resources across the state,” the office said. 
The executive order took immediate effect when it was signed Monday. It’s set to expire on June 1.

(Spencer Platt/Getty Images)As Republicans in Congress consider cutting the federal share of Medicaid funding, states are weighing numerous options to scale back their programs. But voters in three states have significantly limited those options by enshrining Medicaid expansion in their constitutions — creating a potential budget disaster and a political challenge for the GOP.
Over the past several years, voters in conservative Missouri, Oklahoma and South Dakota have amended their state constitutions to require their Medicaid programs to cover all adults below the age of 65 who earn equal to or less than 138% of the federal poverty level ($21,597 for an individual in 2025). Those states are among the 40 plus the District of Columbia that expanded Medicaid eligibility under the 2010 Affordable Care Act, with the federal government picking up 90% of the cost.
But much of that federal funding could soon vanish. Republicans in Congress are debating several options to achieve $880 billion in Medicaid cuts. One proposal would slash the 90% rate to the lower match rates states get for the traditional Medicaid population, mainly children and their caregivers, people with disabilities and pregnant women. Those percentages range from 50% for the wealthiest states to 77% for the poorest ones.
If Congress goes that route, states would have to come up with $626 billion over the next decade to keep the roughly 20 million people in the expansion population on the rolls.
Nine states (Arizona, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Utah and Virginia) already have laws on the books that would automatically roll back Medicaid expansion if the federal funds dip. Some states are considering requiring people to work, go to school or volunteer in order to receive Medicaid benefits, a condition that would trim the rolls and save money.
But because Missouri, Oklahoma and South Dakota have put Medicaid expansion in their constitutions, they can’t easily take those steps.
Republicans in Congress are eyeing cuts to Medicaid. But what does Medicaid actually do?

“Legislators cannot change that law without going back to voters for a whole other campaign to change the constitution,” said Kelly Hall, the executive director of the Fairness Project, a nonprofit that helped put the constitutional amendments on the ballot in all three states.
“Even if the federal government cuts their contribution towards funding Medicaid expansion, those three states do not have the option to reduce eligibility or benefits for the Medicaid expansion population,” she told Stateline. “They will have to find those resources.”
Medicaid is a huge component of state budgets. Including the federal matching money, states spend an average of nearly a third of their budgets on Medicaid. And the program is also the single largest source of federal funds for states.
Missourians voted in favor of a constitutional amendment to expand Medicaid in August 2020. When state lawmakers refused to fund the expansion, residents sued the state’s Department of Social Services. In 2021, the state Supreme Court ruled that the legislature had to find the resources for Medicaid expansion — a huge win for progressives.
For 2025, Missouri allotted $18.2 billion for Medicaid, with the federal government covering $12.7 billion of that, or about 70%. If Congress cuts the federal share of Medicaid funding by $880 billion over the next decade, it would leave Missouri with a budget hole of around $1.7 billion next year, according to research from nonprofit group the Commonwealth Fund. That would force the state to come up with some options to avoid fiscal disaster.
Timothy McBride, a health policy analyst and co-director of a program at the Institute for Public Health at Washington University in St. Louis, told Stateline that these include raising taxes, cutting enrollment for other Medicaid populations, diminishing reimbursements to providers, getting rid of optional medical services such as dental care or ceasing payments for equipment like wheelchairs.
A fifth of Americans are on Medicaid. Some of them have no idea.

Raising taxes is not a likely or popular choice in Republican-leaning Missouri, McBride noted, while adding that cuts to providers would further endanger struggling hospitals.
“We lost 10 hospitals in Missouri in the last few years. And if you start cutting their payment rates, that’s going to just put them at risk,” McBride said. “The real money is in the disabled and the elderly populations. And so if you really wanted to quote-unquote save money, that’s probably where you’d have to look. But that’s really controversial.”
The state budgetary implications of a potentially sharp decline in federal Medicaid funding have influenced some prominent opponents of Medicaid expansion to have a change of heart. U.S. Republican Sen. Josh Hawley supported efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act in 2018 when he was Missouri’s attorney general. Now, Hawley has said he would refuse to vote for any Medicaid cuts.
“I’m not going to vote for Medicaid cuts, benefit cuts. Work requirements are fine. But 21% of the residents in my state receive Medicaid or [the Children’s Health Insurance Program]. That’s a lot of people,” he told reporters on Capitol Hill in February.
Republicans in the closely divided U.S. Congress might have trouble pushing through Medicaid cuts if other conservative lawmakers from Missouri, Oklahoma and South Dakota follow Hawley’s lead.
Oklahoma voters expanded Medicaid via a constitutional amendment in 2020. South Dakota followed suit in 2022. Republicans in all three states want to impose work requirements on able-bodied Medicaid recipients, but doing so would not save enough money to make up for the loss of federal dollars.
South Dakota Republican state Rep. Will Mortenson said he respects that voters chose to expand Medicaid, and added that the state has “faithfully” implemented it. But the decision to amend the state constitution “can only be described as a foolish decision,” he said in an interview.












Now, as we're staring down the barrel of the federal government contemplating changes to Medicaid … our state is hamstrung.


– South Dakota Republican state Rep. Will Mortenson




“A constitution is not meant to be a flexible document that you change annually or even every other year,” Mortenson said. “And so now, as we’re staring down the barrel of the federal government contemplating changes to Medicaid, including for the expansion population, our state is hamstrung in that we cannot effectively respond to those changes.”
Mortenson was one of the lead sponsors of a bill adopted by the Legislature that will ask voters to consider a ballot measure in the next general election to amend the constitution again, this time conditioning Medicaid expansion on the level of federal assistance.
But some of the supporters of the original constitutional amendment say they will fight any attempt to change it. Any restrictions, including work requirements, would severely harm working-class people, said Doug Sombke, head of the South Dakota Farmers Union. Sombke told Stateline that most farmers in the state struggle to make ends meet and certainly cannot offer high wages or health care benefits to their workers.
“There’s just no extra income,” Sombke said. “And, in South Dakota, we’re a right-to-work state, so you can get fired for any reason. As a worker, you really don’t have a lot of choice.”
Hall, of the Fairness Project, said amending the constitution is the most effective way to expand Medicaid in states where conservative-leaning lawmakers have been reluctant to do so. She said she suspects that voters in other states might pursue the constitutional amendment strategy if their state lawmakers try to roll back expansion.
“I do think that it’s possible that if we see these cuts move forward in D.C., and states are making highly unpopular choices to cut benefits for people, that we will see this issue back at the ballot box,” Hall said. “But for right now, I would say we’re seeing the power of constitutional amendments to protect benefits in action in real time.”

How that might harm special education,Carolyn Jones,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/k-12-education/2025/04/special-education-2/,Special education is shifting to a different federal agency.

Special education is shifting to a different federal agency. Advocates fear the loss of expertise will harm students.


President Donald Trump has promised to keep special education intact, even as he dismantles the federal department that has overseen it for nearly a half century. But some experts and parents in California fear Trump’s policies will imperil the program on multiple fronts, and undoing decades of progress for disabled students.
“Students in special education are equally as important as students who aren’t, but that hasn’t always been the case. The disability community has fought hard for where we are now,” said Gina Gandolfi, a former special education teacher in San Bernardino County whose 10-year-old son has Down syndrome. “What if those services are taken away? Kids with disabilities will go back to being second-class students.”
Last month, Trump said he’s moving special education from the Department of Education, which he’s described as wasteful and inefficient, to the Department of Health and Human Services, under the direction of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Enforcement of special education laws would likely move to the Justice Department. Although the laws surrounding special education wouldn’t change, there’s likely to be disruptions as the program moves to a new department, especially one not focused on education and that’s undergoing a 20% reduction in its workforce.

Advice to California schools on Trump’s DEI crackdown: Do nothing — yet 

by Carolyn Jones 





More than 40 disability rights groups sent a strongly worded letter to Congress in early April imploring members to preserve special education funding, keep the program in the Department of Education and leave the department intact. The authors said the plan to move special education to Health and Human Services is “short-sighted, insulting and unacceptable.”
Trump has not announced cuts to special education funding, and Congress left its funding intact in the most recently passed budget. But at the same time, Trump has threatened to cut school funding to states — including California — that defy his orders to eliminate diversity programs or scrap protections for transgender students. The federal government currently covers about 10% of California’s total cost for special education.
Beyond school funding, Republicans in Congress are debating cuts to Medicaid, which would have a deep impact on services for students with disabilities and their families. School districts use Medicaid to help pay for speech and occupational therapy and mental health services for students with disabilities. In addition, parents with disabled children rely on California’s regional centers — funded in part by Medicaid — for diagnoses, in-home visits, equipment like wheelchairs and walkers and other services.
Impacts on special education services
Cuts to any of those programs would have a cascading effect that would upend the disability community, said Kristin Wright, former director of special education for California and currently the executive director of prevention, intervention and inclusive practices at the Sacramento County Office of Education.
For example, if families lose services from a Medicaid-funded agency such as a regional center, they may have to quit working to care for their disabled child. That could potentially catapult a family into poverty. 
“It’s a fragile ecosystem,” Wright said. “These programs have evolved together. When you pull any one strand away, it affects everything else.”
Wright fears that the changes would set special education back decades. Until the 1970s, when the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act passed, many children with disabilities didn’t attend school at all. And for many years, they were often in separate classrooms, segregated from their classmates without disabilities. Now, in California, most students with disabilities spend the majority of their time in general education classes, with the assistance of aides and other supports, where they tend to do better academically and socially.
“We’ve come so far, moving away from pathologizing people and using a medical model of disability toward a social model, where disability is seen as a natural part of the human condition,” Wright said. “This feels like we’re backpedaling. As a society, we’re going to have to decide what we care about, and how committed we are to educating every student.”

About 14% of K-12 students in California are enrolled in special education, with disabilities ranging from mild learning disorders to severe autism or traumatic brain injuries.
Typically, students receive extra services from therapists, aides and special education teachers, which can be costly. California spent about $13 billion on special education last year, with about 10% coming from the federal government. That doesn’t include money that schools get from Medicaid. If Medicaid is cut, schools would have to find the money elsewhere.
Effects on schools
Ginese Quann is a special education director for the El Dorado County Office of Education and oversees the Special Education Local Plan Area, a cost-sharing consortium for 464 California charter schools. Quann said she’s not overly worried about the federal changes — yet.
Special education funding has always been in flux, she said, and the state has its own systems for monitoring and enforcing the program. Even if the federal government cuts its enforcement of special education laws, she said, parents will still be able to file complaints with the state.
She’s less sure about the transition to the Department of Health and Human Services. Even in a best-case scenario, there’s likely to be some disruptions in payments or services, she said. In a worst-case scenario, the program will be overseen by people with little expertise in how to educate students with disabilities.
The best she can do, Quann said, is to “try and cushion schools from changes at the federal level, so ideally there’s no impact on students. I see this as our biggest challenge right now.”

But even minor disruptions could be damaging for schools that rely on a smooth-running special education system. One of those schools is the Hanna Academy, a small nonprofit boarding school in Sonoma County that contracts with school districts to serve students with acute behavioral challenges. Federal changes to special education could have lasting effects on students, and jeopardize students’ and staff safety, said principal Courtney Jackson.
The academy, which opened in 1945, serves about 50 students from around California. The students receive extensive therapy, vocational training and academic and life-skills classes, delivered in small groups with numerous teachers and aides who can intervene when students have meltdowns or violent outbursts. 
Budget cuts will likely mean fewer adults in classrooms, which could endanger students as well as staff. It also means students won’t get the individual attention they need and their progress will almost certainly drop off, Jackson said. 
“We’re dealing with the most delicate population in education. When you start removing services in a careless manner, without a backup plan, it just causes chaos,” Jackson said. “The damage will be so deep, it could take years to fix and be far more expensive.”
Future of special education law
Special education has traditionally had bipartisan support, with champions in both parties. The Trump administration has promised to leave special education unscathed, but that would require continued funding, said Rorie Fitzpatrick, vice president for K-12 systems at the nonprofit research and consulting firm WestEd.
“The biggest concern is the future of IDEA,” Fitzpatrick said, referring to the 1975 legislation that created special education. “Students with disabilities have a right to a free, appropriate public education under the law. But you need well-trained staff and funding to make that happen. If you cut that funding, you’re gutting IDEA by default.” 
Gandolfi, whose son has Down syndrome, said special education has made a world of difference for her son, Nathan, a fourth grader in Redlands Unified. He loves his friends in his general education classroom, and gets extra services like speech and occupational therapy, one-to-one classroom support and academic help through special education. Through the local regional center, he attends classes in swimming, drumming and social skills, as well as camps. He loves hip hop dance, movies, singing and his two younger siblings.
“He’s living his best life. He’s full of joy. He looks forward to school every day,” Gandolfi said. “We want him to have a long, purposeful, meaningful life, and having the support of special ed makes that possible.”

Wiley Nickel spoke at a packed “empty chair” town hall for Sen. Thom Tillis in March. (Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)Democratic former U.S. Rep. Wiley Nickel has raised $2.4 million this year in his quest to oust Republican U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis in the 2026 election.
Last week marked the Federal Election Commission’s most recent quarterly filing deadline for the period between Jan. 1 and March 31 — the first complete period following the 2024 election in November.
Nickel’s haul was a notable increase over last quarter, when he raised less than $3,000. After spending nearly $2 million this year, he has about $520,000 left on hand.
Nickel, who declined to run for a second U.S. House term due to gerrymandering heavily favoring a GOP victory in his district, formally launched his campaign against Tillis earlier this month. He’s the first Democrat to officially declare his candidacy for the seat.
The numbers are still dwarfed by Tillis, who has the incumbent’s advantage a year and a half out from the election.
He reported raising more than $5.6 million during the filing period and spending nearly $2.5 million, leaving him with just over $4 million in the bank.
North Carolina’s 2026 Senate race is anticipated to be one of the nation’s most competitive and expensive. As he seeks his third term, Tillis is the only Republican senator up for reelection in a 2024 swing state.
It’s a must-win for Democrats, who would need to retain all of their incumbents and win four additional seats to become the majority party.
As a more moderate member of his party, Tillis has come under fire for breaking from MAGA guidelines. As such, he risks a primary challenger from a Trump-endorsed candidate.
He’s possibly found one in Don Brown, a lawyer from Charlotte who has provided aid to clients participating in the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol, and who embraces a an aggressively pro-MAGA agenda, according to his campaign website.
Brown raised $21,600 in the first quarter. That’s not an insignificant amount for a largely unknown first-time candidate whose team filed paperwork to enter the race in February — halfway through the filing period. These contributions came from 18 individuals who donated between $250 and $3,500 each.
Having spent just under $2,000 during the period, Brown has about $20,500 remaining on hand.
Andy Nilsson, a retired businessman and former candidate for lieutenant governor, declared his candidacy for the Republican nomination at the start of the year. Nilsson did not file a campaign finance report for the quarter.
On the Democratic side, the party is eyeing former Gov. Roy Cooper for a run. Cooper, who left the executive mansion in January, has yet to announce his intentions.
Aside from North Carolina, it looks like Democrats’ most viable pick-up opportunities in 2026 could be Maine, where GOP Sen. Susan Collins is running for her sixth term, and a special election in Ohio to replace Vice President JD Vance.
In addition to already holding the majority in the chamber, the map is more favorable for Republicans. The party could seize seats in the battleground states of Georgia and Michigan, where Sen. Gary Peters’ retirement leads to an open seat.
Democratic Sens. Tina Smith of Minnesota and Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire have also announced their retirements. This means the party will need to recruit candidates to hold on to those seats.
Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado could also depart the Senate next year if he is successful in his run for governor. His seat isn’t up until 2028, though, and he does not need to resign to run.
If he wins, Bennet will likely be able to appoint his successor to the Senate seat for Colorado.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wiley-Nickel-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-21 15:10:21.282825

David Rowe wants to make it easier for sportsmen to register to vote,John Cole,,,,,https://penncapital-star.com/government-politics/general-assembly/state-rep-david-rowe-wants-to-make-it-easier-for-sportsmen-to-register-to-vote/,His proposal would make voter registration applications available when someone applies for a hunting or fishing license.,"A hunter walks across a field. (Getty Images)State Rep. David Rowe (R-Union) represents a lot of sportsmen in the rural 85th state House District, which includes parts of Union, Juniata, and Mifflin counties and all of Snyder County. He wants to see them more engaged with the electoral process and is planning on introducing legislation that aims to make it easier for them to register to vote.
The Sportsmen Voter Registration Act, which Rowe is dubbing the proposal, would ensure the availability of voter registration applications any time someone of voting age applies for a hunting or fishing license in Pennsylvania.
“Pennsylvania’s hunters and anglers are some of the most engaged citizens in our state, but too often their busy seasons in the field and on the water make it harder for them to register to vote,” Rowe wrote in a press release announcing the proposal. “This legislation ensures Pennsylvania sportsmen have greater access to voter registration, so they can have a voice in the policies that impact our land, wildlife, and way of life.”
Rowe said there is a “remarkably high number of sportsmen” who are not registered to vote in Pennsylvania. Vote4America, a group that supports President Donald Trump and aims to encourage hunters to vote, estimated that 30% of sportsmen in Pennsylvania are not registered to vote, which was more than other swing states in the previous election.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“It really sparked an idea for me that we needed to make it easier for sportsmen to be able to be part of the democratic process,” Rowe told the Capital-Star.
Rowe said the objective would be to “simply streamline the process” for sportsmen to make registering to vote more accessible.
“The bill will not complicate the process of getting a license. The bill will not add another step to the hunting license process,” Rowe said. “Rather, it will simply make it more accessible. So, for sportsmen that are going to a state office, there will be paper registration forms available for them to simply grab.”
He also said there would be an additional link that would provide the option to register to vote for those online who are sportsmen updating their licenses.
In Sept. 2023, Gov. Josh Shapiro announced eligible Pennsylvanians would be automatically registered to vote when they renew their driver’s licenses or ID cards at PennDOT driver and photo license centers, calling it a “commonsense step to ensure election security and save Pennsylvanians time and tax dollars.” This has been referred to as the “motor-voter” system in the state.
“You look at the hobbies of sportsmen and fishermen, hunters, whether it has to do with hunting license fees or wildlife management or trespassing laws, the state has a lot of jurisdiction over those fees and hobbies that these sportsmen enjoy,” Rowe said. “So, we should absolutely be encouraging these sportsmen to be part of the process that elects the officials that make the decisions that impact their way of life.”
Lauren Cristella is the President and CEO of Committee of Seventy, a government reform group.
“We’re all for anything that makes it easier for Pennsylvanians to register to vote, especially when things at the national level are trying to complicate that and limit access,” Cristella said.
Cristella says she believes that the “motor voter” law in Pennsylvania has been successful and thinks it’s great to make it easier for those acquiring hunting and fishing licenses to register to vote.
“I would love to see it when people interact with any government agency,” Cristella said. She referenced Medicare and barbers acquiring licenses through the state as a few examples where the state could encourage more people to register to vote.
While Cristella supports this effort, she ultimately believes that automatic voter registration should be passed and implemented.
“So that we don’t have to rely on individual, piecemeal efforts like this,” she said.

Are other states doing this? 
The goal of increasing voter registration for sportsmen and women is not new in the United States, according to the Congressional Sportsmen’s Foundation (CSF). The organization, which is dedicated to “protecting and enhancing the rights of hunters, anglers, recreational shooters, and trappers across the nation,” said the issue of voter registration was introduced at an annual meeting in 2004 by a Georgia legislator.
CSF describes “sportsmen/voter” efforts as being based on the “Motor/Voter” concept and noted that some states allow hunting or fishing licenses to be used as proof of eligibility to vote.
The organization encourages legislators and elected officials to explore and support similar efforts. It reports that sportsmen’s caucuses in Florida and Virginia have passed similar legislation regarding the matter, while at least eight other states have made attempts to, as well. CSF also references Georgia, New York, and New Jersey as states that have “successfully passed and enacted voter registration legislation.”
 
What’s next for this proposal?
Rowe said he’s talked to several of his colleagues on the GOP side of the House that are “very excited” about the idea and added he’s had conversations with “one or two” of his Democratic colleagues who are also “interested in the idea.”
“I think that we can all agree that our republic does better…the more people that are involved with the process, the better,” Rowe told the Capital-Star.
Democrats hold a one-seat majority in the state House and would ultimately determine which committee the proposal would be assigned to, Rowe said, but thinks it would either go through the Game & Fisheries Committee or the State Government Committee.
He would like to formally introduce the legislation in the near future.
“Nobody in the General Assembly should be opposed to registering more Pennsylvanians to vote, and so I would love to see this be a consensus issue,” Rowe said, adding that he hopes it could be part of the negotiation process this budget cycle.
“We could maybe see this bill be part of a compromise solution that allows us to get something bipartisan done right out of a Republican Senate, a very closely divided Democrat House, and Democrat governor,” Rowe added.
He didn’t want to engage in any hypothetical scenarios, but Rowe, acknowledging compromise is common in the legislative process, said “potentially some other demographics that we are trying to engage to be part of the electoral process,” could be a part of the conversation surrounding this proposal.
Cristella told the Capital-Star that she’s aware of numerous conversations happening right now with the Pennsylvania General Assembly revolving around a variety of election reforms, which include voter ID, open primaries, and mail-in ballot pre-canvassing. She thinks that there’s a “decent chance” that a compromise voter ID bill will garner enough support to pass.
“And then the exact combo of what other things might be given in exchange for that is up for debate,” Cristella said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/hunter-field-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-21 15:10:21.282825

Gretchen Whitmer gave her support for cell phone restrictions in Michigan schools, with state Rep. Mark Tisdel (R-Rochester Hills) reintroducing his plan to keep school children off their phones and focused on lessons that same day. 
However, members of the Senate Education Committee on Tuesday will hear testimony on a different proposal crafted by its chair, state Sen. Dayna Polehanki (D-Livonia). 
Slated for introduction on Monday, Polehanki told the Michigan Advance her plan was crafted alongside the governor’s office and has support from the Michigan Department of Education. 
While Tisdel’s plan would place different restrictions on students based on their grade level, Polehanki’s proposal would require a district’s school board or a charter school’s board of directors to develop their own wireless communications device policy to limit cell phone use during school hours and cut down on distractions. 



Tisdel’s plan would: 

Prohibit students in Kindergarten through grade 5 from possessing a wireless communication device on school grounds
Block students in grades six through eight from using a wireless communication device on school grounds during instructional time, breaks between instruction, lunch and recess. 
Bar students in grades nine through 12 from using a wireless communication device during instruction time.

The school board and board of directors can also implement additional restrictions. 



“It’s important to me that our bill is not too prescriptive. I do believe that school districts should have control over exactly what their cell phone policies say. School districts know what’s best for themselves,” said Polehanki, who taught high school for almost 20 years. 
Polehanki’s proposal also includes exceptions for emergency situations, medical devices and devices included in a student’s individualized education plan, and permits a school’s principal to create further exceptions.
“I am personally not comfortable with any legislation that would put an outright ban on a cell phone in the era of the school shootings,” Polehanki said. 
“I just don’t believe in an outright ban, but some schools may choose to do that. But the beauty of this bill is it’s up to them,” she said.
Heading into the 2024-2025 school year, an increasing number of states began implementing or weighing cell phone bans, with the U.S. Surgeon General issuing two advisories on social media use and youth mental health. 
Independent Health Policy Organization KFF reports as of March 5, 2025, nine states had banned or restricted cell phone use in schools, while 16 others, including Michigan, were considering restrictions. 
The Columbia University Department of Psychiatry notes studies have found a link between heavy social media use and depression, anxiety, loneliness, and suicidal ideation.
While cell phone use in classrooms can be a problem, cell phone policies do work, Polehanki said. However these policies need to be understood and enforced, she said, and having district-level policy can help that.

(Madeline Carter/Missouri Independent)Former Missouri Congressman Billy Long received $137,000 in campaign contributions — just enough to pay off a personal loan to his campaign — soon after he was tapped to lead the Internal Revenue Service.
Some of the donations are connected to companies that will be policed by the agency Long has been nominated to run.
According to recently filed financial disclosures, which were first reported on by the investigative journalism site The Lever, Long only raised roughly $36,000 in the last two years.
He was named as President Donald Trump’s pick to lead the IRS in December, and in January received $137,000 in donations. He then paid back the remaining $130,000 in debt from a $250,000 loan he made to his unsuccessful 2022 U.S. Senate campaign.
The donations, and their timing, have renewed criticism of Long’s appointment, which still awaits Senate confirmation. Senate Democrats have already called for a criminal investigation of firms with ties to Long that they allege are involved in fraudulent tax credit schemes.
Among the donors to Long’s campaign are financial advisers from some of those firms.
“When they told Billy he’d be in charge of revenue collection, did they forget to tell him that meant for the American people, not his own bank account?” said Sean Nicholson, a longtime progressive activist and campaign consultant in Missouri.
Jordan Libowitz, vice president of communications for the liberal watchdog Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said the timing of the donations and the “explicit knowledge that they’d end up directly in Long’s bank account, it’s hard to see them as anything other than an attempt to curry favor with the future head of the IRS.”
Long did not respond to a request for comment.
After a career as an auctioneer and conservative radio host, Long served six terms representing a Southwest Missouri congressional district. He gave up his seat to run for U.S. Senate in 2022, losing in the GOP primary to now-Sen. Eric Schmitt.
Long then worked for Lifetime Advisors and earned at least $5,000 in income from White River Energy. Both companies have drawn scorn from Senate Democrats, and intense media scrutiny, over their involvement in controversial tax credit programs.
In 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a limit on the amount of post-election funds a candidate can use to pay back personal loans. The majority found the limit an unconstitutional restriction on the freedom of speech, while the dissenting justices argued removing it would pave the way for political corruption.
“Even if our broken campaign finance system allows this behavior,” Libowitz said, “it raises serious questions about future conflicts of interest and needs to be addressed in any hearings (Billy Long) has before Congress.”

After several weeks of conducting business at a steady, manageable pace, the North Carolina General Assembly suddenly shifted into high gear. This past week, legislative committees rapidly considered and okayed scores of brand new, never before-heard bills on an array of topics, while at the same time Senate Republicans were unveiling and advancing their proposed version of a new two-year state budget.
So, what is the average lawmaker to do at such a time – especially if you’re not a member of the majority party? For Wake County state Senator Lisa Grafstein, the path has been obvious – read each proposed new law as quickly and thoroughly as possible and do your best ask questions, offer amendments and speak up on behalf of average North Carolinians whose interests are so often ignored.

Pete's doing a great job. Everybody's happy with him.”The New York Times published an article Sunday detailing a second group chat on the encrypted, commercial messaging app Signal, where Hegseth shared information about U.S. military plans.Hegseth, asked during the White House Easter Egg roll on Monday about the latest New York Times report, didn’t deny that he sent messages in another group chat.“What a big surprise that a few leakers get fired and suddenly a bunch of hit pieces come out from the same media that peddled the Russia hoax, won't give back their Pulitzers, they got Pulitzers for a bunch of lies,” Hegseth said. “As they peddle those lies no one ever calls them on it. See, this is what the media does. They take anonymous sources from disgruntled former employees and then they try to slash and burn people and ruin their reputations.""The New York Times report was the second time in less than a month that Hegseth’s discussion of military operations on the app came to light.Someone on a chat meant to comprise only high-level administration officials accidentally included Jeffrey Goldberg, editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, who published an article in late March on the experience.That group chat included Vice President J.D. Vance, Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, National Security Advisor Michael Waltz and others. In that chat, Hegseth shared a precise timeline of U.S. bombing of Houthi targets in Yemen.The Defense Department’s Office of the Inspector General opened an investigation earlier this month “to determine the extent to which the Secretary of Defense and other DoD personnel complied with DoD policies and procedures for the use of a commercial messaging application for official business.

One month later the policy became law. (Courtesy of Maine Women's Lobby)The state’s paid family and medical leave program will be center stage later this week as both Republicans and Democrats look to modify the new employee benefit. 
The Legislature’s Labor Committee will hold a public hearing Wednesday afternoon for 13 bills to change the program that has yet to take effect for workers but has prompted some pushback among the business community, which has started making payments into the benefit system. The majority of the proposals seek to repeal or scale back the program, but others are looking to clarify the existing law or make it more accessible for employees. 
A bill from Rep. Tiffany Roberts (D-South Berwick) is the only one with bipartisan support. LD 1712 hopes to strike a better balance between employee and employer interests by modifying how much an employer is required to contribute, when an employee needs to apply for the benefit and how much is paid out. 
Though it isn’t expected to be available until May 2026, the paid family and medical leave program will allow eligible public and private sector workers to take up to 12 weeks of paid leave for reasons such as illness, to care for a loved one or the birth of a new child. 
Proponents have described it as a panacea and a way to make certain jobs more accessible, while opponents argued that certain requirements are too burdensome on employers. 
The Maine Department of Labor finalized the program’s rules in December after an outpouring of input from employees and the business community. At the start of the year, Maine employers began withholding a portion of wages to pay into the new paid family and medical leave fund. 
Senate President Mattie Daughtry (D-Cumberland) and Rep. Kristen Cloutier (D-Lewiston), co-sponsors of the original legislation establishing the program, are introducing LD 894 on behalf of the department that would make a series of amendments to the current law to create certain enforcement mechanisms and penalties, as well as clarify intermittent leave. 
Daughtry said she plans to testify in “strong and unequivocal” opposition to the bills that want to delay, weaken, exempt or dismantle the program. Rather than waiting to see how Maine’s paid family and medical leave system operates and then making adjustments based on experience, Daughtry said the bills represent a “reversal of course before the program has had a chance to begin.”
“Maine workers deserve a strong benefits program and I’ll be fighting to protect it,” she said. 
There are two nearly identical proposals to repeal the program entirely. In addition, House Minority Leader Billy Bob Faulkingham (R-Winter Harbor) has two bills to make the benefit voluntary for employers and employees (LD 1273) and delay its start until 2027 (LD 1249). All four pieces of legislation have emergency preambles, which means they would take effect immediately if passed by two-thirds of the Legislature. 
Another emergency proposal from Sen. Russell Black (R-Franklin)would exempt agricultural workers (LD 952). And though not an emergency measure, LD 1400 seeks to exempt certain public school districts and their employees from the benefit program. 
Rep. Mike Soboleski (R-Philips) has a bill (LD 1169) that would allow employers to get a refund for any premiums paid into the state’s plan if they are approved to use a private substitute plan. Sen. Dick Bradstreet (R-Kennebec) is similarly looking to better accommodate employers wishing to use a substitute private plan with LD 1307.
Rep. Gary Drinkwater (R-Milford) is proposing an amendment to the state constitution with LD 1221 to prohibit the Legislature from using paid family and medical leave program funds for any other purpose. 
Labor Committee co-chairs Sen. Mike Tipping (D-Penobscot) and Rep. Amy Roeder (D-Bangor) are introducing LD 575 to remove a provision in the current law that requires leave to be scheduled. While that is meant to prevent undue hardship on an employer, the bill title says its removal would create more equitable access to the program. 
Rep. Jennifer Poirier (R-Skowhegan) is proposing a series of changes with LD 1333 that would seek to clarify the definition of “self-employed individual” and prevent employers from having to bargain with unions over the employee’s share of the program, among other tweaks.

Overdoses in Montana are seeing another spike, and most appear to involve fentanyl, according to the state Department of Public Health and Human Services.
Health officials are reminding Montanans that help is available for recovery and treatment.
In March, Montana saw 95 reports of suspected opioid overdoses, compared to an average of 69 a month in 2024, according to the Department of Public Health and Human Services.
The last time the state saw that number of overdoses in a single month was August 2023, DPHHS said in the news release last week.
“This current overdose spike serves as a startling reminder of the deadly consequences that fentanyl and opioid overdoses have for our communities,” DPHHS Director Charlie Brereton said in a statement.
The agency said data from March 1 to April 15 this year include seven fatal and 132 nonfatal overdoses, and April is on track to have higher-than-average suspected opioid overdoses.
Reviews of case reports indicate most overdoses involved fentanyl, but confirmation through laboratory testing is not always available, DPHHS said. However, it said reviews also show other drug use, including methamphetamine and cocaine.
The health department has focused on increasing access to recovery and treatment programs, it said in the news release. The help includes $400,000 for “Wellness Kiosks” to be installed “throughout the state” and dispense fentanyl testing strips and naloxone.
Health Department spokesperson Jon Ebelt did not respond to questions about which communities would receive the kiosks or the timeline for implementation.
An earlier news release from the Governor’s Office in August 2024 said Montana would install 24 kiosks strategically placed at community-based programs such as drop-in centers.
The Governor’s Office said the initiative aims to combat “an alarming rise” in fentanyl and opioid overdoses.
It said prior to 2020, the state averaged about eight overdose deaths per year, but in 2023, it saw 123 fatal opioid overdoses in Montana, the highest since DPHHS started tracking in 2009.
A recommendation from the Behavioral Health System for Future Generations Commission said pilot programs showed promising results in other states including Nevada and Ohio.
A research study published in the Annals of Medicine in 2022 said the Covid-19 pandemic worsened the “overdose crisis” but naloxone dispensers in Clark County, Nevada, helped.
It said forecasts projected 270 opioid-involved overdose fatalities in the 12 months right after dispensers were made available. But it said just 229 occurred, “suggesting an aversion of 41 deaths.”
“Communities should consider implementing public health vending machines in efforts to prevent opioid-involved overdose fatalities,” said part of the study.
In Montana, money for the kiosks is part of the $300 million the Behavioral Health System for Future Generations Commission is directing to improve behavioral health and developmental disabilities services in the state.
The Health Department said cases in the most recent spike do not appear to be concentrated in any particular county or region, but most are occurring on major transportation routes.
The counties with 10 or more suspected overdoses include Cascade, Flathead, Missoula, Silver Bow and Yellowstone, the news release said.
“DPHHS wants to remind the public that when someone is experiencing an overdose, the timely administration of the emergency medication naloxone may successfully reverse their symptoms and save their life,” said Dr. Maggie Cook-Shimanek of the agency in a statement.



 Suspected overdose

Naloxone reversal may only be temporary, so emergency response should always be activated in instances of suspected opioid overdose, DPHHS said. It directed people here for more information.
Signs of an overdose include:

Loss of consciousness or falling asleep
Small, constricted “pinpoint pupils”
Slow, shallow breathing
Choking or gurgling sounds
Limp body
Pale, blue, or cold skin
Slow to no heartbeat

“If you suspect someone is experiencing an opioid overdose, call 9-1-1 immediately and administer naloxone if it is available,” Dr. Cook-Shimanek said.
DPHHS officials advise that, if you use opioids, make sure a trusted friend or family member is aware, ensure they know how to administer naloxone, and that you have naloxone on hand in the event there is an overdose.

LOUISVILLE — In advance of a hearing Monday afternoon over Jonah Bevin’s effort to intervene in the divorce case of his adoptive parents, former Gov. Matt Bevin and his ex-wife Glenna, a flurry of motions offers sharply different claims about Jonah’s care.
The recent filings even raise questions about Jonah’s age — whether he is 18, as he had believed, or just 17 — because of a conflict in records that recently came to light.
Matt Bevin, in filing Friday, said Jonah’s claims of neglect, abandonment and abuse “are not grounded in fact or law and are, instead, intended to garner media attention and outrage.”
“The truth is entirely different and it is heartbreaking to Matt to see his son caught up in this web,” it said, adding that “Jonah is deeply loved by his entire family” and cites Matt Bevin’s “unshakable love and commitment for his son.”

Glenna Bevin, in a separate filing, said she is “very sad” about the contentious legal proceedings, adding “she loves her son Jonah and wants only the best for him.”
Both Matt and Glenna Bevin are subject to protective orders barring them from contact with Jonah, who sought the orders last month in Jefferson Family Court, alleging they attempted to send him on a hastily arranged trip to Ethiopia, supposedly to meet  his birth mother, whom he believed was deceased.
Dawn J. Post, a child advocate and lawyer representing Jonah, said she has not been able to find any evidence Jonah’s birth mother is alive.
Jonah, in a filing Monday, restates his allegations he was abandoned by the Bevins in Jamaica after child welfare authorities closed the Atlantis Youth Academy for abuse and neglect, removing residents and leaving him for a time in the custody of the Jamaican child welfare system.
“Where is the love my parents said they had for me because they didn’t show it when they left and ignored me. Other parents came to get their kids,” he said in an affidavit. “My parents either lied or left out the truth over and over. Because of that I’ve been on my own. I’ve been trying to speak up because nobody else has done it for me.”
Jefferson Family Court Judge Angela Johnson has scheduled a hearing Monday afternoon to decide whether to permit Jonah to intervene in the Bevins’ divorce case in order to prevent them from reaching a confidential settlement. The Courier Journal also is objecting to keeping such a settlement private, saying court records generally are open to the public.
Meanwhile, Jonah has reported to the court his exact age is in dispute; recently obtained records show he may be only 17 instead of 18, as he previously believed.
“I feel that I am not real,” Jonah said in his affidavit. “No one knows my real age.”
A motion filed Friday by his lawyers says Jonah, who was one of four children adopted by the Bevins in 2012 from Ethiopia, said records the Bevins recently provided show conflicting birth dates.
One of the records the Bevins provided shows Jonah’s birth date as November 2006, which Jonah had thought was his true birth date, and the other, November 2007, the motion said.
If Jonah is just 17, and still a minor, that could affect his pending case, said one of Jonah’s lawyers, John Helmers Jr.
Prior to the recent filings, court records have said the Bevins’ five biological children are adults and that only one of the four adopted children is a minor.
It makes Jonah’s case for intervening in the Bevins’ divorce stronger since the court has a greater responsibility toward minor children, Helmers said in an email.
Matt Bevin’s motion objecting to Jonah intervening in the divorce case dismissed the issue, saying that it was “undisputed” the teen turned 18 in November 2024 and therefore is “emancipated.”
He and Glenna Bevin both ask, in separate motions, that Jonah’s request to intervene as a party in their divorce case be denied.
Jonah, in his affidavit, disagrees, saying his alleged abuse, neglect and abandonment deserve consideration.
“The court can’t just let this go on like it didn’t happen,” it said. “I’m not just a name on paper. I’m a real person. What happened to me was real. Leaving me out of this case says it didn’t happen.”

Carlos Trujillo couldn’t sleep despite it being well past midnight.
As both an immigrant and an immigration lawyer, Trujillo has been acutely tuned into the volatile nature of the Trump administration’s immigration policies. That night, in the early hours of April 11, as has often been the case lately, Trujillo’s mind drifted to worries about how the changes will impact his clients and what he can do to assist them.
Those thoughts weren’t helped by an email that arrived in his inbox at 1 a.m. The opening line got straight to the point.
“It is time for you to leave the United States,” reads the email from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS). It ends with a promise: “The federal government will find you.”
Trujillo initially assumed the email was for one of his clients. Then he realized the only name on the email was his own.
“I was in a little bit of a shock,” said Trujillo, who became a citizen over a decade ago. “I was like, why is this happening?”

Trujillo is one of several U.S. citizens on the receiving end of what appears to have been a mass email campaign. The emails stated that the recipients’ parole had been terminated. But Trujillo has never had immigration parole, which allows immigrants to temporarily remain and, in some cases, work in the country. It is separate from the kind of parole used in a criminal justice context.
Immigration lawyers in Massachusetts, Ohio, Arizona, Michigan and Pennsylvania, as well as a doctor in Connecticut — all of whom are also citizens — reported receiving the same email as Trujillo.
Customs and Border Patrol said in a statement that it used the “known email addresses” of immigrants to send the notices, which it acknowledged could have included immigration attorneys’ emails.
“If a non-personal email — such as an American citizen contact — was provided by the alien, notices may have been sent to unintended recipients,” the statement reads. “CBP is monitoring communications and will address any issues on a case-by-case basis.”
 A broader strategy 

To Trujillo, the motivation behind the emails is clear.
“This is part of a new practice, and the practice is to instill fear in the Latino or the minority communities,” Trujillo said. “Why am I a part of the email? Was it a mistake? Was it that I am born and raised in Venezuela? I don’t know. It could be, because I know there have been mistaken communications by DHS, but because I don’t know — that unknown makes you worry.”
Maria Montes with Comunidades Unidas said the administration’s constantly changing policies have made it difficult for the nonprofit and other organizations to effectively respond within their communities.
“The federal administration has organized a strategy to create chaos, confusion and fear all in the hopes that immigrants will choose to self deport,” Montes said.
Trujillo has been an outspoken advocate for Utah’s immigrant community. He said he refuses to accept that his advocacy was linked to the email, although it did cross his mind. 
“To think that there could be consequences for that in a country like the United States, I just can’t believe it,” he said. “It probably was a mistake, and I love this country so much that I think my first inclination is just to believe that and leave it at that. But if it is something else. Well, here I am. I know who I am and what I stand for. And I understand what this country stands for and I am staying put.”
The emails are part of a broader immigration strategy aimed at revoking visas, asylum, parole and temporary protected status for hundreds of thousands of immigrants. A specialized immigration task force within the Department of Government Efficiency is providing the technical infrastructure to make that strategy a reality, according to reporting by Politico.
Like other DOGE mass email campaigns, the emails Trujillo and others received incited panic and confusion, especially since immigration notices have historically been sent through U.S. mail and online government portals. Before DHS publicly acknowledged the emails many online wrote them off as a scam.
The switch to email is a recent one, Trujillo said. But his case and that of other citizens who mistakenly received the email call into question the reliability of using email.
Trujillo’s email — which he shared with The Utah Investigative Journalism Project — lists the sender as “automatedmessage@cbp.dhs.gov.” Because the message came from an unrecognized address, it triggered an anti-phishing warning from his Outlook email service.
CBP did not respond to questions about how it is ensuring the notices get to the correct recipients and how many emails it accidentally sent to citizens. Instead, the agency said in a statement that it had issued notices terminating parole for individuals who do not have lawful status to remain in the country.
The statement clarified that those notices were not limited to just individuals who had used CBP One and that the notices do not currently apply to Ukrainian and Afghan immigrants with parole.
“To be clear: If you are an alien, being in the United States is a privilege — not a right,” the statement reads. “We are acting in the best interest of the country and enforcing the law accordingly.”

 ‘It’s heartbreaking’

Trujillo has written off the email as a mistake. But many aren’t so lucky.
Jesus — who The Utah Investigative Journalism Project is referring to by only his first name because he fears speaking out may impact his immigration case — received a letter late last month that terminated his parole and authorization to work in the U.S. Unlike Trujillo, Jesus is not a citizen.
“It literally destroyed me,” Jesus said in Spanish, “Because I’ve tried to do things legally in the U.S.”
The letter, which was shared with The Utah Investigative Journalism Project, directed Jesus, a BYU computer science student, to leave the U.S. by April 24 or face “adverse immigration consequences.”
Jesus applied for asylum in the U.S. after fleeing political persecution in Venezuela. He entered the country legally in November 2023 through the humanitarian parole program. The Trump administration recently ended the program, which had benefited 532,000 people from Venezuela, Haiti, Cuba and Nicaragua. That decision is currently being challenged in court.
“The phones blew up here,” Trujillo said, adding that over 50 of his clients have gotten letters telling them to leave the country. They range from newly arrived immigrants to individuals who have been in the U.S. for close to a decade.
“It’s heartbreaking,” he said. “You know, these people came the right way, applied the right way, lawfully and orderly, and they’re leaving.”
Trujillo and Montes encouraged immigrants to pursue their case with an immigration attorney, get informed of their rights and be brave about standing up for themselves and their communities.
“There’s never been a scarier time to step up and to push back against such a powerful entity like our federal administration, but there’s also never been a more important time to do so,” Montes said.
Jesus is currently working with his immigration lawyers to stay in the country, but he worries daily of both the consequences of returning to Venezuela as well as the possibility of being detained by U.S. immigration officers.
“My worry is that I go back and the persecution against me starts again,” he said in Spanish. “They could literally kill me.”
All of these developments hit close to home for Trujillo. When he became a citizen, he remembers finally feeling like he had made it, like he didn’t need to worry anymore.
“As an immigrant, you always feel unstable,” he said. “Here I am, 15 years later, and I’m worried about it again.”

Dan McKee has ordered flags at all state buildings and facilities to fly at half-staff and is asking Rhode Islanders to do the same in honor of Senate President Dominick Ruggerio.
The governor’s directive comes as tributes pour in from political figures across the spectrum following Ruggerio’s death early Monday following a battle with cancer. The self-described moderate North Providence Democrat served more than four decades at the State House. 
McKee called Ruggerio a great friend and “true public servant who dedicated his life to lifting up the state he loved.”
“His service and thoughtful leadership have made Rhode Island a better place, and his legacy will leave a lasting impact on our state for generations to come,” the governor said in a statement. “It was my honor to work alongside him.”
Flags are ordered to remain at half staff until Ruggerio’s internment.
Rhode Island Senate President Dominick Ruggerio has died

Lt. Gov. Sabina Matos praised Ruggerio’s leadership on workforce training, lead pipe replacement, and climate resiliency, saying his impact and legacy will be felt for generations.
“Rhode Island will miss him dearly,” she said.
Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said Ruggerio “displayed true leadership in addressing the state’s most pressing issues, from the opioid crisis to climate change and everything in between.”
“Mr. Ruggerio led until the very end, demonstrating the same courage and tenacity in illness as he did his entire life, because of his steadfast commitment to the health and well-being of Rhode Islanders,” Neronha said in a statement.
Rhode Island Secretary of State Gregg Amore said Ruggerio exemplified the qualities of an effective public servant, demonstrating unwavering dedication to his work and a clear set of values that shaped his decisions throughout his career.
“Senate President Ruggerio took on those requirements for more than four decades, serving his constituents and the Senate as a whole with dedication and steadfast leadership,” Amore said.
U.S. Sen. Jack Reed remembered Ruggerio as a “distinguished public servant, a champion for working people and our state, and a dear friend.”
“I will miss Donny’s friendship and his unwavering advocacy for our state and the people who make it a special place,” Reed said in a statement. “Rhode Island is better today because of Senate President Ruggerio’s leadership and dedication.”
U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse said Ruggerio’s legacy at the State House will be defined by his decades of forceful advocacy for working people and his practical, highly effective style of legislating.
“Beloved by his North Providence community, Donny was always a pleasure to work with,” Whitehouse said. “I send my deepest condolences to the entire Ruggerio family.”
U.S. Rep. Seth Magaziner called Ruggerio “a champion for working people, a skilled legislator, and a true gentleman.” Magaziner, a former state treasurer, said it was an honor to work with Ruggerio on the school construction initiative launched in 2018.
“He understood the importance of investing in the next generation, and the Senate delivered under his leadership,” Magaziner said in a statement.
U.S. Rep. Gabe Amo called Ruggerio’s passing “a significant loss for Rhode Island” and echoed Magaziner, saying the late senate president championed the state’s working class.
“From infrastructure to labor protections, he believed that our state’s progress is ultimately a result of the hard work of our people,” Amo said.
Ruggerio’s passing has garnered sympathies from across the aisle as well. 
Rhode Island GOP chairman Joe Powers issued an online statement saying his absence “will be felt throughout the State House and across our state.”
“Though we stood on opposite sides of the aisle, I recognize Senate President Ruggerio’s institutional knowledge and leadership during his decades of service in public office and the lasting impact he made on Rhode Island politics,” Powers said. 
Ruggerio’s pro-labor stance was not lost on local unions. Mary Barden, executive director for the National Education Association Rhode Island, called Ruggerio “a steadfast advocate for public education” who was committed to advocating fair wages and strong benefits.
“His leadership left an enduring mark on our state, and he served the Senate with great pride and integrity,” Barden said.
Democratic National Committeeman Joe Paolino Jr., a former mayor of Providence, remembered Ruggerio as “a man of reason” who could find common ground when others saw only differences. Committeewoman Nicole Verdi, who once worked under Ruggerio, thanked her former boss for his mentorship and his leadership.
“I saw firsthand how many people he helped and how deeply he cared about public service, the institution of the Senate, and the state he loved,” she said. “His legacy will live on in the institutions he strengthened and in the lives of so many he worked tirelessly to support and uplift.”
State Party Chair Liz Beretta-Perik thanked Ruggeiro for bringing civility and respect to Rhode Island politics and called him a good friend.
“Anytime I was with him, I felt the kindness and warmth that were his trademarks,” she said. “His Italian heritage reminded me of my grandparents and the values of family and community that I grew up with and cherish.”
Advocates with the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Networks have also lent their condolences to the man they said championed efforts to improve public health and increase access to cancer screenings tests.
“Sen. Ruggerio was a resounding voice on so many issues critical to Rhode Islanders and will be sorely missed,” said Ryan Strik, government relations director for the society’s Rhode Island chapter.

Tammy Baldwin and Ron Johnson announced Friday that they’d renewed their agreement establishing the Wisconsin Federal Nominating Commission to provide recommendations for Congress on nominations for U.S. attorneys and federal judgeships. 
There are currently vacancies for U.S. attorneys in both the eastern and western districts of the state and U.S. Circuit Court Judge Diane Sykes announced she will take senior status, a form of semi-retirement, on Oct. 1, which will require the senators to offer potential nominees for the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. 
The commitment to the nominating commission comes as President Donald Trump and Republicans attack the federal judiciary over decisions by judges across the country to limit the president’s authority. 
Both senators said they were confident the commission will find people who can work impartially. 
“I am proud to work with Senator Johnson this Congress to select qualified, impartial candidates to serve our state and faithfully apply the law,” Baldwin said in a statement. “I have full confidence our bipartisan nominating commission will do its job well of rigorously vetting and selecting candidates with the character, expertise, and experience required to fairly deliver justice for our constituents.” 
In his statement, Johnson said the nominating commission must concentrate “on finding individuals who will apply the law and not alter it to fit their ideological or policy preferences.” 
But late last month, Johnson said he supported an effort from U.S. House Republicans, supported by Wisconsin’s GOP representatives, that would limit the ability of federal district judges to impose nationwide injunctions on executive actions. Johnson told the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel that the judiciary was “overstepping its constitutional bounds” by declaring Trump’s actions unconstitutional. 
“They’ve got to discipline, they’ve got to put some guardrails around this,” Johnson said. “This is getting completely out of control.”

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)The Rhode Island Senate’s hypothetical, forward-looking leadership succession plan became present-day reality with the death of Senate President Dominick Ruggerio Monday. 
But just as some lawmakers were tight-lipped about Ruggerio’s declining health and the impact of his absences on the chamber prior to his death, they are keeping quiet about the forthcoming election.
Senate Majority Leader Val Lawson and Senate Majority Whip David Tikoian walked out of the room when asked by reporters at a State House appearance Monday when the Senate will elect a new president. Both had stressed the need for privacy during individual remarks minutes earlier.
“It’s fitting first and foremost in the early hours of this loss to focus on the life and legacy of Senate President Dominick Ruggerio,” Tikoian, a Smithfield Democrat, said during the press conference. “And we will accomplish that by providing proper respect, decorum, and tribute, fitting for our Senate president.”
The Senate has cancelled all of its regularly scheduled floor sessions and committee hearings until further notice — at least through the end of the week, Lawson said.
When the chamber reconvenes, its first task will be to choose a new leader. While the majority leader has been the obvious successor in recent history — Ruggerio ascended to the presidency role from majority leader in 2017 — Lawson has not said publicly whether she wants the job. 
Lawson’s time as second-in-command has been brief. The East Providence Democrat was elected in 2018, ascending to majority whip in 2023. In the fall of 2024, Ruggerio brought in Lawson to replace  former Majority Leader Ryan Pearson on the heels of a growing feud between Pearson and Ruggerio rooted in Ruggerio’s health and ability to lead. At the Senate Democrats’ November caucus, Pearson challenged Ruggerio for the president position; he lost, but had the backing of nearly one-third of the Senate’s 34 Democratic members.
Pearson, a Cumberland Democrat first elected in 2012, declined to comment when asked on Monday about his interest in seeking the leadership role in the upcoming election. 
“Today is about remembering Senator Ruggerio,” Pearson said in a text message.
Another name being whispered down State House halls as a possible contender is Sen. Frank Ciccone, a Providence Democrat who has served 22 years. Ciccone sat in the folding chairs of the Senate Lounge Monday morning as Lawson and Tikoian offered brief tributes to the late Ruggerio.
Ciccone did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment on Monday.
Meanwhile, Sen. Dawn Euer, a Newport Democrat who was believed to be considering a run for president as recently as the fall caucus, confirmed to WPRI-TV 12 Monday that she did not intend to seek the president role. Euer did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment on Monday.
While sitting state senators determine who will be their next president, constituents in Ruggerio’s District 4, spanning northern Providence and North Providence, will elect his successor in a forthcoming special election. The Rhode Island Secretary of State, who oversees state special elections, has not yet set dates, Faith Chybowski, a spokesperson for the office, said in an email on Monday. State law requires open seats to be filled 70-90 days after a vacancy occurs. However, there is flexibility to push the election later within the calendar year if it is “doubtful” that the successor will be chosen in time to complete the legislative session.
The General Assembly returned from its April recess today, and is expected to conclude its annual session by June 30.

(Getty Images)In early April, state humanities councils in all 50 states received a letter from the infamous DOGE. It read “Your grant no longer effectuates the agency’s needs and priorities and conditions of the Grant Agreement and is subject to termination” It meant  — simply put — their funding was axed. Many councils had probably foreseen this coming, given prior moves that undermined integrity at the Kennedy Center and the National Endowment of the Arts.

Councils have been in a tailspin since. It’s a cultural domino effect. The federal money humanities councils received would otherwise have been divvied out in smaller grants to libraries, historical societies and museums.

Checking online websites, I see councils across the nation posting heartfelt apologies, alongside lists of programs they will no longer support. That’s bad enough. New Mexico Humanities Council Director Brandon Johnson, however, offers the most dire prognosis: He expects the NM Humanities will have to shut down.

Gone. Utterly gone   — lock, stock and barrel — ending its mission to support relevant work.

Which is? It’s work related to history, philosophy, literature, ethics, media and cultural studies. It’s helping a local art museum fund a special exhibition, exploring Hispano traditions. It’s funding the library to sponsor a special speaker who has just published a book preserving Native American stories. It could be be funds for a public exhibition in which you or your children could participate. It’s providing free access to a lecture on that small piece of history that you feel hasn’t been done justice.

Because that’s what the humanities by definition is: the intellectual study of human culture. The job of councils, on the other hand, is to make these studies available to the general public, regardless of location, and without cost.

I have been a beneficiary of the New Mexico Humanities Council, both as someone seated in the audience, and as an artist/historian. The NM Humanities Speakers Bureau programs sends writers, and artists of various disciplines, to public institutions across the state. I have traveled extensively, delivering lectures on Black American history, especially the Black presence in New Mexico.

It’s a subject many New Mexican have never devoted attention to, given the state’s small Black population. I love watching audiences, who have come to hear me with obvious curiosity, as their eyes light up, exploring new vistas. A Q&A follows every lecture. This is the part that is truly in the Socratic tradition. Knowledge isn’t simply delivered on a silver platter. It’s probed. It’s investigated. It’s put to the test.

However, looking back, the most memorable incident in my lecturing career occurred in a private encounter with an audience member. It was a question from a very young man who said he was college student. He approached me after I finished my talk with an earnest, but worried look. I could tell he had serious intentions. He was very somber, though his question was quite naive.

“I …uh… wanted to ask you something…”

Go ahead, I signaled with a nod.

“Ummm… how do you read books, and enjoy them?”

I was flabbergasted because this wasn’t a question about my subject matter.

He asked me about the roots of studiousness.

I asked: Was he having trouble in school? Was he overwhelmed by books?

He said he was a freshman who until recently had never been required to read so much — or  so extensively.

And he was fascinated by his college subjects.

And he was simultaneously feeling overwhelmed.

I finally answered that all an ideal reader needed to have was passion.

I believed he had this. He was young, with a genuine desire to become a better reader. His commitment wasn’t feigned. He was beginning a lifetime’s worth of scholarship. Stick with it, I said.

I feel proud, looking back, believing my lecture awakened an earnestness inside him, or stirred his desire to read and read and read. I believe in tens of thousands of New Mexicans out there —especially from underserved backgrounds — waiting to be stirred, provoked or inspired in the same way.

Reaching them is a mission that must be restored, by reinvesting in humanities councils, or else we will give the phrase “the closing of the American mind “a new meaning.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/gettyimages-2148912235-1024x640.jpg,,,2025-04-21 14:18:24.619204

We’re now three months into the second Trump administration and, as so many experts had feared and warned, the chaos – in the global economy, in the federal government, in our courts, and on the ground in scores of communities across the nation – is palpable. Between the seemingly random economic tariffs, massive and crude cuts to public services, and cruel and unlawful treatment of lawfully present immigrants, the national mess is already looking as if will be bigger than it was during the first Trump administration.

It also would generally apply across state agencies. Jan. 10, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The anticipated debate on whether Nebraska lawmakers will define “male” and “female” in state law, largely for school bathrooms and sports, kicks off Tuesday afternoon, with one conservative holdout no longer “leaning” in opposition.
Debate on Legislative Bill 89, the “Stand With Women Act” from State Sen. Kathleen Kauth of the Millard area, is set to begin Tuesday by 3 p.m. for up to four hours of debate. LB 89 seeks to restrict bathrooms, sports teams and locker rooms at public K-12 schools and colleges, or in the case of private schools competing against public schools in sports, to individuals’ sex at birth.
Speaker John Arch of La Vista, who sets the Legislature’s daily agenda, has designated LB 89 as “controversial and emotionally charged,” meaning half the debate time as other bills.
‘Those are your rights’
Under a proposed committee amendment, sex would be defined as whether someone “naturally has, had, will or would have, but for a congenital anomaly or intentional or unintentional disruption, the reproductive system that at some point produces, transports and utilizes” either eggs (female, woman or girl) or sperm (male, man or boy) for fertilization.
  State Sen. Kathleen Kauth of Omaha shakes hands with Gov. Jim Pillen. Jan. 10, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
In addition to schools, state agencies would need to generally enforce any applicable rules, regulations, administrative decisions or duties according to someone’s sex.
Kauth said she has been told by some of her Democratic colleagues that she has “no idea what’s in store” for LB 89’s debate, that it could be “pretty aggressive and brutal.” Still, she said she remains grateful for her colleagues who will stand with her and that she is “cautiously optimistic” that she will have 33 votes, the threshold needed to shut off debate after four hours.
Kauth said families have reached out to her since she introduced the issue for the first time in the Legislature two years ago. Some of them “fear being bullied” by teachers and administrators, Kauth said.
“They don’t want to be looked at as mean, and it is never mean to want to have your privacy and your safety and your opportunity protected,” Kauth said. “Those are your rights.”
‘Creating confusion’
At LB 89’s public hearing in February, State Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha, who has filed motions to lead debate against the bill, repeatedly questioned Kauth how someone would know if someone was in the “right” bathroom if her bill passed. Hunt said that of some trans people who testified against Kauth’s bill, “I had no idea they were trans.” Hunt has also asked what would happen to intersex students.
“If I saw them in the bathroom, I wouldn’t think a thing — that’s a beautiful woman, that’s a handsome man,” Hunt told Kauth at the time. “What this is doing is creating confusion for those people because they do fear arrest. They do fear being kicked out of a space.”
  State Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha. Aug. 8, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha, who sits on the Government, Military and Veterans Affairs Committee with Hunt, said after the bill advanced 5-3 from committee: “That it took at least three different bites of the apple to define what a man and a woman are is a clear indication that this is a space that government should not be involved in.”
LB 89 provides an exception to the bathroom requirements for parents of children or caregivers of someone with a disability who is not the same sex as the adult.
Schools would need to designate bathrooms and locker rooms for use by females or males only, unless they are single occupancy. Family use bathrooms could also be designated.
A ‘softened’ opponent
Among the senators being eyed to get to 33 votes — the threshold needed to shut off debate after a set amount of time — is State Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston, a Republican.
In the officially nonpartisan Legislature, Republicans maintain 33 seats while Democrats hold 15 seats. The remaining lawmaker is registered nonpartisan but votes with fellow progressives.
Since LB 89 was introduced in January, Riepe has described himself as a “doubting Thomas” on the bill and said that he was “leaning” against voting for it. But now, he said he is “leaning” toward voting for the bill for the first time. 
State Sen. Merv Riepe still the center of attention in Nebraska Legislature

He said he’s “softened” on the issue. He was previously not just a “no” but a “Hell no” on the bill, in part because of anger that the State Board of Education wasn’t taking up the issue. However, he said he wants to “protect women’s sports,” as other supporters have said is their goal.
Riepe said he can “only be the maverick in so many cases,” referring to his position as a critical vote on multiple bills the past few years, including those from Kauth.
Last week, Riepe said he would take the extended weekend to review LB 89, including the amendment to require doctors to verify a student’s sex before sports participation. When he first heard of that requirement, the longtime hospital administrator thought it could be “busy work.”
In 2024, Riepe was one of two Republicans who didn’t vote for a previous version of Kauth’s bill, at the time limited to K-12 sports, locker rooms and bathrooms. The bill fell two votes short. 
Getting around Riepe
There have also been efforts to get around Riepe’s vote, if needed, such as through Democratic State Sens. Jane Raybould of Lincoln, Jason Prokop of Lincoln or Dan Quick of Grand Island, multiple senators confirmed to the Nebraska Examiner.
  State Sen. Jane Raybould of Lincoln. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska News Service)
Raybould said she, for example, was called into Pillen’s office earlier this month. After discussing the opening of a Super Saver in Pillen’s hometown of Columbus, a grocery chain that Raybould’s family operates, Pillen asked if Raybould could be counted on for Kauth’s bill.
In part of the exchange, Raybould said, she noted a distinction for transgender students and told Pillen she couldn’t vote for LB 89. She cited meetings with families and children who would be impacted, such as those from the nonprofit Rainbow Parents that formed over the past two years in response to Kauth’s legislation.
Raybould also brought LB 605 this year to enshrine regulations from the Nebraska School Activities Association for transgender sports participation into law. She later withdrew the bill.
Prokop, a more moderate freshman senator, said he will not vote for Kauth’s bill. His close ally in a similar swing vote position, State Sen. Eliot Bostar of Lincoln, confirmed the same.
Quick declined to comment on the bill late last week.
A different federal landscape
Many of the components of Kauth’s LB 89 have already been addressed in a 2023 executive order from Pillen (for state agencies) and in 2025 executive orders from President Donald Trump (for school sports).

Trump and his education officials have threatened to pull federal funding from schools that allow student-athletes to participate according to gender identity, not sex. The Nebraska School Activities Association and National Collegiate Athletics Association each had narrow policies that were amended shortly after Trump’s executive orders.
Some opponents to Kauth’s legislation look to the impact of those state and national executive orders as making LB 89 obsolete. Riepe, for example, previously said that if Trump’s orders could last for the four years of his presidency, then LB 89 might be able to wait, too.
Kauth acknowledged LB 89 is coming under a very different federal administration than the past two years but that executive orders can be overturned. 
She said the state must protect its citizens.
“If we are not willing to govern ourselves, then someone else will do it for us,” Kauth said. “I would prefer to be the ones governing ourselves.”

Democrats are ending their bid to repeal a voter-approved limit on property tax growth, excising one of the most controversial revenue-raising ideas they’ve pursued this session.
The proposal, embedded in House Bill 2409, seeks to allow an increase in the growth factor from the current 1% cap to the combined rate of population growth plus inflation within a taxing district, not to exceed 3%. This would apply to the state’s common schools levy and for cities and counties, as well as special purpose districts.
A fiscal analysis projected that uncapping the state property tax would net an additional $200 million for public schools and potentially $236 million for local governments in the next budget. The bill passed the House Finance Committee on Saturday and is expected to be voted on by the House today.
But Rep. Steve Bergquist, D-Renton, the bill’s sponsor, filed an amendment Sunday to remove sections on the growth limit, effectively ending Democrats’ pursuit of the change.
“It’s my understanding we don’t have a three-corners agreement on those provisions,” Bergquist said Monday morning.
Three-corners refers to the Democratic leadership of the House, Senate and Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson.
Without the property tax change, the bill will be focused on education funding and providing school districts with the ability to collect more revenue from voter-approved local levies.
From the outset of the session — now just six days from ending — Democrats’ desire to increase the limit has been fiercely opposed by Republican lawmakers and taxpayers who warned the measure would drive up living and housing costs.
A year ago, Senate Democrats pushed to erase the cap solely for cities and counties. It too ran into a buzzsaw of opposition, forcing the majority party to set it down.

Steve Whalen loves his home state of Delaware and he’s proud to manufacture computers there that police officers use to “catch bad guys.” He said tariffs on imports from China and other countries, along with sharp cuts to government spending and the winding down of a program for small manufacturers, will make it harder for him to do that.
“We got into business to keep costs low for the ‘good guys,’ but tariffs or anything else that raises prices keeps us from doing that,” said Whalen, co-founder of Sumuri LLC in Magnolia, Delaware, which makes computer workstations for police and government investigations. Whalen has to buy materials overseas, often from China, and he said the tariffs could force him to triple his price on some workstations to $12,000.
Tariffs are the main tool President Donald Trump is wielding to try to boost manufacturing in the United States, calling the achievement of that goal “an economic and national security priority.” But the higher levies have led to retaliation and suspended shipments, and Whalen said they are just one of several Trump administration actions squeezing his small manufacturing business.

The wave of federal spending cuts, which has affected grants to state and local governments, could make his customers put off purchases. And the administration has moved to cut off funding for a $175 million state-based program that provides expert advice to smaller factories like his.

The Delaware version of that program, the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, helped Sumuri fit expanded product lines into the limited space in its small-town factory.
“We were really having a tough time trying to figure out how to utilize our space efficiently,” Whalen said. “They came here and helped us organize and optimize, and it made a huge difference.”
On April 1, the Trump administration cut off funding for 10 such manufacturing programs that were up for renewal in Delaware, Hawaii, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota and Wyoming. Other state MEP programs will expire over the next year.
The administration gave a reprieve to those 10 states until the end of the fiscal year after objections from Democrats in the U.S. House and Senate. The National Institute of Standards and Technology, which manages the program, extended funding for the 10 states “after further review and consideration” and will “continue to evaluate plans for the program,” said agency spokesperson Chad Boutin.
The program has come under fire from Republicans since the George W. Bush administration first tried to end it in 2009, and again during the first Trump administration, but Congress has continued to fund it. The conservative Heritage Foundation said in a 2023 book that MEP’s functions “would be more properly carried out by the private sector.”

‘Dots don’t quite connect’

Buckley Brinkman, executive director of the Wisconsin Center for Manufacturing and Productivity, which works with his state’s MEP program, said it didn’t make much sense for the administration to shutter the program as it seeks to boost the number of U.S. manufacturing jobs.
“It’s one of those things where the dots don’t quite connect,” Brinkman said. “I mean, jeez, here’s a part of government that doesn’t cost a whole lot, in the grand scheme of things — less than $200 million a year — that’s returning 10-to-1 to the national treasury, working on a priority for the president.”
A 2024 Upjohn report found an even higher return: 17-to-1 on $175 million in the 2023 fiscal year, creating $3 billion in new federal tax revenue.

In Wisconsin, which has lost more than 138,000 manufacturing jobs since 2000, some parts makers report that business is booming as manufacturers seek to avoid tariffs by finding U.S. alternatives to Chinese manufacturers, Brinkman said. But more broadly, he doubts that the tariffs will spark a manufacturing boom in the state.
“Do we want all this manufacturing back? Do we have the will to get it back? The answer to both those questions is ‘no,’” Brinkman said. “Even without the tariffs we don’t really want Americans doing a lot of those jobs that are in Chinese factories right now.”










I mean, jeez, here’s a part of government that doesn't cost a whole lot, in the grand scheme of things … that's returning 10-to-1 to the national treasury.


– Buckley Brinkman, director of Wisconsin Center for Manufacturing and Productivity


In Delaware, the MEP helped Sumuri manage its expansion, but unpredictable tariffs and budgets are now a bigger danger, said Jason Roslewicz, Sumuri’s vice president of business development. He’s had to devote two employees to monitoring supply lines, tariff news and competitor pricing to stay afloat.
“We went from putting things together in a basement to a 19,000-square-foot facility, doing exactly what we’re supposed to do here in the U.S., and it’s all in danger of coming apart because of this problem,” Roslewicz said.
Other small manufacturers express similar concerns. TJ Semanchin, who owns Wonderstate Coffee in Madison, Wisconsin, said his business roasting and distributing coffee is in crisis because of the tariffs.
Wonderstate’s costs have almost doubled between tariffs on imported coffee and packaging materials from China, plus a cyclical rise in coffee prices. “I’m borrowing money to pay for this and at some point we’ll have to raise prices. We’ll have no choice,” Semanchin said.

But many Republican state officials, and even some Democrats, have backed Trump’s tariff push, including Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who credited the Trump administration with “reshoring manufacturing and restoring this middle class which has been eviscerated over the last 20 years.”
“There’s dislocation in the short term, there’s long-term opportunity,” Youngkin said in an April 15 interview on CNBC. He said his state is hearing more interest from manufacturers looking to build or expand local factories since Trump took office. For instance, Delta Star recently announced a plan to add 300 jobs building power transformers in Lynchburg.
“The president has been clear that there will be some level of tariffs, and folks are coming, and that’s good for Virginia,” Youngkin said in the CNBC interview.
Virginia’s MEP program, called Genedge, claims successes in streamlining production and quality control for local factory products including TreeDiaper, an automated tree watering device made in Ashland, and for advising EDM, a Lynchburg plastic product assembler that needed more efficient production to keep overseas competition at bay. But Virginia’s MEP is one of the state programs slated to expire in the next year.

Long-term trend

The slide in U.S. manufacturing jobs has continued on and off since 1979, and many experts say tariffs will not bring them back. Despite a modest bounce back under the Biden administration, the number of manufacturing jobs has declined from nearly 20 million in 1979 to less than 13 million today, even as the total U.S. workforce has grown from 89 million to 159 million during that period. Alabama has 69,000 fewer manufacturing jobs than it did in 2000.

Manufacturing faces labor shortages, with many factories operating below capacity because they can’t find enough workers, according to Jason Miller, a professor of supply chain management at Michigan State University.
That doesn’t bode well for a mass reshoring of factories from China and other countries, but Miller doesn’t expect that to happen anyway.
“Firms are not planning on reshoring much of the work that was offshored 20 to 25 years ago,” Miller said. “I’m not concerned about having enough workers for manufacturing jobs that would be reshored because this isn’t going to happen.”
In a 2024 survey by the libertarian Cato Institute, 80% of Americans said America would be better off if more people worked in manufacturing, but only 25% said they personally would be better off working in a factory. The Chinese government has poked fun at the idea with memes of American workers struggling to make Nike sneakers with sewing machines.
Joseph McCartin, a labor historian at Georgetown University, said the idea of a manufacturing rebirth is a “mirage being conjured to attract the support of workers who have been underpaid in an increasingly unequal economy for the last 40 years, and are desperate for some hope of renewed upward mobility.”
Manufacturing “isn’t the magic wand to make that happen,” McCartin said.
“What we need is to raise workers’ wages and make the economy less prone to producing inequality,” McCartin said. “That mission is not at all what Trump is about. He is dealing in stale nostalgia.”

It’s been nearly two years since Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel announced a group of 16 individuals would each face several felonies carrying years of potential prison time for what she said was an undermining of the public’s faith in elections and a flagrant violation of the law.
According to investigators, after Trump lost Michigan to former President Joe Biden in 2020 by about 150,000 votes in the presidential race, 16 individuals from across the state met in the basement of the Michigan Republican Party’s Lansing headquarters on Dec. 14, 2020. There investigators say the group signed and submitted false documents contending they were the rightful slate of electors for Michigan. Those affidavits were then submitted to the United States Senate and National Archives.

The case has been lengthy, with a state judge hearing out the defense and prosecution of 15 defendants after the state dropped the case against one of the defendants.

24-1132_Documents 
Arguments from the defense have ranged from the group’s right to political protest to their actions being a lawful maneuver in the event that the 2020 election results be overturned.
The defense of multiple individuals in the group have taken particular issue with Nessel’s own comments surrounding the case, notably statements she made during a virtual event in September of 2023 where she said the group was “brainwashed” by Trump’s lies about the 2020 election being stolen from him.
“These are people who have been brainwashed,” Nessel said in the video. “They legit believe that … somebody can’t even plead guilty if they wanted to because they can’t admit that what they did violated the law because they still think they’re right.”
The defense team for one member of the group, Clifford Frost of Warren, argued that Nessel and her office are engaged in a “bad faith” case against the defendants, requesting at the end of 2023 that a federal judge intervene in the case. In January of 2024, U.S. District Judge Robert Jonker rejected the defense’s arguments, declining to intercede, saying a proper argument had not been made to support the “bad faith” contention.
Frost’s attorney, Kevin Kijewski, has argued that there was no criminal intent in what the state is alleging, adding that the defendants signed their own real names to the documents in an act of political protest.
However, on Thursday, a panel of judges in the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed Jonker’s decision to stay out of the state’s case. The appeal to the lower court’s decision was set before Judges Eric L. Clay, Judge Helene N. White and Judge John B. Nalbandian, a Trump appointee.
The opinion, penned by Clay, an appointee of former President Bill Clinton, outlines that Frost’s defense does not call into question the state court’s competency to consider the challenges that have been made to the validity of the criminal charges he faces.
“…we must ‘assume that state procedures will afford an adequate remedy, in the absence of unambiguous authority to the contrary,’” the opinion reads. “In addition, Frost’s qualms with the adequacy of the State’s charging documents do not automatically convert his prosecution into a product of bad faith. This is particularly so where, as here, state court remains a viable forum for the consideration of Frost’s arguments.”
Preliminary exams for the group of defendants were held throughout 2024 by Ingham County District Court Judge Kristen Simmons, as the group was divided into three groups for three separate multi-day preliminary hearings, the last of which concluded in October 2024. 
Simmons now faces the task to review all the evidence and testimony the court received during the exams and evaluate if the case should proceed to trial. While a May 2 review hearing is set for the defendants, it’s not known when Simmons will hand down her decision.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-876701606-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-21 13:12:29.384495

The pope died Monday at the age of 88, according to the Associated Press. He was the first pope from Latin America and presided for more than 12 years.
“Susan and I join Christians across Montana and around the world in mourning the loss of his holiness, Pope Francis,” Gianforte said in a statement. “After leading a life of service to the Lord, Pope Francis leaves a legacy of kindness and understanding toward the most vulnerable among us.

(File photo by Sviatlana Lazarenka/Getty Images)South Carolina’s state-affiliated hospital system can now proceed with long-delayed expansion plans into some of the Palmetto State’s fastest-growing communities, but it will more than double its debt in the process.
After more than five years of court battles and four years of pandemic-induced financial hardships, the Medical University of South Carolina’s hospital system has final approvals in hand to finance two new hospitals in the suburbs of Charleston and Charlotte.
The State Fiscal Accountability Authority gave permission earlier this month for MUSC to borrow $860 million: $400 million to build a hospital and cancer center in Summerville’s mega Nexton community, $330 million to build a hospital in Indian Land (the unincorporated panhandle of Lancaster County), and $130 million to finance the equipment for both.
Unanimous approval from the state’s five-member fiscal oversight board came without discussion.
“These projects are good projects in and of themselves,” MUSC Health CEO Dr. Pat Cawley told the SC Daily Gazette. “We know both are in growing areas and we know those areas can easily support these facilities.”
The new borrowing adds to the public hospital system’s $836 million in existing long-term debt and leases, according to an April financial report.
By comparison, the similarly sized Prisma Health hospital system, headquartered in Greenville, carries a debt load of about $1.5 billion, according to the latest report from Wall Street ratings agencies.
Unlike the private Prisma Health, MUSC Health is a state-owned nonprofit.
But Cawley is not concerned by the financial lift, saying MUSC Health has more than enough borrowing capacity.
Expansive growth
MUSC Health first announced plans for the Summerville hospital in December 2017, citing the community’s booming population with mega developments such as the Nexton community filling up with thousands of new homes.
Hospital executives said patients were already making the drive from once-rural Berkeley County into downtown Charleston for health care. It was around this time the hospital system started talking about a new strategy to bring services closer to where patients live.
Two years later, MUSC purchased community hospitals in Chester and Lancaster counties and saw firsthand the growth potential in communities near the North Carolina state line.
Indian Land had the second-fastest-growing ZIP code in the state in early 2020, when that project was announced.
“That whole area where the population is booming is a bedroom community of Charlotte,” Cawley said in a statement accompanying the announcement. “We already have patients and employees who commute to our existing hospital in Lancaster to receive care or to work.”
“It’s been shown that to serve patients most effectively, you need to be where they are,” Cawley added. “Patients want to receive their health care closest to home and family. These days, we can build a small hospital and do it in a cost-efficient way so patients don’t have to travel.”
The announcement followed the system’s 2019 purchase of four rural community hospitals — in Florence and Marion, in addition to Lancaster and Chester.
That upended the health system’s nearly 200-year history of staying largely contained to its Charleston base.
In 2021, MUSC Health again expanded with the purchase of three hospitals and a standalone emergency room in the Midlands.
The public system took on debt for all of those purchases. Plus, it still owes upwards of $430 million for its 5-year-old children’s hospital and its Ashley River Tower hospital, which opened in 2008.
With all that, MUSC Health is still at less than half of its debt capacity, Cawley said.
While its tab is set to more than double, revenues generated by the two new hospitals when they open also will grow the system’s borrowing power, though Cawley did not say by how much.
Moody’s ratings agency praised MUSC for its “prudent fiscal management” when it held the combined university and hospital system steady at its highest-level credit rating. Analysts with the firm did note some concerns however, with the hospital’s significant debt leveraging and narrow margins.
Still, a lot has changed since MUSC Health’s December 2017 announcement about the Summerville location.
For starters, the hospital system suffered four years of operating losses that started with the onset of the global coronavirus pandemic.
“COVID created a major workforce disruption. That was a big issue for hospitals all across the country,” said Thornton Kirby, president of the South Carolina Hospital Association. “It also caused a significant financial crisis, because the labor costs went up so much when the reimbursement rates (paid to hospitals by insurance, Medicare and Medicaid) were not going up at the same rate.”
MUSC Health’s operations were back in the black as of last June, with the system’s 16 hospitals earning nearly $62 million in income after expenses for fiscal year 2023-24.
“We held back simply due to COVID-induced uncertainty,” Cawley said of the new hospital plans. “Since then, the need has grown, and we are ready to move forward again.”
Regulatory changes
In addition to the pandemic, the projects were also held up by legal challenges filed under the state’s soon-to-be phased out regulatory process that required providers to get a Certificate of Need.
The bureaucratic permission process was supposed to control costs and prevent duplication by providers in the same area. But critics argued the protections ended up reducing access to care and increasing costs as hospital systems fought in court to prevent competition and tied up proposals for years — as occurred with MUSC’s plans for Nexton and Indian Land.
Under a 2023 law phasing out the application approval process, new hospitals will no longer need a Certificate of Need starting in 2027.
While that will end lawsuits and hefty legal fees for hospital operators, it also opens them up to more competition for patients, particularly from hospital systems in border states.
“The truth of it is, hospitals make a lot of money in some areas and lose a lot of money in some areas,” Kirby said. “They make money on surgery and on imaging, and they lose money in the emergency room. They lose money taking care of pneumonia patients and they lose money delivering babies.”
That means hospitals rely on those money-making procedures to subsidize the other care provided.
“If you say anybody can build anything they want, they’re not going to build behavioral health units that lose money. They’re not going to build trauma services,” Kirby said. “They’re going to build surgery centers for insured people.”
Despite this, Kirby said hospital systems have not expressed a lot of angst about Certificate of Need going away.
“I hear people saying, ‘OK, this is the new environment. Let me decide what I’m going to do as a result,'” he said.
Unlike the SC Hospital Association, MUSC Health actually backed the law’s repeal, Cawley said.
He’s confident the hospital system will “remain successful and competitive in South Carolina.”
And there’s no end in site for the hospital system’s spending spree.
MUSC Health recently announced plans for a new cancer hospital in downtown Charleston.
“This is a monumental event for the entire state,” Charles Schulze, chairman of MUSC’s governing board, said in a statement. “The goal here is to have something that rivals the top cancer facilities in the nation so no one has to leave South Carolina for cancer care.”
That’s on top of the purchase of Roper St. Francis’ hospital on the peninsula announced last August.
MUSC Health has not named a dollar amount for either of these projects.
The price for the Roper building will be decided in 2029, when the hospital is scheduled to move to a new North Charleston location.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/hospital-image-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-21 13:12:29.384495

HB 165, sponsored by Rep. Rick Rehm, R-Dothan, closes state offices on June 19, which celebrates the end of slavery in the United States. 
“This is a bill that is constituent driven, that was brought to me by my constituents,” Rehm said.

The legislation passed after years of efforts by Black Democrats in the Alabama Legislature, who either saw their proposals rejected or were effectively forced by Republicans to pair Juneteenth with Jefferson Davis’ Birthday, a state holiday honoring the slaveholder and white supremacist who said that Black Americans were “fitted expressly for human servitude.” 
The House last year approved a bill sponsored by Rep. Juanadalynn Givan, D-Birmingham, that would have required state employees to choose Juneteenth or Jefferson Davis’ Birthday as their day off, a choice not required of any other state holiday. 
Several Black Democrats said during the debate on the bill last year that they struggled with whether to support the legislation with the Davis requirement. The House approved the bill, but it did not come out of the Senate.  
Several Black Democrats in the House Thursday expressed their frustration that Rehm’s bill — which makes Juneteenth a standalone holiday not tied to Davis’ birthday — won approval from the majority Republican Legislature while Givan’s had to be altered before it could come to a vote. 
“There’s something wrong that the only way it could be a good bill is that somebody else carries it, and not the people that was affected by it in the first place,” Moore said.
Rep. Napoleon Bracy, D-Mobile, echoed Moore and said he was thankful the bill would pass but was upset that it took a white Republican like Rehm to pass it.
“Sometimes we need to win for our community,” Bracy said. “We’ve had people that have brought this legislation for decades, and it wasn’t good enough.”
The bill passed 85-4 with a floor amendment by Rep. Laura Hall, D-Huntsville, that moved the effective date up to June 1 so that state employees could reap the benefits of the legislation this year. 
“It was going to be taking effect on October 1, and we wanted it to take effect prior to the actual holiday,” Rehm said, supporting the amendment.
Gov. Kay Ivey has signed memos for the last four years making Juneteenth a federal holiday. Juneteenth has also been a federally recognized holiday since 2021.
Alabama’s official state holiday calendar puts Robert E. Lee’s Birthday on the same day as Martin Luther King’s Birthday. The state also marks Confederate Memorial Day on the fourth Monday in April. 
The bill goes to the Senate.

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Two Indiana statewide elected officials filed a lawsuit Friday against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, months after they first urged the federal agency to verify the citizenship of more than 585,000 registered Hoosier voters. 
In October, Secretary of State Diego Morales and Attorney General Todd Rokita petitioned the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) — which is housed within the homeland security agency — to review lists of voters who registered without providing a state-issued form of identification.
Federal officials “have failed to provide information that would enable Indiana to verify that only eligible voters participated in elections,” Morales’ and Rokita’s offices alleged in news releases Monday.
Story continues below.
2025.4.16 – Complaint
 
There is no evidence of widespread noncitizen voter fraud. It is illegal under both state and federal law to cast a ballot as a noncitizen.
“Following the Biden administration’s obstruction here, I expect that President (Donald) Trump’s team will resolve this matter,” Rokita said in the release. “This lawsuit is another important step in ensuring the integrity of our elections. Hoosiers have a right to know that legitimate ballots are not being diluted by noncitizens. I promised that I would get citizenship information from USCIS, and that is exactly what I am doing by filing this suit.”  
Though Trump took office in January, his administration has also declined to respond to Indiana’s request. Over a dozen other states have filed similar missives. 
The 585,774 Hoosiers from the Oct. 11 letter include those who registered without an Indiana driver’s license number or a social security number — or who live overseas. Some of those could include Hoosiers who registered before those numbers were required. 
It represents roughly 12% of the registered voters for the November election. 
But critics pushed back, saying that the USCIS Person Centric Query Service wasn’t designed to process large numbers of voters and could be prone to error. 
In a statement to the Indiana Capital Chronicle, Common Cause Indiana Executive Director Julia Vaughn said Hoosiers deserve better. 
Indiana officials ask federal government to verify citizenship of 585K registered voters

“It is shameful that the Attorney General and Secretary of State continue to put partisan games at the forefront of their job responsibilities. Indiana elections are, and always have been, safe and secure. This is just another attempt to spread misinformation about voting and at the same time, intimidate naturalized citizens from exercising their rights. Hoosiers deserve better than this waste of taxpayer dollars wrapped up in an unnecessary lawsuit,” Vaughn said.
The Department of Homeland Security does offer access to the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, which requires an identifier such as a registration number, which makes it “not suited” for verification, according to the lawsuit. 
In October, Morales told the Capital Chronicle that the verification push stemmed from county-level officials concerned about an uptick in absentee ballot requests for overseas voters — Hoosiers living abroad, including those in the military, vote using absentee ballots.
“As Indiana’s Chief Election Officer, ensuring the integrity of our elections is non-negotiable,” Morales said in the Monday release. “This legal action is a continuation of our efforts for Indiana to lead the way in election integrity. Since we never received a response from the Biden administration, we know that under President Trump’s leadership and based on his recent Executive Order, there’s a stronger commitment to the election process. Hoosiers deserve nothing less than full confidence in the security of their vote.”
It’s unclear what executive order Morales referenced, though a breakdown of election-oriented proclamations by the Brennan Center for Justice includes an overhaul that the left-leaning group said was illegal. 
In particular, Trump’s actions align with the Congressional SAVE Act, which some have worried would disenfranchise married women who changed their last names but might not have matching documentation. Under SAVE, individuals must present a passport, birth certificate or other citizenship documentation when registering.

More than two-thirds know someone impacted by SUD, and the data shows robust support – across political and demographic lines – for a health-first approach to the issue. North Carolinians support expanding access to the full spectrum of evidence-based SUD treatment, including medications and eliminating SUD-based discrimination.
Leaders in North Carolina’s executive and legislative branches can take heart in this emerging consensus of support for their efforts to combat the state’s overdose epidemic. Fortunately, Governor Josh Stein and First Lady Anna Stein both support access to evidence-based treatment and ending the stigma that interferes with the delivery of treatment. 
Additionally, State Representative Timothy Reeder and State Senator Jim Burgin recently held a press conference with the Addiction Professionals of NC (APNC) to announce the NC Treatment Connection website, aimed at ensuring all SUD treatment providers in the state use evidence-based models.
These efforts are essential since the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) ranks North Carolina in the top 15 states with the highest fatal overdose rates. According to the state’s Department of Health and Human Services, 2023 (the most current year of data) marks NC’s highest rate of fatal overdose since 2010, with an estimated 4,442 deaths. That’s 12 deaths per day, more than double the rate of fatalities from vehicle crashes  that year.
For opioid use disorder, the most evidence-based form of treatment uses either methadone or buprenorphine, two of the three medications approved by the FDA for treatment of this disorder. The third, naltrexone, has much less robust evidence of efficacy.
Buprenorphine and methadone are effective at treating opioid withdrawal and cravings for opioids. These two medications for opioid disorder (MOUD), in repeated studies, show a reduction in overdose death rates of at least two-fold. 
If a medication showed such a reduction in death when used to treat any other chronic condition, failing to provide that medication would be malpractice. Yet MOUD is often prohibited in settings such as drug courts, skilled nursing facilities, and even in residential SUD treatment programs. These stigmatizing practices lead to unnecessary deaths.
We must eliminate MOUD- and SUD- based discrimination in all settings, especially healthcare settings. The stigma some medical professionals hold towards people with SUD can lead to dangerous results. Studies have shown clinicians can miss important diagnoses or deny care when they harbor preconceived ideas about patients. 
Inadequate treatment of withdrawal symptoms causes patients to leave against medical advice or avoid medical care completely. Verbal and nonverbal communication of disdain or judgment from medical providers intensifies the shame already felt by patients with SUD and harms the therapeutic relationship. Even at facilities treating SUD, some providers carry negative attitudes towards life-saving buprenorphine and methadone.
The people of North Carolina also have reasons for optimism. In 2024, North Carolina experienced a five-year low of 12,447 emergency department visits due to overdose. The availability of naloxone, now free at many jails, health departments, and harm reduction sites, and the use of mobile OUD treatment clinics to reach people in areas that previously lacked access has contributed to this positive trend.
Clearly, there’s much more work to be done. North Carolina’s widespread support for strategies that prioritize treatment over punishment signals a prime opportunity for action. NC leaders should build on their efforts in three key ways:

Ensure emergency departments, primary care providers, jails, recovery courts, and SUD treatment programs all provide – or act as conduits to – evidence-based treatment.
Expand the SUD treatment workforce
Ensure public funds, including opioid settlement money, only support programs that provide access to evidence-based treatment.

Overwhelming public support for a health-first approach, the leadership of policymakers committed to change, and the availability of lifesaving interventions bring the overdose crisis within our reach for positive change.
By investing in treatment, harm reduction, and policies that promote recovery and combat discrimination, North Carolina can save lives and create a robust healthcare system that treats all people with dignity and respect. There is consensus, and the path forward is clear.

But Senator Natalie Murdock (D-Chatham, Durham) refused to allow budget week to shift her focus from what she sees as the critical need to pass a bill crafted to improve Black maternal health outcomes.
The United States has the highest maternal mortality rate in the developed world. And Black women in the U.S. are three times more likely to die from pregnancy-related health problems than white women.
  Sen. Natalie Murdock (D-Durham) (Photo: ncleg.gov)
Murdock has repeated those sobering facts for more than three years now, as she tries to get the Republican-controlled Senate to advance the MOMnibus 3.0 Act.
Battling perceptions and negative stereotypes
Gabriel Scott, an MPA with the North Carolina Coalition of the National Council of Negro Women, joined Murdock last week in advocating for Senate Bill 571/House Bill 725.
Scott said when she went into labor at 25 weeks, doctors were dismissive.
“I needed pain medication, I needed help, I needed something. They did not listen.”
After she delivered her twins, complications with the placenta and an excessive loss of blood, left her husband terrified she might need a blood transfusion.
“They finally had an anesthesiologist come to give me medication. My husband said, can you at least tell me what the medication is? And the anesthesiologist laughed and said, ‘Oh, this is typically medicine we give to war vets who have had limbs blown off,’” Scott recounted. “They took it as a joke. The doctor continued to shove his arm in me.”
Hours later in recovery, a white female doctor came to her room acknowledging the difficulty of the delivery.
“And she said, there are things that we know we do well at the hospital and then there are things that we know we don’t do well, and one of those things is our treatment of African-American women and childbirth.”
The same doctor suggested both she and her husband might seek mental health help.
Scott gives thanks to God that her twin girls are healthy. But she’s been dealing with pelvic pain for over four years and the trauma of doctors who didn’t listen to her.
  Dr. Charity Watkins (Photo: Duke.edu)
Dr. Charity Watkins, an assistant professor of social work at North Carolina Central University and a maternal health researcher at Duke University, shared her own terrifying story of pregnancy-related heart failure.
“I always feel it is important for me to introduce myself using my professional roles. Maybe my doctoral degree will save me from the daily mistreatment I experienced because of my dark complexion. Maybe leaning into the perceived prestige of being a professor will protect me from poor perceptions and negative stereotypes associated with being a Black woman,” Watkins told a room of reporters on Wednesday.
After her pregnancy, Watkins presented with classic heart failure symptoms, a family history of heart disease, and a recent cesarean delivery followed by hemorrhaging.
She was told by a doctor that maybe it was the flu.
“What could have led to me receiving quality health care without having to prove I’m worthy of being treated as a human being?”
MOMnibus 3.0
Watkins believes the MOMnibus 3.0 Act would have changed her birth story, with doctors who would not have dismissed her as being over-dramatic or “just another Black woman exaggerating her pain levels.”
The legislation would direct the NC Department of Health and Human Services to establish and operate a maternal mortality prevention grant initiative that would establish or expand programs for the prevention of maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity among Black women.
  Rep. Zack Hawkins (D-Durham) (Photo: ncleg.gov)
“It’s time for us to provide Black mothers with more confidence in their care before, during, and after childbirth,” said Watkins.
The legislation would also require NCDHHS, in collaboration with community-based organizations led by Black women and a historically Black college and universities (HBCUs) that primarily serves minority populations to create evidence-based implicit bias training program for health care professionals.
Patients receiving care at a perinatal care facility would also receive a list of their rights including being informed of continuing health care requirements following discharge.
The bill would also earmark $3 million for each year of the 2025-27 biennium for the UNC Board of Governors for recruiting, training, and retaining a diverse workforce of lactation consultants in North Carolina.
Reps. Zack Hawkins (D-Durham) and Julie von Haefen (D-Wake) are advocating for HB 725, the companion bill in the state House.
Hawkins said his two sisters and his wife had their own stories in which doctors were not “listening appropriately” to their pain, and the fact that they knew their own bodies.
Von Haefen said while it may not seem like her place to speak on Black health, she also knew she could not turn away.
“This should not be something that’s put solely on Black women. White women need to be allies in this fight, because we are all mothers.”
In North Carolina Black women are 1.8 times more likely to die from childbirth, two-thirds of these deaths are preventable, according to Murdock.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/black-maternal-health2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-21 12:24:47.407380

She said she is against many of the initiatives President Donald Trump’s administration is carrying out in its first months of work, such as cuts to the Social Security Administration and proposed cuts to Medicaid.
“I’m glad people are coming out and protesting,” Jochim said. 
Sharon Korsmo of Bismarck said a person’s “day in court” is fundamental and expressed concerns about the Trump administration’s deportations of hundreds of people to an El Salvador prison without the chance to challenge their cases in court. 
“How do we know who he’s going to turn on next?” Korsmo said.
Kori Holub, an occupational therapist in Dickinson, said she’s already noticing the children with disabilities she treats on the Medicaid program are unable to get “medical necessity” services at their homes based on her recommendations.

Holub also volunteers with the National Disabled Veterans Winter Sports Clinic, which helps veterans with traumatic brain injuries, spinal cord injuries and other injuries participate in adaptive sports. 
During the clinic over the winter, Holub said some Department of Veterans Affairs employees received notices for layoffs, which worried her because those federal workers are a large part of the program.

(Photo by Jackie Llanos/Florida Phoenix)House Democratic Leader Fentrice Driskell said Monday the DeSantis administration needs to answer for the arrest last week of Juan Carlos Lopez-Gomez, a U.S. citizen, under a suspended immigration law.
During a press conference Monday, Driskell highlighted Florida Highway Patrol’s arrest of Lopez-Gomez on Wednesday, when he was a passenger in a car during a traffic stop on his way to work from Cairo, Georgia, to Tallahassee. The 20-year-old, born in Georgia, was charged under a temporarily suspended law making it a first-degree misdemeanor to illegally enter the state as an “unauthorized alien.”

The case garnered national attention following Florida Phoenix’s reporting on Thursday. Lopez-Gomez was released from jail Thursday evening, but U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is in custody of the driver of the car, who doesn’t enjoy legal permanent status, in a Broward County transitional center.
“We are a nation of laws, and no one — not Ron DeSantis, not Donald Trump — no one gets to decide to imprison people without cause,” Driskell said. “We need better answers about this. Ron DeSantis and his administration need to answer for this unlawful arrest, and for the pain and suffering they caused, and the fear that they continue to stoke throughout our communities.”
Attorney general tells law enforcement to stand down
Although Attorney General James Uthmeier argues that the federal prohibition on enforcement of the law, SB 4C, doesn’t apply to law enforcement, he sent a memo Friday to FHP, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, police chiefs, and sheriffs stating that they shouldn’t arrest or detain anyone under the suspended law.
“I should also note that while my office represents the current defendants named in this case, it does not represent nonparties like your law enforcement agencies,” Uthmeier wrote in the memo.
The new attorney general, who used to be Gov. DeSantis’ chief of staff, said the state would continue this argument in the federal court for the Southern District of Florida or an appellate court.
His memo came at the direction of U.S. District Court Judge Kathleen Williams on Friday, when she extended the bar on enforcement until the next hearing on April 29.
The judge had barred enforcement of the law on April 4, a little over a month after DeSantis signed it, and she expressed frustration during the Friday hearing in Miami about Lopez-Gomez’s arrest.
Immigrant advocacy groups, Florida Immigrant Coalition and Farmworker Association of Florida Inc., and two women without permanent legal status are suing Uthmeier, the statewide prosecutor, and state attorneys over the constitutionality of the law.
“We appreciate that the federal courts have seen through this blatantly unconstitutional law, but the reality is that, without enforcement, it seems that local law enforcement and Florida Highway Patrol are continuing to ignore the judge and order,” said Miriam Fahsi Haskell, an attorney for Community Justice Project representing the plaintiffs, in a phone interview with the Phoenix Friday. “The reality is that once a person is arrested under SB 4C and booked into jail, that person risks then having an ICE hold on them.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-21 15:26:33+00:00,CT Mirror,Lawmakers to offer CT budget that pushes back on ‘fiscal guardrails’,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/21/ct-budget-fiscal-guardrails-pushback/,"State legislators will propose their budget Tuesday, using every loophole and maneuver available to bend budget caps without breaking them.","Though potentially massive cuts in federal aid loom, Connecticut’s General Assembly can’t tackle that crisis until it first solves another.
State budget caps that amassed huge surpluses since 2017 have taken a heavy toll, leaving big challenges for funding education, health care and social services. 
The legislature’s Appropriations Committee will begin trying to plug those gaps Tuesday when it proposes a spending plan for the next two fiscal years. That blueprint will set the stage for final budget negotiations with Gov. Ned Lamont later this spring or summer as the picture from Washington becomes clearer.
In the meantime, state legislators will use every loophole and maneuver available to bend these budget caps — or “fiscal guardrails” — without breaking them.

The committee will assume raises for most state employees, due this July 1, won’t be negotiated on time.


Legislators will propose reforming one “guardrail” immediately — moving about $300 million earmarked to reduce pension debt back into the General Fund this fiscal year.


As Lamont did, the panel will endorse creating a big, new off-budget account to expand child care services while circumventing a spending cap that keeps budget growth in line with household income and inflation.


It also will follow Lamont’s lead and under-fund guaranteed health benefits for retired state employees by almost $230 million.

Even with these maneuvers, the committee’s spending plan will postpone — yet again — a major increase in Medicaid rates for physicians who treat the poor. The last broad-based rate adjustment plan took effect in early 2008, and critics say many children and adults enrolled in Connecticut’s HUSKY program effectively are uninsured, unable to find doctors willing to accept more Medicaid patients.
But the committee plan will maintain enhanced funding for special education while reversing planned cuts to basic grants for about 80 K-12 school districts.
“We need to stop looking at the storm down in Washington and look at the storm that’s here in Connecticut,” said Rep. Toni E. Walker, D-New Haven, co-chair of the Appropriations Committee. 
“There are a lot of things that need to be addressed,” said Sen. Cathy Osten, D-Sprague, the panel’s other co-chair, who added the panel tried to stabilize those programs most at risk before expected federal cuts blast big new holes in numerous state programs.
“I’m not a hair-on-fire kind of person. I’m not exaggerating anything,” she added. “But the things that are being cut at the federal level are going to have a big impact on the people.”
With Congress aiming to slash federal spending by $880 billion per year, state officials project losses in Medicaid funds alone could range from almost $200 million to about $1 billion. And that doesn’t include anticipated losses in special education, public health and addiction services, and federal aid to Connecticut municipalities.
But state programs already have been forfeiting big dollars for nearly a decade.
‘Fiscal guardrails’ have taken a toll
Connecticut has closed the past seven fiscal years with an average of $1.8 billion left over — a whopping total equal to roughly 8% of the General Fund and far more than legislators from both parties envisioned in 2017 when they enacted a broad array of budget caps.
Lamont’s administration projects Connecticut will close the current fiscal year — its eighth under the so-called “fiscal guardrails” system — with a similar, $1.8 billion cushion.
Those windfalls don’t mean state government can spare all those funds.
Critics say the “guardrails” system falsely characterizes hundreds of millions of dollars in annual income and business tax receipts as too “volatile” — meaning they fluctuate too much from year to year and shouldn’t be spent on ongoing problems. Instead, these revenues, which have been used to build reserves and whittle down pension debt, have grown steadily.
The leaching of resources from education, health care and social services has been mitigated somewhat by the nearly $3 billion Congress gave Connecticut in 2021 to repair damage caused by COVID. Lamont and the General Assembly have been doling out chunks of these pandemic grants, including more than $500 million this fiscal year, to these core programs. 
But nearly all that relief has been exhausted. 
While Democrats in the legislature’s majority have been vocal critics of the caps, they aren’t the only ones who’ve struggled to follow them.
Lamont, a fiscally moderate Democrat who praised the caps repeatedly, conceded in February that the program for saving “volatile” revenues should be scaled back. He proposed moving about $300 million annually, starting next year, from the save category into safe-to-spend.
While Republicans insist the “guardrails” be left untouched, their votes haven’t matched their statements.
The GOP voted overwhelmingly with Democrats in late February to order an extra $40 million in aid to local K-12 districts to mitigate a crisis in special education — despite warnings from Lamont that expenditures already were on pace to exceed the spending cap.
Panel finds more for K-12 education, social services, child care
The Appropriations Committee wants to continue that extra $40 million in special education grants in each of the next two fiscal years. Lamont’s budget included the extra funding, but not until 2026-27. 
That’s because the governor’s biennial plan, which appropriates $27 billion across all programs in the first year, falls a razor-thin $1.8 million under the spending cap. The $28.2 billion proposed for 2026-27 falls a more comfortable $261 million under the limit.
The committee’s plan will recommend more spending than Lamont did in some other areas:

Education Cost Sharing [ECS] grants, the main state funding program for K-12 district expenses, would gain another $8.7 million in the first year and $17 million in the second so that no community would receive a cut in funding. The existing ECS formula calls for about 80 communities to receive less in the next budget cycle.


The private, nonprofit community agencies that deliver the bulk of state-sponsored social services for people with developmental disabilities would gain $19 million to replace expiring pandemic grant dollars Lamont and lawmakers gave them last spring.

The committee would follow Lamont’s lead and create a new $300 million account, outside of the formal budget and spending cap, to allow investments in child care services for years to come.
Lamont’s budget spokesman, Chris Collibee said only that the administration “will review the General Assembly’s budget proposal when it is officially released and then work with legislative leaders on an honestly balanced budget that complies with all legal requirements.”
Rep. Tammy Nuccio of Tolland, ranking House Republican, predicted GOP lawmakers would fight the committee proposal, which she said places too much emphasis on working around budget caps and not enough on finding ways to trim state spending.
“They’re putting in a budget that’s expanding the size of government” at the wrong time, she said.
Struggling to find dollars for Medicaid rates, retiree health care
The committee plan will not fix two other problems legislators are facing — at least not right away.
The first involves financing a major upgrade in Medicaid rates paid to doctors and other providers. A 2019 analysis by KFF, the health care think-tank formerly known as Kaiser Family Foundation, found that Connecticut’s Medicaid rates for most specialists ranked 42nd among all states, just ahead of West Virginia.
Earlier this year, Democratic legislators announced a plan to boost spending on Medicaid rates by $300 million by 2028-29, starting with a $75 million jump next fiscal year.
Instead, the Appropriations Committee spending plan hew closely to the increased spending Lamont proposed in February: adding about $10 million next fiscal year and $25 million in 2026-27 for a much more modest, incremental bump.
The second major problem involves funding for retiree health care.
Comptroller Sean Scanlon recommended that the committee find another $228 million over the next budget cycle — in addition to what Lamont proposed — to cover this contractual obligation. The comptroller made a similar recommendation to the Lamont administration in December, but the governor didn’t add the money into his February budget plan.
Scanlon said he is very hopeful those cost hikes can be reduced somewhat in the coming months. The comptroller is soliciting bids for a new Medicare Advantage provider, directing patients to lower-cost care sites and providers and negotiating savings on prescription drugs.
Like Lamont did, the committee also will wait to see how much savings the comptroller can secure before scrambling to find more dollars for this retirement benefit.
Thousands of state employees may be waiting a while for a raise
The committee plan also has no room under the spending cap to pay raises to most state workers next fiscal year, even though their contracts expire June 30.
Connecticut did reach a tentative deal recently with a small unit representing part-time teachers at online Charter Oak State College. And a raise agreement is expected soon with the state police troopers.
But Lamont has announced no wage agreement with the State Employees Bargaining Agent Coalition, which represents every major union excluding the troopers.
SEBAC unions have received about 4.5% annual raises — a 2.5% general hike and a step increase that normally is worth another 2 percentage points — for the past four fiscal years. According to nonpartisan analysts, this year’s raises cost the General Fund about $120 million.
Anticipating similar raises going forward, Lamont in February proposed adding $129 million to the reserve for salary adjustments in the 2025-26 fiscal year, and $242 million extra in 2026-27.
But if the governor and SEBAC don’t deliver a tentative deal to lawmakers before the regular session ends June 4, then the prospects of raises being approved on time are slim. 
That doesn’t mean workers would forfeit raises. A pay hike eventually ordered for 2025-26 might be delivered late — as has been done on occasion in the past.
In other words, legislators could budget nothing for raises in 2025-26, carving out $129 million in spending cap room in the fiscal year they need it most, and deliver retroactive raises in 2026-27, when the cap doesn’t fit so snugly. It just requires Lamont and the unions to take their time reaching a deal.
“Everybody has indicated to me it will not happen this year,” Osten said. 
Lamont’s budget spokesman, Chris Collibee, declined to comment on the timing of contract negotiations, as did Drew Stoner, spokesman for the coalition of unions.
Stoner added, though, that “what remains clear is the vital role our public services — and the 45,000 state workers who keep Connecticut running. With agencies across the state understaffed and federal uncertainty growing, we must do everything we can to recruit and retain the workforce needed to meet this moment. The public deserves nothing less.”
Speeding up reform of budget ‘guardrails’
Recognizing their plan has some holes, Appropriations Committee members also will try to carve out some extra dollars that could be tapped later.
While Lamont proposed scaling back one mandatory savings program by $300 million starting next fiscal year, the committee will propose that change happen right away. That would allow legislators, if necessary, to take $300 million of this fiscal year’s surplus, transfer those dollars to either of the next two fiscal years, and spend them on core programs at that time.
“I think the most important thing Connecticut can do is adopt a budget on time, fund the core things we wanted to fund, … and give people predictability,” said House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, who said top legislative leaders also are backing the committee’s proposal to begin “guardrails” reform right away.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/DSC05379.jpg,,,2025-04-21 12:24:47.407380

One reason is that state programs aren’t always called “Medicaid.” Many states have rebranded their programs with consumer-friendly names such as SoonerCare in Oklahoma, Apple Health in Washington, Medi-Cal in California or TennCare in Tennessee.
And nearly all states now use private insurance companies such as UnitedHealth or Blue Cross Blue Shield to run their Medicaid programs. That means Medicaid enrollees may hold an insurance card and paperwork with the name of a commercial insurance company.
“We toss around terms like ‘Medicaid,’ but we see so many of our patients not having [insurance cards or] anything that describes or uses the word ‘Medicaid,’” said Dr. Adam Brown, a Washington, D.C.-based emergency physician and founder of a health care strategy firm.
“People oftentimes do not realize either that they have it, or know the value of what it does.”

Medicaid is the health insurance program for people with low incomes or certain disabilities. About 72 million people, or about a fifth of all the people living in the United States, are enrolled. It operates with state and federal funding, but every state has the freedom to choose how to run its program, within federal rules.
As a result, Medicaid is a sprawling patchwork of programs that can confuse lawmakers and even top health officials, not to mention the average beneficiary. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., now secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, incorrectly described basic elements of Medicaid and seemed to confuse it with Medicare during his January confirmation hearing before Congress.
Republicans in Congress are considering proposals to slash hundreds of billions of dollars from federal Medicaid funding as they look to offset trillions in tax cuts proposed by President Donald Trump. The specifics of the Medicaid cuts are still being hammered out. But any reductions to federal Medicaid spending would shift those costs to states, which would likely be forced to end services or cut coverage for certain groups of people.
“Part of the problem is when we hear people talk on television or hear lawmakers talk, there are many people that don’t make the connection that they themselves are on [Medicaid] or that their hospital is very much dependent upon the dollars that come from Medicaid,” said Brown.
“Calling it one thing and branding it something very different, that makes it challenging for people to understand the connection or the value in the product that they actually have.”
About 3 in 4 people who have Medicaid are enrolled in managed care organizations (MCOs), according to the latest national data. Most of these are private plans operated by companies such as UnitedHealth Group and Centene. But the branding from these companies can distance recipients from the fact that their care is paid for with public funds.
When Brown worked in emergency medicine, he had many patients who had insurance through Medicaid.
“There were times they would show me their card and it would have commercial branding, like a Blue Cross Blue Shield,” he said. But as they talked, “I noticed there was a lack of understanding that they were on a Medicaid-supported or state/federal-supported program.”
Millions of people who are enrolled in Medicaid mistakenly believe they’re uninsured, Dr. Ben Sommers, a Harvard health economist and physician, told Stateline.
“It is a long-standing issue that got worse during the pandemic,” he said.
He and fellow researchers found that the gap between the number of people who have Medicaid and the number who think they have it jumped during the pandemic, to about 18.5 million people. This was due to a lack of public understanding about a COVID-era rule that granted continuous Medicaid coverage to people without requiring them to re-enroll, researchers found.
Sommers expects the gap will eventually return to pre-pandemic levels, or nearly 6 million people.
“That’s still a lot of people who don’t think they’re in Medicaid but who are,” he said.
There are also some uninsured people who enroll in Medicaid when they show up at an emergency room or clinic needing care. Most providers will check for Medicaid eligibility if a person doesn’t have another form of insurance. People who become Medicaid beneficiaries that way may not realize it’s Medicaid paying for their care, Sommers said.
 Public debate

Physicians, public health experts and advocates worry that the confusion over Medicaid is affecting public debate over funding cuts.
From a public health perspective, Sommers said, “It’s not a huge problem if people think they have one type of insurance and misclassify it, as long as they’re getting care.
“Politically, it can be tricky if people don’t recognize they have Medicaid and they’re trying to weigh in on policies that affect Medicaid.”
Conservatives have long argued for reducing the reach of Medicaid. They say the program is too expensive and that its expansion under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, diverts too much money toward able-bodied adults and away from the more vulnerable populations it was originally intended to help.
But despite the controversy surrounding Medicaid, the program is extremely popular. More than 3 in 4 people view Medicaid favorably, including nearly two-thirds of Republicans, according to a January tracking poll from KFF.
In focus groups conducted in January by KFF, no Trump voters and few Harris voters said they were aware of proposals to cut federal Medicaid dollars, and some Trump voters said they didn’t think Trump would follow through on the cuts.
 Making the connection

Brown said that despite confusion, most Medicaid patients he encountered were aware their insurance came through a government program.
But he said it can still be hard for people — including those with private insurance — to make the connection between Medicaid funding cuts and their local hospitals or other services.
“We oftentimes frame this [debate over Medicaid funding cuts] as ‘People will lose their health insurance,’ and that is true,” Brown said. But “the constituencies affected are not just the people who have Medicaid.”
Less funding for Medicaid, or an increase in the number of people without insurance, would harm people with any kind of insurance, he said. It could lead to longer wait times at hospitals, fewer services offered and, in some cases, hospital closures.
“One of the important parts about democracy is people being educated about what their representatives are voting for or against, and also how to advocate for yourself,” Brown said. “If you don’t fundamentally understand or fully grasp the benefits you have, then it’s harder to advocate.”

California is making progress in curbing fentanyl-related deaths, but opioid overdoses continue to kill thousands of people every year.


Any Californian can purchase naloxone, an opioid overdose reversal medication, directly from the state at a discounted price, Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office announced Monday. 
The medication is available online for $24 for a two-pack of the nasal spray, roughly half the market price of the drug. Previously, the discount was available only to government organizations and businesses. 
“Life-saving medications shouldn’t come with a life-altering price tag. CalRx is about making essential drugs like naloxone affordable and accessible for all — not the privileged few,” Newsom said in a statement. CalRx is a Newsom initiative to bring down the cost of prescription drugs. 
California has spent more than $1 billion fighting the opioid epidemic, which killed more than 8,900 people last year, according to preliminary data from the state health department. That represents a 13% increase in deaths from 2023. 
The Naloxone Distribution Project and Access Initiative is part of the strategy to stop overdoses, which began spiking in 2019 as fentanyl, a highly potent synthetic opioid, infused the market. The rate of fentanyl-related overdose deaths began declining last year, according to state data.
More than 6 million naloxone kits have been distributed to local governments and organizations since 2018, according to state data. About 355,000 overdoses have been reversed.
In 2024, Newsom’s office announced a new supplier for the state initiative, Amneal Pharmaceuticals, which agreed to sell the steeply discounted drug to California. Days prior, Attorney General Rob Bonta announced a $273-million multistate settlement with the New Jersey-based company over its alleged failure to report suspicious opioid orders that contributed to the country’s epidemic.
“By getting this lower price, we are making the financial savings and able to use our dollars to buy more product, which of course is ultimately very much about saving lives,” said Elizabeth Landsberg, director of the Department of Health Care Access and Information, last year. 
Naloxone is one of two current efforts by the state to make generic drugs more affordable under Newsom’s effort to lower the costs of pharmaceuticals. California has a $50-million contract to manufacture generic insulins for CalRx. That project is more than a year behind schedule.

The disparate events ranged from a march through midtown Manhattan and a rally in front of the White House to a demonstration at a Massachusetts commemoration of “the shot heard ’round the world” on April 19, 1775, marking the start of the Revolutionary War 250 years ago.
Thomas Bassford was among the demonstrators at the reenactment of the Battles of Lexington and Concord outside Boston. The 80-year-old retired mason from Maine said he believes Americans are under attack from their own government and need to stand up against it.
“This is a very perilous time in America for liberty,” said Bassford, who was with his partner, daughter and two grandsons. “I wanted the boys to learn about the origins of this country and that sometimes we have to fight for freedom.”
In Denver, hundreds of protesters gathered at the Colorado State Capitol with banners expressing solidarity with immigrants and telling the Trump administration: “Hands Off!” People waved U.S. flags, some of them held upside down to signal distress.
Thousands of people also marched through downtown Portland, Oregon, while in San Francisco, hundreds spelled out the words “Impeach & Remove” on a sandy beach along the Pacific Ocean, also with an inverted U.S. flag. People walked through downtown Anchorage, Alaska, with handmade signs listing reasons why they were demonstrating, including one that one that read: “No sign is BIG enough to list ALL of the reasons I’m here!”
Elsewhere protests were planned outside Tesla car dealerships against billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk and his role in downsizing the federal government. Others organized more community service-oriented events such as food drives, teach-ins and volunteering at local shelters.
The protests come just two weeks after similar nationwide demonstrations.
Organizers say they oppose what they call Trump’s civil rights violations and constitutional violations, including efforts to deport scores of immigrants and to scale back the federal government by firing thousands of government workers and effectively shuttering entire agencies.
Some of the events drew on the spirit of the Revolutionary War, calling for “no kings” and resistance to tyranny.
In Anchorage, a colonial reenactor in colonial garb held up a “No Kings” sign while the person next to him hoisted cardboard that read in part: “The Feudal Age is OVER.”
Boston resident George Bryant, who was among those at the Concord protest, said he is concerned that the president is creating a “police state.” He held a sign saying, “Trump fascist regime must go now!”
“He’s defying the courts. He’s kidnapping students. He’s eviscerating the checks and balances,” Bryant said. “This is fascism.”
In Washington, Bob Fasick, a 76-year-old retired federal employee from Springfield, Virginia, said he came out to the rally near the White House out of concern over threats to constitutionally protected due process rights, Social Security and other federal safety-net programs.
The Trump administration, among other things, has moved to shutter Social Security Administration field offices, cut funding for government health programs and scale back protections for transgender people.
“I cannot sit still knowing that if I don’t do anything and everybody doesn’t do something to change this, that the world that we collectively are leaving for the little children, for our neighbors is simply not one that I would want to live,” Fasick said.
In Columbia, South Carolina, several hundred people protested at the statehouse holding signs with slogans such as “Fight Fiercely, Harvard, Fight.”
And in Manhattan, protesters rallied against continued deportations of immigrants as they marched from the New York Public Library north toward Central Park and past Trump Tower.
“No fear, no hate, no ICE in our state,” they chanted to a steady drumbeat, referring to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
Marshall Green said he is most concerned that Trump invoked the wartime Alien Enemies Act of 1798 by claiming the country is at war with Venezuelan gangs linked to the South American nation’s government, even though a recent U.S. intelligence assessment found no coordination between them.
“Congress should be stepping up and saying no, we are not at war. You cannot use that,” said the 61-year-old from Morristown, New Jersey. “You cannot deport people without due process, and everyone in this country has the right to due process no matter what.”
Meanwhile Melinda Charles, of Connecticut, said she worries about “executive overreach,” citing clashes with the federal courts, Harvard University and other elite colleges.
“We’re supposed to have three equal branches of government,” she said, “and to have the executive branch become so strong, I mean it’s just unbelievable.”

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)Maine voters send our elected officials to Washington to solve problems — not make them worse. But Congress is moving forward with budget plans that would harm the health, stability, and well-being of Maine’s families, aging residents, and immigrant communities. Fortunately, Sens. Susan Collins and Angus King and our representatives have the opportunity to reject these dangerous proposals and fund real solutions.
The proposals being advanced by Congress would slash funding for healthcare and food assistance that Mainers rely on and funnel billions into expanding the Trump administration’s capacity to separate families and put immigrants in detention — severely compromising our communities’ health, safety, and stability.
As the oldest state in the country, Maine communities rely on Medicaid and a strong healthcare system to stay healthy. More than 350,700 Mainers rely on Medicaid, which faces billions in budget cuts under these proposals. These cuts could cause devastating damage to our healthcare economy. Community health centers — serving 204,000 patients at 174 clinics across the state — would likely have to close their doors, costing over 2,200 jobs.
Our families also depend on food assistance, but the current budget proposals threaten to take it away. On top of the USDA cuts that pull food from the shelves of distributors like Good Shepherd Food Bank, Congress’s proposals would sharply cut Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) funding, which feeds over 172,200 — or one in eight — Maine residents. 
While these budget plans make devastating cuts to programs that Maine’s young and old depend on, they authorize Congress to allocate billions to separate families and uproot workers who call Maine home.  
Immigrants are integral members of our state’s communities, but Congress’s budget proposals include up to $350 billion — potentially up to a half-trillion — to drastically expand the Trump administration’s ability to detain and deport our immigrant neighbors. The administration’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency recently put out a request for proposal for new detention centers — potential contracts totaling up to $45 billion. The funding to pay for them would come directly from taxpayers. 
The devastation from this inhumane investment would be felt most acutely by our families and economy. Over 20,500 children in Maine have at least one immigrant parent. As of 2023, nearly 53,450 immigrants live in Maine — and though they make up only 3.8% of the state’s population, immigrant workers account for nearly 5% of the state’s labor force, filling critical gaps as older generations retire. In 2023 alone, Maine’s immigrant residents paid $625.8 million in taxes, contributing to the Medicare, Social Security, and other programs that Mainers depend on.
Instead of taking taxpayers’ dollars away from healthcare and nutrition to fund family separation and tax breaks for the wealthy, Congress must invest in solutions that enhance the health, stability, and family unity of all Mainers. They should invest in less costly, more supportive services like legal representation that uphold the right to due process and help people navigate the immigration system without taking them away from their families, communities, and jobs. And they should maintain and support our nation’s longstanding investment in healthcare and food assistance.
The stakes for our communities couldn’t be higher, and the budget decisions made by Congress this spring will have long-lasting consequences. As Maine’s members of Congress move forward with their debates on budget reconciliation, we urge them to remember this: the health and stability of our communities is in your hands; we send you to Washington to solve problems and deliver solutions that give every Mainer a fair shot at building a safe, healthy, and meaningful life.

(Anna Kaminski/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas State Department of Education commissioner Randy Watson has an unobstructed view of financial, political and social battles about how best to educate nearly 500,000 school children in Kansas.
In addition to regular collaboration with members of the Kansas State Board of Education, he routinely visits classrooms to absorb perspectives on everything from the basics of reading and math to human sexuality, special education, summer school and the training of current and future teachers. He wades into issues of access to computer technology and cellphones in schools. He’s there for debates on appropriation of state and federal tax dollars to public education, as well as how that funding was deployed in more than 280 local school districts across Kansas.
“What makes me want to get up in the morning is trying to help young people and the people that serve those young people do their job well. There’s rarely a week that I’m not in schools,” Watson said on the Kansas Reflector podcast. “I not a politician, but I deal in a political environment all the time. At the end of the day, again, what gets me up is: How can we help people that educate kids have a great environment to do so?”


The state Board of Education has a constitutional responsibility for public education in Kansas and the duty to hire a state education commissioner to assist with crafting policy, rules and regulations aimed at fulfilling the promise of education in preschool to high school classrooms.
Watson, a former teacher and superintendent, recently recommended the state Board of Education and local school boards consider working together on a special summer school program to help the students in pre-kindergarten, kindergarten and grades 1 and 2 gain some academic ground in the subjects of reading and math. The COVID-19 pandemic set children back at all levels, he said, but recovery has been influenced by separate decisions to reduce the number of school days while maintaining the required total of annual hours of instruction.
“A lot of research says if you’re not at that grade level by the time you hit third grade, it’s really hard to catch up, and most do not,” he said. “In fact, more fall further behind.”
He said a summer program would be voluntary for students and could involve 90 minutes of instruction daily. Students could come together for four-day weeks and gain about 50 hours of instruction time, he said.
“If that was with one of our many great teachers in Kansas, what could we do? We could stop the summer slide for sure,” he said.
 
Public and private
Of course, the Kansas Legislature and the state’s governor have large roles in terms of funding and policy of public education. That involves politics and, at times, controversy.
Members of the 2025 Legislature attempted, but failed, to gain traction with a bill providing as much as $125 million in annual state funding in the form of state income tax breaks to families of students in private schools. Similar proposals to ease the financial burden of enrolling 26,000 students to accredited and unaccredited private schools have surfaced in Kansas, but those also met the fate of Senate Bill 75. The bill introduced by Republican Sen. Renee Erickson, a former middle school principal in Wichita, didn’t advance in the House or Senate.
“Some states have gone full force into that,” Watson said. “Other states have pulled back. Some states have put that up to a vote. I can tell you currently where the state board is on that. They believe that public funds should go to public education.”
Watson, too, observed as the Legislature placed in state law, despite Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly’s veto, contents of a bill that dealt on two objectives. Part of the bill granted the state Board of Education authority to set compensation of elected board members, while the balance mandated public schools that teach anything about human development to also present students with a computer-generated animation or high-definition ultrasound video of fetal development. The law says the presentation must last at least 3 minutes.
A battle between Kansans for Life and Planned Parenthood illustrated the core of the bill was about influencing opinions of school children on abortion rights, which were affirmed by the Kansas Supreme Court and by Kansas voters. Statehouse debate on the fetal development curriculum bill touched on the state Board of Education’s constitutional role in establishing educational standards and the responsibility of local school boards to determine precise curriculum.
“The state board was opposed to that bill. It had nothing to do with the content,” Watson said. “What is shown in a video is a local board decision, and the state board said, while we may or may not like the contents, that is a local decision, and we don’t think the Kansas Legislature should weigh in on it.”
In terms of compensation, the Legislature maneuvered to nearly double their own salaries on Jan. 1. The decision was made to decouple the state Board of Education from the Legislature in terms of daily compensation for travel costs and expenses tied to work for the state. Toward the end of the 2025 session, a bill surfaced with the human development curriculum mandate and a provision directing the state Board of Education to set its own compensation rate. It didn’t include funding to the state Board of Education to address any costs. The state Board of Education plans to take up the issue during a meeting in May.
“They’ll certainly have to do something with it, because the new law says you shall set your rate. So even if they set it where it is now, they’re going to have to take some action to do that,” Watson said.
 
Governor, president
In January, the governor proposed the Legislature pay the cost of meals for children enrolled in the state’s reduced-price school meal program. She suggested lawmakers allocate $5.5 million to provide free rather than subsidized meals to about 36,000 students statewide. With federal assistance, Kansas currently provides free meals to about 40% of students in public schools or approximately 200,000 youths.
Kelly’s idea was for the state to cover the reduced-meal cost for each child at 30 cents for breakfast and 40 cents for lunch.
“We can reduce childhood hunger, we can reduce the stigma our low-income students face in our school cafeterias, and we can increase academic success,” Kelly said.
Watson said the Republican-led Legislature didn’t buy into the governor’s idea for supplementing the cost of school meals for children in lower-income families.
“What Governor Kelly was proposing is putting some state money into that, but that was not adopted in this legislative session,” he said.
Watson also reflected on lessons learned through former President George W. Bush’s ambitious No Child Left Behind program from 2002 to 2015. It was designed to hold schools accountable for learning among all students, including subgroups of low-income students, students with disabilities and students of color. The objective was to have every student reach proficient levels in math and reading.
NCLB became controversial because it penalized schools that didn’t show annual improvement on standardized student tests. State assessments should be viewed as a measure of how students were doing academically instead of the lone metric of success or failure, Watson said.
“President Bush was thinking, we want kids to learn how to read and do math. It’s a great goal. It’s a noble goal. And I would applaud that,” Watson said. “When we put that into law, I don’t think he could have foreseen what the consequences were going to be if you were going to require that. What happened is that, at least in Kansas, I won’t speak to other states, but I think it’s pretty typical teachers said, ‘Well, then we won’t teach science. We won’t teach social studies. Oh, we’ll cut recess out. We teach to that test because it became so high stakes.’ ”
He said NCLB affirmed chasing student test scores just to obtain a mark acceptable to politicians shouldn’t be the primary focus of a classroom teacher, school principal, district superintendent or school board member.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/250418_watson-2-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-21 11:13:51.102508

(Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)In February, the Trump administration sent a letter to all state education departments with a broad message: diversity, equity, and inclusion programs in public schools must come to an end. Every public K-12 school and university must stop policies related to “diversity, equity, and inclusion,” or face a potential loss to their funding, the letter stated.
This month, a New Hampshire federal judge is grappling with whether to stop the government from enforcing the letter.
A group of organizations – the National Education Association, the National Education Association of New Hampshire, and the Center for Black Educator Development – have sued the U.S. Department of Education in the U.S. District Court of New Hampshire to block enforcement of the letter. The suit is being litigated by the American Civil Liberties Union’s Racial Justice Program and the American Civil Liberties Union of New Hampshire.
On Thursday, Judge Landya McCafferty presided over oral arguments in the lawsuit. She’s weighing whether to issue a preliminary injunction.
The requirement is not immediate; after an extension agreed to earlier this month, state education agencies have until April 24 to certify that the state’s schools have agreed to the conditions in the letter. But plaintiffs are hoping McCafferty issues the injunction sometime this week to halt enforcement before that deadline arrives.
Plaintiffs argue that because the letter threatens financial repercussions against school districts that allow for DEI programs, it could in turn force schools to drop support for NEA and CBED teacher diversity programs. And the NEA says the vagueness of the letter will push its teacher members to take defensive measures and avoid teaching certain topics if they think there will be professional consequences for doing so.
But the government says plaintiffs are overreacting to the letter, which they say simply warns school districts not to fall afoul of Title VI, a federal statute that prevents discrimination in public programs based on race or national origin, and promises investigations and potential withholding of federal funding for those districts that do.
The letter that kicked off the dispute, known as a “dear colleague letter,” presents a stark portrait of public schools.
“Educational institutions have toxically indoctrinated students with the false premise that the United States is built upon ‘systemic and structural racism’ and advanced discriminatory policies and practices,” the letter reads. “Proponents of these discriminatory practices have attempted to further justify them — particularly during the last four years — under the banner of ‘diversity, equity, and inclusion’…”
The letter relies on Students for Fair Admissions Inc v. President and Fellows of Harvard College, a landmark 2023 U.S. Supreme Court decision in which the court held that the race-based admissions policies at Harvard and the University of North Carolina had violated the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment.
And it says the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights would “vigorously enforce the law” and that institutions that failed to comply with federal law may “face potential loss of federal funding.”
“The Department will no longer tolerate the overt and covert racial discrimination that has become widespread in this Nation’s educational institutions. The law is clear: treating students differently on the basis of race to achieve nebulous goals such as diversity, racial balancing, social justice, or equity is illegal under controlling Supreme Court precedent.”
To the U.S. Department of Justice, the letter is not an official agency rule; rather, it is an interpretive guidance. That means it can’t be struck down by a court the way a rule can, they argued.
Abhishek Kambli, a U.S. deputy associate attorney general who traveled to Concord to argue the case Thursday, said the letter is simply articulating existing law preventing school districts from classifying students according to their race. Kambli pointed to the Students for Fair Admissions decision, and said the dear colleague letter is simply trying to stop K-12 schools from that kind of discrimination, Kambli told the court Thursday. Already, U.S. case law has established that schools should not make distinctions on the basis of race or other characteristics except in rare circumstances, Kambli argued. And he said those circumstances must face a legal test of strict scrutiny to pass.
The plaintiff’s hardship, Kambli said, “is due to self-censorship based on a misunderstanding of what the dear colleague letter says.”
Kambli added that the government does not claim diversity, equity, and inclusion itself is illegal; rather, it claims that schools that are already breaking the law by classifying students by race should not use the concept of DEI as an excuse to do so.
And he said despite the colorful language in the letter, any decision by the federal government to withhold funding to a school could come only after an investigation, and would include the possibility of an appeal. “It’s a lengthy process,” he said.
But plaintiffs say the government’s characterization understates the impact and scope of the letter.
The letter creates the possibility of consequences for teachers because of its threat to punish school districts, who directly employ those teachers, Sarah Hinger, deputy director of the ACLU’s Racial Justice Program argued Thursday. And she said the letter contains pronouncements that are hard for teachers to apply to their instruction.
“Every day, today, tomorrow, they go to work and they are tasked with following the dear colleague letter, along with all their other obligations,” Hinger said. “They are chilled now in their ability to speak… They are uncertain of what practices they can engage in.”
Hinger also pointed to the Trump administration’s swift move to withhold funding from Columbia University and Harvard University, suggesting that the administration could move quickly to block funding to public schools if it decides to.
“The chill from that is happening now, and plaintiffs are not required to wait until they are hauled into court in order to challenge an unconstitutional law,” she said. McCafferty appeared sympathetic to plaintiffs, asking Kambli questions about how teachers could cover periods of American history like Reconstruction or the Jim Crow South without worrying they were improperly teaching that America has structural racism.
The case bears similarity to another lawsuit alleging that New Hampshire’s 2021 “banned concepts” law prohibiting public school teachers from advocating for certain topics around race and gender is unconstitutional. In 2024, the U.S. District Court of New Hampshire agreed with plaintiffs and struck that law down; the decision is currently being appealed in the First Circuit Court of Appeals.
But Kambli said those lawsuits were different because they involved state laws that directly affected teachers. The dear colleague letter should not have a direct effect on the topics that can be taught, he argued.
“It goes toward how they treat students,” he said. “It doesn’t go toward what they teach.”
And Kambli argued the suing organizations are not linked directly to the Department of Education’s enforcement action, and lack standing to bring a case in the first place.
Lawyers for the ACLU are attempting to add a handful of New Hampshire school districts as parties to the case, in order to make additional arguments about how the letter would unfairly affect them. But the government argued it needs more time to file a motion countering those arguments, and McCafferty has not yet approved the districts’ inclusion to the case.
For now, the parties are expecting McCafferty to issue a ruling on the injunction before this Thursday. Lawyers for the government asked her to issue a narrow injunction that affects only the named plaintiffs if she must issue one; lawyers for the plaintiffs urged a nationwide injunction.
Under the agreement, any New Hampshire school district that signs a letter certifying that they will comply with the letter will not be bound to that letter until April 24, meaning that if the court enjoins the letter before then, the district will not be subject to it. As of last week, 165 New Hampshire school districts have signed on, according to the Department of Education’s website.
Maine’s Department of Education has asked districts to refrain from signing on to the guidance while the state issues a response, according to Ed Week.
At a press conference after the hearing, Hinger said she hopes McCafferty will act quickly.
“I think that the government has shown a track record of avoiding and ignoring careful due process, moving swiftly against institutions and using the full power of its authority against individuals in the education sector and beyond,” she said.

Tariffs meant to encourage U.S. manufacturing could have the opposite effect because many materials are imported from China. (Courtesy of Sumuri LLC)Steve Whalen loves his home state of Delaware and he’s proud to manufacture computers there that police officers use to “catch bad guys.” He said tariffs on imports from China and other countries, along with sharp cuts to government spending and the winding down of a program for small manufacturers, will make it harder for him to do that.
“We got into business to keep costs low for the ‘good guys,’ but tariffs or anything else that raises prices keeps us from doing that,” said Whalen, co-founder of Sumuri LLC in Magnolia, Delaware, which makes computer workstations for police and government investigations. Whalen has to buy materials overseas, often from China, and he said the tariffs could force him to triple his price on some workstations to $12,000.
Tariffs are the main tool President Donald Trump is wielding to try to boost manufacturing in the United States, calling the achievement of that goal “an economic and national security priority.” But the higher levies have led to retaliation and suspended shipments, and Whalen said they are just one of several Trump administration actions squeezing his small manufacturing business.
The wave of federal spending cuts, which has affected grants to state and local governments, could make his customers put off purchases. And the administration has moved to cut off funding for a $175 million state-based program that provides expert advice to smaller factories like his.

The Delaware version of that program, the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, helped Sumuri fit expanded product lines into the limited space in its small-town factory.
“We were really having a tough time trying to figure out how to utilize our space efficiently,” Whalen said. “They came here and helped us organize and optimize, and it made a huge difference.”
On April 1, the Trump administration cut off funding for 10 such manufacturing programs that were up for renewal in Delaware, Hawaii, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota and Wyoming. Other state MEP programs will expire over the next year.
The administration gave a reprieve to those 10 states until the end of the fiscal year after objections from Democrats in the U.S. House and Senate. The National Institute of Standards and Technology, which manages the program, extended funding for the 10 states “after further review and consideration” and will “continue to evaluate plans for the program,” said agency spokesperson Chad Boutin.
The program has come under fire from Republicans since the George W. Bush administration first tried to end it in 2009, and again during the first Trump administration, but Congress has continued to fund it. The conservative Heritage Foundation said in a 2023 book that MEP’s functions “would be more properly carried out by the private sector.”
‘Dots don’t quite connect’
Buckley Brinkman, executive director of the Wisconsin Center for Manufacturing and Productivity, which works with his state’s MEP program, said it didn’t make much sense for the administration to shutter the program as it seeks to boost the number of U.S. manufacturing jobs.
“It’s one of those things where the dots don’t quite connect,” Brinkman said. “I mean, jeez, here’s a part of government that doesn’t cost a whole lot, in the grand scheme of things — less than $200 million a year — that’s returning 10-to-1 to the national treasury, working on a priority for the president.”
A 2024 Upjohn report found an even higher return: 17-to-1 on $175 million in the 2023 fiscal year, creating $3 billion in new federal tax revenue.


In Wisconsin, which has lost more than 138,000 manufacturing jobs since 2000, some parts makers report that business is booming as manufacturers seek to avoid tariffs by finding U.S. alternatives to Chinese manufacturers, Brinkman said. But more broadly, he doubts that the tariffs will spark a manufacturing boom in the state.
“Do we want all this manufacturing back? Do we have the will to get it back? The answer to both those questions is ‘no,’” Brinkman said. “Even without the tariffs we don’t really want Americans doing a lot of those jobs that are in Chinese factories right now.”










I mean, jeez, here’s a part of government that doesn't cost a whole lot, in the grand scheme of things … that's returning 10-to-1 to the national treasury.


– Buckley Brinkman, Wisconsin Center for Manufacturing and Productivity director


In Delaware, the MEP helped Sumuri manage its expansion, but unpredictable tariffs and budgets are now a bigger danger, said Jason Roslewicz, Sumuri’s vice president of business development. He’s had to devote two employees to monitoring supply lines, tariff news and competitor pricing to stay afloat.
“We went from putting things together in a basement to a 19,000-square-foot facility, doing exactly what we’re supposed to do here in the U.S., and it’s all in danger of coming apart because of this problem,” Roslewicz said.
Other small manufacturers express similar concerns. TJ Semanchin, who owns Wonderstate Coffee in Madison, Wisconsin, said his business roasting and distributing coffee is in crisis because of the tariffs.
Wonderstate’s costs have almost doubled between tariffs on imported coffee and packaging materials from China, plus a cyclical rise in coffee prices. “I’m borrowing money to pay for this and at some point we’ll have to raise prices. We’ll have no choice,” Semanchin said.

But many Republican state officials, and even some Democrats, have backed Trump’s tariff push, including Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who credited the Trump administration with “reshoring manufacturing and restoring this middle class which has been eviscerated over the last 20 years.”
“There’s dislocation in the short term, there’s long-term opportunity,” Youngkin said in an April 15 interview on CNBC. He said his state is hearing more interest from manufacturers looking to build or expand local factories since Trump took office. For instance, Delta Star recently announced a plan to add 300 jobs building power transformers in Lynchburg.
“The president has been clear that there will be some level of tariffs, and folks are coming, and that’s good for Virginia,” Youngkin said in the CNBC interview.
Virginia’s MEP program, called Genedge, claims successes in streamlining production and quality control for local factory products including TreeDiaper, an automated tree watering device made in Ashland, and for advising EDM, a Lynchburg plastic product assembler that needed more efficient production to keep overseas competition at bay. But Virginia’s MEP is one of the state programs slated to expire in the next year.
Long-term trend
The slide in U.S. manufacturing jobs has continued on and off since 1979, and many experts say tariffs will not bring them back. Despite a modest bounce back under the Biden administration, the number of manufacturing jobs has declined from nearly 20 million in 1979 to less than 13 million today, even as the total U.S. workforce has grown from 89 million to 159 million during that period.

Manufacturing faces labor shortages, with many factories operating below capacity because they can’t find enough workers, according to Jason Miller, a professor of supply chain management at Michigan State University.
That doesn’t bode well for a mass reshoring of factories from China and other countries, but Miller doesn’t expect that to happen anyway.
“Firms are not planning on reshoring much of the work that was offshored 20 to 25 years ago,” Miller said. “I’m not concerned about having enough workers for manufacturing jobs that would be reshored because this isn’t going to happen.”
In a 2024 survey by the libertarian Cato Institute, 80% of Americans said America would be better off if more people worked in manufacturing, but only 25% said they personally would be better off working in a factory. The Chinese government has poked fun at the idea with memes of American workers struggling to make Nike sneakers with sewing machines.
Joseph McCartin, a labor historian at Georgetown University, said the idea of a manufacturing rebirth is a “mirage being conjured to attract the support of workers who have been underpaid in an increasingly unequal economy for the last 40 years, and are desperate for some hope of renewed upward mobility.”
Manufacturing “isn’t the magic wand to make that happen,” McCartin said.
“What we need is to raise workers’ wages and make the economy less prone to producing inequality,” McCartin said. “That mission is not at all what Trump is about. He is dealing in stale nostalgia.”

This week: what a drop in international tourism means for Minnesota; the most conservative and liberal workplaces; how trucks and SUVs drive road congestion; and meaningful jobs. 
International tourism takes a hit
The Washington Post reported last week that international tourism to the U.S. is plummeting at the start of the second Trump administration. In March, “overseas visitors fell nearly 12% compared with the same time last year, according to data from the International Trade Administration, an agency under the U.S. Department of Commerce,” the paper reports.
The reasons aren’t terribly complicated: Trump seems determined to turn the U.S. into a pariah state, with every day bringing new horror stories of travelers being detained, deported and refused admittance.
In 2023, more than 500,000 international tourists visited Minnesota, according to Explore Minnesota, spending a little over $500 million in the state. The agency had been forecasting 2025 would bring 700,000 international visitors and $700 million in spending, but that’s now unlikely.
More than half of Minnesota’s international tourists hail from Canada. The administration’s ongoing belligerence toward our northern neighbor has fueled a fierce backlash. Minnesota businesses relying on those visitors are likely to be especially hard hit. 
“I don’t want to pay into their economy, I’m going to stay in Winnipeg and go to local events here, put my money here,” one Winnipeg resident told a city newspaper. “And who knows what’ll happen? What if you get your car keyed? We don’t know how they’re going to treat Canadians going down,” she added.
Measuring workforce politics
Last month a team of researchers released a new dataset on the political affiliations of workers at hundreds of thousands of American employers. They did this by linking public voter registration data to online worker profiles maintained by many employers.
They found that workplaces in their sample tend to lean left, with more than 60% of employees identifying as a Democrat (for simplicity’s sake, independents and those not registered with one of the two major parties were excluded from this calculation). But some industries are much more conservative or liberal than others, and the same goes for individual workplaces.
At Target, for instance, fewer than 30% of identifiable employees are registered Republican. Privately owned agriculture behemoth Cargill, on the other hand, has close to a 60% Republican workforce.
“In the context of growing political polarization, employers are entering the political arena in unprecedented ways,” the authors write. “Given the potentially critical role that workers play in shaping these actions, it is critical to have wide-reaching, representative measures of workers’ personal politics.”
Trucks and SUVS are clogging up the roadways, study finds
MPR News reports on a recent study using Minnesota traffic data to analyze how the exploding popularity of trucks and sport-utility vehicles affects traffic flows on roadways.
Minnesota has some of the best traffic data in the United States, the authors note, with reliable numbers going back to the 1990s. That allows researchers to get a sense of how things have changed.
The study looked at the freeway network around Minneapolis and St. Paul, and found that “the average network throughput decreases from approximately 1850 vehicles per lane per hour in 1995 to about 1600 vehicles per lane per hour in 2019.” 
The authors attribute that to the growing popularity of small trucks and SUVs, which take up more space on the road.
“The number of vehicles it takes to reach a congested level of traffic is fewer, and so you’re more likely to see congestion for the same number of people traveling because people are in SUVs and vans and pickup trucks, but especially SUVs,” co-author David Levinson told MPR.
The study found that while the total number of registered vehicles in Minnesota grew by 36% from 1995 to 2019, the number of SUVs increased by more than 1,000%.
1 in 5 Americans say their job “is not making a meaningful contribution to the world”
A recent YouGov survey found that while most American workers say their job makes a difference, 20% told the pollster that their job is essentially meaningless.
People with so-called email jobs — sending and receiving emails and Slack messages and attending meetings — were actually more likely to characterize their jobs as meaningful, although this is probably a function of education: More educated people are also more likely to say their jobs mean something, and they’re also more likely to do email jobs.
Americans who think their own jobs are meaningless are also much more likely to take a dim view of the value of other people’s jobs.
Incidentally, workers in the U.K. are nearly twice as likely as those in the U.S. to say their jobs are meaningless.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2197666840.jpg,,,2025-04-21 11:13:51.102508

Dr. Jessica Lowe, a neurologist and epileptologist at Bayhealth, has been named the 2025 Delaware Woman of Impact by the American Heart Association (AHA) as part of its Go Red for Women initiative.
The recognition comes after a spirited nine-week campaign in which Lowe led a series of community-focused events and fundraising efforts aimed at fighting heart disease and stroke among women.
Lowe raised $88,000 in donations and earned additional “impact points” through educational and wellness initiatives, ranking fifth overall in the AHA’s Eastern States Region—an area that spans 11 states.
“It was important for me to participate in Woman of Impact because, as a physician, I see firsthand how cardiovascular disease affects women at every stage of life,” Lowe said. “I want to be part of the change that helps ensure women have the knowledge and tools they need to protect their health. I am honored to have received this recognition and am excited to continue working alongside the American Heart Association and its Go Red for Women initiative to help ensure all women know their risk factors and have the information they need to live longer, healthier lives.”

Her campaign included lectures on stroke and neurological health, a steps challenge, goat yoga, and digital outreach through her Instagram platform, @Doctorbrainbarbie.
“Thanks to the efforts of incredible leaders like Dr. Lowe and all of our nominees, we’re making strides to ensure all women in Delaware are seen, heard and counted when it comes to their health,” said Jim Murphy, executive director of the American Heart Association, Delaware. “Together, we have the power to help ensure more women are represented in research, have the information they need for heart health through every stage of life and receive quality and timely care. The power of our community coming together creates better health outcomes for all of us.”
Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death for women in the United States, taking the life of 1 in 3 women each year.
The Woman of Impact campaign, which launched on National Wear Red Day (February 7), is part of the AHA’s broader effort to raise awareness and improve health outcomes through its Go Red for Women movement.
Lowe was one of two Delaware-based nominees in the 2025 campaign.
The other nominee, Dr. Sarah Beebe, Simulation Lab Program Manager at Bayhealth, also contributed to community wellness efforts, including CPR training for over 500 people and multiple educational events.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screen-Shot-2025-04-21-at-10.03.11-AM.png,,,2025-04-21 11:13:51.102508

This would allow voters to vote on machines in the same way they would on election day, but with the flexibility to do so ahead of time.","Georgia is among the battleground states that since the 2020 presidential election has enacted new laws that could restrict voting access. (Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder)Pennsylvania voters have been given a raw deal when it comes to early voting options. As we head into another round of municipal elections, voters across the Commonwealth again face the dilemma of whether or not they should stand in long lines to cast their ballots early. Although the problem is worse in some counties than others, it is unacceptable anywhere.
Pennsylvania’s current no-excuse mail ballot system is a good idea on paper, but the long lines early voters face are due to the fact that many voters are filling out their mail ballots in person before they turn them in, likely because they want to ensure they are filled out correctly and will, therefore, be counted.
Therefore, in a state where nearly half of all counties don’t even have a ballot drop box, a strong, well-funded, and complementary-to-no-excuse-mail-ballots system that encourages early voting done in person is an absolute must.
Currently, our counties are not equipped to handle the volume of voters trying to cast their ballots before Election Day because our no-excuse mail ballot system isn’t designed for accessible in-person voting. We need more. The fact that voters are so eager to vote early is exactly why we need a modernized system that can meet this overwhelming demand.
Without the infrastructure in place for true early voting, not only do Pennsylvania voters have to suffer through long lines, but it also causes unnecessary stress on our election workers who already face enormous challenges. Election workers and voters deserve a process that is as efficient, safe, and accessible as possible—one that ensures every voter has a fair chance to have their voice heard.
The solution is obvious: Pennsylvania needs to establish an official system for in-person early voting. This would allow voters to vote on machines in the same way they would on election day, but with the flexibility to do so ahead of time.
To make this a reality, our election offices need to be fully funded and staffed to meet the demand. It’s not just a nice-to-have option; it’s a necessity to ensure that Pennsylvania’s election system actually works for voters and election workers – and that democracy includes all of us.
This is not some far-fetched idea, either. Pennsylvania leaders can look to nearby states that have provided a clear blueprint for success. In Michigan, where in-person early voting was implemented in time for last year’s general election, there was a marked increase in voter turnout before Election Day.
  Voting booths set up at Madison, Wisconsin’s Hawthorne Library on Election Day 2022. (Henry Redman/Wisconsin Examiner)
According to a recent data analysis released by my organization, All Voting is Local, more than 58 percent of Michigan voters cast their ballots before Election Day in 2024. Meanwhile, in Pennsylvania, only 27 percent of voters cast their ballots early.
This difference is not just a statistic. It’s a sign that having a statewide plan works when it comes to early voting. In Michigan, the establishment of early voting polling locations allowed voters to cast their ballots ahead of time and reduced long lines on Election Day itself.
This increase in early voting turnout wasn’t limited to one political party or one region—it was a broad, statewide trend. When early voting options are made accessible, voters from all walks of life take advantage of them, because let’s not mince words: long lines are a form of suppression that can deter voters from casting their ballots.
Pennsylvania voters want more voting options, a fact that was made crystal clear in November as they stood in hours-long lines both before and on Election Day. They want to be able to cast their ballots securely without having to wait in line for hours. Most importantly, they want a system that ensures they have a voice in their own democracy.
Without in-person early voting, the voters most impacted will be parents, students, and all working-class folks who often don’t have time to wait in voting lines. Although the lack of in-person early voting disproportionately affects these voters, it’s an issue that impacts all voters. The problem needs to be addressed before voters find themselves standing in long lines again.
Fortunately, we know what the solution is to the problem. This is where Pennsylvania legislators have an opportunity. The window to make meaningful changes to our election code is now. By implementing in-person early voting, Pennsylvania can not only ensure greater voter turnout but also ensure that all voters—regardless of their background—have a fair shot at participating in our democracy. We’ve seen it work elsewhere, and we know it can work here.
Without this change, Pennsylvania voters will continue to face long lines and frustration at the polls. Our election officials will continue to struggle with an outdated system that isn’t equipped to meet the needs of today’s electorate. Without immediate action, we will fail to meet the moment and risk disenfranchising voters in a state that prides itself on being a critical battleground in national elections.
In Pennsylvania, we have the power to make our election system better, more inclusive, and more accessible. But this change can only happen if our leaders in the state legislature act now to make real early voting options a reality. Let’s ensure that every Pennsylvanian has the opportunity to cast their ballot early without unnecessary hurdles. It’s time for Pennsylvania to put in place a system that works for everyone.

Delaware dog owners now have a faster, easier way to license their pets—and bring them home if they ever get lost.
The Office of Animal Welfare (OAW) has teamed up with pet registration provider DocuPet to roll out a new online dog licensing platform and lost pet recovery service across the state.
The user-friendly system is designed to streamline the licensing process and strengthen efforts to reunite lost pets with their families.
Tracking lost dogs
Under the new program, canine owners who register their pets on the DocuPet platform will receive a uniquely coded ID tag linked to a secure online profile.
If a pet goes missing, owners can quickly create a Lost Pet Report.
Anyone who finds a lost canine can use the tag’s code to file a Found Pet Report in seconds. A 24/7 dispatch team is also on hand to help reconnect pets and owners at any hour.
READ: Volunteers needed to help protect Delaware’s beach-nesting birds
“Our new partnership with DocuPet will be extremely valuable to dog owners and necessary for animal safety within the state,” said Christina Motoyoshi, director of OAW. “Licensing your dog helps reduce the number of animals in shelters, freeing up space and resources for pets in need. Licensing also helps to ensure public safety and support critical animal services to our community. We’re excited for residents to take advantage of this program to help keep their own pets and others in the community safe.”
Dog licensing is required by law in Delaware for all dogs six months or older and must be accompanied by proof of rabies vaccination.
To encourage pet owners to comply, the state is waiving late fees for expired licenses through July 15, 2025. Existing licenses will remain valid until their expiration.
Pet owners can sign up here, where they can also choose from standard or customizable designer tags.
As a bonus, the promo code “LICENSES” offers $5 off designer tags for a limited time.
The initiative is part of OAW’s ongoing mission to promote animal welfare and public safety across Delaware. T
he program is supported by Delaware Animal Services (DAS), the enforcement arm of OAW that handles dog control, rabies response, and animal cruelty investigations.

Photo courtesy of Ryan Fiereck. If you’re a reader, a student of history, or a writer, it’s been appalling to watch book bans proliferate across the nation. As The Reformer reported last month, St. Francis High School and Independent School District 15 recently adopted a policy that defers to Booklooks, a website linked to the far-right group Moms for Liberty when evaluating which books to purchase or pull from shelves.
The result: Hundreds of books are now either banned outright or will likely be pulled from shelves in the near future; this includes classics like The Handmaid’s Tale, The Bluest Eye, and soon, perhaps the likes of “Night” by Elie Wiesel and “Slaughterhouse Five” by Kurt Vonnegut and hundreds of others.
I graduated from St. Francis High School in 2001. I owe much of my career as a writer — I’ve written ten books and edited many more — to one of the soon-to-banned books. It was “Slaughterhouse Five.” It was the year 2000. Frosted tips and Billabong shirts were everywhere. I picked up the book from a spinner in my journalism class. (That teacher was the best teacher I ever had.) I absorbed it, and I proceeded to read every other book by Vonnegut on the spinner, and then Ray Bradbury; soon I was reading Sylvia Plath and Richard Wright. A good book is a springboard to others; the best books lead to a lifetime of a reading.
Rather than trot out generic arguments about why book bans are ill-advised, I want to talk about “Slaughterhouse Five.” It’s a fictionalized story, that like all truly great fiction, is, at its heart, true. Vonnegut was a G.I. in World War II. He was in the 106th Infantry Division and was captured during the Battle of the Bulge. To put that another way: The St. Francis school board wants to ban a novel written by an American serviceman and a member of the Greatest Generation.
  Published by Penguin Random House.
Vonnegut was forced to do manual labor in Dresden, and he survived the firebombing of the city in February 1945 by the Royal Air Force and the U.S. 8th Air Force. The resulting firestorm killed perhaps 35,000 people. “Slaughterhouse Five” is superficially science fiction, but it’s really about the insanity of war, the absurdity of surviving one, and more than anything, PTSD. Vonnegut’s writing will last forever because he’s irreverent, funny, and accessible, but he’s also honest and fundamentally decent.
That’s why Vonnegut appeals to younger readers; kids aren’t just picky eaters; they are picky readers. You have to meet them where they are in terms of attitude, interest, and style. By removing some of the most popular books among young people — classics and newer books alike — the district is depriving students of great books but also the love of reading and learning itself.
And as a rule, if you’re banning books, you’re afraid of ideas: The Soviets were afraid of capitalism, religion, and freedom of speech. The Nazis loathed the Jews, “inferior” races, modernism in all its forms, and were racist to their core. The Inquisition banned or targeted works by Copernicus and Galileo and Giordano Bruno because they feared their monopoly on cosmology was at an end. The ideas that Booklooks, and by extension, The St. Francis School Board, fear are plain. Even the most cursory look at its anonymous “ratings” (available on Internet Archive) shows that the books it targets are by or about women, LGBTQ folks, Black and brown folks, or people who have a “different” point of view. Like any attempt at censorship, it’s an exercise in erasure.
But I can promise you this: It won’t work. As the packed school board meetings, recent student protests, and a pair of newly filed lawsuits against the district make clear, people care about the freedom to read, the First Amendment, and the books and characters they love. 
This misguided policy has already been an expensive debacle, and the district has made statewide news in the most embarrassing way. If the policy remains in force, it will continue to hurt the district’s own students by depriving them of great works of art, and worse, giving them an incomplete, myopic view of the world.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/St.-Francis-Banned-Books-1-1024x868.jpg,,,2025-04-21 10:05:53.445210

Clinton, who was president at the time of the attack, returned to the site of the 1995 Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building bombing Saturday to deliver the keynote address to a crowd of over 1,600 that attended to remember and honor those who died and were injured in the attack.
While the event is typically held outdoors at the Oklahoma City National Memorial and Museum, the site of the bombing, it was moved indoors due to inclement weather. The crowd that arrived to commemorate the anniversary was so large that once the pews were packed, people stood along the walls and filled an overflow room.

“The domestic terrorists who did this awful thing believed that it would spark a nationwide upheaval against the American government, and would eventually destroy our government, our democracy and our life,” Clinton said. “Instead, you gave them, as the mayor said so eloquently, the Oklahoma Standard. You gave them service, honor and kindness.”
Clinton, a Democrat, came to Oklahoma City days after the 1995 attack to address a devastated crowd assembled at the Oklahoma State Fair Arena. He said he’s returned to Oklahoma City in subsequent years to commemorate the event.
Three decades later, Clinton said that the country has again grown more polarized. When Oklahoma City was the “center of polarization” 30 years ago, it chose to move forward together, he said.
“America needs you, and America needs the Oklahoma Standard,” Clinton said. “And if we all live by it, we would get a fairer economy, a more stable society. We would understand one another, and we wouldn’t feel weak if we admitted we were wrong about something.”
Thirty years ago, a fertilizer and fuel oil bomb placed inside a Ryder truck outside the Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City exploded at 9:02 a.m., killing 168 people, including 19 children, and injuring around 850.
Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols were arrested for their roles. Both were found guilty. McVeigh was executed June 11, 2001, by lethal injection at the Federal Correctional Complex in Terre Haute, Indiana. Nichols was sentenced to life in prison.

Michael Fortier was sentenced to 12 years in prison for failing to report his knowledge of the bombing plot.
Investigators said McVeigh held extremist views and planned the bombing on the anniversary of the end of the Waco siege between law enforcement and the Branch Davidians.
Other speakers at Saturday’s remembrance event included prominent Republican officials such as Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, former Gov. Frank Keating, and U.S. Sen. James Lankford. Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt also spoke. Most of Oklahoma’s Congressional delegation was present, as were a few other former governors, current state lawmakers and other officials.
There have been nearly “11,000 tomorrows” since the bombing and in Oklahoma City, Holt said, and the city has grown in that time. He said 30 years since the bombing signifies a “generation.”
While younger Oklahomans may not remember the bombing, Stitt said, they live in a state shaped by it and the “commitment to service, honor and kindness” that followed.
Lankford said Oklahomans need to ensure the lessons learned from the bombing and its aftermath are passed to future generations to ensure there is “no generation that rises up that does not remember.”
The Federal Building housed federal agencies like the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Secret Service, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and Explosives, the agency that initially launched the Waco raid. But the building also held a day care, military recruitment offices and other various federal agencies.

Family members of victims read the 168 names to the crowd Saturday in an effort to “humanize” the people, said Kari Watkins, president and CEO of the memorial museum.
The building was imploded after the rescue operations and evidence collections were completed. A new federal building was built nearby.
The memorial was built where the old federal building once stood. The 168 chairs erected at the site each represent an empty seat at the dinner table. The smaller chairs represent the children who died. A reflecting pool represents the time between 9:01 a.m. and 9:03 a.m. April 19, 1995. Officials were able to preserve an American elm tree that survived the blast. It is known as the “Survivor Tree.”
In the aftermath of the attack, the state became known for the “Oklahoma Standard,” a term used to describe the “selfless actions” of thousands who offered help.

A recent court order could put the money back in circulation, but the administration has yet to signal if it will fully comply. U.S. District Judge Mary McElroy of Rhode Island, who was nominated by President Donald Trump in 2019 during his first term in office, ordered the administration to release the funding last week. 
The following day, the administration filed notice that it intends to comply with the nationwide order. On Sunday, however, the organizations that sued over the funding freeze filed their own notice, saying that the grant funds “remain inaccessible” even after McElroy’s order. 
Angela Ehlers is the executive director of the South Dakota Association of Conservation Districts. Her organziation is not a party to the lawsuit, but has been awarded some of the funds now in dispute and works closely with other grantees affected by the executive order.
The money flowed through the Inflation Reduction Act, and were paused under direction from the U.S. Department of Agriculture after a Jan. 20 executive order from President Trump. The Inflation Reduction Act was authorized by Congress and signed into law under former President Joe Biden in 2022.
Ehlers said there’s been no clear sign of if or when they’ll be restored since the Jan. 20 0rder, which has been a frustration for those relying on them.
“These aren’t regulatory programs,” Ehlers emphasized. “They’re voluntary, and the fact that they’ve been frozen without explanation creates a chilling effect across the entire landscape.”
The pause impacted billions in conservation spending nationwide and sparked the lawsuit that led to last week’s order from Judge McElroy. Projects designed to support beginning farmers have also stalled. 


DOGE cuts in SD
This is part of a series on the impact of mass federal firings, funding freezes and grant cancellations in South Dakota. For future and prior reporting, see Searchlight’s DOGE in SD page.


Ehlers said her association had partnered with South Dakota State University to support young producers entering agriculture through sheep and goat production. The grant-funded effort is meant to offer a way into agriculture for young producers but doubles as a conservation measure, because sheep and goat production requires less land and capital than cattle or grain farming.
“There’s a real opportunity here,” Ehlers said, but added “we just don’t know” if the grant funding will continue.
Leaders in water quality and habitat restoration programming along the Big Sioux River are in  a similar wait-and-see scenario.
Most watershed project funding remains available, according to Jay Gilbertson, manager of the East Dakota Water Development District. But staff losses and hiring freezes have undercut the delivery of on-the-ground support.
“Even if you don’t reduce the program funding, who’s going to do the work?” Gilbertson said. “If you fire someone who’s approving payments or working directly with farmers, it creates a massive gap in capacity.”
Travis Entenman, director of Northern Prairies Land Trust and Friends of the Big Sioux River, said the downstream impacts of federal uncertainty are already reaching local landowners. The Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), which helps farmers and ranchers integrate conservation into their operations, has seen funding pauses, he said. That’s left some landowners without reimbursement for practices they installed on the promise of repayment.
“Some of it’s open, but there’s still money frozen,” Entenman said. “And these programs are often receipt-based, meaning landowners put their own money on the line expecting reimbursement.”



Frozen conservation funds in limbo:
$51 million in climate-smart agriculture projects:

$25 million to Ducks Unlimited to restore 25,000 acres of grassland and help ranchers better manage grazing.
$18.3 million to South Dakota Agricultural Land Trust to offer easement payments to conserve 8,000 acres of ranchland near the Black Hills.
$8 million to South Dakota State University to help farmers identify unprofitable acres and suggest better land uses.

$83 million in grassland and conservation grants:

$24 million to Pheasants Forever & Quail Forever to use prescribed fire to remove invasive Eastern red cedar trees and restore prairie grasses on up to 125,000 acres.
$21 million to InterTribal Buffalo Council to restore native grassland ecosystems using sustainable buffalo grazing practices across tribal lands.
$20 million to The Nature Conservancy to purchase voluntary conservation easements on 20,000 acres in western South Dakota to prevent development.
$11 million to South Dakota Second Century Habitat Fund to convert low-quality cropland into grasslands suitable for grazing and haying.
$5 million to The Buffalo Nations Grasslands Alliance to identify and restore marginal croplands across 16 tribal nations.
$1.2 million to The Sisseton Wahpeton Oyate to create a tool to measure the environmental impact of agriculture on the reservation.

,California,2025-04-21 13:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,Special interests poured more than half a billion into California lobbying last year,Jeremia Kimelman,,,,,https://calmatters.org/data/2025/04/california-lobbying-spending-2024/,"Google, oil companies and utilities helped push California lobbying to a record $540 million in 2024, up 10% from the year before.","In summary
Google, oil companies and utilities helped push California lobbying to a record $540 million in 2024, up 10% from the year before.


Lobbying groups spent more than half a billion dollars to influence the state government in 2024, the most ever, according to a CalMatters analysis of data recently filed with the secretary of state. Lobbying by Google, oil companies and utilities during special sessions in the third quarter appeared to drive the sharp spike in spending.
Companies and organizations reported roughly $540 million in lobbying expenses to push their point of view to California officials, including legislators, on hundreds of bills between January and December of last year — and that’s up by more than 10% from $485 million in 2023.

Perhaps that isn’t so surprising in a state with a full-time Legislature and one of the largest economies in the world, said Francesco Trebbi, an economics professor at UC Berkeley who studies political influence and lobbying.
“Half a billion is kind of normal,” he said. “If California is about 14% of U.S. GDP and federal lobbying is about $4 billion, $500 million is about 13% of that. So it would be in line with the size of the California economy.”
Thomas Holyoke, a professor of political science at Fresno State University, said that the spending increase might reflect not only corporations’ desire for more influence but also the growing influence of California policy itself.
As long as California maintains its prominence, “more and more interest groups and lobbyists are going to take what Sacramento does very, very seriously,” he said.
 
 

Major players driving the lobbying boom
The Western States Petroleum Association reported more than $17.3 million dollars in advocacy costs over the year, more than $10 million of which was spent last summer, and more than double the total bill of the previous year.
The organization took public positions on 18 bills last session and got its desired outcome two-thirds of the time, according to a CalMatters analysis of data from Digital Democracy, our platform to track state lawmakers and legislation.
In part, the trade group’s spending more than doubled because of increased proposed regulations on oil and gas, including a special session focused on gas prices.
The largest non-oil spender was PacifiCorp, which reported spending more than $13.4 million to influence California officials last year, 30 times the yearly average for the company over the last two decades. The investor-owned utility lobbied for a rate hike but didn’t take a public position on any bills in 2024.
Pacific Gas & Electric, one of the largest utilities in the state, reported nearly $3.6 million on lobbying last year. Over the two-year legislative session, the company took a public position on 45 bills and also got its way on roughly two-thirds of them, or 31 bills.
Google doesn’t usually spend much on state-level lobbying efforts but spent more in 2024 than the last 20 years combined.

The company reported one of the largest totals for state advocacy last year, driven primarily by a spending spree in the third quarter of the year when the tech giant was fighting a media bill and AI regulations. The company got its way in both cases.
Much of its advocacy went through the Computer & Communications Industry Association, which reported spending nearly $7.4 million, $7 million of which came from the Mountain View behemoth.
Only two labor groups spent more than $1 million on lobbying last year: the Service Employees International Union and the California Teachers Association.
SEIU reported spending nearly $3.4 million and the California Teachers Association, another powerful union in the state, spent more than $3.1 million. Both unions took public positions on hundreds of bills and got their way nearly 70% of the time.

How CalMatters analyzed the data
Organizations that hire lobbyists to influence state policy are required to disclose how much money was spent in a quarterly report to the secretary of state, who makes the data and filings available online. For example, the page for the Western States Petroleum Association shows that the industry group spent roughly $1.7 million on advocacy in the second quarter of last year and more than $10.1 million in the following quarter.
CalMatters added quarterly reported expenses to calculate the total annual lobbying bill for each organization, then added every organization’s yearly sum to determine the aggregate amount spent on lobbying California officials per year.
Sometimes, organizations give money to industry groups to lobby on their behalf, such as the $7 million Google paid to the Computer & Communications Industry Association, and both organizations must report that money: Google, when it buys advocacy services from the association; the trade group, when it actually spends the money on grassroots organizing or direct lobbying. Because there’s no way to determine if a payment is to another “lobbyist employer” or to a political or media consulting firm, there are amounts reported more than once in our data.
CalMatters determined the success rate of each organization by comparing organizations’ public positions taken on bills in the last legislative session (2023–2024) as recorded in Digital Democracy to the ultimate outcome of that legislation. Lobbying efforts were considered successful if either of the following were true:

The organization opposed a bill that failed the Legislature.
The organization supported a bill that passed through the Legislature (even if it was vetoed by the Governor).

It’s difficult to get a more detailed picture of lobbying because of what isn’t reported in the data. California does not require disclosure of either the offices or staff members who meet with lobbyists or the connections between individual lobbyists and specific bills.
Our analysis found that corporate lobbying efforts were successful about 60% of the time. This is likely an undercount because it can take more than one year to successfully pass a bill.
Micheli said that sometimes a bill can even take more than one two-year legislative session.
“After six or seven years on a really tough bill, you finally get it enacted. Leading up to it, you could say you failed every year,” he said. “But then eventually, you get a seismic change in the law.”

By the end of last summer, CalMatters data reporter Jeremia Kimelman recognized that 2024 was on its way to break lobbying spending records in California. With the year concluded and recent data filed with the secretary state, lobbying groups indeed spent an unrivaled amount of money in 2024 to influence state government: $540 million, or 10% more than the year before.
So who were the biggest spenders? 
Topping the list were oil companies, which were the main focus of a special session Gov. Gavin Newsom called last summer to address gas prices. The Western States Petroleum Association reported more than $17.3 million in advocacy costs in 2024 — including more than $10 million spent last summer. 
Electric company PacifiCorp and utility company Pacific Gas & Electric also spent big last year: PacifiCorp reported spending more than $13.4 million — about 30 times its yearly average in the last two decades — while Pacific Gas & Electric spent nearly $3.6 million.
But one standout is the tech and search giant Google, which poured $11.9 million into state-level lobbying in 2024 — more than it spent in the last 20 years combined. Last summer it successfully opposed two bills related to funding journalism and artificial intelligence regulations.
Given the state’s prominence as having one of the largest economies in the world, half a billion dollars in lobbying spending isn’t too surprising for some political and economic experts. During the 2023-24 legislative session, California also saw its biggest spike in registered lobbyists in more than a decade.

Thomas Holyoke, political science professor at Fresno State University: “More and more interest groups and lobbyists are going to take what Sacramento does very, very seriously.”

CA spared from other research funding cuts, for now

From CalMatters higher education reporter Mikhail Zinshteyn:
Another federal cut to university research, another lawsuit — and yet another judge halting the cuts for now.
While the proposed research cuts to universities by the National Institutes of Health have been a top concern for campuses, other federal agencies are big funders of research, too. The Department of Energy provided the University of California $162 million in research funding last year for 393 projects.The department under President Donald Trump wanted to cap a major source of that funding, called indirect costs, to 15% — much lower than the existing negotiated rates between campuses and the federal agency. The government said the move would save taxpayers $400 million annually. A coalition of universities and higher-education associations, which count UCs as members, sued last week. Days after, a federal Massachusetts judge temporarily halted the cuts. Indirect costs cover expenses to maintain labs and other major infrastructure for research.Calculating the true cost of those proposed Department of Energy losses for the UC is difficult, but the NIH also sought to lower those indirect rates to 15%. One calculation found that the UC would lose $460 million out of about $2.6 billion in funding the system gets for health science research annually.In the Department of Energy suit, California Institute of Technology indicated it spent $25 million on Department of Energy projects. A 15% cut to indirect costs would mean $6 million in losses for the school.



CA consumer group sues to prevent insurance surcharge

From CalMatters economy reporter Levi Sumagaysay:
A consumer advocacy group sued the California Insurance Department last week because the state agency allowed private insurers to pass a $500 million surcharge to their customers.
The FAIR Plan — a state-mandated association of insurers that’s required to provide fire insurance to property owners who can’t get it elsewhere — asked the insurance department to approve a $1 billion “assessment” to help prop it up after the Los Angeles County fires, saying the plan was running out of money. The insurers in the plan are required to fund the assessment. But under two bulletins issued by Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara last fall and in February, insurers for the first time can recoup half of their cost by imposing fees on their customers — who are not on the FAIR Plan. 
CalMatters reported in February that Consumer Watchdog was considering legal action. It filed suit in Los Angeles Superior Court last week, saying Lara violated one law that requires public comment on a regulation and review by the Office of Administrative Law. In addition, the group said Lara violated the state’s insurance code by “effectively (requiring) every California policyholder to reinsure their own insurer.” It asks the court to declare the bulletins invalid, and to order the insurance department to facilitate the return of any fees on insurance customers so far. 
Gabriel Sanchez, a spokesperson for the insurance department, said the lawsuit “fails to benefit consumers.” The insurance industry also slammed the lawsuit.

Denni Ritter, a vice president at the American Property Casualty Insurance Association: “It is critical that the costs be spread equitably across a broader pool of insured customers.”

Volcanoes inspire awe with spectacular eruptions and incandescent rivers of lava, but often their deadliest hazard is what quietly falls from the sky.
When a large volcano erupts, as Mount Spurr appears close to doing about 80 miles from Anchorage, Alaska, it can release enormous volumes of ash. Fine ash can infiltrate the lungs of people and animals who breathe it in, poison crops and disrupt aquatic life. Thick deposits of ash can collapse roofs, cripple utilities and disrupt transport networks.
Ash may lack the visual impact of flowing lava, but as a geologist who studies disasters, I’m aware that ash travels farther, lasts longer and leaves deep scars.

Volcanic ash: What it is, and why it matters
Volcanic ash forms when viscous magma – molten rock from deep beneath Earth’s surface – erupts, exploding into shards of rock, mineral and glass carried in a near-supersonic stream of hot gas.
Towering clouds of ash rise several miles into the atmosphere, where the ash is captured by high-altitude winds that can carry it hundreds or even thousands of miles.
As the volcanic ash settles back to Earth, it accumulates in layers that typically decrease in thickness with distance from the eruption source. Near the vent, the ash may be several feet deep, but communities farther away may see only a dusting.

  When Mount Spurr erupted in 1992, a dark column of ash and gas shot into the atmosphere from the volcano’s Crater Peak vent. Wind patterns determine where the ash will fall. (U.S. Geological Survey photo)

Breathing danger: Health risks from ash
Breathing volcanic ash can irritate the throat and lungs, trigger asthma attacks and aggravate chronic respiratory conditions such as COPD.
The finest particles pose the greatest risk because they can penetrate deep into the lungs and cause death by asphyxiation in the worst cases. Mild, short-term symptoms often resolve with rest. However, the long-term consequences of ash exposure can include silicosis, a lung disease and a possible cause of cancer.
The danger increases in dry regions where fallen ash can be kicked up into the air again by wind or human activity.
Risks to pets and livestock
Humans aren’t the only ones at risk. Animals experience similar respiratory symptoms to humans.
Domestic pets can develop respiratory distress, eye inflammation and paw irritation from exposure to ash.

	Livestock face greater dangers. If grazing animals eat volcanic ash, it can damage their teeth, block their intestines and poison them.
During the 2010 Eyjafjallajökull eruption in Iceland, farmers were advised to shelter sheep and cattle because the ash contained fluoride concentrations above the recognized safety threshold of 400 parts per million. Animals that remained exposed became sick and some died.
Harm to crops, soil and water
Soil and crops can also be damaged. Volcanic ash alters the acidity of soil and introduces harmful elements such as arsenic and sulfur into the environment.
While the ash can add nutrients such as potassium and phosphorus that enhance fertility, the immediate impact is mostly harmful.
Ash can smother crops, block sunlight and clog the tiny stomata, or pores, in leaves that allow plants to exchange gases with the atmosphere. It can also introduce toxins that render food unmarketable. Vegetables, fruit trees and vines are particularly vulnerable, but even sturdy cereals and grasses can die if ash remains on leaves or poisons emerging shoots.
Following the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption, vast tracts of farmland in central Luzon in the Philippines were rendered unproductive for years due to acidic ash and buried topsoil. If multiple ashfalls occur in a growing season, crop failure becomes a near certainty. It was the cause of a historic famine that followed the eruption of Mount Tambora in 1815.

  Electron microscope images of ash show how sharp the shards are. The top left image of shards from Mount Etna in 2002 is 1 mm across. Top right is an ash particle from Mount St. Helens magnified 200 times. The shards in the lower images are less than 0.064 mm. (Volcano Hazards Program, U.S. Geological Survey photo)


	Ash can also contaminate surface water by introducing toxins and increasing the water’s acidity. The toxins can leach into groundwater, contaminating wells. Fine ash particles can also settle in waterways and smother aquatic plants and animals. During the 2008 Chaitén eruption in Chile, ash contamination led to widespread fish deaths in the Río Blanco.
Ash can ground airplanes, gum up infrastructure
Ash clouds are extremely dangerous to aircraft. The glassy ash particles melt when sucked into jet turbines, clog fuel systems and can stall engines in midair.
In 1982, British Airways Flight 9 lost power in all four engines after flying through an ash cloud. A similar incident occurred in 1989 to KLM Flight 867 over Alaska. In 2010, Iceland’s Eyjafjallajökull eruption grounded more than 100,000 flights across Europe, disrupting travel for over 10 million passengers and costing the global economy billions of dollars.
Volcanic ash can also wreak havoc on infrastructure by clogging water supplies, short-circuiting electrical systems and collapsing roofs under its weight. It can disrupt transportation, communication, rescue and power networks, as the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines dramatically demonstrated.
What to do during ashfall
During an ashfall event, the most effective strategy to stay safe is to stay indoors as much as possible and avoid inhaling ash particles.
Anyone who must go outside should wear a properly fitted N95 or P2 mask. Cloth masks provide little protection against fine ash. Rainwater tanks, troughs and open wells should be covered and monitored for contamination. Livestock should be moved to clean pastures or given uncontaminated fodder.
To reduce structural damage, ash should be cleared from roofs and gutters promptly, especially before rainfall.
Older adults, children and people who are sick are at greatest risk, particularly those living in poorly ventilated homes. Rural communities that are dependent on agriculture and livestock are disproportionately affected by ashfall, as are low-income people who lack access to clean water, protective masks or safe shelter.
Communities can stay informed about ash risks through official alerts, including those from the Volcanic Ash Advisory Centers, which monitor ash dispersion and issue timely warnings. The International Volcanic Health Hazard Network also offers guidelines on personal protection, emergency planning and ash cleanup.
The long tail of ash
Volcanic ash may fall quietly, but its effects are widespread, persistent and potentially deadly. It poses a chronic threat to health, agriculture, infrastructure and aquatic systems.
Recognizing the risk is a crucial first step to protecting lives. Effective planning and public awareness can further help reduce the damage.

According to a news release, Ellison has served as an assistant U.S. attorney for the District of New Mexico in the Las Cruces Branch Office, most recently as supervisory assistant U.S. attorney of the Violent and General Crimes Section. In that capacity, a news release notes, Ellison prosecuted members of the Syndicato de Nuevo Mexico prison gang, with more than 175 SNM gang members and associates thus far charged with serious federal crimes, “making the ongoing SNM prosecution the largest criminal case ever brought in the District of New Mexico.”
“I am grateful for the opportunity to serve the people of New Mexico in this role,” Ellison said in a statement. “For however long I serve as United States Attorney, my primary objective will be to keep New Mexicans safe through the vigorous enforcement of Federal law. Under my leadership, the United States Attorney’s Office will do its part to stem the unlawful flow of people and drugs into our country. We will also not lose sight of our responsibility to combat violent crime, gang activity, child predators, and to zealously advocate on behalf of the United States’ civil interests. Together with our federal, tribal, state, and local law enforcement partners, the United States Attorney’s Office will work tirelessly to make New Mexico a safer place to live, work, raise a family, and run a business. And we will make New Mexico a far less attractive place to commit a crime.”

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)Senate President Dominick Ruggerio, the State House’s longest-serving member, died early Monday morning following a battle with cancer, according to a statement from his office. He was 76.
“It is with deepest sorrow that we announce the passing of Senate President Dominick J. Ruggerio earlier this morning,” the statement said. “We are so grateful for the love and support of his friends and colleagues. Throughout his illness, Donny fought valiantly, just as he always had for his constituents and the residents of Rhode Island.”
The North Providence Democrat was hospitalized at Our Lady of Fatima Hospital last week for a bad reaction to his treatment — returning less than five weeks after he was released from the same hospital and rehabilitation center for pneumonia. 
House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi said he was “heartbroken,” referring to Ruggerio as his “dear friend” in a statement Monday morning.
“I had enormous respect and admiration for his dedication and leadership,” Shekarchi said.  “Even through his illness, we communicated on nearly a daily basis about the important issues facing our state. Donny devoted his life to the people of Rhode Island, which will always be his legacy. This is the end of an era at the State House, where Donny was a true giant for well over four decades, beginning his career in the House in 1981 before moving to the Senate four years later.  On behalf of the House of Representatives, we extend our deepest sympathies to his family and his Senate colleagues, and we will miss him greatly.”
Ruggerio was absent for a majority of the 2025 sessions, attending just four of the 17 regularly scheduled Senate gatherings since January. He last presided over the chamber’s regular session on March 25.
Similar stretches of absence also characterized his leadership of the upper chamber in 2024, prompting a rival bid for the president role from his former second-in-command, Sen. Ryan Pearson. Ruggerio fended off the challenge with two-thirds of the votes of the Senate’s 34 Democrats. Despite his multiple absences, supporters remained steadfast in their public conviction that Ruggerio was the best pick to lead the chamber.
First elected to represent District 4 spanning parts of Providence and North Providence in 1985, Ruggerio, known to friends and colleagues as “Donny” was considered the “dean” of the Senate as its longest-serving member. The retired administrator for the New England Laborers Labor Management Coop Trust was tapped as majority whip in 2003. He ascended to Senate Majority Leader in 2010 and in 2017, was elected Senate President after former President Teresa Paiva Weed suddenly resigned.
A self-described moderate Democrat, Ruggerio leaned more conservative on gun and abortion issues, though his mindset shifted in his later years in leadership. In 2023, Ruggerio cast the tie-breaking vote in the Senate Judiciary Committee that allowed the Equality in Abortion Coverage Act to advance to the full Senate, where it also passed and was signed into law. This year, he signaled new openness to a state assault weapons ban, which he previously opposed.
He was a strong voice for labor, small business and expanding the state’s legal gambling sector, leading the way for the state’s online sports betting in 2019 and in 2023, virtual slot and table games, or iGaming.
His biography on the General Assembly website highlights his recognition from The Humane Society of the United States, recognizing his efforts to prohibit double-decker horse trailers, as one of the standouts from his many awards and honors.
A lifelong North Providence resident, Ruggerio graduated from LaSalle Academy in 1966. He attended Bryant College, but earned a bachelor’s degree in 1974 from Providence College.
He served on the board of the Wanskuck Library and as a member of the Sons of Italy, Loggia Vittoria, and the DaVinci Center Development Committee.

(Photo: Jeniffer Solis/Nevada Current)As temperatures soared past 100 degrees in early October, Yajaira Rimendes, a 35-year-old former nurse, started to feel faint at a bus stop in North Las Vegas. It was midday and she was on her way to a chemotherapy appointment. She drank her only remaining water, which was already lukewarm, and passed out.
“I don’t remember much, but from what I remember I woke up in a hospital,” Rimendes said.
She was one of more than 3,500 heat-related emergency hospital visits reported in Southern Nevada last year, according to the Southern Nevada Health District. 
Last year Nevada experienced the hottest summer on record, and even into October, daily heat records were broken, triggering a re-activation of cooling centers. Temperatures on Oct. 4 reached 104 degrees, breaking the record for the hottest day ever recorded for the month.
Extended triple degree temperatures in 2024 also brought a surge of fatalities. State health officials recorded 526 heat-related deaths in Southern Nevada last year, a 78% increase from the 294 heat-related deaths in 2023.
After a record number of heat related deaths and hospitalizations in the state, lawmakers are considering measures this session designed to protect Nevadans whose vulnerability to heat is only rising with temperatures.
Rimendes joined dozens of Las Vegas residents on a trip to Carson City with the Nevada Environmental Justice Coalition this month — traveling more than 400 miles — to push for several bills that would help Nevadans adapt and thrive as record-breaking temperatures and wildfire impact every aspect of their lives. 
Extreme heat exposure is a serious health hazard. It can cause heat rash, cramps, heat exhaustion, or heat stroke, which can be fatal or have lifelong consequences. Older people, people with disabilities, pregnant people, and children are at increased risk of adverse health impacts from heat, in some cases with fatal consequences.
At face value, policies to protect against the consequences of climate change seem like an obvious necessity, but lack of funding combined with fiercely anti-regulatory corporate interests and like-minded elected officials have made climate-related legislation difficult to pass.
One example is Assembly Bill 96, a measure that would mandate the Clark and Washoe counties, the state’s two most populous, to include a specific “heat mitigation” section within their development master plans. That would mean actively addressing extreme heat through urban planning strategies, like creating public cooling spaces, public water access, cool building practices, and shaded areas.
Nevada’s Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo vetoed a similar bill in 2023. His reasoning was that there’s “no data definitively supporting the proposition that development is causing rising temperatures in either Washoe County or Clark County.” 
In reality, one of the major consequences of urban development is the urban heat island that results in cities being, on average, warmer than adjacent rural landscapes. As natural land and vegetation is replaced by dark and heat-absorbing surfaces like asphalt and concrete, the urban heat island is amplified at night when stored daytime heat is emitted even when the sun is down.

After 18 years of living in Nevada, Rimendes said the heat feels different than it did even five years ago. It’s more persistent, and her mobile home is no longer effective enough at creating a barrier from the intensity of the summer heat in North Las Vegas.
Her observation is backed by data. From 2010 to 2019, the low temperature in Las Vegas increased by 7 degrees, according to the nonpartisan Climate Central research and communications group. Much of that increase can be attributed to explosive development in Las Vegas since the 1970s.
A recent comparative study of cities by the U.S. Geological Survey found that nearly 50% of the Las Vegas metro area was covered by heat-absorbing buildings, roads and sidewalks — more than any other city in the study — contributing to significantly higher air temperatures in the area. 
Nothing but a pole for shade
Nevada’s capital—where the Legislature meets once every two years— is 431 miles away from the Las Vegas Metropolitan Area, where seven out of ten Nevadans live. That’s farther than Las Vegas to Phoenix. It’s farther than Las Vegas to Salt Lake City. It’s farther than Las Vegas to Los Angeles.
Tollis Hill, a Las Vegas resident, packed into the Carson City office of Sen. Edgar Flores (D-Las Vegas) with a dozen other Nevada Environmental Justice Coalition members to advocate for more action on climate change. 
Hill traveled with Chispa Nevada from Las Vegas to advocate for Senate Bill 260, a measure that would ensure that outdoor workers receive the protection when air quality reaches unhealthy levels due to the wildfire smoke. It was his first time ever going to Carson City or speaking to lawmakers. 
Nearly one-fifth of Nevada’s land area has been burned by wildfire in the past 40 years, landing the state fifth in the nation for land area burned by wildfires. More frequent and destructive wildfires have also impacted air quality for outdoor workers in the state from Reno to Las Vegas. Despite growing destructive wildfires in the state, there are currently no regulations to protect workers air quality during extreme weather events. 
Hill spent 15 years working casino security on the Las Vegas Strip, including seven years as an outside bike officer. He recalled times the air quality was so bad during wildfires that he couldn’t stop coughing and had to rely on an inhaler. 
“In 2022, when Southern Nevada was filled with wildfire smoke, my coworkers and I were still outside working. We were not provided the needed personal protective equipment, and using what we had was discouraged as it did not meet the company’s uniform code,” Hill said.

Members of the Nevada Environmental Justice Coalition split up to speak to different legislators in order to maximize their lobbying time. They also provided comments during legislative hearings that coincided with their trip to Carson City.
Rimendes, the 35-year-old former nurse who is fighting cancer, has practiced telling her story in an effective and compelling way in 2-minutes or less — the time allotted by legislative committees to an individual to submit public comment on legislation during a hearing. 
There’s no guarantee any of the bills the coalition supports will make it into law at the end of the 120-day legislative session, despite lobbying efforts by coalition members. Alternatively, the measures could be approved, but in a much different form than what was originally proposed.
One example is Senate Bill 431. The measure’s original goal was to extend the state’s 9% live entertainment tax to sports teams ticket sales, which are currently exempted from the tax.  The bill would have dedicated the revenue to Nevada’s woefully underfunded public transit. 
State Sen. Dina Neal (D-North Las Vegas), the bill’s sponsor, said if passed as originally written the bill could have brought the state $54.5 million in revenue. That funding could be used to improve transit wait times, upgrade bus shelters to provide shade, and expand routes.
Rimendes relies heavily on public transit, even on days when temperatures soar past 100 degrees. That means at times Rimendes is forced to wait up to an hour at a bus stop with nothing but a pole for shade. Drive past any major road in Las Vegas and you’ll find several bus stops without trees or shelters to keep people cool as they stand on hot concrete near a sizzling asphalt road.
“There isn’t any shade, there aren’t any benches, there’s no trees. Imagine 110 degree weather, standing out there in scorching hot sun,” Rimendes said. 
The bill was opposed by Golden Knights, a pro league hockey team, and the Reno Aces, a pro baseball team, each saying the bill would raise ticket prices.
Neal acknowledged it was “controversial” during a hearing while Rimendes and other Nevadans who had traveled from Las Vegas sat in the gallery.
“I apologize to the committee who will sit through lots and lots of opposition,” Neal said. 
Days later, the bill was stripped down during a work session, narrowing the live entertainment tax to only the resale of sports teams tickets. And instead of $54.5 million to improve public transit infrastructure, the bill is projected to generate $36.5 million.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/story3-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-21 09:03:21.609108
,California,2025-04-21 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,California lawmakers can do a lot to aid LA fire recovery. Steeper looting penalties aren’t part of that,Robert Greene,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/04/looting-penalties-los-angeles-fires/,"There were relatively few arrests inside evacuation zones during this year's LA firestorm, yet California legislators have put looting center stage. The bills would mostly enhance already-stiff penalties, raising questions about why Democrats are making such a fuss.","It is noteworthy that some of the earliest mentions of “looting” in news reports during this year’s deadly fires in Los Angeles County made the point that there actually wasn’t much of it.
Video circulated on social media purporting to show young Black men stealing goods from a home in Altadena during the Eaton Fire. But the claim was quickly debunked by KTLA reporter Chip Yost, who spoke to the impacted family and noted that the young men were residents of the house and their neighbors, who were quickly removing and bagging as much of their possessions as they could before the flames could destroy everything.
Similar scenes played out all over Altadena, Pacific Palisades, Malibu and other areas hard hit by the fires that began on Jan. 7 and spread quickly amid hurricane-force winds. Neighbors pitched in to help save pets, pictures, important documents and personal items.
It’s a fairly typical response during disaster emergencies like wildfires. Neighbors tend to come together. Looting, although not unusual during violent social uprisings, is rare during natural disasters.
But fears and false reports of looting are common.
The Los Angeles Police Department, whose jurisdiction includes Pacific Palisades, took to social media in the hours after fires broke out to rebut looting rumors. 
“At this time,” the LAPD said on X, “we have received no information regarding looting or other criminal activity in the affected areas.”
As the fires were beaten back, some people did come to the reeling neighborhoods to take advantage of the disaster, allegedly stealing goods from intact or partially destroyed homes, or in some cases sifting through ash for any valuables that somehow remained unburned. 
The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department reported six arrests for burglary, three for grand theft and seven for entering a disaster area in Altadena; and one for burglary, two for attempted burglary and one for possession of burglary tools in Malibu. The Los Angeles, Pasadena and Santa Monica police departments also made arrests in fire zones, including some for looting, but also for arson, flying unauthorized drones, possession of illegal drugs or weapons, and other non-looting-related crimes. Arrests in the evacuation areas for all crimes hovered at around 100. 
In a disaster in which at least 30 people died, and in a county of 10 million people, that’s a rather low number and does not point to a widespread outbreak of looting during the fires and the immediate aftermath.
Read More: New fire maps put nearly 4 million Californians in hazardous zones. What does that mean for the people who live there?
So it’s maddening that so many members of the California Legislature have put looting center stage, pushing bills to lengthen jail and prison sentences for theft during emergencies. It’s a misdirection of public time, effort and money. And it glosses over the deep governmental failures that the fires exposed: The failure to send timely emergency evacuation orders to the west side of Altadena where at least 18 people died. The needlessly nerve-wracking false emergency warning sent to millions of county residents not affected by the fires. The lack of available water to fight the fires. Plus questions about inadequate brush clearance and confusion over just who was in charge of disaster response.
Senate Bill 571 by Sens. Bob Archuleta of Norwalk and Jesse Arreguín of Oakland will be heard Tuesday in the Senate Public Safety Committee. Assembly Bill 468 by Assemblymembers Jesse Gabriel of Encino, Jacqui Irwin of Thousand Oaks and Blanca Pacheco of Downey passed out of the Assembly Public Safety Committee earlier this month and comes to the Appropriations Committee Wednesday.
All of the lead authors are Democrats and most are considered among the Legislature’s more progressive members. Parallel bills have been authored by Republican members.
The bills differ in their details but all are based on the specious premise that lengthening sentences — in some cases by four months, in others by a year or two — would dissuade would-be perpetrators who are not discouraged by current looting penalties.
California’s history with anti-looting laws
What is looting? As used in California law, it means stealing during a declared emergency or in an evacuation zone. Although charged as a distinct crime rather than as a sentence enhancement, it can lengthen sentences for charges like residential burglary, grand theft and petty theft — crimes that already carry stiff penalties. Residential burglary, for example, is a felony that carries a sentence of up to six years in state prison. AB 468 would make that seven years. 
It’s hard to imagine a perpetrator thinking, “I’m ready to do six years, but seven? No way. I’ll pass.”
California law also already increases the minimum penalty for petty theft during an emergency and virtually guarantees jail time. These bills would further strip judges of authority to order no-jail probation based on individual circumstances.
The state’s political foes often claim, falsely, that California is a soft on crime state. For example, after Gov. Gavin Newsom approved Los Angeles County’s request to deploy the National Guard to help patrol evacuation zones, Elon Musk amplified an absurd post on X, the platform he owns, that California had previously “literally decriminalized looting.”
In fact, at least two people arrested after allegedly stealing from an evacuated house in Mandeville Canyon during the Palisades fire reportedly could face life sentences under the state’s notoriously tough three strikes law because they have two prior serious or violent felony convictions. That’s not even including the longer sentences under current looting laws, let alone new penalties put in place if the bills become law. 
California is one of only eight states with anti-looting laws. Of those, most were adopted amid 1960s race riots, but California adopted its laws after the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989. There were only a few reports of theft during the emergency, but it was in the midst of the state’s tough-on-crime era and longer sentences were popular.
The remaining 42 states prosecute and sentence thieves and vandals the same whether they commit their crimes during a state of emergency or during normal times. There is no data to support the notion that theft increases during disasters or in evacuation zones, or that any such increase, if it did exist, would be controlled by special looting-related sentences.
In fact, there is little data to suggest that longer sentences have any impact on crime at all. The authors of California’s latest anti-looting bills surely know that if they have read the reports of their own legislative analysts.
So why are supposedly progressive Democrats pushing so hard to pointlessly adopt longer sentences for thefts committed during emergencies?
It may be that they feel pressure to hold someone — anyone — accountable for the overwhelming pain and loss. They recently scuttled a bill to allow fire victims to sue oil companies for their role in climate change, because it was opposed by their allies in labor. It would be likewise politically hazardous to target emergency workers for failed warning systems, or insurance companies for onerous recovery procedures. But accused thieves make popular targets, even though they had nothing to do with the fires.
The bills also allow Democrats to continue burnishing the tough-on-crime credentials they sought last year with a legislative package to toughen sentences for shoplifters. But retail theft dropped because of stepped-up investigation and enforcement, not because of longer prison or jail terms. 
Besides, criminal sentences don’t give their constituents what they need.
In Altadena, which historically has a large Black community, members of the Essie Justice Group made more than 500 calls to ask residents how they’re doing and what they need from their elected officials to better support their recovery. They’re still analyzing their responses, but so far, group member Sadio Woods said, “Zero percent of those folks said anything about crime or looting.”
Woods did note that some residents who returned home were stopped by officials and “questioned as looters.”
That recalls the false rumors circulated by social media about supposed looters who were actually friends and family helping to save precious belongings. And it raises a troubling but undeniable concern about the effect of racism during disasters.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/010824_Eaton-Fire_JH_CM_55.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-21 09:03:21.609108

Carlos Trujillo couldn’t sleep despite it being well past midnight. 
As both an immigrant and an immigration lawyer, Trujillo has been acutely tuned into the volatile nature of the Trump administration’s immigration policies. That night, in the early hours of April 11, as has often been the case lately, Trujillo’s mind drifted to worries about how the changes will impact his clients and what he can do to assist them. 
Those thoughts weren’t helped by an email that arrived in his inbox at 1 a.m. The opening line got straight to the point. 
“It is time for you to leave the United States,” reads the email from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS). It ends with a promise: “The federal government will find you.”
Trujillo initially assumed the email was for one of his clients. Then he realized the only name on the email was his own. 
“I was in a little bit of a shock,” said Trujillo, who became a citizen over a decade ago. “I was like, why is this happening?”

Trujillo is one of several U.S. citizens on the receiving end of what appears to have been a mass email campaign. The emails stated that the recipients’ parole had been terminated. But Trujillo has never had immigration parole, which allows immigrants to temporarily remain and, in some cases, work in the country. It is separate from the kind of parole used in a criminal justice context. 
Immigration lawyers in Massachusetts, Ohio, Arizona, Michigan and Pennsylvania, as well as a doctor in Connecticut — all of whom are also citizens — reported receiving the same email as Trujillo. 
Customs and Border Patrol said in a statement that it used the “known email addresses” of immigrants to send the notices, which it acknowledged could have included immigration attorneys’ emails. 
“If a non-personal email — such as an American citizen contact — was provided by the alien, notices may have been sent to unintended recipients,” the statement reads. “CBP is monitoring communications and will address any issues on a case-by-case basis.”
A broader strategy 
To Trujillo, the motivation behind the emails is clear.
“This is part of a new practice, and the practice is to instill fear in the Latino or the minority communities,” Trujillo said. “Why am I a part of the email? Was it a mistake? Was it that I am born and raised in Venezuela? I don’t know. It could be, because I know there have been mistaken communications by DHS, but because I don’t know — that unknown makes you worry.”
Maria Montes with Comunidades Unidas said the administration’s constantly changing policies have made it difficult for the nonprofit and other organizations to effectively respond within their communities. 
“The federal administration has organized a strategy to create chaos, confusion and fear all in the hopes that immigrants will choose to self deport,” Montes said. 
Trujillo has been an outspoken advocate for Utah’s immigrant community. He said he refuses to accept that his advocacy was linked to the email, although it did cross his mind.

“To think that there could be consequences for that in a country like the United States, I just can’t believe it,” he said. “It probably was a mistake, and I love this country so much that I think my first inclination is just to believe that and leave it at that. But if it is something else. Well, here I am. I know who I am and what I stand for. And I understand what this country stands for and I am staying put.”
The emails are part of a broader immigration strategy aimed at revoking visas, asylum, parole and temporary protected status for hundreds of thousands of immigrants. A specialized immigration task force within the Department of Government Efficiency is providing the technical infrastructure to make that strategy a reality, according to reporting by Politico. 
Like other DOGE mass email campaigns, the emails Trujillo and others received incited panic and confusion, especially since immigration notices have historically been sent through U.S. mail and online government portals. Before DHS publicly acknowledged the emails many online wrote them off as a scam. 
The switch to email is a recent one, Trujillo said. But his case and that of other citizens who mistakenly received the email call into question the reliability of using email. 
Trujillo’s email — which he shared with The Utah Investigative Journalism Project — lists the sender as “automatedmessage@cbp.dhs.gov.” Because the message came from an unrecognized address, it triggered an anti-phishing warning from his Outlook email service.
CBP did not respond to questions about how it is ensuring the notices get to the correct recipients and how many emails it accidentally sent to citizens. Instead, the agency said in a statement that it had issued notices terminating parole for individuals who do not have lawful status to remain in the country. 
The statement clarified that those notices were not limited to just individuals who had used CBP One and that the notices do not currently apply to Ukrainian and Afghan immigrants with parole. 
“To be clear: If you are an alien, being in the United States is a privilege — not a right,” the statement reads. “We are acting in the best interest of the country and enforcing the law accordingly.”

‘It’s heartbreaking’ 
Trujillo has written off the email as a mistake. But many aren’t so lucky. 
Jesus — who The Utah Investigative Journalism Project is referring to by only his first name because he fears speaking out may impact his immigration case — received a letter late last month that terminated his parole and authorization to work in the U.S. Unlike Trujillo, Jesus is not a citizen. 
“It literally destroyed me,” Jesus said in Spanish, “Because I’ve tried to do things legally in the U.S.”
The letter, which was shared with The Utah Investigative Journalism Project, directed Jesus, a BYU computer science student, to leave the U.S. by April 24 or face “adverse immigration consequences.”











It's heartbreaking. You know, these people came the right way, applied the right way, lawfully and orderly, and they're leaving.


– Utah attorney Carlos Trujillo



Jesus applied for asylum in the U.S. after fleeing political persecution in Venezuela. He entered the country legally in November 2023 through the humanitarian parole program. The Trump administration recently ended the program, which had benefited 532,000 people from Venezuela, Haiti, Cuba and Nicaragua. That decision is currently being challenged in court. 
“The phones blew up here,” Trujillo said, adding that over 50 of his clients have gotten letters telling them to leave the country. They range from newly arrived immigrants to individuals who have been in the U.S. for close to a decade.
“It’s heartbreaking,” he said. “You know, these people came the right way, applied the right way, lawfully and orderly, and they’re leaving.”
Trujillo and Montes encouraged immigrants to pursue their case with an immigration attorney, get informed of their rights and be brave about standing up for themselves and their communities. 
“There’s never been a scarier time to step up and to push back against such a powerful entity like our federal administration, but there’s also never been a more important time to do so,” Montes said.
Jesus is currently working with his immigration lawyers to stay in the country, but he worries daily of both the consequences of returning to Venezuela as well as the possibility of being detained by U.S. immigration officers. 
“My worry is that I go back and the persecution against me starts again,” he said in Spanish. “They could literally kill me.” 
All of these developments hit close to home for Trujillo. When he became a citizen, he remembers finally feeling like he had made it, like he didn’t need to worry anymore. 
“As an immigrant, you always feel unstable,” he said. “Here I am, 15 years later, and I’m worried about it again.”

Sen. Clyde Chambliss, R-Prattville, the sponsor of the legislation, said on the Senate floor that the bills aim to prevent children from accessing potentially harmful content online.
“They try to protect children, the most vulnerable of our society … they do it in different ways, but it’s all about protecting children,” Chambliss said following the vote.

The first bill, SB 186, passed the chamber on a 28-5 vote. It would require that smartphones and tablets manufactured on or after June 1 and activated in Alabama include a pre-installed filter capable of blocking obscene material. During the device activation process, users will be asked their age and the filter will automatically be enabled if the user is identified as a minor who is under 18. Adults would be able to disable the filter using a password.
“We don’t even have to come up with a solution. It’s already there. It is already there. This bill is very simple. All it does is require those who manufacture these devices to turn the filter on if the device is enabled, activated for a child. That’s it in a nutshell,” he said on the Senate floor, adding that smartphones are already equipped with these filters.
The bill would allow parents or guardians to sue manufacturers for damages if a minor accesses obscene material due to non-compliance, and the Attorney General would also be able to pursue civil penalties against manufacturers.
The second bill, SB 187, which passed 26-6, would require app store to verify the age of individuals creating accounts in Alabama. The app store must obtain parental consent for users identified as minors before the minor can download or purchase apps or make in-app purchases. It would also prohibit developers from enforcing disclosures or terms of service on minors without parental consent.
“This is important because children, minors are not of an age and maturity and intellect to enter into these contracts, to read and understand these contracts. They’re hard enough for adults,” Chambliss said.
This legislation would require app store providers to share age category data with developers and notify parents of significant app changes, requiring renewed consent. The attorney general would have the right to pursue civil action for potentially deceptive trade practices, potentially leading to significant fines.
Chambliss said that similar legislation regarding app stores has advanced in other states, including one that was signed into law in Utah in March. Chambliss said that the Alabama bill was amended to align closely with Utah’s law.
“The point is to try to make it consistent across the states, and then, hopefully, when enough states adopt it, maybe Congress will adopt it, and we wouldn’t have a different law in every state,” Chambliss said.
Both bills move to the Alabama House of Representatives for consideration.

Brown,,,,,https://marylandmatters.org/2025/04/21/health-officials-cut-inspection-backlog-of-nursing-homes-advocates-demand-more/,"Health officials say the state is making progress on reducing a significant backlog of nursing home inspections, with more than half of facilities having received an inspection within the last 16 months, but advocates worry that's not enough.","Advocates worry that some nursing homes have not been inspected in years, leaving seniors potentially exposed to unsafe living conditions. Stock.adobe.comHealth officials say the state is making progress on reducing a significant backlog of nursing home inspections, with more than half of facilities having received an inspection within the last 16 months.
But with some facilities being more than four years behind schedule for an inspection, advocates and lawmakers fear that some of Maryland’s seniors may be languishing in unsafe living conditions while the state works through its backlog.
“How do we hold owners of nursing homes accountable for the care in the places where these folks are staying?” asked Bruce Hartung, president of the Maryland Continuing Care Residents’ Association. “Without inspections, we simply have no idea how these folks are living — and in what conditions they are living.”
At issue is a years-old backlog of state inspections of the state’s 220 nursing homes as required by the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The backlog has spanned administrations and was exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.
But Maryland ranks second to last in the nation when it comes to timely inspections of nursing homes, with average inspection lag of 2.44 years compared to the national average of 0.97 years, according to StarPro, which tracks data on nursing homes across the United States. Maryland falls behind only Alabama, which has an average lag of 3 years.
The state Department of Health has been struggling to catch up on those inspections since, with some facilities not receiving an annual inspection for four years or more, according to CMS data, though state officials note that the federal data may lag by a couple months.
Meanwhile, lawmakers and senior advocates worry that seniors could be facing unsafe living conditions without oversight or knowledge of state officials, and they passed legislation this session in hopes of keeping better tabs on the issue.
“These are the most vulnerable people in our population,” said Sen. Benjamin Kramer (D-Montgomery). “And nobody is putting eyes on the nursing home to ensure that these seniors are being properly cared for.”

Lawmakers passed Senate Bill 376, sponsored by Kramer, to boost the reporting requirements on the health department, so it will provide more frequent updates as it works through the inspection backlog.
Under SB376, which is currently on the governor’s desk, the department will need to start providing quarterly reports updating lawmakers on the progress of nursing home inspections throughout the state. The bill also prompts the Office of Health Care Quality to report to local jurisdictions every six months on the progress of inspections in their individual counties.
The nursing home inspection backlog was a hot topic throughout session.
Dr. Nilesh Kalyanaraman, deputy secretary for the health department on public health, told lawmakers that the agency is making progress on the backlog, though he admitted there is still work to be done.
He said during a January briefing on the issue for the Senate Finance Committee that the estimated time to “catch up” on inspections will take about two more years, as the department has needed to train staff to conduct the inspections. Each inspection can take about a week to conduct.
In written testimony on SB376, the health department reported that as of March 31, there were 130 nursing homes out of a total 220, or 59%, that had an annual inspection conducted in the previous 16 months, the maximum time allowed by federal guidelines.  That’s an improvement from June, when the rate of annual inspections conducted within 16 months was just 21.2%, according to the department’s testimony.
Hank Greenberg, AARP Maryland state director, said that uninspected nursing homes can result in lower quality of care for seniors, who may not have a strong support system to help advocate for themselves against mistreatment or even abuse.
“This can result in preventable injuries, a decline in overall resident well-being, and really contributes to the fact that their could be abuse and neglect that don’t rise as quickly as they should,” he said. “And keeps people from being able to know that things will be addressed.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
A group of nursing home residents are already suing the Department of Health for neglect they allegedly experienced in living facilities, citing the backlog of nursing home inspections as a contributing factor to their experience.
The plaintiffs have mobility-related disabilities and rely on nursing staff for moving around the facility, eating, and personal hygiene. The lawsuit alleges that residents were often left unattended for extended periods, leaving them isolated from community events or sometimes left in soiled clothing for hours, among other concerns outlined in the lawsuit. The nursing homes cited in the lawsuit had not had an inspection in years, some as far back as 2020, according to the suit filed last year.
SB376 was amended throughout session, and Greenberg and Hartung would have preferred the original version of the bill, which would have allowed counties to sign a memorandum of understanding with the health department to take over on inspections for nursing homes, freeing up state resources to work on the remaining backlog.
The initial version of the bill was based on a previous agreement between Montgomery County and the state that expired in 2021, which allowed the county to keep up with timely inspections. The original language in SB376 would have allowed other counties to request the chance to do the same.
The department opposed that version of the bill, saying it would actually cost the state more money to let counties conduct inspections and would create other complications. Supporters of the legislation disagreed, but the bill went through a series of amendments before it was struck out during conference committee and rewritten to the new reporting requirements.
“When you can’t get the inspections done, what are your alternatives?” Hartung said. “It [reporting requirements] is a step forward … But we know that they’re not getting done, so the question is what kind of teeth will there be in that reporting?”
But both Hartung and Greenberg still believe that the new reporting requirements will help keep tabs on the department as it works through the backlog of nursing home inspections.
“We obviously need that reporting,” Greenberg said. “I’m sure that some of those reports will be responses to complaints that have been alleged … There’s a lack of accountability without these reports that could lead to increased risks of neglect and abuse and most importantly, substandard care.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/AdobeStock_581812902-1024x622.jpeg,,,2025-04-21 08:06:19.384949

(Photo courtesy Santa Fe Public Schools)As New Mexico schools continue to grapple with more than 700 teacher vacancies, according to the most recent data, some districts have begun to rely on teachers licensed through the state’s alternative licensing programs, which provide licensure pathways for people with degrees in areas outside of education.
For instance, Hatch Valley Public Schools Superintendent Michael Chavez told Source NM about one third of the teachers the district employs are non-traditional teachers and because of this, the district does not deal with teacher vacancies to the same extent as other districts.
According to the 2024 New Mexico Educator Vacancy Report released in October, there were 737 teacher vacancies last year, 34% of which were special education teacher positions and 24% were elementary positions. The vacancy rate showed a slight improvement over 2023 by 14 positions.
When asked for the total number of current teachers licensed through an alternative program, a Public Education Department spokesperson pointed to the same report, which noted that more than 1,100 students completed a teacher preparation program at a New Mexico school last year and more than half of those students were enrolled in an alternative program.
These teachers are “highly qualified” and bring years of professional experience in their field to the classroom, Chavez said. However, he noted, they are still learning how to be teachers. This is why professional work hours are so important, for teachers from all pathways and experience. 
“One of the things that I’ve been really pushing on since we came out of COVID is we need to build the capacity of our teachers,” Chavez said. But finding the time with 180 days of instruction — a number set by the state Public Education Department in a March 2024 rule and currently in litigation — is challenging, he said. “What we need is more time…for professional development with teachers so we can develop them and build their capacity in learning how to become an effective teacher.”
New Mexico’s current Public School Code allows middle and high school teachers to use 30 hours of instructional time for parent-teacher meetings, professional development and mentorship, while elementary teachers can use up to 60 hours. These standards were established in 2023 through House Bill 130, which also set a required 1,140 instructional hours per school year. The maximum professional work hours allowed previously were even fewer.
When the Public Education Department subsequently created its rule requiring 180 instructional days per calendar year, it also included a stipulation that professional work hours be completed before school, after school or on a day outside of the required minimum, so as to not detract from students’ instructional time. 
That component of the rule also faces opposition.
Whitney Holland, president of American Federation of Teachers’ New Mexico chapter, told Source NM that there are “more than enough opportunities to accommodate” professional development during regular school time and that her organization is “going to hold the line” against the PED’s rule.
Holland told Source that AFT-NM always advocates for more professional development time and an alignment between primary and secondary teachers’ allowed hours.
“I think the most valuable time I had as professional development as a teacher was that time where I could collaborate with my peers and even go into their classrooms and see what they’re doing,” Holland said. 
She said she has some concern over alternative licensed teachers filling so many teacher vacancies because teaching is often their second career and AFT wants to make sure “we’re investing in people who are going to stay in their communities and stay in their field,” but “at the end of the day, I’ve worked with a ton of [alternative] licensed teachers who have been super capable. They bring a lot to the table.”
Holland said she would rather have alternative licensed teachers fill vacancies than long-term substitutes, so long as there are “some” individuals in classrooms with traditional licensure through the PED.
House Bill 238, introduced during this year’s legislative session, would have amended the Public School Code to allow all levels of teachers K-12 up to 60 hours of professional work hours. The House of Representatives unanimously passed the bill, but it eventually died in the Senate Finance Committee.
Holland said she will continue advocating for teachers to have more professional work hours going forward because “we are looking at a holistic model of what pieces of education need to change and I think looking at that traditional school year, school day is part of that,” she said. “It’s not going to be one fix. It’s going to have to be a whole bunch of different things.”

Garrett sponsored last year's CHOOSE Act, which gives families tax credits of $7,000 for each eligible child to be spent on nonpublic education. Orr recently increased funding for the program in the 2026 budget. (Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)Our leaders call Alabama’s effective voucher program the CHOOSE Act. There’s some grim irony in that.
Of course, you can choose to pay for private school tuition, whatever your reasons may be.
But it’s not my choice. Or what the families of 730,000 Alabama students want. We pay taxes to support the teachers educating our children in public schools. And we want teachers and staff to have the resources they need to help students thrive.
Yet our leaders plan to divert that money from classrooms into the pockets of wealthy families, in the form of $7,000 tax breaks. More if they have more than one kid enrolled in a private school.
Yes, yes. Under this law, the credit could cover something besides a non-public academy. But considering that two-thirds of the initial applicants to the program are already in private school or homeschooled, it’s not hard to predict how the program will operate.
You might also note current eligibility is limited to those making 300% of the poverty level. That sounds a lot more restrictive than it is.
The cap is almost $80,000 a year for a family of three and around $96,000 for a family of four. Alabama’s median household income is $62,212 a year. So we’re already letting those making more than half the households in the state into the program.
That mild regulation goes away in 2027. Which means the 1% will get in. And that you will be paying private school tuition for people who don’t need the help.
That’s not how one sells a voucher program. Instead, you preach “choice” to families and educators locked in a public education system built on discrimination.
“The CHOOSE Act will provide an opportunity for students to learn and thrive in an environment that best meets their needs, which could be a public school,” said Rep. Danny Garrett, R-Trussville, the sponsor of the law, during House debate last year.
Even U.S. Sen. Katie Britt gets into it, claiming that her own federal version of this is OK because “your zip code shouldn’t determine your opportunities.”
Nor should dead racists, the main reason why some zip codes have a lot more opportunity than others. But even if we accept Garrett and Britt’s premises, the CHOOSE Act isn’t going to help poor kids. Seven thousand dollars won’t get a student struggling with poverty to a private school. Not when the average private school tuition in Alabama is $8,298 a year.
One gets an image of a person in an Armani suit walking into a cell block and proclaiming freedom to the inmates while holding a $7,000 check in one hand and a $8,298 key in the other.
Freeing our schools from the prison of Jim Crow means trusting local communities with school funding; ending tax breaks to elite Alabamians that drain public services and spending money on students.
The CHOOSE Act sort of acknowledges that. Implicit in the law is the premise that any private school in Alabama is superior to any public school.
Why?
Because many private schools invest far more money in their students than the $13,461 per pupil our state does, a number that would be even lower without the 18% the federal government kicks in. Altamont in Birmingham charges over $30,000 a year for high school. Montgomery Academy asks for $19,000 for students in grades 10-12.
Just think what we could achieve if Alabama spent $30,000 a year on a public school student. Or $24,000, which gets Massachusetts nation-leading results on standardized tests. Or $17,277, the average per-pupil spending in the United States.
The CHOOSE Act has to nod at the fact that school spending works. But it also operates within the worldview of a state government that promotes private privilege over public welfare. Money can only go to people who already have it. Not the undeserving poor.
And a lot of that money is about to head out the door. The 2026 education budget originally included $100 million to fund the CHOOSE Act. Sen. Arthur Orr, R-Decatur, the chair of the Senate’s education budget committee, increased that to $135 million due to “overwhelming, large applicant numbers” for the program.
Expect that number to grow even more as the caps come off the program. Public school funding will suffer. Arizona in 2022 expanded an existing voucher program along the lines of what Alabama has just implemented. It proved far more expensive than they anticipated, and it’s contributed to budget problems in the state. That could happen here, and public school students will pay the price.
The key to public school improvement is obvious: collecting more taxes from the wealthy — who pay less to the state government in percentage terms than the poorest 20% — and investing them in public education. Making the system better for everyone.
But Alabama legislators have signaled they’d much rather assist children who don’t need the help.
The rest of us have no choice in that.

“With the Women’s CARE Act, we focus on providing appropriate care for those who are pregnant at the time of arrest or detention, emphasizing the deferment of time served rather than complete exemption from sentencing,” Hollis told members of the House Judiciary Committee during its April 9 meeting.
Hollis introduced nearly identical legislation in 2024 and managed to get it approved in the House Judiciary Committee with roughly the same number of days left in the session as this year. However, it failed to get consideration on the House floor.
The bill states that a woman who is pregnant or thinks she is pregnant will have the option of taking a pregnancy test. If a woman is pregnant, the test result will be reported to the court and the county health department.
She will then be released on bail during the court proceedings. If the court sentences her to be incarcerated, she will then be sentenced to supervised probation up to12 weeks after she gives birth to the child, with the time she served while on probation getting credited toward her sentence.
Any fines, fees and restitution she owes will be suspended while she is serving pre-incarceration probation.
After that time, the individual will surrender to the Alabama Department of Corrections, the county or municipal jail, or be charged with a Class A misdemeanor, punishable by up to a year in jail and a $6,000 fine.
A woman must report the loss of a pregnancy to the court within 72 hours while she is serving probation prior to getting incarcerated, and the court will determine when she begins her incarceration.
“I have spoken with many women who have experienced this nightmare, and did not get the proper medical attention that they should get,” Hollis said.

(Photo: Getty Images)Every time I go to work, I carry a radio, a rulebook, and the weight of knowing one mistake could cost someone their life. After more than 20 years working as a conductor for Union Pacific Railroad, I’ve learned this job isn’t just about moving freight. It’s about coming home safe and making sure everyone else does, too. That’s why I support Assembly Bill 446. 
This bill isn’t an overreach. It’s not some abstract regulation dreamed up in a government office. It’s a reflection of what rail workers see and face every single day: blocked crossings that delay ambulances and fire crews, pitch-black yards where visibility is next to nothing, and trains so long they take twenty minutes to clear an intersection—if they clear it at all. These aren’t rare occurrences. This is daily life on the railroad. And it shouldn’t take a tragedy to decide it’s time to do better. 
Assembly Bill 446 is a common-sense proposal rooted in firsthand experience. It puts basic safeguards in place, like requiring proper lighting in rail yards so workers aren’t fumbling in the dark with heavy equipment. It sets standards to prevent multiple mile-long trains from cutting off emergency services and splitting communities for hours. It addresses safety concerns with defect detectors, the trackside devices that flag potential failures, by ensuring their data isn’t kept hidden when something goes wrong. And it provides oversight over contract carriers who move rail crews to and from trains, because those folks deserve to get home safe too. 
Critics will say this bill is unnecessary. That the railroads already follow federal rules and can police themselves. But ask the workers on the ground. Ask the folks in Caliente, Carlin, or Sparks who’ve watched crossings stay blocked while help sits on the wrong side of the tracks. Congressman Mark Amodei, a Republican, recently raised concerns about these very issues in his own district. This isn’t a union-versus-corporation fight. It’s about public safety, and it affects us all. 
We’ve seen what happens when railroads are left to set their own limits. In the past decade, the major carriers have pushed longer and heavier trains onto the rails under a model called Precision Scheduled Railroading. It was designed not for safety or efficiency but for Wall Street. The result? Skeleton crews, overloaded trains, and delayed response times when emergencies strike. Safety has become a cost to cut, not a value to protect. 
No one is saying railroads aren’t vital. They are. They move goods across this country every day and are the backbone of our economy. But with that responsibility comes the obligation to do it safely and to serve the communities they run through. Not just the shareholders they report to. 
Some lobbyists will argue that state laws like AB 446 interfere with federal regulation. What they don’t say is that many of these same companies have spent years lobbying against national safety standards. They’ve defeated efforts to regulate train length, mandate two-person crews, or require timely data sharing on safety devices. And now, when states like Nevada step up to fill the gap, they cry foul.
If we wait for Washington to solve this, we’ll be waiting a long time. States have every right, and I would argue a duty, to protect their citizens when federal action falls short. AB 446 doesn’t replace federal law. It complements it by addressing the unique challenges our state faces, from remote rural towns to rapidly growing urban areas. 
In the railroad industry, we often say that safety is no accident. But it can’t just be a slogan. It has to be a commitment backed by policy, training, investment, and yes, regulation. Because when things go wrong on the railroad, they go wrong fast and with consequences that ripple far beyond the tracks. 
I don’t write this as a politician or a lobbyist. I write it as someone who’s walked the ballast in extreme weather conditions. As someone who’s crawled under rail cars in the dead of night. And as someone who’s had to explain to new hires that they’ll be riding in clunky passenger 
vans on icy roads for 12 hours, because there’s no law saying their safety has to be taken seriously. 
AB 446 is a step toward changing that. It says we see you, we hear you, and we’re going to do better. For the workers, yes. But also for the parents stuck behind blocked crossings, for the paramedics trying to save a life, and for the next generation who deserves to grow up in a state where safety isn’t optional. 
It’s not radical. It’s responsible. And it’s long overdue.

(File photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters).In what many are calling an astonishing dereliction of duty, the Maryland Senate’s Judicial Proceeding Committee (JPR) failed to move “Good-Cause” eviction legislation forward. Despite unprecedented statewide support, including a 96-37 vote in the House last year, JPR allowed amendments pushed by the landlord/developer (LL/D) industry tying the legislation to rent stabilization laws, and weakening good-cause standards, letting landlords arbitrarily and unjustly evict renters from their homes.
The committee’s first amendment would have required rent stabilization programs across Maryland to drop vacancy control from apartment homes. Vacancy control maintains rent levels for apartments when a tenant moves out. Vacancy decontrol lets rent float up to market rates, often to levels new tenants cannot afford. Affordable housing advocates adamantly oppose decontrol, pointing to the further loss of reasonably priced housing stocks.
The second series of amendments would have knocked the teeth out of the good causes that would be required to justify nonrenewal of leases and the eventual eviction of a tenant who stays longer than the lease term, known as Tenant Holding Over (THO). Including minor violations of a lease or community rules, for example, as a justification to evict turns on its head the very principle of establishing a stated, substantial violation to justify forcing someone from their home.

Consensus has been building for decades that stable, quality homes are central determinants of community health, welfare and prosperity. The idea that a rental apartment is a mere “unit” no different than any commodity, like craft beer or concert tickets, has faded as the relationship of stable, quality housing to social welfare and prosperity has changed.
Nearly 40% of Maryland residents now live in rental housing not as a station on the way to owning, but as permanent housing. It is no longer acceptable to destabilize whole communities with unpredictable and excessive rent increases that rely entirely on market potential, or to evict without good reason, without considering the social and economic costs to tenants and our communities.
At least that’s what we thought …
But alongside modern thinking on housing policy that promotes affordability, and legislation to ensure stability, a counter narrative promoted by the rental housing industry and its well-financed network of lobbyists and bloggers has spawned, citing cherry-picked and distorted data.
The narrative goes like this: Things like good-cause protections, rent stabilization or stronger code and rights enforcement might sound nice to uneducated renters and their advocates, but they don’t really need them. What they really need is investment in building more housing so that market competition will eliminate the lack of affordability and disincentivize bad landlord behavior.
They define the housing crisis solely as a “shortage,” citing market demand for housing while ignoring the instability of existing residents’ housing, and conveniently omitting discussion around when or how that demand might be met in specific markets. They say all we need to do is “build our way out of the crisis.”
Industry-friendly bloggers cite the building boom of the Sun Belt and how housing prices there have come down, not mentioning high vacancy rates and low demand in some of those cities. They cite the St. Paul, Minnesota, sample where new multifamily building slowed after rent stabilization passed — but fail to mention how, when the city went back and exempted new development long enough for investors to recoup their investment and make a profit, investment in multifamily housing continued at its hurried pace.
Closer to home, the LL/D bloggers cite the lack of building in Takoma Park, citing rent stabilization as the cause.  They don’t mention the lack of land availability in Takoma Park, now understood to be a built-out community.
Housing codes and renter protections were introduced decades ago to put an end to the squalor, instability and abuse past generations of tenants endured. Teachers, police, nurses, retail workers, immigrants, young families and now, an increasing number of senior citizens are no longer able to purchase a home in a housing market that places home ownership well out of their reach.
Marylanders must ask why Senate Judicial Proceedings Chair Will Smith (D-Montgomery) and Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) would give deference to these fallacious industry narratives that set up a false choice between renter protections and building more housing, rather than using every tool at their disposal to get this done for constituents demanding action — and facts.
More than 5,000 Marylanders were evicted last year for THO, likely a tip-of-the-iceberg figure as it does not count those who move before going to court. Until our elected officials press them on just what that means, we will continue to see whole renter communities destabilized, while anger grows at those elected to represent them who failed to act.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025_feb18_renterrally_goodcause-newsletter-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-21 08:06:19.384949

Ned Lamont is championing a plan that would offer free or reduced-price pre-K education to scores of CT families. Here's what to know.,"Gov. Ned Lamont is championing a plan that would offer free or reduced-price pre-K education to scores of Connecticut families. The plan is one of several bills that lawmakers are considering to improve access to early childhood education.
The issue has a lot of support from lawmakers, parents, advocates and members of the business community. That’s in part because the COVID-19 pandemic brought the urgent need for child care into focus for many, including Lamont, and became the catalyst for him to create a Blue Ribbon Panel to study the issue. But paying for more families to access child care spots and improving salaries for workers in the sector is an expensive proposition.
Here’s what to know. 
Would my family qualify for pre-K under the governor’s plan? 
It depends on your household income. Families making up to $100,000 a year would pay nothing for pre-K. Families making up to $150,000 a year would pay just $20 a day. But households earning more than $150,000 a year would still pay out of pocket for pre-K, unless they have access to schools in a district that offers spots, like New Haven and Hartford. 
What would the governor’s plan do for infant and toddler care? 
Currently, the governor’s plan does not cover infant and toddler care, only children ages 3 to 5. While advocates say infant and toddler care is critically important for Connecticut families, especially to help companies fill more than 90,000 vacancies across the state, many still support Lamont’s plan because they say it represents a major step in the right direction.
Plus, advocates say, Lamont’s plan would maintain the integrity of the infant and toddler system that currently exists by improving salaries for workers in child care centers while building capacity and spots in public schools.
How would I enroll my children in pre-K under Lamont’s plan?
Lawmakers envision a new portal that would provide easily accessible information for parents to quickly see all of the pre-K options available to them. There are currently bills under consideration that propose this solution, including House Bill 5003, a more comprehensive plan to support early childhood care, and House Bill 7044, which focuses on the creation of the online portal.
When would these additional pre-K slots be available?
Office of Early Childhood Commissioner Beth Bye says that a significant number of new subsidized pre-K spots would be added by 2028 and that by 2032 the vast majority of Connecticut’s pre-K population would have access. Those spots would be spread across child care centers, public schools, group child care homes and family child care homes.
How would Connecticut pay for all these new spots? 
Under Lamont’s plan, up to $300 million in surplus funds would be directed to a Universal Preschool Endowment Fund. Of that, $30 million could be spent in the next fiscal year, with 10% of the endowment eligible for spending each year thereafter. In his budget address, Lamont optimistically told lawmakers, “our budget anticipates almost $1 billion in the endowment over the next few years — God, the economy, and President Trump willing.” 
What other plans are on the table? 
Lawmakers are also considering other plans for pre-K.  Senate Bill 1 would involve a four phase approach that would eventually build toward covering not only pre-K but infant and toddler care as well, and similar to Lamont’s proposal, it would rely on surplus funds. The first phase of that proposal would call for a “tri-share” model in which businesses would be asked to contribute to the cost of child care for their employees, but participation would be voluntary. Another plan, House Bill 5003, seeks to allow more households to qualify for Care4Kids, would expand the child care subsidy fund, provide support to child care workers and help with renovations to child care facilities. And Senate Bill 1369 would provide financial assistance for working families to pay for child care through a new 1.5% payroll tax on large, for-profit employers.
Why has this issue become a priority? 
During the COVID pandemic, the issue of access to affordable, quality child care came to the forefront. Suddenly, medical workers and other essential workers across Connecticut were left without child care. Advocate Eva Bermúdez Zimmerman said COVID “created a dystopian reality” where workers were quitting left and right because child care was simply unavailable and the necessity of child care to the survival of the workforce was suddenly glaring.
In 2023, Lamont created a Blue Ribbon Panel to study child care. The bill being considered by lawmakers is a result of the panel’s report, which found that the sector was struggling with many problems simultaneously, from low-wages for child care workers and pre-K teachers, to the lack of transportation in some rural regions, to limited hours in public school programs that made it impossible for parents to work and make pick-ups and drop-offs. The governor’s plan intends to address all of these issues.
With so many federal cuts, will there really be enough money in the state budget? 
That question can’t really be answered yet. With significant federal cuts to all kinds of programs, from libraries and museums to support services for the unhoused, to threats to Medicaid and Medicare, it’ stands to reason’s possible that the kinds of surpluses envisioned when the plan was drafted may not be available.
It’s notable that Lamont has stood by the plan despite all of the upheaval in recent months. Asked at The Connecticut Mirror’s In the Room event, featuring a sit-down interview with the governor on March 26, about what problem he would fix in the state if he could fix anything, Lamont brought up education, specifically early childhood. Like paying down the pension deficit, Lamont framed the issue as a key part of the legacy he might leave behind.

(Courtesy of the New Jersey Governor’s Office)Attorneys representing a group of New Jersey parents and activist groups are asking a state appellate court to weigh in on a case that could reshape the state’s public education system.
At the center of the fight is whether New Jersey schools are unconstitutionally segregated by race and socioeconomic status. A lower court judge in October 2023 acknowledged the state’s public schools are segregated by race and that the state must act, but also found that the plaintiffs had failed to prove the entire system is segregated across all its districts.
The parents’ attorneys filed a motion last week with the state’s appellate division asking it to hear the case.
“It is imperative that no more students be deprived of these rights by the trial court’s avoidance of the straightforward conclusion compelled by the facts and the law in this case — that the state defendants, who are legally obligated to take action to desegregate public schools regardless of the reasons for that segregation, have acted unconstitutionally by failing to do so,” the attorneys wrote in the filing.
Gov. Phil Murphy and the state Department of Education have until April 28 to respond to the plaintiffs’ new filing. A spokesman for the Murphy administration declined to comment. 
News of the new filing was first reported by Chalkbeat Newark.
The case dates to 2018, when the Latino Action Network, the NAACP New Jersey State Conference, and several other families and groups sued the state alleging New Jersey failed to address de facto segregation in public schools. The plaintiffs cited data showing that nearly half of all Black and Latino students in New Jersey attend schools that are more than 90% non-white, in districts that are often just blocks from predominantly white districts. 
In New Jersey, students typically attend schools in the municipality where they live. Plaintiffs argued that long-standing housing policies that led to segregated residential neighborhoods led to segregated schools also. New Jersey is the seventh-most segregated state for Black and Latino students, the plaintiffs say.
In October 2023, after Superior Court Judge Robert Lougy issued his ruling that acknowledged racial segregation in New Jersey schools but said it was not widespread, both sides entered mediation talks in hopes it would resolve more quickly than continued litigation.
Attorneys for the parties said in February that it’s unlikely continuing the talks would “be constructive.”
The plaintiffs’ attorneys say the lower court’s October ruling should be reversed. They want a judge to review what they say are six errors in the 2023 order, like the fact that Lougy did not identify a disputed fact. 
“Rather than reach the only logical conclusion that followed — that the state defendants violated plaintiffs’ constitutional rights — the trial court left the question of liability for another day,” the filing reads.
If the appellate court denies the motion, the case would return to the trial court, or could be appealed to the state Supreme Court.

Cuts to U.S. Department of Agriculture food assistance programs could hit local farmers, food banks and their users at a time when more families are reliant on them.
Northwest Harvest CEO Thomas Reynolds has been tracking the situation closely.
Northwest Harvest is a statewide nonprofit that distributes goods to most food banks in Yakima County, and has 400 partners across the state. Since 2023, it has operated the Fruitvale Community Market in Yakima, a food pantry modeled after a grocery store and one of the largest food banks in the state.
Lately, the lines at Fruitvale Community Market have been much longer than usual, Reynolds told the Yakima Herald-Republic. The food bank is open three days a week. Last summer, it served about 750 households on the days it was open, a number that’s now grown to 1,300 households.
“That’s a really strong indicator that household budgets are being constrained by the increased cost of rent, of fuel, of food and of health care,” Reynolds said.
The federal funding situation is changing each day, he said.
“It’s just a dynamic situation right now,” Reynolds said. He does not believe a complete federal cut would happen, as too many constituents rely on these programs.
If there was a complete cut, “every food bank overnight would have to quadruple what they’re doing just to meet the gap,” he said.
Reynolds said Northwest Harvest is preparing for a wide range of scenarios. While the organization does not rely on federal funding to operate, many of its partners do. Northwest Harvest depends on donations of money and food, and has some state support.
 Farmers and harvest

Adding to the situation, and his worries, are concerns about potential labor shortages during the upcoming harvest season and tariffs impacting farmers’ bottom line, which might lower produce donations to Northwest Harvest.
Northwest Harvest has increased its budget for purchasing food in case less food is donated, he said.
“The growers, the orchardists, the ranchers in the Yakima Valley are some of the most generous people in Washington state,” Reynolds said.
About 70% of the foods the organization distributes across the state are fruits and vegetables, most of which are grown near Yakima, he said. It also receives local beef, dairy, eggs and will trade some of its apples for other in-demand goods it can’t get locally, like citrus fruit.
He’s also concerned about how the terminations of USDA research positions might impact the future of American agriculture.
 Senator’s perspective

U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, a Democrat who represents Washington state, lambasted the Trump administration for funding cuts in a news conference on April 10. She said $1.6 billion in funds that help food banks, public school students and local farmers have been cut nationwide.
The USDA’s Local Food for Schools program awards funds to schools to buy local produce; the Local Food Purchase Assistance program helps states, tribes and territories buy local food for food banks; and the Emergency Food Assistance Program provides food assistance to people with low incomes.
All are facing cuts. Around $25 million would have gone to Washington state alone, she said.
“Right now, some of the richest and most powerful men in the world are stealing food from our kids,” Murray said.
Joining Murray was Cal Coblentz, CEO of Partners Inland Northwest, a food bank in Spokane. Coblentz said that at least a quarter of households in Washington need some kind of food assistance, according to studies by the state Department of Agriculture.
That increased from just one in seven in 2021, he said. In some areas, up to 70% of households with children might need food assistance.
So far, 23 school districts have withdrawn from the Local Food from Schools program because they don’t have money in their budgets to make up for the federal funding shortfall, according to Murray’s office. The program helps get fresh food to around 850,000 students in Washington state, the senator said.
 On the farm

The Local Food Purchase Assistance program and the Emergency Food Assistance Program also saw cuts of $500 million each nationwide, she said. USDA Farm to School grants also were canceled, which help food purchasing programs as well as field trips and school gardens.
“These programs support American farmers by buying their products,” Murray said.
Cutting the programs hurt the domestic market at a time when the international market is in flux with proposed tariffs, she said.
“It’s almost as if their plan is to hammer farmers as hard as they can,” Murray said.
Haley Olsen-Wailand, a farmer who grows organic vegetables on the Olympic Peninsula, said last year was the best year financially in her family’s 22 years of growing. But now, she has major concerns about the future with the federal cuts.
She said just under 20% of her farm’s gross sales came from sales to food banks, spurred directly by Local Food Purchase Assistance program funds, she said.
A grocery store might not want curved cucumbers, but food banks will buy them.
“As a farmer, having a market for secondary vegetables and fruits is very valuable,” she said.
Local schools were starting to make more meals from scratch using local produce because of the programs.
“We were excited by the idea that we had an expanding local market,” she said. “In our industry, new markets are few and far between.”
Now she’s not as confident.
“We put these seeds in the ground, and it’s months before we harvest them. We need to know where they are going, she said. “Losing these markets is a really big blow to us right as our costs are rising.”

(Courtesy photo)We often mark life’s joyful milestones — birthdays, graduations, and anniversaries — with celebrations because they signal new beginnings. But beyond the cake and presents, what truly makes these moments special is sharing them with others. The same is true in communities with problem-solving courts where each graduation is more than an individual achievement; it is a victory for the entire community.
Indiana has 140 certified problem-solving courts across 61 counties, operated by 94 judges working alongside prosecutors, attorneys, case managers, and service providers. These courts tackle the underlying causes of criminal behavior — including substance abuse, mental health struggles, and family instability — through a rigorous, evidence-based approach.
Participants commit to intensive services, frequent court appearances, weekly meetings, and drug screenings. Our problem-solving courts are not a shortcut to leniency; they demand accountability and sustained effort. Indeed, success is neither easy nor guaranteed, and graduation can take years. But when participants reach that milestone, the sense of accomplishment and hope is profound. Having attended many problem-solving court graduations myself, I assure you that the overwhelming joy and aspiration is indescribable.
And the effectiveness of these courts is well documented. A 2023 independent study by Temple University found that 93% of our problem-solving court graduates were not rearrested. With more than 250,000 new criminal cases filed in Indiana each year, we count on our judges to make firm, fair sentencing decisions to protect public safety while honoring the constitutional mandate of reform. In 1816, our founders made it clear through the Indiana Constitution — now embedded in Article 1, Section 18 — that our state’s criminal justice system promises reformation, not vindictive justice.
Problem-solving courts embody this principle, offering a structured path to lasting change.
Chief Justice Rush highlights ways judicial system is working to improve the lives of Hoosiers

Nationally, the criminal justice system has become a primary source of referrals to treatment. Our problem-solving courts offer a proven path to rehabilitation. The Indiana Supreme Court’s Office of Court Services certifies these courts to ensure that they comply with all applicable court, state, and federal regulations.
They are designed to help veterans get stable housing, a person in recovery to get job training, and parents to catch up on child support. And success for problem-court participants includes life-changing accomplishments, such as marking sobriety, reconnecting with family, earning a diploma, getting a driver’s license, depositing a hard-earned paycheck, or moving into a new home.
These are the types of triumphs that can cause a ripple effect for an entire community.
The state has limited resources, so it is unquestionably wise to use them in areas that have demonstrated long-term value to our communities. Investing in problem-solving courts is about allocating resources efficiently and effectively. And the results speak for themselves.
Our problem-solving court data shows thousands of graduates and hundreds of thousands of negative drug screens. But the real return on investment is not a number, and it is not quantifiable with a metric—it is the countless lives reclaimed.
Indiana’s problem-solving courts exemplify all that is good in our judicial system; justice tempered with mercy and based on principles of reformation required by the Indiana Constitution. They improve individual outcomes, provide a pathway for children to be safely reunited with their parents, and contribute to safer communities.
So, as you celebrate events this spring, consider attending a problem-solving court graduation in your community. Witness firsthand the transformation, the perseverance, and the second chances these courts provide. If your community doesn’t have a problem-solving court now, they hopefully will soon, as nearly 20 are in the planning stages.
And as we continue to expand these courts, more Hoosiers will have the opportunity to turn their lives around — one joyful milestone at a time.

(Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana lawmakers have just a week to close a staggering $2 billion hole in the state’s next two-year spending plan — plus, bridge disagreements over publicly funded vouchers to private schools, regulations on marijuana-like products and school board elections.
The General Assembly aims to finish its work this week, but technically has until a statutory April 29 deadline to wrap up.
“Our job, one more important than any other legislation that we pass, is to make sure we pass a budget that is balanced and done so with integrity and not gimmicks,” Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray told reporters Thursday. “So, it’s going to be hard to do now, but we’re going to get it done.”
The budget, contained in House Bill 1001, is typically the last to cross the legislative finish line. But a crushing revenue forecast last week complicated an already formidable task.
The anticipated shortfall creates a “major” challenge, Bray said, and puts “everything” on the table when it comes to cuts and revenue generators. 
“They’re working through the line items. I think the thing that we want to protect and hold to the longest is trying to protect K-12,” House Speaker Todd Huston told reporters.

Both GOP leaders acknowledged that’ll be a challenge. K-12 is 47% of the budget.
Asked how he’d justify a universal expansion of a “school choice” voucher program amid cuts, Huston replied, “I can justify that we fund students in the state of Indiana. We don’t fund systems. So that’s the way our caucus has always approached it.” 
The voucher expansion would allow wealthy Hoosiers of all income levels to send their children to private school on a state-paid voucher. Right now the cap is 400% of the amount required for a student to qualify for the federal free or reduced price lunch program, equal to about $220,000.
House Republicans put the expansion into their version of the budget, but the Senate GOP stripped it out even before the rough financial news. Democrats in both chambers have long decried the spending of taxpayer dollars on private schooling.
“They’re very important to some people in our caucus, the House as well,” Bray acknowledged. “And so, the idea of having vouchers is certainly a viable option, but we’re going to have to figure out how to pay for it if that’s the case.”
  House Minority Leader Phil GiaQuinta answers reporter questions on Thursday, April 17, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
Skipping the expansion is among Democrats’ first choices for cuts.
House Minority Leader Phil GiaQuinta assailed the voucher program as “irresponsible spending,” adding, “I mean, we’re almost approaching, now, a billion dollars there.”
Senate Minority Leader Shelli Yoder also suggested holding off on scheduled income tax cuts, which Bray said was “certainly … on the table.”
But cutting expenses isn’t the only way to plug the anticipated hole in state finances.
Cigarette tax hikes and more under consideration
Indiana’s sobering fiscal outlook may soften the Senate’s traditionally hostile stance against a long-sought increase in the cigarette tax. But is it enough?
The current rate of 99.5 cents per pack has gone unchanged since 2007. A $2 increase could bring in $318 million in new revenue annually, and bring down the state’s high smoking rate.
“Our caucus was slightly more amenable to that than they have been in the past, primarily because of the challenge that Medicaid has created for us,” Bray said.
The House has voted to approve cigarette tax hikes multiple times but Bray indicated his caucus’ resistance hasn’t totally waned.
“That’s still on the table, but it’s not at all going to be the first thing we look at,” he said.
Yoder, his Democratic counterpart, additionally suggested pursuing a managed care assessment fee. If fully implemented, the fee could bring the state $1 billion a year.
“We should be doing this (to) our managed care entities, the insurance companies who are making money off of our Pathways (to Aging program) patients,” she said. “We should be looking there.”
But it would require federal approval. Mitch Roob, who helms the agency overseeing Indiana’s Medicaid program, has expressed doubt that President Donald Trump’s administration would allow the Hoosier state to max it out.

And despite repeated assurances from leaders that “everything is on the table,” Huston was clear that one thing isn’t: marijuana legalization.
“We’re not going to legalize marijuana in the budget,” he said. He similarly batted away questions about gambling industry expansions.
“Significant public policy things shouldn’t be considered just because you have a revenue shortfall,” Huston told reporters.
Democrats, however, maintain conditions are ripe for a “serious conversation” about the drug.
Regulations for already-available, marijuana-like substances — and an accompanying excise tax — are still up for consideration, but face an uncertain path amid plenty of Senate skepticism.
Marijuana-lite tax could boost revenue, if lawmakers let it
Products with legally low concentrations of delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol have proliferated in Indiana, alongside those containing delta-8 THC and other isomers. Past attempts to regulate the nascent industry, which is booming on shaky legal footing, have failed repeatedly. 
Senate Bill 478 is the furthest lawmakers have gotten. But it needs to survive closed-door negotiations — despite its sponsor’s attempts to avoid them — before it can cross Braun’s desk.
The measure would task the Indiana Alcohol and Tobacco Commission with overseeing the industry, including approving up to 20,000 retail permits. It sets out advertising, age-limit, licensing, packaging, testing and other requirements over the currently unregulated substances; an excise tax was removed because new taxes must go into House-originated legislation.
The revenue-generating provision is expected to find a new home.
 
Medicaid is expected to be about 20% of the budget. Because it’s an entitlement program — in which anyone who meets eligibility requirements has the right to enroll — states have limited power to cut costs.


“If it works its way through the process, I do think there’ll be an excise tax on it,” Huston told reporters. He was optimistic, citing “robust discussion” across three House committee hearings.
“There’s (been) a lot of discussion about where we are on the legalization, or, excuse me, the regulation of those products,” he concluded.
His Senate counterpart was more skeptical.
“We’re not gonna do a delta-8 bill to chase revenue. At all. That’s not the policy that we’re trying to pursue,” Bray said. “If we can find a way forward with that bill, then we will.”
Despite a whopping seven rounds of edits, critics still say the language would expand existing loopholes and legalize overly potent drugs.
“The way that it moved out of the House is not acceptable to the Senate,” Bray said. 
Lawmakers are still working on a compromise, but commented, “I have no ability to tell you that that’ll pass the finish line.”
‘Razor-thin’ margins expected for partisan school board compromise
Disagreements between House and Senate Republicans could sink another contentious measure — years in the making — adding political party affiliations to Indiana’s currently nonpartisan school board elections.
Senate Bill 287 originally would’ve required school board candidates to run in partisan primary elections. But, last month, House lawmakers changed it. Now it carries resurrected language requiring partisan designations only on the general election ballot. 
The Senate dissented to the changes, teeing up negotiations.

“(It’s the) same idea, but fairly dramatic changes,” Bray said. “… We’ve got members that are trying to work through that, to see if they can find a path forward that both the House and Senate can accept. I don’t think they’re there yet, but they’re still working on it.”
A Thursday conference committee hearing — when lawmakers usually provide short updates on negotiations or outline their compromises — was cancelled, then rescheduled for Monday.
“We’re still in conversations on how it’s going to go,” Rep. J.D. Prescott, R-Union City, told the Capital Chronicle. He sponsored the Senate bill, and authored the dead House bill.
But, he added, “I think the final version will still look a lot like how it left the House.”
Gaining Senate support could be a challenge, however.
In its original form, the legislation squeaked through the Senate on a 26-20 vote in February. The House, which has historically been friendlier to the concept of partisan school boards, approved the overhauled version with greater leeway in a 54-40 tally last month.
Asked if he’d have enough votes, Bray replied, “You know, that’s a razor-thin margin. So I do not have the answer for your question.”

States worry that an executive order and federal funding cuts could weaken their cybersecurity efforts. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)For the first half of his career in law enforcement, working as a police officer in South Florida, Chase Fopiano did not think cyberattacks on police agencies were a serious threat.
Many of his law enforcement colleagues were under the same impression — that since they were the most likely to investigate the attacks, there was no way cybercriminals would go after them.
By about 2015, as technology advanced and hackers became more creative, that changed, Fopiano said. Now, from the U.S. Secret Service to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, there are thousands of attempts to compromise networks or organizations every day, he said.
“A lot of those [attempts] are toward government or even police, especially because they know that we’re not as prepared as we should be,” said Fopiano, who now oversees cybersecurity as part of a regional task force.
Spanning health care facilities to court systems, states and local communities are facing a rise in cyberthreats. They include threats to critical infrastructure, increased activity from foreign actors, continued ransomware attacks, and more, according to a recent report from the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center.
But President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order shifting some of the responsibility from the federal government to states and localities to improve their infrastructure to address risks, including cybercrimes. And federal cuts have reduced resources for state and local officials, including a cybersecurity grant program and a key cybersecurity agency.
States and localities are taking steps to address the problems, such as establishing new penalties for tampering with critical infrastructure, centralizing state IT personnel, and setting standards in areas from elections to health care.
But the Trump order and federal funding cuts, a shortage of IT experts at the local level, and an overall lack of preparedness could weaken their efforts.
In December, a major cyberattack forced Rhode Island to take down its online portal used by residents to obtain Medicaid benefits and SNAP, commonly known as food stamps. The personal data stolen from Rhode Island’s public benefits network — including Social Security numbers and banking information — was later found on the dark web.
In February, a “sophisticated cyberattack” hit the office of Virginia Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares, which led agency officials to shut down computer systems and resort to paper court filings.
Last week, hackers breached the computer network of the Fall River School District in Massachusetts. The school district is working with third-party experts and law enforcement to determine if anyone’s personal information was targeted, according to MassLive.
In 2023, of the 48 states that participated in the Nationwide Cybersecurity Review, a voluntary self-assessment conducted by federal agencies that examines how well governments are prepared to respond to cyberattacks, only 22 states reached or surpassed the recommended levels of security in their systems.










The notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.


– amir Jain, Vice President of Policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology


Cybersecurity has become increasingly important over time because more government services and data are digitized, said Samir Jain, vice president of policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology, a nonprofit that advocates for digital rights and freedom of expression.
But a national shortage of people with that expertise — especially at the local level — creates a challenge.
“The federal government has traditionally played at least some role in trying to fill some of those gaps,” Jain said. “And so the notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.”
Local governments and law enforcement agencies also have other priorities, Fopiano said. The police need cars, guns, shields, and other resources that generally take precedence over cybersecurity.
Today, Fopiano is cybersecurity chair of the Southeast Regional Domestic Security Task Force in Florida, overseeing cyber activity from South Florida to the Florida Keys. The attacks continue to rise, he said.
“Terrorist groups are getting into cybercrime, cartels are getting into cybercrime, you have kids just learning about hacking and just fooling around,” he said. “The audience of who’s doing it has definitely expanded and led to that rise in overall cybercrime.”
 Cuts to federal resources

In 2022, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced a first-of-its-kind cybersecurity grant program, providing more than $1 billion in funding for states, localities, tribes, and territories to address cybersecurity risks and threats.
The State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program, created under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, awarded $279 million to states and localities in fiscal year 2024. The Tribal Cybersecurity Grant Program awarded another $18 million for tribes in its first year.
But the grant program is set to expire in September, with no plans to renew it. At a hearing this month, several state and local officials urged Congress to reauthorize the program. But U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who refused the federal aid during her tenure as governor of South Dakota, questioned the program’s efficacy.
The Trump administration is also cutting as many as 1,300 employees from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, which administers the grants alongside the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
The program has allowed states to assess the security of their networks, develop cybersecurity training, implement multi-factor authentication features — which requires users to provide more than one form of verification to access a site or service — and much more, said Alex Whitaker, director of government affairs at the National Association of State Chief Information Officers.
“This has been a really great program because we’re seeing a lot of great evidence for how states and their counterparts in local government are improving their cyber defenses,” Whitaker said.
Counties rely on a number of federal resources to strengthen their defenses, including services provided by CISA, said Rita Reynolds, chief information officer at the National Association of Counties and managing director for County Tech Xchange. NACo is an organization that represents county governments across the United States.
The Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center, for instance — a key collaboration between CISA and the Center for Internet Security to help state and local governments with cybersecurity operations — lost some of its federal funding for certain programs last month, Reynolds said.
In trying to keep up with emerging threats, counties are still trying to find resources to help them implement multi-factor authentication, convert government pages to “.gov” domains and other methods of protecting their infrastructure, she said.
“Are counties prepared?” Reynolds asked. “I would say they’re not as prepared as they’d like to be. And in some cases, they are looking at how to strategically approach this now that resources are disappearing.”
In a statement, CISA spokesperson Jared Auchey said Trump’s executive order empowers state and local governments “to make risk-informed decisions and investments to improve their preparedness.” The agency will work with state and local officials to ensure they have the information and support they need, Auchey added.
 Lawmakers step up

In 2024, 33 states adopted resolutions or enacted legislation regarding cybersecurity, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan public officials’ association.
Many of those measures sought to protect states’ critical infrastructure, including water systems, government services, health care, and more. Florida, Louisiana, West Virginia and other states created new criminal and civil penalties for people who attempt to tamper with critical infrastructure.
In Minnesota and Washington state, lawmakers passed measures allowing or requiring state and local governments to invest in cybersecurity protections related to election administration. Connecticut and Florida also passed legislation to secure health care facilities from cyberattacks by having hospitals create plans or by supporting investments in new technologies.
Other states are looking for solutions from outside vendors. South Dakota has set aside $7 million for a company to examine local governments for vulnerabilities to hackers.
With attacks occurring at every level of government, New Mexico Democratic state Sen. Michael Padilla, the Senate majority whip, sponsored legislation in 2023 to create the state’s office of cybersecurity. As chair of the Senate Science, Technology, and Telecommunications Committee for 10 years, he plays a significant role in most of the state’s cybersecurity legislation.
Through the committee’s work, Padilla says, New Mexico is in good shape to fend off cyberattacks — and the state’s cities and counties are joining in.
“I think New Mexico is in a very good position because what we decided to do by creating that office is to ensure that any transactions that occur with state government here [in New Mexico] have to meet a minimum set of security standards,” he said.
In Indiana, Republican state Sen. Liz Brown filed legislation that would encourage state agencies and groups to develop cybersecurity policies. The bill was approved by both chambers, with the Senate agreeing to changes sent from the House.
“You have to protect your infrastructure,” Brown said. “We don’t want utility systems to be shut down. We don’t want wastewater or freshwater treatment plants or even the water supply being contaminated or harmed in some way. Our systems all have backups, but even so, we know there are bad actors.”
Some states are preparing to reshuffle their offices or create new ones to centralize their cybersecurity efforts. Arkansas, for example, enacted legislation this month to create a new state cybersecurity office, which will monitor the state’s computer networks and respond to cyberthreats.
In Alabama, rather than having information technology people scattered throughout the government, Republican state Rep. Mike Shaw wants cybersecurity personnel centrally managed.
Shaw’s legislation, which passed the House and is before the Senate, would give the Alabama Office of Information Technology central authority to maintain the needs of all of the state’s departments.
The centralization would make it easier to pursue cybersecurity initiatives in the future, Shaw said.
“The federal government is really big, and it’s really hard to come up with a one-size-fits-all solution for things like cybersecurity, data privacy and technology in general,” Shaw said. “So, in some sense, it’s good that the states are coming up with their own.”

Washington’s top commerce official says the state cannot shield its economy from the fallout of rapidly escalating tariffs, particularly in sectors like agriculture, aerospace and technology.
“There is no way in Washington state that we can cover the gap for a global tariff trade war,” said Department of Commerce Director Joe Nguyễn in a wide-ranging interview on “Inside Olympia”. “We haven’t recovered from the last trade war [in 2018],” he told host Austin Jenkins, “We’re still down 30% of exports to the Asia Pacific region because of the previous ones.”
Washington is among the most trade-dependent states in the nation, with more than $58 billion in exports in 2024 and 40% of jobs tied to trade. According to the governor’s office, new and retaliatory tariffs could cost the state’s agriculture sector $7.5 billion, with significant hits expected to apples, cherries, potatoes, wheat and dairy. India, for example, has imposed a 20% retaliatory tariff on U.S. apples, which the state says has caused shipments to fall dramatically.
Nguyễn emphasized that while the state has launched a tariff information resource and is engaging international partners like Canada, Vietnam and Mexico, its capacity is limited.
“These tariffs are even worse than what we saw last time,” he said.
Nguyễn described the Department of Commerce’s role as pivotal — but constrained — in navigating such external pressures. With 485 programs and an $8 billion portfolio, the agency manages everything from housing and behavioral health to economic development and small business grants.
“If this was a publicly traded company, you’re talking about a Fortune 500 company,” he said. “It is a behemoth in terms of the reach that we have.”
Among Commerce’s most visible challenges is the state’s growing housing crisis. Washington needs more than 1.1 million additional housing units by 2040, according to state projections, with more than half required to serve the lowest-income residents. Nguyễn acknowledged that even with a proposed $600 million investment in the Housing Trust Fund — the largest in state history — gaps remain.
“It amounts to about 2% of what we actually need on an annual basis,” he said. “So we can do as much as we can at the state to enable, in this case, affordable housing … but we need the capital markets. We need other investments.”
Interest in streamlining
Nguyễn said the state’s regulatory landscape often slows or derails projects, despite good intentions behind the rules. He cited conflicting definitions between two housing bills — one related to middle housing and another to accessory dwelling units — that have created confusion among local governments trying to comply with growth management laws.
Nguyễn said he is developing a new proposal he calls a “Fast Track,” which would apply an “abundance mindset” to housing policy by targeting areas with high need and fewer regulatory hurdles. He said the idea is still in early stages and has not yet been publicly vetted. “I have a proposal that I’m shopping with the governor’s policy team right now, said Nguyễn. “The concept aims to demonstrate that faster, more affordable construction is possible under a streamlined permitting model.
“If your goal is to build more housing, [then let’s] build more housing,” he said.
Nguyễn’s critique of bureaucratic inefficiency is grounded in his personal experience. He described the difficulty of navigating complex compliance rules required to administer state and federal grants, saying the state’s administrative and accounting manual alone is 1,067 pages. When combined with federal guidance and additional rules, it can exceed 1,500 pages per program.
“That’s longer than ‘Game of Thrones’. That’s the whole of ‘Lord of the Rings’. That’s double the longest ‘Harry Potter book’,” he said. There’s at least $300,000 to $400,000 of compliance costs associated with that.”
To tackle the problem, Nguyễn spent a recent weekend building a custom GPT chatbot using publicly available data from the state accounting manual, federal compliance guidelines and program rules. He fed in sample invoices and used the tool to rate their compliance risk as high, medium or low.
“I made a custom GPT… and it came back, and it’s fairly accurate,” he said. “There are ways for us to be much more effective so that we can still be compliant, provide the tools for our staff to be much more effective with their time and our resources.”
Nguyễn said the goal isn’t to replace state workers but to free them from rote administrative tasks so they can focus on designing programs and serving communities.
“We’ve essentially built a system where you’re trying to catch 1% who might cause a problem, and you punish everybody else,” he said.

When all the damage has been done, what will be left to salvage?
Will this beautiful house that is America — albeit in need of some major home improvements — collapse or be in irreparable disrepair?
We’re all distracted by the sound of the woodpecker on the roof, chipping away at the protective covering of our democracy. But unseen within the walls, the termites are doing catastrophic and undetected damage.
What is occurring today on the state and national level at break-neck speed is unprecedented on so many levels. We often find it difficult to keep up.
America has always been fighting with itself — with words, rarely with arms. The north against the south. Urban versus rural. Whites versus Blacks. Conservative versus liberal. Left versus right.
And, of course, we have the Democrats versus the Republicans.
You get the point. Diversity, which has taken on a toxic meaning, is and has always been what defines America.
Somehow, we have continued to co-exist. Somehow, we all have remained Americans — free to believe, free to live, free to express our differences.
But, today there is a concerted effort to tear down and redesign America into something very different.
Illegal immigration has been presented as the main area needing repair. But it won’t stop there, as the major remake taking place is to remove all diversity from the foundation of America, pillar by pillar.
Other façade and structural changes are neither superficial nor temporary but substantive and permanent whether they occur with a blast or hammer. We as bystanders or recipients often do not realize that the whole house is at risk of coming down around us.
Don’t be blinded by the immigration fix. Yes, immigration needs to be overhauled, but it should be done in the right way.
More importantly, don’t ignore or dismiss other “remodeling” taking place and think of it in isolation. For example, the removal of DEI programs is more than it may first appear. The effort has morphed into attempts to completely remove the presence and contributions of Blacks and women, including throwing out books and other evidence that document the factual and official record of American history.
You may recall it began with rendering Affirmative Action illegal, under the guise and pretext of the great lie and great illusion that equal access and opportunity are available to all citizens. The pretending and propagating continue despite the obvious realities.
The termitic behavior doesn’t stop there.
Look at the attacks on public and private education. The dismantling and dissolution of the Department of Education that provides all kinds of support for K-12 is essentially bifurcating and decentralizing what defines and constitutes a quality education for our children and the nation’s future citizens, leaving it up to individual states.
Many states are already engaged in trashing and banning books that could provide our children with a real education about the facts and history of this country.
Some of the nation’s most academically rigorous colleges and universities are being targeted and financially penalized in an effort to control who can be admitted, how they operate, and how they allow freedom of expression among their students.
An ignorant populace is easier to indoctrinate and rule.
Then, there is the wanton disregard for the rule of law, due process and ruling of the courts.
No area of American life is being left untouched by these termitic efforts to devour and destroy.
There is gutting of the military not only of personnel, but of the personal achievements and contributions of women and Blacks to this country’s safety and security that have occurred across decades. This includes removing photographs and books — all in an attempt to rewrite history and control what future cadets, soldiers, shipmen, airmen who chose to serve their country believe.
Institutions, like the treasured Smithsonian, which preserve the history of our civilization for current and future generations are not spared. An edict has been issued that targets specific collections like the African American History Museum, the Women’s History Museum, and the Art History Museum.
The purpose is to rip out or whitewash any things that may not fit the new prefabricated American house being built.
When you consider the enormous damage that can be wrought as a result of a wrecking ball being swung at agencies that oversee public health, Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security — services designed to not only protect the most vulnerable Americans, but all Americans, it begs the question: Why?
Don’t lose sight of the ongoing chipping away of the autonomy and independence of the press.
What is the end game?
Is it to change America into a white society controlled by autocratic oligarchs, where the middle class is controlled, the poor and disenfranchised continue to remain poor, uneducated, or undereducated and oppressed, and the wealthy continue to thrive?
Where freedom of the press and individual expression will be curtailed and suppressed.
The overriding question: Are we connecting the dots and getting the whole picture?
You do not have to read Project 2025. Just pay attention to what is being said and done before it is too late.
Take some time and ponder the question: Why?
More importantly, when all the termitic activity is done and a different America is left standing, will you, your children and future generations have a better country to call home?",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WeakeningAmerica2-anotherperfectday-1024x655.jpg,,,2025-04-21 07:03:31.441955

The Madison Public Library is in the process of collecting physical notes from patrons to be mailed to lawmakers. (Photo courtesy of Madison Public Library) Threatened federal funding cuts are causing uncertainty for the future of Wisconsin libraries and the programs they provide to the public, especially for those serving rural areas — and libraries are pushing Wisconsinites to talk to their lawmakers.
President Donald Trump signed an executive order in March to downsize and begin the process of eliminating the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), an agency responsible for providing funding to states, including over $266.7 million last year. In 2024, Wisconsin received $3.23 million from the federal Library Services and Technology Act (LSTA) Grants to States program, which is the largest source of federal funding support for library services in the country. 
Northern Waters Library Services Director Katherine Elchert called IMLS the “backbone” of American libraries. While the cuts could affect all libraries, Elchert said the cut would be a “direct blow” to rural libraries, including those in her system.
Elchert’s system is one of 15 public library systems across Wisconsin. It’s made up of 27 libraries in the northern part of Wisconsin and is one of the smaller population size library systems, but the largest geographical systems. It is expected to get $64,064 in federal funding — or 8% of its total funding —  from the federal government in 2025, according to DPI. 
“Most [of my libraries] are quite small and the loss of this funding will impact every single library in my system….” Elchert said, adding that patrons might not immediately recognize the impact of cuts. “It’s not like the institute is providing money so your libraries can buy books. It’s more providing large, big picture collaborations,” she said. 
Some of those collaborative programs that could be affected include interlibrary loans, a mechanism for Wisconsin libraries to share information, books and resources across the state, WISCAT, the state’s resource sharing platform, and Badgerlink, an online library that gives people access to online databases and educational resources. 
Ben Miller, library services director for the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction, said his team is made up of about 20 people, 16 of them funded through federal dollars. They are responsible for providing support to local libraries, including supporting collaborative programs and ensuring they work. Miller said that Wisconsin has had more than 15 million materials moved between libraries each year with the Interlibrary Loan programs and WISCAT.
“If we lost federal funding, we would be down to a skeleton of a skeleton crew of three folks,” Miller said. 
Badgerlink is funded with state dollars, Miller said, but the staff at DPI is responsible for negotiating contracts and ensuring there is access to Wisconsin residents. 
“Our team of people make that happen, and without this federal funding, that state money would pay for content that no one can access,” Miller said. 
The agency has also worked to make WISCAT more accessible.
“We pay for the platform, we staff it… we manage it, and we have folks that help with those referrals,” Miller said. “It allows us to cast requests outside of the state even, so you could get a book from Florida into Wisconsin if that is what you need.” 
The DPI also distributes federal funds in the form of grants that allow libraries to pilot programs that could become part of regular services in the future. 
A recent example, Miller said, is the JobPod Initiative in Brown County, which has helped provide resources including digital literacy training and technology skills to Wisconsinites seeking a job through their public libraries. 
Another example of a successful program is the Wisconsin Public Library Consortium, widely known as Libby, which provides people across the state with access to e-books and audiobooks.
“We provided money, found out people loved it, slowly stepped ourselves off, and then the library systems just went nuts and started buying books and things and now we have, like, the second most checkouts in the nation in Wisconsin,” Miller said. “We were able to stand that up, using this federal money to test the concept, and say, like, ‘Hey, this thing, this works. Let’s do it,’ and then they can incorporate it into their budgets.”
Miller said that his team is looking at the potential scenarios and working to provide service until they find out they aren’t funded. 
The last time the agency got communication from the IMLS, Miller said, was after the executive order, but before the appointment of Deputy Secretary of Labor Keith E. Sonderling to serve as acting director of IMLS on March 20. 
In that communication, Miller said, the federal government notified the agency that it should expect payment on April 22. Tuesday, he said, will be the next milestone. Some states, including California and Washington state, have already received notification that their Grants to States funding has been pulled.
Wisconsin’s library agency hasn’t had any communication with the federal government lately, though it has been monitoring for anything new. Miller said the program officer assigned to Wisconsin was part of the staff put on administrative leave in March. 
Typically, Miller said, he would be preparing to finalize the budget and preparing to put out grant applications, but he said his agency will be proceeding with caution, even if the state does get the funding on Tuesday.
“We’re holding back until we have a better picture of the future… We have questions about how this will look,” Miller said. “All of this funding is contingent on the Museum and Library Services Act of 2018, which comes up for renewal this October, and so even if we get this money next week, we’re going to be really gun shy about putting that out until we know the future of IMLS as an institution and Grants to States moving forward.”
Miller said that the agency is also waiting to see what comes from a multi-state lawsuit launched by 20 states, including Wisconsin, challenging the Trump administration’s cuts to the IMLS and arguing that it violates the Constitution and the Administrative Procedure Act. 
Elchert said the programs funded with federal money and the work of the state supporting those programs are important for broadening the collections available to libraries “particularly in those rural areas that don’t have the space or the budget to have those large collections that, say, Madison does.” 
Elchert noted that South Dakota recently announced it is suspending its interlibrary loan service in light of the federal cuts.
“My library system could not provide all of these resources. It’d be — I don’t even know how much it would cost to try and it just wouldn’t happen to be frank,” Elchert said. “So everybody is losing access to all of these larger resources that connect Wisconsin to the larger world.”
Elchert noted that the federal cuts are also affecting tribal libraries, which had their federal funds cut a couple of weeks ago. There are two, the Lac Courte Oreilles Ojibwe University Community Library and the Ben Guthrie Lac Du Flambeau Public Library, in her system.
The cuts would hit Wisconsin’s urban libraries as well.
“Ironically, this [executive order] is supposed to eliminate government inefficiency, but this is an incredibly efficient system to offer these services statewide and have them run at the state level with federal funds or any funds for that matter,” said Tana Elias, director of the Madison Public Library.
Elias said that if the funding isn’t awarded there will likely be a “scramble” in July to figure out what programs could be stopped initially and over time.
“It may be that we have to go back to the vendor and renegotiate a contract or renegotiate a reduction in service that we can afford in the meantime, while we wait for all of this to play out,” Elias said. “It’s a lot of uncertainty.”
According to a joint statement from Madison Public Library and Madison Children’s Museum, IMLS has awarded an average of 18 grants per year to Wisconsin museums, libraries and other institutions over the last 15 years — totaling nearly $70 million dollars over that span.
The Madison library was also notified that one of its recent grants that helped support the Observation Deck, a program that was being used to measure and illustrate the impact of library programming and support librarians in improving it, was canceled. She said the library had spent about half of the $240,000 awarded before it was canceled. 
“It’s a reduction,” Elias said. “But we have a plan to continue and wrap up that project with the funding that we have now.” That plan includes not moving forward with a second grant request and paying for service directly so the platform can continue to be used. “We won’t be able to expand it and offer it for other public libraries to use,” she said.
Elias added that she was concerned that the cuts could limit professional opportunities for library staff. Currently, she said many of those opportunities become available through DPI at little to no cost. She said professional training and ensuring staff have support will be even more important if public services shrink in other areas. 
“Library funding is being targeted. Humanities funding is being targeted. Arts funding is coming. We all know that education funding is being targeted as more of those funds slip away from us… as all of those safety nets shrink and fray, people will be coming to libraries more and more,” Elias said. “I think it’s even more important that we continue to have strong funding for libraries, because they’re kind of a safety net for a lot of people.” 
Elias said advocacy on behalf of libraries by Wisconsin residents and other stakeholders is essential right now. The Madison Public Library is in the process of collecting physical notes from patrons to be mailed to lawmakers. 
The Wisconsin Public Library Consortium, which includes all of the public library systems in the state, has put together a webpage to inform residents about and encourage them to lobby their lawmakers for funding.
“It does make a difference. Legislators do listen to their constituents, and I think because we are working on a statewide campaign across the whole state, we’ll hit both those Republican and Democratic legislators… I think having bipartisan support is really important,” Elias said. 
Elchert of the Northern Waters system said that librarians are “scrappy” and everyone is working to help the community.
“It’s important that patrons know that their library services will be impacted if these cuts go through,” Elchert said. “It’s not a matter of will it be felt, but how badly will it be felt.”

(Photo courtesy of Canyon County Pride)Tom Wheeler did not anticipate the inaugural Pride event he planned last June would inspire Idaho lawmakers to change the state’s indecent exposure law.
The Canyon County Pride president said the event was meant to be family friendly. But after an individual attending the event wore nipple pasties — despite requests from event organizers to put on a shirt — Idaho state lawmakers crafted House Bill 270 this year.
The bill updates the law to ban the public exposure of female breasts, male breasts altered to look like female breasts, artificial breasts and products resembling genitals. Gov. Brad Little signed the bill into law, and it’s effective immediately.
House Bill 270 is among several Idaho bills that received national attention for targeting LGBTQ+ rights, particularly for transgender individuals. Those pieces of legislation were a part of a larger effort by Idaho lawmakers to limit diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, programs; sex education; government display of pride flags; and medical treatment for transgender individuals — policies that reflect similar efforts by the Trump administration.
“It’s unsurprising, but it’s really disappointing that that’s how these Republican legislators are spending their time,” Wheeler told the Idaho Capital Sun. “They’re very obsessed with gay people.”
In his testimony against House Bill 270, Nikson Mathews, a trans man, said the bill would criminalize him for doing something as simple as mowing his lawn while shirtless. The Idaho transgender rights advocate said the 2025 legislative session was the “worst session” he’s experienced.

“Our community — every year, but I think this year especially — is getting smaller because there’s just so much uncertainty happening right now,” Mathews told the Sun. “It kind of feels like our futures are being stolen from us because of what is happening nationally and what is happening locally.”
He called the first pieces of legislation introduced this session — both of which targeted LGBTQ+ individuals — a “damning introduction” to the kinds of laws that would make their way through the Statehouse.
“This is our home and our community, and so we will stay as long as we possibly can,” Mathews said about himself and his partner. “But I’ll tell you, every single queer person — especially trans people in this state — we’re all planning for what is that line when we have to make a decision to leave.”

 At least 10 anti-LGBTQ+ policies were adopted in Idaho in 2025

(Kyle Pfannenstiel/Idaho Capital Sun)
Idaho Senate Minority Leader Melissa Wintrow, D-Boise said the around two dozen anti-LGBTQ+ bills considered in Idaho this year work together. 
“The cumulative effect is with the intention to erase and not recognize human beings based on who they are,” she told the Sun. “And that is the definition of discrimination. So, this Legislature has embraced formal discrimination.”
Rep. Barbara Ehardt, R-Idaho Falls, sponsored several of this year’s bills — but she said they aren’t connected. And she pushed back on concerns that the Legislature is making it harder for LGBTQ+ people to live in Idaho.
“Nobody’s making it harder for them to live in Idaho,” said Ehardt, a basketball coach who years earlier championed an Idaho bill that inspired other states to ban transgender kids from playing sports with students of their same gender. “They keep choosing to create and make themselves a victim. They’re not a victim. Just go to school. Be a normal school kid. Just study normal school academics.”
In addition to House Bill 270, the Idaho Capital Sun has compiled a list of legislation crafted during the 2025 legislative session that impacts LGBTQ+ individuals living in Idaho. The following bills passed largely along party lines in both legislative chambers, and were signed into law by Gov. Little:
Flags in schools
House Bill 41 prohibits public schools from displaying flags that represent political, religious or ideological views within school property. 
Sponsors: Rep. Ted Hill, R-Eagle; Sen. Tammy Nichols, R-Middleton
Status: Effective July 1 
Flags on government property
House Bill 96 restricts state and local government entities in Idaho to only display official domestic government and military flags. Schools, colleges and universities are exempt.
Sponsors: Rep. Heather Scott, R-Blanchard; Sen. Ben Toews, R-Coeur d’ Alene
Status: In effect
Transgender bathroom, dorm ban in state facilities 
House Bill 264 directs state correctional facilities, colleges and universities and domestic violence shelters to designate multi-occupancy restrooms, changing rooms and dorm rooms “for the exclusive use by either females or males.” The bill says those facilities must only be used by “members of that sex.”
Ehardt said the bill was inspired by a national workgroup that spawned from her bill years earlier to restrict transgender students’ sports participation. 
The group, she said, included around 20 groups, including influential conservative organizations such as the Heritage Foundation and the Alliance Defending Freedom, and an anti-trans feminist organization, the Women’s Liberation Front, also known as WoLF.
In women’s prisons, Ehardt said the WoLF group became aware that “men were starting to identify,” a trend she said started in California but has happened elsewhere.

Around 60 to 70 patients in Idaho Department of Correction custody have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria, court documents released in a lawsuit last year showed. 
“If they watch what’s happening in the rest of the states, it’s only a matter before they start making their claim to be able to come to the women’s spaces,” Ehardt told the Sun.
“This legislation has absolutely nothing to do with the L, the G or the B. It only has to do with the T, and very narrowly defined,” she said.

Requiring parents opt in to human sexuality education 
House Bill 239 requires parents or guardians to opt in to education on sexuality and gender identity.
The bill requires parental consent for teachings about human sexuality, incorporating an existing definition in Idaho law that includes broader sex education concepts. The law’s legal definition for abstinence includes sexual activities that can result in pregnancy, risk transmitting sexually transmitted diseases or infections; or present emotional risks. 
Ehardt said she’d been working on the bill since her first year in the Legislature. She said she pulled the human sexuality definition largely from the World Health Organization. While the definition affects LGBTQ+ sexuality teachings, she said it wasn’t targeted at that — just “all things sexual in nature.
“The sex was rampant. It could have been, you know, heterosexual sex. It could have been homosexual. It didn’t matter,” Ehardt told the Sun. “It’s not necessary. The kids don’t need to be exposed to any of that.”
This year, she said she reached out to the Pacific Justice Institute, a conservative legal defense nonprofit based in California, for help crafting the bill’s civil cause of action. The bill allows school boards to cure potential violations before a parent can sue.

 Stepping into direct action amid anti-LGBTQ+ Idaho policies

Despite the passage of many of these laws, LGBTQ+ advocates are planning Pride events across the Gem State later this year, including pride celebrations in Coeur d’Alene and Nampa in June, and Boise Pride in September. 
Wheeler said this year’s Canyon County Pride will be bigger than last year’s — and with more security measures. It will be held from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. June 8 at Lakeview Park in Nampa. 
“We’ve tripled the space,” he said. “We’re tripling the six-foot privacy fencing for security purposes. Half of our budget is invested in private security and safety precautions.”
There are 70 businesses participating in the upcoming event, Wheeler said. 
“This administration and the times we are in have shown us that we really can’t rely on the institutions that we pay our tax dollars to to protect and support us,” Wheeler said. “It’s more important now than ever to just be involved in direct action. Canyon County Pride is that direct action. It’s a day to recognize how many individuals are in the community that really do exist and have these needs.”

(Getty Images)Since 2013, a Wisconsin law has blocked workers who lose a job from collecting unemployment insurance if they also receive Social Security disability benefits.
A federal judge ruled in July 2024 that the exclusion violates federal law. Nine months later, however, the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development (DWD) continues to reject unemployment claims from laid-off workers who are also on disability.
The delay in implementing the judge’s ruling frustrates workers such as Judy Fintz of La Crosse. Fintz receives a monthly Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) payment of $1,400. By itself it’s not enough to live on, she says, but she’s able to work part-time at a college dining hall to help make ends meet.
When the dining hall is closed between semesters and during breaks, her income drops — but unlike other employees, she can’t file for unemployment insurance (UI) to tide her over during those periods.
“I work very hard on my job,” Fintz said in a telephone interview. “I shouldn’t have to have all this problem going on.”
The 2013 Wisconsin law that blocks SSDI recipients from collecting unemployment insurance passed the state Legislature with only Republican support and was signed into law by then-Gov. Scott Walker.
It was enacted to “prevent the payment of duplicative government benefits for the replacement of lost earnings or income, regardless of an individual’s ability to work,” in the words of the statute. A proposal in 2012 from the Walker administration claimed that most SSDI recipients didn’t work and therefore, if they collected unemployment pay, they were “double-dipping” and probably committing “fraud.”
The federal Social Security Administration program allows disability insurance recipients to work part-time if they are able to, however. The program  encourages them to do so under procedures structured to ensure they do not lose their disability payments or their medical coverage under Medicaid.
  Victor Forberger
Victor Forberger, a Madison lawyer who represents people making unemployment insurance claims, says Wisconsin has thousands of SSDI recipients who also work part-time.
Forberger is one of a team of lawyers who sued DWD on behalf of eight plaintiffs in 2021, charging that the state ban on jobless pay for SSDI recipients violated federal laws that protect people with disabilities. Lawyers from Gingras, Thomsen & Wachs and Axley Brynelson were also part of the case.
On July 17, 2024, Judge William Conley ruled on summary judgment that the 2013 law violated two federal laws: the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act. In his decision Conley stated that while Wisconsin law didn’t intentionally discriminate against people with disabilities, it “applies only to individuals with disabilities, meaning that it necessarily has a disparate impact on those with disabilities.”
Conley’s ruling put off a remedy for the plaintiffs. The lawsuit was filed as a class action, and lawyers for the plaintiffs and DWD have conflicting views about who should be included in the class action as well what remedies are appropriate. A hearing is scheduled for later this year to decide what groups of people would qualify for a remedy and what the remedies should be.
Those questions relate to people who made claims in the past however — SSDI recipients whose UI claims were denied, or whose claims were initially accepted, then reversed, and who were required to repay their unemployment compensation.
DWD has not indicated any plans to appeal the judge’s summary judgment finding.
Since the July ruling, however, DWD has continued to reject UI claims from laid-off workers who are  also on SSDI, Forberger said — ignoring Conley’s conclusion that doing so violates federal law.
“There’s no logic that I’m aware of that would indicate why a disabled worker today filing for unemployment benefits should be denied unemployment benefits,” Forberger said.
In response to an inquiry from the Wisconsin Examiner, Lee Sensenbrenner, communications director for DWD, said in an email message, “Due to the ongoing litigation here, we won’t be able to comment.”
Judy Fintz is one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit against the SSDI restriction. She said she thought after the judge’s ruling was issued that she and other SSDI recipients would now qualify for unemployment benefits.
“If it’s discrimination — and that’s what the judge said — that’s what they should go on,” she said.
Forberger, who participated with Fintz in her telephone interview, pointed out that based on her work history and wage rate, Fintz would have a weekly unemployment insurance payment of $81.
“They’re refusing to pay her $81 a week under this eligibility ban,” he said. “Judy’s not getting rich off anything.”
Another plaintiff in the lawsuit, Cliff Neuman, combines his disability payment from SSDI with part-time work he is able to take on.
Until the beginning of this year, Neuman was working part time at a grocery store. One day, he said, the store stopped scheduling him for shifts. He said he never got an explanation why.
With Forberger’s help he filed unemployment insurance claims each week for the five or six weeks he was out of work before finding a new job as a restaurant dishwasher. “A couple of times we called and people refused to help him because they said he gets SSDI and is not eligible,” Forberger said.
One requirement for UI applicants is to regularly search for new work and to document those searches. Neuman followed through on that requirement, but his UI applications got mired in rejections and appeals.
An administrative law judge found in February that Neuman was eligible, a consequence of the Conley decision in July. After a DWD lawyer asked for reconsideration, however, the administrative law judge set aside his earlier finding.
DWD’s lawyer argued that the July federal court ruling is not final and that since Conley had not issued an injunction against following the 2013 law, Conley’s decision could not be used to overrule the decision to deny Neuman’s UI claim.
Forberger submitted a response arguing that where new claims are concerned, the Conley decision should be treated as final.
The administrative law judge responded by setting aside his own earlier ruling and asking both DWD and Forberger to address additional questions.
Neuman was disappointed by that outcome and his inability to collect UI despite the Conley ruling in July.
Getting jobless pay “shouldn’t matter if I had SSDI or not,” Neuman said. “Once you’re working you should get that.”
The denial of his claims is “not right and fair,” he said. “To me that’s picking on people that have disabilities.”

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)As Republicans in Congress consider cutting the federal share of Medicaid funding, states are weighing numerous options to scale back their programs. But voters in three states have significantly limited those options by enshrining Medicaid expansion in their constitutions — creating a potential budget disaster and a political challenge for the GOP.
Over the past several years, voters in conservative Missouri, Oklahoma and South Dakota have amended their state constitutions to require their Medicaid programs to cover all adults below the age of 65 who earn equal to or less than 138% of the federal poverty level ($21,597 for an individual in 2025). Those states are among the 40 plus the District of Columbia that expanded Medicaid eligibility under the 2010 Affordable Care Act, with the federal government picking up 90% of the cost.
But much of that federal funding could soon vanish. Republicans in Congress are debating several options to achieve $880 billion in Medicaid cuts. One proposal would slash the 90% rate to the lower match rates states get for the traditional Medicaid population, mainly children and their caregivers, people with disabilities and pregnant women. Those percentages range from 50% for the wealthiest states to 77% for the poorest ones.
If Congress goes that route, states would have to come up with $626 billion over the next decade to keep the roughly 20 million people in the expansion population on the rolls.
Nine states (Arizona, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Utah and Virginia) already have laws on the books that would automatically roll back Medicaid expansion if the federal funds dip. Some states are considering requiring people to work, go to school or volunteer in order to receive Medicaid benefits, a condition that would trim the rolls and save money.
But because Missouri, Oklahoma and South Dakota have put Medicaid expansion in their constitutions, they can’t easily take those steps.
“Legislators cannot change that law without going back to voters for a whole other campaign to change the constitution,” said Kelly Hall, the executive director of the Fairness Project, a nonprofit that helped put the constitutional amendments on the ballot in all three states.
“Even if the federal government cuts their contribution towards funding Medicaid expansion, those three states do not have the option to reduce eligibility or benefits for the Medicaid expansion population,” she told Stateline. “They will have to find those resources.”
Medicaid is a huge component of state budgets. Including the federal matching money, states spend an average of nearly a third of their budgets on Medicaid. And the program is also the single largest source of federal funds for states.
Missourians voted in favor of a constitutional amendment to expand Medicaid in August 2020. When state lawmakers refused to fund the expansion, residents sued the state’s Department of Social Services. In 2021, the state Supreme Court ruled that the legislature had to find the resources for Medicaid expansion — a huge win for progressives.
For 2025, Missouri allotted $18.2 billion for Medicaid, with the federal government covering $12.7 billion of that, or about 70%. If Congress cuts the federal share of Medicaid funding by $880 billion over the next decade, it would leave Missouri with a budget hole of around $1.7 billion next year, according to research from nonprofit group the Commonwealth Fund. That would force the state to come up with some options to avoid fiscal disaster.
Timothy McBride, a health policy analyst and co-director of a program at the Institute for Public Health at Washington University in St. Louis, told Stateline that these include raising taxes, cutting enrollment for other Medicaid populations, diminishing reimbursements to providers, getting rid of optional medical services such as dental care or ceasing payments for equipment like wheelchairs.
Raising taxes is not a likely or popular choice in Republican-leaning Missouri, McBride noted, while adding that cuts to providers would further endanger struggling hospitals.
“We lost 10 hospitals in Missouri in the last few years. And if you start cutting their payment rates, that’s going to just put them at risk,” McBride said. “The real money is in the disabled and the elderly populations. And so if you really wanted to quote-unquote save money, that’s probably where you’d have to look. But that’s really controversial.”
The state budgetary implications of a potentially sharp decline in federal Medicaid funding have influenced some prominent opponents of Medicaid expansion to have a change of heart. U.S. Republican Sen. Josh Hawley supported efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act in 2018 when he was Missouri’s attorney general. Now, Hawley has said he would refuse to vote for any Medicaid cuts.
“I’m not going to vote for Medicaid cuts, benefit cuts. Work requirements are fine. But 21% of the residents in my state receive Medicaid or [the Children’s Health Insurance Program]. That’s a lot of people,” he told reporters on Capitol Hill in February.
Republicans in the closely divided U.S. Congress might have trouble pushing through Medicaid cuts if other conservative lawmakers from Missouri, Oklahoma and South Dakota follow Hawley’s lead.
Oklahoma voters expanded Medicaid via a constitutional amendment in 2020. South Dakota followed suit in 2022. Republicans in all three states want to impose work requirements on able-bodied Medicaid recipients, but doing so would not save enough money to make up for the loss of federal dollars.
South Dakota Republican state Rep. Will Mortenson said he respects that voters chose to expand Medicaid, and added that the state has “faithfully” implemented it. But the decision to amend the state constitution “can only be described as a foolish decision,” he said in an interview.
“A constitution is not meant to be a flexible document that you change annually or even every other year,” Mortenson said. “And so now, as we’re staring down the barrel of the federal government contemplating changes to Medicaid, including for the expansion population, our state is hamstrung in that we cannot effectively respond to those changes.”
Mortenson is one of the lead sponsors of a bill that would ask voters to consider a ballot measure in the next general election to amend the constitution again, this time conditioning Medicaid expansion on the level of federal assistance. The measure has passed both chambers of the legislature.
But some of the supporters of the original constitutional amendment say they would fight any attempt to change it. Any restrictions, including work requirements, would severely harm working-class people, said Doug Sombke, head of the South Dakota Farmers Union. Sombke told Stateline that most farmers in the state struggle to make ends meet and certainly cannot offer high wages or health care benefits to their workers.
“There’s just no extra income,” Sombke said. “And, in South Dakota, we’re a right-to-work state, so you can get fired for any reason. As a worker, you really don’t have a lot of choice.”
Hall, of the Fairness Project, said amending the constitution is the most effective way to expand Medicaid in states where conservative-leaning lawmakers have been reluctant to do so. She said she suspects that voters in other states might pursue the constitutional amendment strategy if their state lawmakers try to roll back expansion.
“I do think that it’s possible that if we see these cuts move forward in D.C., and states are making highly unpopular choices to cut benefits for people, that we will see this issue back at the ballot box,” Hall said. “But for right now, I would say we’re seeing the power of constitutional amendments to protect benefits in action in real time.”

(Courtesy photo)Something is missing from Harrison County Hospital’s website. The homepage used to feature birth announcements with pictures, names and weights. However, the proud declarations have been taken down since the facility’s labor and delivery services closed on April 1.
Harrison County Hospital’s obstetric department is one of over a dozen that have shut down statewide since 2020, according to Steve Cooke, senior director of public relations at the Indiana Hospital Association.
“About 70% of these closures were in the last two years,” he said.
  Steve Cooke, senior director of public relations at the Indiana Hospital Association.
A March of Dimes report revealed nearly a quarter of Indiana counties are considered maternity care deserts. The growing trend is concerning because lack of access to high-quality care is a factor in maternal and infant mortality rates. 
A 2022 Indiana University Indianapolis brief showed Indiana has the third highest maternal mortality rate among reporting states at 44 deaths per 100,000 live births. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ranked Indiana 7th in infant mortality rates by state with 7.16 infant deaths per 1,000 live births.
Reasons for OB unit closures include staffing shortages, declining birth rates and low Medicaid reimbursement rates. Potential solutions involve expanding access to mobile health centers, making reimbursement rates sustainable and increasing the workforce by incorporating midwives, according to Honour Hill, director of maternal and infant health initiatives for March of Dimes in Alabama.
“We know that certified nurse-midwives and certified midwives are associated with significantly improved maternal and neonatal outcomes, including reduced rates of preterm birth, C-sections and the like,” she said.
Why OB units are closing
The Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform reported more than 80 hospitals have stopped labor and delivery services nationwide since 2022. Cooke said 14 OB units shut down in Indiana over the last five years:

IU Health Jay Hospital in Portland (2020)
Franciscan Health in Hammond (2021)
Pulaski Memorial Hospital in Winamac (2022)
Ascension St. Vincent Dunn Hospital in Bedford (2022) 
Parkview Wabash Hospital (2023)
St. Joseph Health Plymouth Medical Center (2023)
St. Elizabeth Dearborn Hospital in Lawrenceburg (2023)
Parkview DeKalb Hospital in Auburn (2023)
Parkview LaGrange Hospital (2023)
Perry County Memorial Hospital in Tell City (2023)
Parkview Whitley Hospital in Columbia City (2024) 
Bluffton Regional Medical Center (2024)
Dukes Memorial Hospital in Peru (2024)
Harrison County Hospital in Corydon (2025)

At Harrison County Hospital, the issue wasn’t fewer deliveries, according to Chief Operating Officer Lisa Lieber. The department performed up to 400 deliveries a year. However, both of the hospital’s OB providers left, and recruitment efforts to replace them were unsuccessful. Sarah Doughtery, marketing and physician recruitment manager, said the decision to close the unit was not made lightly. 
  Harrison County Hospital Chief Operating Officer Lisa Lieber
“As Dr. [Lisa] Clunie, our CEO, often says, she was born at Harrison County Hospital. Lisa [Lieber] and I were both born at Harrison County Hospital. We had our children at Harrison County Hospital, all three of us,” she said.
Lieber said many OB physicians want a better work-life balance with a steadier schedule and less time on-call. Granting those requests can be taxing when it comes to the needs of a small region.
“A lot of the providers are either looking to retire or in their retirement. They’re telling us that they want to do hospital-based work. So they might just want to be a laborist. They want to go to a hospital where they just work a 12-hour shift. They just deliver who comes into that hospital. In our community, that just doesn’t work. We can’t operate that way,” said Dougherty.
For OB departments with declining birth rates, the challenge lies in compensation. Each year, Indiana’s low Medicaid base rates force hospitals to cover about $2.7 billion in unpaid health care expenses, according to IHA President Scott B. Tittle.
“Which is one of the reasons so many hospitals are struggling financially today, and some must make the difficult and unfortunate decisions to eliminate certain health care services, especially in rural areas,” he said.
Maternity care desert impacts
When OB units close, pregnant women must find new providers. Brittany Duke had three daughters at Perry County Memorial Hospital in Tell City before switching to Deaconess Women’s Hospital in Newburgh to deliver her fourth daughter in 2024.
“It’s easier for my family to be around [PCMH]” she said. “I already knew how everything ran down here, and I felt so comfortable with it all. It was stressful having to figure out whether New Albany, Jasper, Owensboro [KY] or Evansville would be the best.”
  Indiana Hospital Association President Scott Tittle
Hoosier women living in maternity care deserts travel three times farther for services than those with full access, according to the March of Dimes. Lexie Pendleton, a former nurse in Harrison County Hospital’s OB unit, said some patients were already driving more than 30 minutes for care before the closure.
“Now they are being forced to drive an extra 20 minutes on top of that to get to a hospital with obstetric care and also to see their providers for their prenatal visits,” she said.
Hill said additional travel time for OB services can become a significant issue for expectant mothers.
“Especially for those moms with high-risk pregnancies or chronic diseases, or even those moms who are having perfectly healthy pregnancies but end up in an obstetric emergency,” said Hill. “Women with chronic conditions have about a 51% increased likelihood of preterm birth.”
The March of Dimes disclosed that 15.5% of pregnant women in Indiana received inadequate prenatal care, a higher percentage than the U.S. rate of 14.8%. Plus, only 2.5% of OB providers practiced in rural counties while 4.5% of babies were born to women living in those areas.
“We are dedicated to trying to remain a place where people could grow their family if it is feasible to be able to do so,” said Dougherty. “We’d like to be a resource to help set people up if they need prenatal care and don’t know where to go. We can help them find those resources through our [gynecology] office. But they could also go to their family practice doctor and figure out where to start.”
Advocating for solutions
For expectant moms looking for an OB provider outside their county, getting recommendations from other women with similar experiences is helpful. Kate Kenealy, who delivered a stillborn infant and a rainbow baby at Harrison County Hospital, said finding the right environment is essential.
“Ask your friends who have kids, who have gone through OBGYN offices for whatever reason, ask them about the atmosphere,” she said. “[The Harrison County Hospital OB unit was] there for us. For all the moms, for all the dads, for all the babies. They were there for us personally and medically, for their career, but mainly because they cared about us.”
Expanded access to accredited and licensed freestanding birth centers and mobile health centers would also make a difference, according to Hill. March of Dimes has Mom and Baby Mobile Health Centers in Arizona, Ohio, Washington, D.C. and New York with plans to launch more in Ohio, Texas and Alabama. 
“If anyone is interested in joining us in doing that, both on the provider side as well as sponsorship side, we’d love to see that come to Indiana,” said Hill.
  Sarah Doughtery, marketing and physician recruitment manager at Harrison County Hospital
As for birth rates and compensation, Tittle said House Bill 1004 has a provision that would draw more federal Medicaid funds at no cost to the state.
“With these additional federal dollars, we can enhance much-needed reimbursement rates for hospitals, which will best enable rural birthing hospitals to improve access and health outcomes for Hoosier mothers and babies,” he said.
Another focus area for improvement is diversifying the workforce with midwifery care and other specialties.
“Making sure our emergency rooms, whether there is an obstetric unit there, are trained in obstetric emergencies because we know when we do see a unit close due to maybe low volume, that those women, if they do have an emergency, they’re going to their emergency room,” Hill said.
Despite the struggles, Harrison County Hospital has not given up on its quest to reopen labor and delivery services. Dougherty said the facility is working with three recruitment agencies, including one based in Bloomington. It would likely take four OB providers to reinstate the unit, according to Lieber.
“Could be an OB-GYN, a family practice with an OB fellowship would be someone we would look at. Midwives, we’ve opened that up. So we’re looking at all avenues of ways we could staff the department,” she said.
Hill advised women to raise awareness about their maternity care desert experiences.
“Have that conversation with providers, but also with your representatives and your legislators about how that impacts your life. Change can’t be made unless there are voices saying that it does need to be made,” she said.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)Oklahoma lawmakers are clearly scared to death of their constituents, and who could blame them?
After all, voters in recent years have forced our lawmakers to come face-to-face with the terrifying reality that average Oklahomans can band together to circumvent the Legislature’s will and force the passage of new progressive laws and block boneheaded conservative policies.
In short, by taking matters into their own hands by expanding Medicaid access for the working poor and reducing the state’s over-incarceration rates through criminal justice reforms, voters have repeatedly been serving lawmakers an unwanted reminder that the influence of rural Oklahoma is dwindling as the state’s population continues to shift to more politically diverse urban centers.
I can understand how that must be a scary prospect for a Republican-led governing body whose members typically take immense pride in thinking up conservative policies. And, I suspect that’s probably why lawmakers continue to monkey around with Oklahomans’ constitutionally guaranteed right to put their own proposed laws or constitutional amendments on the ballot.
It’s already an uphill battle to qualify measures for the ballot considering the enormous signature collection requirements — over 92,000 for a statutory change and over 172,000 for a constitutional amendment — and the 90-day window to gather those.
But just when you think it can’t get any worse, Republican lawmakers, led by House Speaker Kyle Hilbert and Sen. David Bullard, are telling us to hold their beer. In case you’re not familiar with the idiom, it’s what people say when they’re about to do something extremely foolish that they’ll likely regret later.
Oklahoma lawmakers are plowing ahead with a bizarre — and likely unconstitutional — scheme that seeks to disproportionately inflate the influence of rural voters at the expense of urban and suburban ones. 
They want to cap how many people living in each county can sign petitions. At most, that means only 20.8% of signatures can come from one county, which potentially disenfranchised tens of thousands of their constituents. 
And, among other things, their latest scheme also prevents people who live outside the state from working here to collect signatures, requires them to only be paid by Oklahoma entities and allows an appointed bureaucrat with no legal experience to decide how ballot summaries should be worded.
Supporters say these changes will ensure rural voters have a bigger say on what’s included on the ballot by forcing signature collectors to visit rural communities. Critics argue it attempts to dilute the influence of those living in urban counties.
Whatever the reasoning, the entire concept is an expensive lawsuit waiting to happen. Taxpayers should expect to foot that bill because the moment Gov. Kevin Stitt’s pen turns this into law, our state is going to get sued for violating people’s constitutional rights. 
And, they should.
Last time I checked, we lived in a state where every citizen is worth the same regardless of where they live. It’s mindboggling to argue that rural perspectives are worth more in a state where about 50% of the population lives in urban areas.
And, I’ve always lived with the philosophy that the more choices we have on the ballot, the better for our democracy. Voters, after all, deserve choice because they aren’t stupid. I may not agree with every ballot measure, but I respect my neighbor’s ability to put it up for a vote.
Unfortunately, I don’t think many of our lawmakers have that same philosophy. Let’s be honest, how often do we hear Republican legislators insult our intelligence by insisting that we don’t know what is best for ourselves or we didn’t understand what we voted for. 
Lawmakers always think they know what’s best for us — until voters are given the power to put some of those crazed ideas in their proper place — the trash can.

In September, the convictions of Robert and his brother David Bintz in the 1987 murder of Sandra Lison were overturned. The brothers left prison more two decades after they were convicted. 
“I missed my mom, before she died,” Robert Bintz told the Examiner in November. His mother passed away while he was incarcerated. “I missed my niece, Hannah. Got killed by a horrible car accident… I missed my job I once had.”
Upon his release from prison, Robert didn’t receive any reentry assistance from the state, according to his compensation request to the Wisconsin Claims Board in February. His sister isn’t able to meet his complex needs, the request said. 
The brothers are seeking $2 million apiece from the state for their imprisonment. Their compensation requests cite high anticipated costs for health care. 
“He’s 68 years old,” Isaiah Eastling, Robert’s nephew, told the Examiner in November. “It’s not fair for him to have to go and get a job like all of us, and just to try to get back into society like that. That’s impossible.”
Wisconsin law caps compensation for wrongful imprisonment at $25,000, unless the state Legislature grants more compensation, which is rare.
To award money, the Wisconsin Claims Board must find that evidence of innocence is “clear and convincing” and that the petitioner did not contribute to bring about their conviction and imprisonment by something they did or failed to do.
Jarrett Adams, an attorney working with the Bintz brothers, doesn’t yet know if they have a claim for a federal lawsuit, he said in late February. He said the brothers might not have an opportunity to get compensation if the state does not award it.
Robert’s sister, Cindy Eastling, said Robert called her every week when he was in prison. But she “had no idea that he had all these health issues.”
With little time to prepare, Eastling wasn’t ready for Robert’s arrival, she told the Examiner in November. His eye and arm were bruised, and he later told her he was beat up, she said.
He requires around-the-clock care and 20 daily medications for physical and mental health conditions, which worsened without sufficient medical attention in the prison system, according to his compensation claim. Eastling said her brothers will probably need assistance for the rest of their lives, and that they could be taken advantage of on their own.
“Bobby knows I love him, but it really took a toll on me,” Eastling said. “…I wasn’t prepared, and then the way he showed up, he looked absolutely horrible… he looks so much [healthier] now. We’re doing one physical problem at a time.”
Eastling said Robert’s asthma had improved. He used to use a nebulizer multiple times a day, she said. When Eastling spoke to the Examiner, he hadn’t used it in three weeks.
“Honestly, it scared me,” Eastling said. “I thought one morning I’d wake up and he’d be dead.”

The brothers have health care coverage, but it’s a challenge at times, Carla Broadnax of Jarrett Adams Law said in late February. 
Broadnax said that “accessing consistent care is persistently tricky, partially due to the cost associated with transportation, medical appointments, and necessary medications.” 
Housing has been an issue for both brothers, according to the compensation requests filed in February. After trying to find housing at shelters, David found a place to stay in Appleton through the help of a local nonprofit. 
David’s shared housing situation is temporary and not sufficient to meet his needs, as of his compensation request. Robert’s request said he hasn’t been able to acquire housing that can assist him with the round-the-clock support needed. 
Cindy Eastling thinks the system should work faster to support her brothers in the short term. A GoFundMe for David Bintz raised $4,165, with a $10,000 goal. Robert’s GoFundMe raised $12,829 with a $20,000 goal. David’s compensation request said his monthly disability and social security payments cover only his most basic needs. 
“This leaves everybody scrambling, [when] somebody like David and Robert gets out,” Adams said. “Everybody’s just trying to do what they can.”
Adams himself was once incarcerated and released after his conviction was overturned,and he co-founded the organization Life After Justice, which supports wrongfully convicted people. In late February, he said the brothers are receiving mental health care through the organization.

“…He’s holding back a lot of things, I can tell,” Cindy Eastling said about Robert Bintz. “And he’s always happy, but bad things happened to him in there.” 
How were the Bintz brothers prosecuted? 
In 1999, the brothers were charged with the 1987 murder of Sandra Lison, according to the National Registry of Exonerations. Testing of semen from a rape kit found that it didn’t belong to the brothers, and blood found under Lison’s body was not theirs. 
Additional DNA testing obtained by the Wisconsin Innocence Project in 2006 confirmed that blood found on Lison’s dress came from the same male whose sperm was found in the rape kit, according to the exonerations registry. A motion for a new trial was denied.
The Brown County Attorney’s Office prosecuted the brothers with a theory of robbery and murder. After the brothers’ exoneration in September, Brown County District Attorney David Lasee spoke to NBC 26.
“The prosecutors and the law enforcement officers were handling this case at the outset, followed the evidence that they had at that time, and that conviction was sound,” Lasee said.
Evidence against the brothers included statements from incarcerated people who said David had admitted to the crime.
In an interview with detectives, David Bintz eventually agreed to a statement that he and his brother were involved and that his brother had strangled Lison, according to David’s page in the National Registry of Exonerations. At the same time, he gave contradictory statements that he wasn’t involved and was home at the time of the crime.
David Bintz’s request for compensation claims that Bintz, who was intellectually disabled, was interrogated for over six hours, “depriving him of food, water and restroom breaks in clear violation of his rights.”
“During the interrogation, David Bintz maintained his innocence, but after several hours, he made confused and contradictory statements — some of which confirmed Swendby’s allegations, others which stressed his innocence,” the request states.
The request says David was coerced by the pressure and tactics of the detectives and signed a false statement implicating himself and Robert Bintz in Lison’s murder.
The Examiner asked Jarrett Adams Law about the sources the firm used for a section of the compensation request about the confession. Facts in the firm’s complaint, findings from investigative reports and communication with the Bintz brothers provided the context and basis for that part of the request, Broadnax said. 
Of 375 DNA exonerations between 1989 and 2020 tracked by the Innocence Project, over a quarter involved a false confession. 
The brothers had multiple convictions prior to their convictions in Lison’s murder, according to Brown County court records. In 1997, David was sentenced to prison for sexual assault. 
Jarrett Adams said that the identity of Lison’s attacker is now known and “nothing else matters but that. It wasn’t them.” 
Last year, investigative genetic genealogy linked crime scene evidence to three male children of a couple in the Green Bay area. In August, the Wisconsin State Crime Laboratory determined that substances at the crime scene pointed conclusively to William Hendricks, who had a history of violent sexual attacks before his death in 2000. 
“The notion that Ms. Lison was having a secret sexual relationship with a recently-released convicted rapist is utterly implausible,” the Great North Innocence Project said in a motion to vacate Robert Bintz’s conviction, according to the exonerations registry.  
Life after exoneration
If the Bintz brothers receive compensation from the state, they have ideas for how to use it beyond paying for health care expenses. In late February,  Broadnax told the Examiner about the brothers’ plans.

They both want to own a home, she said. In an interview with the Examiner, David talked about helping others.“I’d help a couple people out that ain’t got nothing,” he said.
Robert wants to travel and see the world, and David wants to eat home-cooked food, Broadnax said. 
“The food was straight garbage,” David said of the food in prison. “Half [the] time, I didn’t eat the food. I just bought stuff off canteen if I could.”
David has been making cards, Broadnax said. He sends cards to about four to five incarcerated people, and also uses his cards and designs to help with the decor at Mountains of Hope, the nonprofit through which he found a place to stay. 
“That was my hobby,” David said. “When I knew I was getting out, he wanted me to leave all my art supplies behind. I said ‘No, I’m not leaving my stuff behind. I’m still going to do this when I get out.’”

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — State lawmakers seeking to slow down annual minimum wage increases that Nebraska voters approved in 2022 have reached a new deal to avoid the law’s inflationary increases.
State Sens. Jane Raybould of Lincoln and Stan Clouse of Kearney said they have found a “compromise” for Raybould’s Legislative Bill 258 that would completely remove permanent annual cost-of-living increases to the state minimum wage, beginning in 2027. 
Under the Clouse amendment, the wage would increase instead by 1.75% annually in perpetuity. Under the current law, workers could see much larger increases. Average inflation for the past five years was 4.18%. Over the past 10 years, it was 2.63%. And over the past 25 years, it was 2.39%, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics for the Midwest.
“It’s certainty, and I like certainty, and I like minimizing the risk,” Clouse said at the beginning of April, when he pitched a fixed annual increase rather than a sliding scale tied to inflation.

Raybould said her motivation and why she keeps pushing “passionately” for her measure is to help small businesses and others who might not be able to absorb the cost of rising wages that she said could pass on costs to consumers.
“I know that this is the right thing to do, to create a balance,” Raybould said this week. “You have to always balance it out to make sure that we maintain the economic vitality and vibrancy and economic growth in our state without falling off and creating a cycle of cost increases that are so much harder for Nebraska families to be able to afford.”
Clouse has said that unless his amendment has been attached to LB 258 before the end of the next four-hour debate on LB 258, he will not vote for the measure. His vote matters because overcoming a filibuster requires 33 votes, and Clouse is likely Raybould’s 33rd vote. 
State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln has filed multiple motions and amendments to try to prevent his amendment from being attached, one of the opponents who say Raybould’s bill goes against voters.


Minimum wage types

Federal minimum wage: Created in 1938, now $7.25.
Nebraska minimum wage: Created in 1967, now $13.50.
Nebraska tipped employees minimum wage: Created in 1970, now $2.13. Wages plus gratuities must equal or exceed the Nebraska minimum wage under state law.
Nebraska training wage: Created in 1991, now $5.44 (75% of the federal minimum wage) for up to the first 90 days of employment for a worker younger than 20 years old.
Nebraska student-learners minimum wage: Created in 1987, now $11.25 (75% of the Nebraska minimum wage) for workers who are part of a vocational training program.
Nebraska youth minimum wage: Does not currently exist.



Raybould’s amended proposal
Nebraska first enacted a state minimum wage of $1 in October 1967, 29 years after Congress passed a federal minimum wage, first at 25 cents for select workers. The federal minimum wage sets a floor for workers’ pay when state wages don’t keep up.
The Nebraska minimum wage did not overtake the federal minimum wage until voters acted in 2014, increasing it to $9 by January 2016.
In 2022, voters acted again and decided to permanently go around the Legislature, opting for annual $1.50 increases through 2026, up to $15, before shifting to annual cost-of-living adjustments.
Raybould, a longtime grocery store executive who was elected to the Legislature in 2022, first proposed capping annual minimum wage increases to up to 1.5% in 2023. Former State Sen. Tom Briese of Albion, now the state treasurer, had a separate measure seeking to amend the state training wage for teen workers, while also seeking to create a “youth minimum wage” for 14 or 15 year olds.
The training wage was first established in July 1991, allowing employers to pay workers younger than 20 a lower wage for up to the first 90 days of employment. The wage expired after March 1993 but returned in September 1997.
LB 258 would exempt 14 or 15 year olds from the training wage but create a subminimum wage for the youngest workers that could stay in place until they age out.
Raybould’s version of the original Briese proposal, in LB 258, includes the following:

The training wage would be limited to teen workers ages 16 to 19. It would rise to $13.50 this September and, beginning in 2027, increase by 1.5% each year. The training wage in Nebraska has been tied to 75% of the federal minimum wage since 2007. With the $7.25 federal wage not increasing since 2009, the training wage has been locked at $5.44.
The youth minimum wage would be created for 14 or 15 year olds, exempting them from the training wage. It would start at $13.50 in January 2026 and increase every fifth year by 1.5%.

The state minimum wage for adults and older teens would rise by 2065 to $29.51 under Clouse’s amendment. That’s the same point at which the new youth minimum wage would finally catch up to the $15 baseline wage that voters approved for all Nebraska workers in 2022, starting next year, based on an analysis by the Nebraska Examiner of the impact of the Clouse and Raybould language.



The disparity between the state minimum wage and the youth wage would grow over time, from about 90% of the state wage in 2026 to about half of the Nebraska rate by 2065. That’s young workers born after 2050.
The training wage would be $24.13 in 2065, or about 82% of the state minimum wage. Raybould said it’s critical to correct an “oversight” from past legislation and ballot measures that left out increases to the training wage and sever that wage from the stagnant federal rate.
OSHA and emancipated minors
Emancipated minors would be paid the full state minimum wage as older workers, which Raybould and supporters have said would help some young parents or youths who need the most support.

However, very few minors are granted emancipation, according to court data that Conrad requested and shared with the Examiner. In the report, 143 emancipation cases were filed with the judicial system, dating back to 2019 and including the early part of 2025.
Over that period, the court system granted 65 youths emancipation, and eight more cases were pending. It’s unclear how many of those minors were 14 or 15 years old. 
Local businesses sought to employ 2,874 teens aged 14 or 15 in 2022, according to a March 2023 Nebraska Department of Labor report.
Raybould said she continues pushing for the youth minimum wage partly because of child labor laws that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration helps enforce. Under the requirements, a 14- or 15-year-old can only perform certain non-hazardous or non-manufacturing duties or work certain hours. Businesses face severe penalties for noncompliance.
These teen workers can’t work more than three hours on a school day or more than 18 hours during a school week. Work hours are restricted between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m., except around the summer when night hours are extended to 9 p.m.
Raybould said she’s heard from many business leaders who say they would hire 14- or 15-year-old workers but that the same minimum wage coupled with OSHA restrictions is a disincentive for doing so. 
  State Sen. Jane Raybould of Lincoln. Dec. 7, 2023. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
She said her family, which operates B&R Stores, Inc., the parent company of Super Saver, Russ’s Market and other local grocery stores, hasn’t hired those youngest workers for about 20 years “for the very reason of the equipment and things they are not permitted to do.”
If the youth wage were established, she said some businesses might reconsider hiring young workers. However, she said her grocery stores wouldn’t because of “too many restrictions.”
Raybould retired as vice president of her family company, founded in 1964, at the end of March. She continues to serve as vice chair of the company board and has filed a conflict of interest statement on her measure.
LB 258 would not be the final say on minimum wage, Raybould added, as future lawmakers or voters could still act. She noted employers also would not be prohibited from paying more than the minimum wage or from not adopting training or youth wages. She said she realizes workers, during a workforce shortage, are looking for competitive wages, benefits and hours.
Raybould’s bill would not change the $2.13 minimum hourly wage paid to workers earning tips or gratuities, which hasn’t changed since 1991.
‘Basic civics’
Conrad, who helped run the 2014 ballot measure that brought the state minimum wage above the federal rate, and State Sen. Terrell McKinney of North Omaha, who helped lead the 2022 measure, have led opposition to Raybould this spring. All three are Democrats, with Raybould standing alone among her progressive colleagues in the officially nonpartisan Legislature.
Much of the opposition cites the “will of the voters” in 2022, when the McKinney-backed measure secured about 59% support statewide and majority support in 38 of 49 legislative districts.

Conrad blasted the creation of a youth wage as viewing young workers as “subhuman” and urged Raybould to show where in her campaign she said she would “stick it to low-income working families.”
“The frustration is that you shouldn’t have to explain basic civics to adult state senators,” Conrad said during the earlier debate.
As a freshman lawmaker in 2007, Conrad helped keep the state minimum wage on track with the federal minimum wage after a last-minute emergency congressional spending bill, focused on disaster relief for Hurricane Katrina and funding for wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, passed with minimum wage increases.
The first bill Conrad ever introduced, in 2007, sought to increase the state minimum wage and seek regular inflationary changes, while also increasing and narrowing the state training wage and tying the tipped-worker wage to 50% of the state minimum wage. 
One of the lobbyists opposing that bill is now a freshman senator, State Sen. Bob Hallstrom of Syracuse. He was representing the National Federation of Independent Business.
A much-narrowed version of Conrad’s bill came to fruition at the tail-end of the 2007 legislative session, which inadvertently led to a temporary 53-day decrease in the state training wage because of differences in the timing of the state and federal laws taking effect, a hiccup that was added when Conrad’s bill was amended into a similar bill.



‘Stuck in a cycle’
Speaking with the Examiner this week, Conrad said the debate needs to remain focused on voters and low-income families or low-income working young people, who she said would be most hurt by LB 258.
“Anything that has caused us to lose sight of the true impacts of these harmful measures is a distraction, and if Senator Raybould wants to perpetuate some sort of personal attacks or can’t defend her own position in financial conflict, that’s on her,” Conrad said. “Senator Raybould is not a victim.”
Conrad said she and Raybould have been friends for a long time and agree on more than they disagree. While this “sharp disagreement … is painful for both of us,” Conrad said she continues to consider Raybould a friend.

McKinney has said a “common theme” of the 2025 session so far has been to go against voters, whether it be weakening paid sick leave, medical cannabis or minimum wage measures. He called it “sad, to say the least.” He unsuccessfully tried to raise the state minimum wage with legislation in 2021, before leading the 2022 ballot measure.
“When you have stagnant wages, you have people stuck in a cycle,” McKinney said during the previous debate. “And then you have people telling people to pull yourselves up by your bootstraps, do all these things, but we have stagnant wages.”
Raybould has described her bill as exercising the Legislature’s referendum power to modify, amend or repeal voter-enacted laws. 
‘A very temporary measure’
State Sen. Kathleen Kauth of the Millard area, who chairs the Business and Labor Committee that advanced Raybould’s bill, said she was very much against the Raybould and Briese ideas when the youth minimum wage would have applied to 16 or 17 year olds.
Once Raybould limited the youth minimum wage to 14 or 15 year olds, citing the federal restrictions, Kauth came on board.
“Raising the minimum wage does nothing more than a very temporary measure to make you feel good for a little bit,” Kauth said.

She continued: “If you have not improved your skills, you haven’t taken on more responsibility, got more education, or done something to differentiate yourself and improve, then everybody’s going to just kind of float at that same level and everything becomes more expensive.”
Looming reelection decision
Next year, Raybould will have a choice to make on whether she runs for reelection, but she said she has “never cared, not ever” about whether she is reelected. Instead, she said she cares about “doing the right thing every day for the right reasons that help the most Nebraskans.”
She said she’s heard from constituents who have thanked her for the measure, as well as others who have called her self-serving, self-centered and selfish. Of the hits, she said, “I just have to take those.”
Raybould said her constituents know her, that she is informed and does her “homework,” and that her 2026 reelection decision is up to central Lincoln voters. She previously served four years as a Lancaster County commissioner and eight years as a member of the Lincoln City Council, and she was the Democratic candidate in 2018 against U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb.
“It’s really up to them to make that decision if they want me to run again or if they want someone else,” Raybould said. “And if they want someone else, I would support that too.”



Eligibility for the Nebraska, federal minimum wage
The federal minimum wage did not apply to most workers until 1978:

In October 1938, the wage went into effect for employees engaged in interstate commerce or in producing goods for interstate commerce.
Beginning September 1961, at a slightly lower rate than interstate commerce employees, the wage extended to workers of large retail or service enterprises, as well as those in local transit, construction or gas stations.
By February 1967, state or local government employees in hospitals, nursing homes and schools, as well as workers in laundries, dry cleaners and large hotels, motels, restaurants or farms were covered. Between 1970 and 1978, farm workers were paid at a lower rate.
Beginning January 1978, the federal minimum wage extended to most nonexempt workers at one minimum wage, $2.65 at the time.

Nebraska created a state minimum wage in 1967, applying in that case to workers not covered by the federal minimum wage until 1978. The Nebraska minimum wage has now surpassed the federal minimum wage and must be paid to all workers in businesses employing four or more employees. For smaller businesses, the federal minimum wage must be paid.

Not anymore.
Idaho Senate signs off on proposed anti-marijuana constitutional amendment

Skaug, a Nampa Republican, supported two bills this legislative session taking aim at marijuana use: one to impose a mandatory minimum $300 fine for possession and another that would take away the right of voters to legalize pot at the ballot box.
He believes other states are starting to regret liberalizing marijuana use, because of potential health concerns and lackluster revenues from marijuana sales.
“Looking around at other states that have legalized marijuana, it’s not improved their states as a place to raise a family, to do business,” he said. “It just hasn’t come through with the promises that we heard years ago for those states.”
Idaho’s not alone. After years of expanding legal access, lawmakers in several states this year have targeted marijuana in various ways.
To help close budget gaps, officials in Maryland, Michigan and New Jersey have proposed raising marijuana taxes. Health concerns have pushed lawmakers in states including Colorado and Montana to attempt to cap the level of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the primary psychoactive component in cannabis, in marijuana products sold at dispensaries. And some lawmakers have even tried to roll back voter-approved medical marijuana programs.













Looking around at other states that have legalized marijuana, it's not improved their states.


– Idaho Republican state Rep. Bruce Skaug





“This year in particular, we’re playing defense a lot more than we have in the past,” said Morgan Fox, political director at the advocacy group National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, or NORML.
To some extent, he said, the pendulum on marijuana liberalization is swinging back. But Fox said recent legislative efforts are not indicative of waning public support for legalization. He said prohibitionist politicians have been emboldened to act against the will of voters.
 Polling shows most adults say cannabis should be legal for medical, recreational use

Polling from the Pew Research Center has found little change in support for legalization in recent years: 57% of U.S. adults say that marijuana should be legal for medical and recreational purposes.
Colorado and Washington state began allowing recreational marijuana sales in 2014. Today, 24 states and the District of Columbia allow recreational sales, and 39 states and the district have sanctioned medical marijuana.
“There’s been this air of inevitability for a while,” said Daniel Mallinson, an associate professor of public policy at Penn State Harrisburg who researches marijuana legalization.
With medical marijuana programs operational in most states, Mallinson said there is pressure to expand recreational marijuana, especially given uncertainty over whether the federal government will act on the issue.
“Recreational is still in its takeoff period,” he said.
But he acknowledged that new medical research has raised concerns among some lawmakers. One study published in January found a link between heavy marijuana use and memory function. Other studies have found a higher risk of heart attacks among people who use cannabis.
Mallinson said the research on marijuana is “very young,” as many institutions are wary of conducting clinical trials because of federal drug laws. The federal government classifies marijuana as a Schedule I drug — the same classification as drugs such as heroin and ecstasy.
“There’s a mixture of science and politics in this area,” he said. “ … I could imagine seeing in these really conservative states like Idaho, you know, this kind of a backlash, like, we don’t want this here at all, so we’re going to try to put up barriers to even considering it.”
 A debate headed for the ballot

In Idaho, Skaug said he pursued the state’s new mandatory $300 fine for marijuana possession to bring more consistency to how the state handles marijuana cases.
While Idaho law previously allowed fines of up to $1,000, he said judges had issued fines as low as $2.50.
  Rep. Bruce D. Skaug, R- Nampa, listens to proceedings on the House floor at the State Capitol building in Boise on Jan. 23, 2024. (Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)
“So that wasn’t the right message. That’s not even worth the time to write the ticket,” he said. “So it’s not that we’re going to arrest more people for misdemeanor possession of marijuana, but there will be more citations in the amount of $300.”
Skaug also backed a proposed constitutional amendment that would give only the Legislature the power to legalize marijuana and other drugs. That question will go to voters next year.
Skaug said he’s worried outside groups would influence a public vote to legalize marijuana by pouring millions into a ballot initiative campaign. If the amendment he supports passes, it wouldn’t ban pot — it would leave legalization up to lawmakers.
“If the evidence comes back that says marijuana or some other drug is positive in the medical community and a good thing, then the Legislature can legalize that,” he said. “But we’re going to leave it with the Legislature.”
Advocates have been trying without success to get enough signatures to put a medical marijuana question on the ballot for more than a decade in Idaho, said Democratic state Rep. Ilana Rubel. The House minority leader, Rubel said she hit “a firm brick wall” in pitching medical marijuana legislation in Boise, where GOP lawmakers privately tell her they don’t want to look soft on crime.

She views the proposed amendment as another example of the GOP super majority-controlled Statehouse being out of touch with regular Idahoans. She said the state’s closed Republican primaries have led to more conservative stances from lawmakers.
“This is one of those issues where there is just a huge, huge gap between what the people of Idaho want and what they’re going to get from their Legislature,” she said.
A 2022 poll commissioned by the Idaho Statesman found that nearly 70% of Idahoans supported legalizing medical marijuana.
But even discussions about medical marijuana are shut down in Idaho because of concerns about problems with drugs in liberal cities such as Portland and Seattle, Rubel said.
“A very large number of red states have legalized medical marijuana, and they haven’t seen any of the parade of horribles that has been presented whenever we introduce this idea,” she said. “There’s just a lot of hysteria and paranoia about where this is going to lead that is really not tied to reality.”
 Targeting marijuana potency, revenues

In several states, lawmakers have aimed to restrict the potency of marijuana products.
Montana state Sen. Greg Hertz, a Republican, said he doesn’t want to end recreational marijuana sales, which voters approved in 2020. But he said today’s products are much stronger than people may realize.
“People were voting for Woodstock weed, not this new high-THC marijuana,” he said.
A bill he sponsored this year would have banned sales of recreational marijuana products, including flower and edibles, exceeding THC levels of 15%. Montana currently allows up to 35% THC in flower, with no limit on other products.
That legislation stalled, but Hertz said he plans to pitch a similar measure during Montana’s next legislative session in 2027.
A separate bill reducing the state’s dosage of THC for edibles recently passed the Legislature. The measure, which now heads to Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte, would change the individual dosage limit on edibles such as gummies from 10 milligrams to 5 milligrams.
Hertz said the state rushed into its liberalization of marijuana without fully understanding the consequences.
He pointed to state health department data showing rising emergency room visits related to marijuana and dozens of cannabis poisoning cases in recent years — including 36 involving children 10 years or younger.
“We probably opened up the barn door too wide,” he said. “I’m just trying to slow this down a little bit.”

With many states facing gaping budget holes this year, marijuana has proven a popular target from Democrats and Republicans looking to raise revenues without across-the-board tax increases.
Maryland Democratic Gov. Wes Moore in January proposed hiking the cannabis tax from 9% to 15% to help close the state’s $3 billion budget hole. In March, lawmakers agreed to a budget framework that would raise the state marijuana tax to 12%.
Ohio Republican Gov. Mike DeWine proposed doubling marijuana taxes from 10% to 20% — a notion that has so far faced opposition in the Legislature.
In Michigan, Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer proposed a new 32% wholesale tax on marijuana growers to help fund road improvements. That tax would be on top of the 10% excise tax on recreational marijuana and the state’s 6% sales tax.
Whitmer said it would close a loophole that has exempted the marijuana industry from wholesale tax, which is applied to cigarettes and other tobacco products. Michigan lawmakers, split sharply along partisan lines, have until Sept. 30 to approve a state budget.
Lawmakers in some states have even taken aim at voter-approved medical marijuana programs this year.
In South Dakota, a bill that failed in committee would have gutted the medical marijuana program overwhelmingly approved by voters in 2020.
In November, Nebraska voters widely supported ballot measures to roll out a medical marijuana program — winning majority support in each of the state’s 49 legislative districts.
But setting up the regulatory scheme has proven controversial, the Nebraska Examiner reported. Lawmakers are pursuing legislation that would define which medical conditions and forms of cannabis would qualify.
Medical marijuana advocates say overly strict rules would hamper the program and undermine the will of voters. But some legislators insist on limitations to prevent widespread access to marijuana.
“We make it legal for anything and everything, it’s essentially recreational marijuana at that point,” state Sen. Rick Holdcroft, a Republican, told the Nebraska Examiner this month.

The M7.3 Hebgen Lake earthquake caused severe damage and killed 28 people, most notably due to a landslide into a campground in Madison Canyon downstream from Hebgen dam.

(Photo courtesy of the U.S. Geological Survey)In the summer of 1959, the west Yellowstone region experienced one of the largest Rocky Mountain earthquakes in instrumented history.
The M7.3 Hebgen Lake earthquake caused severe damage and killed 28 people, most notably due to a landslide into a campground in Madison Canyon downstream from Hebgen dam. Here, roughly 30 million cubic meters (imagine 30 million washing machines!) of material from the north-facing slope of Madison Canyon came crashing down in the night, burying the campground and damming the Madison River to form Earthquake Lake.
We have learned a lot from destructive historic earthquakes like that at Hebgen Lake. The evidence it left on the landscape, such as fault scarps (steep breaks in slope where vertical displacement occurred along the fault), are especially important for understanding prehistoric earthquakes.
The study of such earthquakes, called paleoseismology, can help to better characterize earthquake-producing faults by providing information about the recurrence and magnitudes of past earthquakes.
  These are the epicenters of 6,188 earthquakes in the Hebgen Lake region since 1990 as determined by the University of Utah Seismograph Stations and the Montana Bureau of Mines and Geology. All epicenters have horizontal uncertainties of 1.0 km or less. Black contour lines show subsidence (in 2-foot intervals) resulting from the 1959 M7.3 Hebgen Lake earthquake (epicenter shown by red star). Magenta line segments show faults that ruptured during the 1959 earthquake and green line segments are Late Quaternary faults from the USGS Quaternary Fault and Fold Database. (Courtesy of the U.S. Geological Survey)
Lakes are becoming increasingly popular in paleoseismic studies. Their regular sedimentation patterns can refine earthquake-timing estimates and can potentially capture earthquakes that may not have ruptured the ground surface but still produced substantial ground shaking.
This subdiscipline is called lacustrine paleoseismology and has been typically practiced in deep, steep, glacially influenced lake systems, like those along the Teton Range to the south.
Because the impacts of the Hebgen Lake earthquake have been documented, a thorough understanding of how this earthquake affected nearby lake basins could teach us to interpret hidden earthquake records in different types of lakes — especially in shallow lakes with gentle slopes, like Henrys Lake just west of West Yellowstone in Idaho.
In the late winter of 2023, our team from the U.S. Geological Survey Geologic Hazards Science Center set out to Henrys Lake with the hypothesis that this shallow lake basin contains evidence of the 1959 Hebgen Lake earthquake. Because Henrys Lake is only about about 15 miles from the earthquake epicenter and therefore experienced strong to very strong shaking, it is fair to assume that lake sediment may have been disturbed.
To test this hypothesis, we extracted seven sediment cores, each about a little over 6 feet long, along an east-west transect across Henrys Lake during winter 2023. A benefit of working on lakes in the winter is that standing on solid (icy) ground can offer a steadier working environment than trying to collect sediment cores from a boat. Just like ice fishing, we used an ice auger to make a hole through the frozen lake surface and plunged the coring device into the water and then into the lake floor, keeping it leashed on a rope to pull it back up once the sediment was collected.
The cores were examined at the USGS Pacific Coastal Marine Science Center core lab, which is specially equipped for imaging and sampling sediment cores.
A common signature of earthquake disturbance within sediment cores results from sediment failure of the lake margin, transport downslope, and deposition in central areas of the lake basin. Cores from multiple locations in Henrys Lake contained a thin (2 inch), distinct, gray sandy layer in their upper portion that appeared to be a record of a recent earthquake.
The challenge was then to test if this layer matched the timing of the 1959 earthquake.
This was done by measuring the concentration of the chemical component Cesium-137 (137Cs) with depth. 137Cs was produced during atmospheric nuclear testing in the mid-20th century, so the concentration in sediment can be matched with the known frequency of nuclear testing through time to establish the age of the sediment layer.
For example, above ground nuclear testing increased around 1954, and the concentration of 137Cs in sediments starts to grow from undetectable levels to detectable that year. Conversely, the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty was signed in 1963, so sediment of this age has peak 137Cs concentration that drastically drops immediately thereafter (which is toward the top of the core in the most recently deposited sediment).
These defined concentration levels should essentially bound the 1959 earthquake deposit in the sedimentary record!
So, what about that outstanding layer of sand hypothesized to be associated with the 1959 earthquake? When pairing the 137Cs concentration data with the sedimentological data, we found that the sand deposit was indeed bracketed between 1954 and 1963, providing solid evidence that this layer probably formed during the 1959 Hebgen Lake earthquake.
  This is a photo and graphic of the 1959 Hebgen Lake earthquake deposit in sediment core from Henrys Lake, Idaho, with references to Cesium-137 activity (or concentration). Changes in Cesium-137 are related to atmospheric nuclear tests and provide a means of dating the deposit; those measurements are plotted on the right with depth of the core. (Courtesy of the U.S. Geological Survey)
With evidence that sediment at the bottom of Henrys Lake does, indeed, contain records of past earthquakes, the next goal was to look for other prehistoric earthquakes using the 1959 Hebgen Lake deposit as a reference.
However, there were no such similar deposits with the same sediment character and presence in multiple cores. Using radiocarbon dating techniques, we were able to establish that the very lowest portions of the cores were approximately 5,000 years old.
Does this mean that there have not been earthquakes similar in intensity to the Hebgen Lake earthquake in the last 5,000 years? Not exactly.
The lowermost layer of the cores — the 5,000-year-old layer — is consistent with deposits from a marshy wetland, not a lake at all! Marshy wetlands are saturated areas with a lot of plants and grasses that typically produce organic-rich soils and not finely layered sediment like lakes do, making them much less likely to record an earthquake.
Based on estimates of sedimentation rate, it appears that Henrys Lake likely only changed from a marshy wetland to a shallow lake less than about 1,000 years ago.
Although there is a lot more to explore about the specific evolution of Henrys Lake and other lakes in the west Yellowstone area, it is promising that a shallow lake with gentle sloping margins can record earthquake shaking. These findings provide increased confidence in our ability to investigate shaking-related deposits in other lakes with similar characteristics in the Rocky Mountain region or beyond.

(Photo: Cassandra Stephenson)West Tennessee soybean farmers already on the heels of a tough year are now facing challenges posed by the remnants of early April floods.
Gina Ward’s low-lying fields near Rives and the Obion River flooded in February, requiring the third-generation farm to make costly repairs to the private levee attached to their land.
Just a few weeks later, the majority of the levee was once again washed away in a near-record-setting flood after rain drenched Northwest Tennessee and surrounding areas.
The 96-hour rain event was the second-highest for the Obion, Forked Deer and Loosahatchie Rivers, according to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
When the water finally began to recede from Ward’s drowned fields about 10 days later, it left craters and debris. 
“It looks like the surface of the moon now,” she said.
Soybeans cover more acres than any other row crop in Tennessee, according to the University of Tennessee. The crop is most popular in the state’s west and central regions.
April typically marks the beginning of the planting season. Ward had not yet planted her fields when the storms began on April 3, but she wants to get seeds in the ground as soon as possible to maximize her yield. 
She has started planting in fields on higher ground. But the sandy moonscape left behind by the flood in lower-lying areas will take a lot of time and work before it’s ready to be planted again, Ward said.

Stefan Maupin, executive director of the Tennessee Soybean Production Council, said most of the flooded land was not planted. 
“The farmers who farm that low-lying ground know that it’s best to wait as long as possible to get outside of flooding season before they start planting that ground,” he said.
But the flooding has pushed back their planting dates, which could lead to lower yields.
“Conventional wisdom in any farming is to get your crop in early, and that’s going to be a little difficult to do on hundreds of thousands of acres in these flood plains, because the water is going to have to go down, and the fields will have to dry,” Maupin said.
Field maintenance could also prove expensive and time-consuming for farmers whose fields were left littered with debris, covered in sediment or rutted by receding flood water.
These delays and extra expenses compound the losses soybean farmers saw in 2024.
Soybean prices paid to Tennessee producers dropped 16% in 2024 compared to 2023, despite farmers planting around 15% more acreage, according to the University of Tennessee Institute of Agriculture. 
Like any other business, a farmer’s goal is to make a return on their investment, and planting requires significant capital up front, Maupin said. Profit margins are thin due to high interest rates and inflated costs for things like fuel, fertilizer, and pesticides. 
“Last year they had no profit in corn, wheat, soybeans and cotton, and they lost a lot of money,” he said. “This year, the prices and the input costs are not any better, so they needed to be able to reduce their costs as much as possible. For those who farm in these flooded areas, it is only going to drive up their costs to put a crop there.”

(Getty Images)In the relentless grip of the opioid epidemic, a surge of tragedies has changed our communities, destroyed families and taken lives.
Since 2000, the United States has seen a dramatic rise in drug overdose-related deaths, including prescription opioids. According to data from the National Institute on Drug Abuse, drug-involved overdoses have doubled since 2015, with approximately 107,000 people dying from a drug-involved overdose. 
Need to get rid of old prescriptions? East Idaho drop off sites open April 26.

Opioid-related deaths aren’t just in the streets of Stockton or the alleyways of Portland, but rather, opioid death touches the lives of everyone in our community. 
These numbers are rising as the opioid epidemic continues to affect communities across the country — and Idaho is not immune. According to the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, in 2022, there were 270 opioid-related deaths across the state and 755 emergency room visits relating to an opioid overdose emergency.
Opioids are often referred to as narcotics and are medications that doctors prescribe to alleviate pain. There are many types of prescribed opioids, such as codeine, fentanyl, hydrocodone, oxycodone, oxymorphone and morphine. 
They are used by people of all ages and walks of life for those suffering from ailments, recovering from an injury or surgery, and needing relief from pain. As we have seen the opioid epidemic sweep across the country, we know opioids can be highly addictive and highly devastating. 
When opioids are used to manage pain for long periods, the risk of addiction rises. A prolonged period of taking opioids puts a person at risk of relying on the drug for survival. This problem is more common than it seems, with opioid overdoses taking the lives of 90 people by accident daily, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. 
Idaho’s youth is no exception to this epidemic. According to the Idaho Healthy Youth Survey, most Idaho students do not misuse prescription drugs. However, of those that do, 72.8% of them said they misuse pain relievers, 30.7% misuse depressants and 30.7% misuse stimulants. Additionally, students who misuse prescription drugs say they do so within their own homes. 
Blue Cross of Idaho and the Meridian Anti-Drug Coalition are proud to partner for the sixth time to host Prescription Drug Take-Back Day. Since 2018, our annual partnership has safely disposed of approximately 1.9 tons of unwanted medication. 
On April 27, 2024, bring all your old, expired, and unwanted medications to Blue Cross of Idaho’s headquarters in Meridian to safely dispose of these substances. Our event is an opportunity to clean out that medicine cabinet and see what is expired and should be disposed of before possibly getting into the wrong hands. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration noted that take-back programs are the best way to dispose of unused or expired prescriptions and over-the-counter medicines safely. 
Opioid addiction and abuse know no bounds to who it affects; addiction does not discriminate, affecting all ages and backgrounds. It is a disease that affects families, friends, neighbors, and people we love, and maybe has affected us personally.
Join us in making a positive and long-lasting effect on our community and potentially saving a life by turning in your household prescription medications.

Many of his law enforcement colleagues were under the same impression — that since they were the most likely to investigate the attacks, there was no way cybercriminals would go after them.
By about 2015, as technology advanced and hackers became more creative, that changed, Fopiano said. Now, from the U.S. Secret Service to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, there are thousands of attempts to compromise networks or organizations every day, he said.
“A lot of those (attempts) are toward government or even police, especially because they know that we’re not as prepared as we should be,” said Fopiano, who now oversees cybersecurity as part of a regional task force.

Spanning health care facilities to court systems, states and local communities are facing a rise in cyberthreats. They include threats to critical infrastructure, increased activity from foreign actors, continued ransomware attacks and more, according to a recent report from the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center.
But President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order shifting some of the responsibility from the federal government to states and localities to improve their infrastructure to address risks, including cybercrimes. And federal cuts have reduced resources for state and local officials, including a cybersecurity grant program and a key cybersecurity agency.
States and localities are taking steps to address the problems, such as establishing new penalties for tampering with critical infrastructure, centralizing state IT personnel and setting standards in areas from elections to health care.
But the Trump order and federal funding cuts, a shortage of IT experts at the local level and an overall lack of preparedness could weaken their efforts.
In December, a major cyberattack forced Rhode Island to take down its online portal used by residents to obtain Medicaid benefits and SNAP, commonly known as food stamps. The personal data stolen from Rhode Island’s public benefits network — including Social Security numbers and banking information — was later found on the dark web.
In February, a “sophisticated cyberattack” hit the office of Virginia Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares, which led agency officials to shut down computer systems and resort to paper court filings.
Recently, hackers also breached the computer network of the Fall River School District in Massachusetts. The school district is working with third-party experts and law enforcement to determine if anyone’s personal information was targeted, according to MassLive.
In 2023, of the 48 states that participated in the Nationwide Cybersecurity Review, a voluntary self-assessment conducted by federal agencies that examines how well governments are prepared to respond to cyberattacks, only 22 states reached or surpassed the recommended levels of security in their systems.










The notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.


– Samir Jain, Vice President of Policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology


Cybersecurity has become increasingly important over time because more government services and data are digitized, said Samir Jain, the vice president of policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology, a nonprofit that advocates for digital rights and freedom of expression.
But a national shortage of people with that expertise — especially at the local level — creates a challenge.
“The federal government has traditionally played at least some role in trying to fill some of those gaps,” Jain said. “And so the notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.”
Local governments and law enforcement agencies also have other priorities, Fopiano said. The police need cars, guns, shields and other resources that generally take precedence over cybersecurity.
Today, Fopiano is the cybersecurity chair of the Southeast Regional Domestic Security Task Force in Florida, overseeing cyber activity from South Florida to the Florida Keys. The attacks continue to rise, he said.
“Terrorist groups are getting into cybercrime, cartels are getting into cybercrime, you have kids just learning about hacking and just fooling around,” he said. “The audience of who’s doing it has definitely expanded and led to that rise in overall cybercrime.”
 Cuts to federal resources

In 2022, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced a first-of-its-kind cybersecurity grant program, providing more than $1 billion in funding for states, localities, tribes and territories to address cybersecurity risks and threats.
The State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program, created under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, awarded $279 million to states and localities in fiscal year 2024. The Tribal Cybersecurity Grant Program awarded another $18 million for tribes in its first year.
But the grant program is set to expire in September, with no current plans to renew it. At a hearing this month, several state and local officials urged Congress to reauthorize the program. But U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who refused the federal aid during her tenure as governor of South Dakota, questioned the program’s efficacy.
The Trump administration is also cutting as many as 1,300 employees from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, which administers the grants alongside the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
The program has allowed states to assess the security of their networks, develop cybersecurity training, implement multi-factor authentication features — which requires users to provide more than one form of verification to access a site or service — and much more, said Alex Whitaker, the director of government affairs at the National Association of State Chief Information Officers.
“This has been a really great program because we’re seeing a lot of great evidence for how states and their counterparts in local government are improving their cyber defenses,” Whitaker said.
Counties also rely on a number of federal resources to strengthen their defenses, including services provided by CISA, said Rita Reynolds, the chief information officer at the National Association of Counties and managing director for County Tech Xchange. NACo is an organization that represents county governments across the United States.
The Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center, for instance — a key collaboration between CISA and the Center for Internet Security to help state and local governments with cybersecurity operations — lost some of its federal funding for certain programs last month, Reynolds said.
In trying to keep up with emerging threats, counties are still trying to find resources to help them implement multi-factor authentication, convert government pages to “.gov” domains and other methods of protecting their infrastructure, she said.
“Are counties prepared?” Reynolds asked. “I would say they’re not as prepared as they’d like to be. And in some cases, they are looking at how to strategically approach this now that resources are disappearing.”
In a statement, CISA spokesperson Jared Auchey said Trump’s executive order empowers state and local governments “to make risk-informed decisions and investments to improve their preparedness.” The agency will work with state and local officials to ensure they have the information and support they need, Auchey added.
 Lawmakers step up

In 2024, 33 states, including Colorado, adopted resolutions or enacted legislation regarding cybersecurity, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan public officials’ association.
Many of those measures sought to protect states’ critical infrastructure, including water systems, government services, health care and more. Florida, Louisiana, West Virginia and other states created new criminal and civil penalties for people who attempt to tamper with critical infrastructure.
In Minnesota and Washington state, lawmakers passed measures allowing or requiring state and local governments to invest in cybersecurity protections related to election administration. Connecticut and Florida also passed legislation to secure health care facilities from cyberattacks by having hospitals create plans or by supporting investments in new technologies.
Other states are looking for solutions from outside vendors. South Dakota has set aside $7 million for a company to examine local governments for vulnerabilities to hackers.
With attacks occurring at every level of government, New Mexico Democratic state Sen. Michael Padilla, the Senate majority whip, sponsored legislation in 2023 to create the state’s office of cybersecurity. As chair of the Senate Science, Technology and Telecommunications Committee for 10 years, he plays a significant role in most of the state’s cybersecurity legislation.
Through the committee’s work, Padilla says New Mexico is in good shape to fend off cyberattacks — and the state’s cities and counties are joining in.
“I think New Mexico is in a very good position because what we decided to do by creating that office is to ensure that any transactions that occur with state government here [in New Mexico] have to meet a minimum set of security standards,” he said.
In Indiana, Republican state Sen. Liz Brown filed legislation that would encourage state agencies and groups to develop cybersecurity policies. The bill was approved by both chambers, with the Senate agreeing to changes sent from the House.
“You have to protect your infrastructure,” Brown said. “We don’t want utility systems to be shut down. We don’t want wastewater or freshwater treatment plants or even the water supply being contaminated or harmed in some way. Our systems all have backups, but even so, we know there are bad actors.”
Some states are also preparing to reshuffle their offices or create new ones to centralize their cybersecurity efforts. Arkansas, for example, enacted legislation this month to create a new state cybersecurity office, which will monitor the state’s computer networks and respond to cyberthreats.
In Alabama, rather than having information technology people scattered throughout the government, Republican state Rep. Mike Shaw wants cybersecurity personnel centrally managed.
Shaw’s legislation, which passed the House and is currently in the Senate, would give the Alabama Office of Information Technology central authority to maintain the needs of all of the state’s departments.
The centralization would make it easier to pursue cybersecurity initiatives in the future, Shaw said.
“The federal government is really big, and it’s really hard to come up with a one-size-fits-all solution for things like cybersecurity, data privacy and technology in general,” Shaw said. “So, in some sense, it’s good that the states are coming up with their own.”

(Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor) Anyone with concerns about handling the manure from 25,000 cows or other issues associated with what could become North Dakota’s largest dairy are now able to submit comments to the state. 
The North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality opened a comment period Friday on the proposed Traill County facility to be operated by Minnesota-based Riverview Dairy. 
The DEQ comment period runs through June 2 and includes a public hearing May 20 from 5-8 p.m. at the Hillsboro High School gym. Comments can be submitted through the DEQ website at deq.nd.gov/PublicNotice.aspx.
Riverview refers to the 25,000-cow project as Herberg Dairy, named for the township along the Red River and North Dakota Highway 200 southeast of Hillsboro where the dairy is planned. 
Riverview already has a state environmental permit for its planned 12,500-cow dairy in Abercrombie Township north of Wahpeton in Richland County. The Dakota Resource Council is challenging that permit in court.

Marty Haroldson, permits program manager of the Division of Water Quality within the Department of Environmental Quality, and other staff members from the agency were in Hillsboro earlier this month as Riverview held an open house to answer questions from the public. 
Haroldson said the plan for the Herberg Dairy is similar to Abercrombie, just on a larger scale. 
“So as far as the technology, that’s all the same, it’s just scaled up,” Haroldson said. “Manure storage ponds are going to have a larger footprint, the barns are going to be a little bit bigger, a few more people working there.” 
Haroldson said even after an environmental permit is issued, some aspects of the plan, such as manure management, can change, such as which farmers want to use Riverview’s manure as fertilizer or on which fields. 
The plan “can be a living document,” Haroldson said, but Riverview would need to document the changes. 
Water sources, processing
Two large questions are not addressed in the environmental plans for the dairy: Where will the water come from? Where will the milk go? 
Large dairy farms like the ones proposed by Minnesota-based Riverview Dairy require huge quantities of water — 20 to 30 gallons of water per cow per day. 
That would equal at least 700,000 gallons of water per day for the Traill County site and 350,000 gallons per day for the Richland County site.
The huge water need coupled with manure output from such a large dairy has some residents in Richland County concerned about the effect on aquifers and the water supply for residents. 
Huge dairy farms planned for eastern North Dakota

Brady Janzen, who works on site development for Riverview Dairy, said during a recent open house on the Traill County project that the company’s dairies use a combination of collected water, such as gathering rain water that runs off barn roofs, surface water and ground water. 
Riverview has a permit request under review with the North Dakota Department of Water Resources for the Richland County site northwest of Wahpeton for using surface water pulled from the Red River.  
A comment period has already been held on that permit. Another comment period will open when the department announces its intent to approve or deny the permit. 
Riverview is working with the East Central Rural Water District that serves Traill and Grand Forks counties for the site southeast of Hillsboro.  Riverview has not yet applied for a water permit for that site. 
The two dairies will use a lot of water and produce a lot of milk that would need to be processed.  The Traill dairy would fill 22 tanker loads of milk – more than 170,000 gallons per day. The Richland site would produce about half that.
“We won’t begin building until we have a processor who has a need for that milk,” Janzen said. 
Riverview already has several large dairies in western Minnesota but does not own its own creamery.
Janzen said Riverview has “kicked the tires” on building a processing plant.

Dairy farmers in the Bismarck-Mandan area, the traditional heart of North Dakota’s dairy industry, have been hurt by the closure of a creamery close to home. 
A bill in the North Dakota Legislature aims to provide some financial incentives for dairy processing. 
Amber Wood of the North Dakota Livestock Alliance, a nonprofit that promotes animal agriculture, is confident that the large dairies will mean more processing in the area.
“With dairy, it’s not the chicken or the egg, it’s the chicken and the egg,” Wood said. “You have to have processing to get cows and cows to get processing.” 
Raising concerns
While Wood is optimistic about dairy in the Red River Valley, others have concerns.

The same evening as Riverview’s Hillsboro open house, the Dakota Resource Council hosted a meeting in Fargo to raise awareness of the Abercrombie Dairy, which would be near the Red River, the drinking water source for Fargo residents.
“So why should you care? Because you’re 35 miles away,” said Madeline Luke, a volunteer with Dakota Resource Council whose main interest is in water protection, told the group. 
Luke said by the time the public became aware of the Abercrombie Dairy, there was little time to review the permit application within the comment period. She cited concerns such as the number of fields where the manure will be applied that have drainage tile installed. 
Luke was already reviewing the Herberg application on Friday.

Erik Olson has become a spokesperson for Abercrombie-area residents opposed to the dairy and addressed the Fargo meeting. The town of Abercrombie is less than four miles from the proposed dairy. 
“Riverview was well into the process of planning and developing for years before the public was made aware,” Olson said. “We have minimal time to learn and educate ourselves on the effects that this megadairy would be having.
“To say that we were shocked is an understatement.” 
The Dakota Resource Council has argued that one reason to throw out the permit is that there was no public hearing. 
Riverview has filed a motion to dismiss the Dakota Resource Council lawsuit. A ruling on that motion is pending with a Burleigh County court.

And a resounding 77% of respondents strongly agreed that focusing on diversity, equity and inclusion in the workplace is a “good thing.” 
The findings are part of a data-driven effort by the Greater Omaha Chamber of Commerce to spotlight gaps in meeting expectations of college-educated and high skilled professionals so that employers and policymakers can reverse the “brain drain” trend that has troubled the state.
 ‘Starting point’

About 700 people chose to respond to the questionnaire, which was marketed and made publicly available in the eight-county area served by the chamber. The bulk of those who participated, 86%, had at least a bachelor’s degree. Nearly 75% were white.
Done in partnership with the University of Nebraska at Omaha-based Center for Public Affairs Research, the survey was conducted in 2024 and results were presented to chamber leaders in January. But the findings are now starting to be more widely discussed. 
On Monday, UNO researchers will explain highlights to a gathering at the chamber that is expected to draw young professionals, business and other leaders.
“The more we know about what talent is seeking and wanting, the more we can key in and help elevate what is going on already — or help support improvements,” said Merrick Brtek, director of the chamber’s Young Professionals & Talent Development Programs. “Is it going to fix everything? No. But it is a starting point for us to move forward with that feedback.”
For example, she said, the chamber runs a program introducing newcomers and others to area resources, including information on Omaha’s rapid bus transit system and how to get a daily Heartland Bike Share pass. About 73% of respondents said they were somewhat or extremely dissatisfied with transit options within the region.

The chamber thinks the modern-day streetcar, which has been controversial, will help and be welcomed by young professionals once its downtown-to-midtown Omaha route opens, Brtek said.
Other transit-related concerns also stood out, however. For example, 56% of respondents were somewhat or extremely dissatisfied with available transit options (such as bus, train or plane) from the Omaha area to other regions like Denver, Chicago, Kansas City or Lincoln.
When it came to walk and bike friendly commutes, only 35% who participated marked extremely or somewhat satisfied.
Brtek said she was pleased to see that the bulk of participants gave a high rating to overall quality of life. About 88% said they were somewhat or extremely satisfied. 
About 69% said the same about overall cost of living, though 60% said they were dissatisfied with the cost of taxes, such as sales, income and property.
 Hybrid over remote work

Among the more surprising nuggets to Brtek was the preference that respondents had for a hybrid but primarily in-person work environment, versus more remote.
“It’s exciting that people want that community aspect — to come together, connect and collaborate,” she said.
When asked to choose which work environment was most appealing, 32% marked the hybrid but primarily in-person choice; 28% marked hybrid but equally split between in-person and remote; 19% said hybrid, primarily remote; 11% said fully in person and 10% said fully remote.

Josie Schafer, head of the UNO research team that worked on the survey, said the survey dovetails with another done in 2019 that tracked down and asked questions of high-skilled professionals who had already left the area. In that study, 78% said that they fled for professional growth and development.
It’s not that jobs weren’t available locally, said Schafer, but “density” was lacking. Participants in the earlier survey felt there was not enough upward movement in companies where top management already was set as part of a family or established network.
This latest survey, on the other hand, was focused on young professionals who currently live and work in the area.
Schafer said only about 12% said they were not satisfied with their job overall. The lowest rated workplace factor was pay, followed by opportunity for advancement at work, she said. 
“Inflation has gone up faster than wages in the Omaha area, people are feeling wage pressure, so pay is a real issue for folks,” Schafer said.
When asked which job benefits were most important, a top answer besides salary was paid time off for sickness and  vacations. 
Most respondents said they weren’t likely to try to leave their current job in the next year. But when asked if they did choose to leave, about half said they’d probably leave Nebraska completely.
Top destination states mentioned were Colorado, Illinois, California, and Texas.
‘Quality of life’
“That is concerning,” Schafer said of brain-drain, or high-skilled people with a college education exiting Husker territory for other states. She said that domestic out-migration has been a “persistent issue for at least 15 years.”

Housing opportunities also stood out as a weakness, she said. About 53% of participants said they were either extremely or somewhat dissatisfied with rental or for-sale housing that meets their size and quality needs.
Among community-centric areas of the greater Omaha area that got the highest “extremely satisfied” marks: entertainment, restaurants and bars (41%); health care services (39%): quality of educational institutions (35%) and overall quality of life (31%).
Schafer will be sharing and discussing specifics of the survey findings at the Monday gathering.
“I don’t know that we’re taking enough steps to actually create the job opportunities that keep people here or the culture of organizations that keep people here,” she said, “Or the quality of life that makes people say, ‘It is worth the difference in pay to stay here.'”



 In their own words 

Among comments survey participants took the time to write:

“City council meetings are poorly placed. I would love to get involved but Tuesday at 2 p.m. assures the city only hears business owners, retired folks and those with a flexible schedule to attend. Given the perspective of politics these days, I believe this is by design to keep common folks from participation.”
“The divide on access to services/programs and basic needs is widening. Middle income is increasingly strained and state Legislature is focused on relief for highest and lowest income earners.”
“I like the flexibility. I don’t like that most of the work is remote. It makes it hard to communicate with coworkers and get to know them.”
“When I started in 2021, the benefits system wouldn’t let me register for benefits because it said my same sex marriage wasn’t valid. Management and up regularly misgender me (I use they/them pronouns). The person who has committed the most microaggressions and discriminatory actions is our only HR person.”
“The culture of fun and employee engagement never recovered from COVID.”
“We have got to increase wages; set rental price caps; develop, enact and implement renter protections; stop with all the bars, create spaces where families are welcome but not specifically children spaces; create real public transit and incentivize environmentally conscious transportation options, repair the roads meaningfully so our cars don ‘t get eaten by potholes and we have to pay to repair our cars more frequently; do actual policy work that is going to get people to have a POSITIVE identity with Omaha.”

House Republicans want to change who has the power to appoint the state’s superintendent of public instruction — potentially stripping the State Board of Education of one of its key functions — because they say Michigan’s education system is failing.
A House joint resolution seeks to alter the state’s constitution to give the governor control over the appointment, with the advice and consent of the Senate. The proposal comes as the state’s current superintendent is set to retire in the fall and, if it passed, would go into effect after Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s term ends.
The State Board of Education currently has the sole hiring and firing power for the position. The elected body has held that authority since 1963.
The resolution is tied to a bill that would require state board seats to be elected from geographic districts. Board seats are currently at-large, meaning whichever candidate wins the most votes wins the election, no matter where they live.
Democrats have controlled the board for much of the last two decades.
The Republican members of the House education committee voted to move the proposals forward to a vote in the full legislative body.
In order to become law, the resolution would have to be approved by two-thirds of the Republican-controlled House and the Democratically controlled Senate. It would then go before voters in the November 2026 election. If passed into law by a majority of voters, the new regulations would go into effect after Jan. 1, 2027.
Under the proposal, the state superintendent would serve a term of up to four years, as determined by the governor.
The current law allows state superintendents to remain in their positions either until they resign or are removed by the state board.
Current State Superintendent Michael Rice has been criticized by Republicans and some Democrats — including Whitmer — for the lagging academic performance of schools in the state. He will leave his position Oct. 3, and the state board has already begun its search for his successor.
“Clearly, what we are doing is not working,” said state Rep. Bill Schuette, a Republican from Gladwin County, citing the state’s results on recent state and national assessments during a recent House Education and Workforce Committee hearing.
“You look across the country, we are one of the only states that has a so-called independent head of its education department, and I believe that this, in practice, has removed an important element of accountability from our state’s public education system,” Schuette added.
Rep. Regina Weiss, a Democrat from Oak Park, said during the hearing there are concerns the position could become more partisan if the change is made because the State Board of Education’s staggered eight-year terms offer more consistency.
Schuette argued that because governors are elected every four years, there would be more accountability to constituents.
“If you have a governor who wants to implement reforms or changes, and that person has a mandate directly from the people and the governor, I think that it is a better way to execute that accountability,” he said.
Schutte said he is also in favor of eliminating the state board entirely, though there are no formal proposals to do so yet.
The state board’s power has been reduced significantly over the years, particularly under the initiatives of former Gov. John Engler, a Republican who transferred a number of the board’s responsibilities to the state superintendent.
Currently, the board’s role is to establish academic standards, as well as make policy recommendations to local districts and lawmakers. It does not have the power to pass laws or to control school funding.
This month, the state board unanimously passed a resolution to oppose the proposal to strip it of its power to appoint the state superintendent.
The members agreed the potential for state education policy to change frequently due to “short-term, flashy” initiatives of new governors would cause “confusion and frustration” among school leaders.
Tom McMillin, a Republican member of the state board, said during the meeting that he’s long opposed previous efforts to shift the power of appointing the state superintendent to the governor.
“The architects of Michigan’s 1963 constitution were wise to recognize that giving too much power to the governor would be harmful and that providing authority and oversight of education to a separately elected board would be beneficial to Michigan’s children,” McMillin said in a statement. “This separation of power should remain.”

“A lot of those [attempts] are toward government or even police, especially because they know that we’re not as prepared as we should be,” said Fopiano, who now oversees cybersecurity as part of a regional task force.
Spanning health care facilities to court systems, states and local communities are facing a rise in cyberthreats. They include threats to critical infrastructure, increased activity from foreign actors, continued ransomware attacks and more, according to a recent report from the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center.
But President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order shifting some of the responsibility from the federal government to states and localities to improve their infrastructure to address risks, including cybercrimes. And federal cuts have reduced resources for state and local officials, including a cybersecurity grant program and a key cybersecurity agency.
States and localities are taking steps to address the problems, such as establishing new penalties for tampering with critical infrastructure, centralizing state IT personnel and setting standards in areas from elections to health care.
But the Trump order and federal funding cuts, a shortage of IT experts at the local level and an overall lack of preparedness could weaken their efforts.
In December, a major cyberattack forced Rhode Island to take down its online portal used by residents to obtain Medicaid benefits and SNAP, commonly known as food stamps. The personal data stolen from Rhode Island’s public benefits network — including Social Security numbers and banking information — was later found on the dark web.
In February, a “sophisticated cyberattack” hit the office of Virginia Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares, which led agency officials to shut down computer systems and resort to paper court filings.
Last week, hackers also breached the computer network of the Fall River School District in Massachusetts. The school district is working with third-party experts and law enforcement to determine if anyone’s personal information was targeted, according to MassLive.
In 2023, of the 48 states that participated in the Nationwide Cybersecurity Review, a voluntary self-assessment conducted by federal agencies that examines how well governments are prepared to respond to cyberattacks, only 22 states reached or surpassed the recommended levels of security in their systems.











The notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.


– Samir Jain, Vice President of Policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology



Cybersecurity has become increasingly important over time because more government services and data are digitized, said Samir Jain, the vice president of policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology, a nonprofit that advocates for digital rights and freedom of expression.
But a national shortage of people with that expertise — especially at the local level — creates a challenge.
“The federal government has traditionally played at least some role in trying to fill some of those gaps,” Jain said. “And so the notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.”
Local governments and law enforcement agencies also have other priorities, Fopiano said. The police need cars, guns, shields and other resources that generally take precedence over cybersecurity.
Today, Fopiano is the cybersecurity chair of the Southeast Regional Domestic Security Task Force in Florida, overseeing cyber activity from South Florida to the Florida Keys. The attacks continue to rise, he said.
“Terrorist groups are getting into cybercrime, cartels are getting into cybercrime, you have kids just learning about hacking and just fooling around,” he said. “The audience of who’s doing it has definitely expanded and led to that rise in overall cybercrime.”
Cuts to federal resources
In 2022, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced a first-of-its-kind cybersecurity grant program, providing more than $1 billion in funding for states, localities, tribes and territories to address cybersecurity risks and threats.
The State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program, created under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, awarded $279 million to states and localities in fiscal year 2024. The Tribal Cybersecurity Grant Program awarded another $18 million for tribes in its first year.
But the grant program is set to expire in September, with no current plans to renew it. At a hearing this month, several state and local officials urged Congress to reauthorize the program. But U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who refused the federal aid during her tenure as governor of South Dakota, questioned the program’s efficacy.
The Trump administration is also cutting as many as 1,300 employees from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, which administers the grants alongside the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
The program has allowed states to assess the security of their networks, develop cybersecurity training, implement multi-factor authentication features — which requires users to provide more than one form of verification to access a site or service — and much more, said Alex Whitaker, the director of government affairs at the National Association of State Chief Information Officers.
“This has been a really great program because we’re seeing a lot of great evidence for how states and their counterparts in local government are improving their cyber defenses,” Whitaker said.
Counties also rely on a number of federal resources to strengthen their defenses, including services provided by CISA, said Rita Reynolds, the chief information officer at the National Association of Counties and managing director for County Tech Xchange. NACo is an organization that represents county governments across the United States.
The Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center, for instance — a key collaboration between CISA and the Center for Internet Security to help state and local governments with cybersecurity operations — lost some of its federal funding for certain programs last month, Reynolds said.
In trying to keep up with emerging threats, counties are still trying to find resources to help them implement multi-factor authentication, convert government pages to “.gov” domains and other methods of protecting their infrastructure, she said.
“Are counties prepared?” Reynolds asked. “I would say they’re not as prepared as they’d like to be. And in some cases, they are looking at how to strategically approach this now that resources are disappearing.”
In a statement, CISA spokesperson Jared Auchey said Trump’s executive order empowers state and local governments “to make risk-informed decisions and investments to improve their preparedness.” The agency will work with state and local officials to ensure they have the information and support they need, Auchey added.
Lawmakers step up
In 2024, 33 states adopted resolutions or enacted legislation regarding cybersecurity, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan public officials’ association.
Many of those measures sought to protect states’ critical infrastructure, including water systems, government services, health care and more. Florida, Louisiana, West Virginia and other states created new criminal and civil penalties for people who attempt to tamper with critical infrastructure.
In Minnesota and Washington state, lawmakers passed measures allowing or requiring state and local governments to invest in cybersecurity protections related to election administration. Connecticut and Florida also passed legislation to secure health care facilities from cyberattacks by having hospitals create plans or by supporting investments in new technologies.
Other states are looking for solutions from outside vendors. South Dakota has set aside $7 million for a company to examine local governments for vulnerabilities to hackers.
With attacks occurring at every level of government, New Mexico Democratic state Sen. Michael Padilla, the Senate majority whip, sponsored legislation in 2023 to create the state’s office of cybersecurity. As chair of the Senate Science, Technology and Telecommunications Committee for 10 years, he plays a significant role in most of the state’s cybersecurity legislation.
Through the committee’s work, Padilla says New Mexico is in good shape to fend off cyberattacks — and the state’s cities and counties are joining in.
“I think New Mexico is in a very good position because what we decided to do by creating that office is to ensure that any transactions that occur with state government here [in New Mexico] have to meet a minimum set of security standards,” he said.
In Indiana, Republican state Sen. Liz Brown filed legislation that would encourage state agencies and groups to develop cybersecurity policies. The bill was approved by both chambers, with the Senate agreeing to changes sent from the House.
“You have to protect your infrastructure,” Brown said. “We don’t want utility systems to be shut down. We don’t want wastewater or freshwater treatment plants or even the water supply being contaminated or harmed in some way. Our systems all have backups, but even so, we know there are bad actors.”
Some states are also preparing to reshuffle their offices or create new ones to centralize their cybersecurity efforts. Arkansas, for example, enacted legislation this month to create a new state cybersecurity office, which will monitor the state’s computer networks and respond to cyberthreats.
In Alabama, rather than having information technology people scattered throughout the government, Republican state Rep. Mike Shaw wants cybersecurity personnel centrally managed.
Shaw’s legislation, which passed the House and is currently in the Senate, would give the Alabama Office of Information Technology central authority to maintain the needs of all of the state’s departments.
The centralization would make it easier to pursue cybersecurity initiatives in the future, Shaw said.
“The federal government is really big, and it’s really hard to come up with a one-size-fits-all solution for things like cybersecurity, data privacy and technology in general,” Shaw said. “So, in some sense, it’s good that the states are coming up with their own.”

(Photo: John Partipilo)When examining the state of national politics and the federal government, there’s much to be concerned about, including President Donald Trump’s enthusiasm for deporting people legally in the country — and possibly, in the near future, U.S. citizens.
Concerned about freedom of the press? You might find it hard not to be if you note the Trump administration tried to ban the Associated Press — the gold standard for professional and fair journalism — from press conferences and has inserted right- wing bloggers in order to get favorable coverage.
It’s easy to get caught up in the doom spiral of national news, but Tennesseans would be better served, if no less sane, by turning from the scary and shiny objects in Washington, D.C., and back towards home, where members of the Tennessee General Assembly eagerly pursue a similarly anti-democratic agenda. 
Monitoring the actions of state lawmakers won’t make you feel less frustrated, but you have greater access to state representatives and senators near you to voice your concerns. 
Anti-immigration measures take priority
Gov. Bill Lee called a special legislative session in January presumably to push his universal school voucher program, but many political observers were surprised when Lee also added to his agenda three other items — in itself unusual, as special sessions are customarily devoted to one topic.
While vouchers remained a priority, almost as much attention was given to what Lee termed his “illegal immigration agenda.”

The legislature created a state immigration agency that would be exempt from public records law, a measure allowing public officials to be prosecuted if they vote for sanctuary city policies — which is unconstitutional, to say nothing of fact sanctuary cities have been illegal in Tennessee since 2018 — and requires immigrants in the state without permanent legal status to have driver’s licenses that mark them as such. 
“The Nazi Germans did this to the Jews,” said Democratic Sen. Charlane Oliver of Nashville, referring to the Star of David sewn into clothing.
Did Republican lawmakers go far enough to make immigrants feel harassed and unwelcome? Apparently not.
As soon as the special session ended and the regular one got into full swing, Republican lawmakers began filing anti-immigrant bills right and left, including: 

Senate Bill 227/House Bill 11: Sponsored by Sen. Brent Taylor of Memphis and Rep. Rusty Grills of Newbern, the bill would hold churches and charitable organizations liable for providing housing aid to immigrants without legal status — who then go on to commit a crime. It has passed both chambers and is set to become law. 
Senate bill 836/House Bill 793 : Sen. Bo Watson, a Chattanooga Republican, is carrying a piece of legislation that would require public schools to verify the immigration status of Tennessee’s nearly 1 million students and would give schools the option of charging students without permanent legal status tuition or denying them an education. The House version, sponsored by Majority Leader William Lamberth of Portland, hit snags and may not pass. 
Senate Bill 1087 /House Bill 0177: A bill making it a crime for immigrants without legal status to remain in the state for more than 72 hours stalled out in the Senate and was deferred until 2026. Senate sponsor Jack Johnson of Franklin acknowledged the measure is unconstitutional — although that has rarely stopped lawmakers with a bee in their collective bonnet. 

Media matters
The year has been marked by fewer large-scale protests in the Capitol than the two years prior, but plenty of small protests — there have been more disruptions in committee meetings than Comcast has during spring storms — and on several occasions, women protesting against anti-immigration measures have been carried out by Tennessee state troopers. 
But sometimes, even members of the media are challenged trying to cover proceedings. 
For some years, reporters have been able to freely enter the House of Representatives, as long as they stationed themselves behind a dingy plexiglass barrier near the dais, separating them from the power brokers.

No more. Now, reporters must be on a list guarded by House sergeants-at-arms, and even reporters who are members of the Capitol Hill Press Corps can’t count on being listed. At times in the last two years, Lookout reporters have been turned away despite being recognized by officials working the door, requiring a direct call from the chair of the Capitol Hill Press Corps to gain entry. 
And earlier this month, members of the media were denied access to the Senate gallery. A spokesman for Lt. Gov. Randy McNally said troopers who provide security and sergeants-at-arms were concerned about “exceptional interest in the day’s proceedings” and turned media away as gallery capacity was reached. 
In that instance, McNally’s staff did, within minutes, take steps to allow reporters and photographers into the gallery. 
But it shouldn’t be that difficult for reporters to be able to enter public chambers to do their jobs.
Is this a chicken or egg issue? Are Tennessee’s Republican lawmakers emboldened by Trump’s example or would they have arrived at these steps on their own? That’s hard to say, since Trump’s influence has permeated Republican-led legislators for nine years — only six years after Republicans became the Tennessee Legislature’s supermajority. 
And I’m not sure the genesis matters, because here we are. But for Tennesseans who are weary of the flood of national bad news and a feeling of helplessness, there’s a cure of sorts. Turn your TV off, look away from Washington, D.C., and turn your sights to home — where your vote has a more direct impact on those same Trump-like policies and those perpetrating them.

Like bringing back smoking rooms to Montana businesses.
This is what Senate Bill 150, now being debated by the Montana Legislature, stands to do.
The bill, sponsored by Sen. Wylie Galt of Martinsdale, would weaken Montana’s 20-year-old Clean Indoor Air Act and allow so-called “cigar rooms” to operate in our state. If the idea sounds familiar, that’s because lawmakers have rejected it time after time in past legislative sessions. But those who put profits ahead of our health keep trying.
SB 150 will subject employees and non-smoking patrons to secondhand cigar smoke, which can cause lung cancer and heart disease and stroke, and which contains all the same toxic chemicals found in cigarette smoke. Every worker deserves a safe place to work – free of toxic air pollutants.
If passed, Galt’s bill as proposed with amendments will irreparably weaken our Clean Indoor Air Act, which, as stated in Montana law, is intended to “protect the public health and welfare by prohibiting smoking in public places and places of employment; to recognize the right of nonsmokers to breathe smoke-free air; and to recognize that the need to breathe smoke-free air has priority over the desire to smoke.”
There is no way to contain cigar smoke within a room or building. Smoke filters through cracks in windows and walls, through air ducts and even through electrical outlets. And there is no safe level of secondhand smoke exposure. If bars or brewpubs have “cigar rooms,” everyone inside the building, not just the smoking area itself, will be at risk, just as they were back in the bad old days when smoking was allowed in restaurants and on board airplanes. Say “so long” to the family environment many establishments have cultivated during the past two decades. Many Montanans may see their favorite spots opting in to allow smoking.
There is no ventilation system that can effectively protect against secondhand smoke. The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, which sets engineering standards for ventilation systems, says that “the only means of effectively eliminating health risks associated with indoor exposure is to ban smoking activity” from a building. Ventilation may reduce odor, but it won’t protect people’s health.
In fact, people who go inside a cigar bar or room will be at risk even when smoking isn’t taking place. Toxins from cigar smoke seep into carpet, furniture and walls and can be absorbed through the skin or by breathing in contaminated dust or by eating contaminated food. Employees charged with cleaning or otherwise maintaining a cigar bar or room will be at risk. Cigar bars or rooms can even pose a hazard for neighboring businesses.
Not only are backers of SB 150 and its amendment undermining our health and the Clean Indoor Air Act, but they also are breaking a promise made to the people of Montana. When the Clean Indoor Air Act was adopted 20 years ago, it included a four-year phase-in period for Montana’s tavern owners to make their bars and casinos smokefree. The phase-in was agreed upon by the tavern industry, legislators and some health groups. SB 150 breaks this promise, which has been held for 16 years.
The bill also runs counter to public opinion in our state. A 2021 poll by the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network and the American Heart Association showed that 89% of Montana voters from across the political spectrum support the Clean Indoor Air Act, and 77% (3-in-4) of Montana voters oppose allowing cigar smoking in bars.
SB 150 breaks a promise made to Montana citizens and hospitality workers, and it undermines our Clean Indoor Air Act, which prevents disease and saves lives. We’ve had 20 years of smokefree workplaces and 16 years of smokefree bars and casinos. Why bring back the days of smoke-filled air and coming home with your clothes, skin and hair stinking of smoke?
We’ve come to expect clean, healthy air in our public spaces. Let’s not go back to the days of smoking rooms.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/cigar-in-ashtray-861x535-1.jpg,,,2025-04-21 06:04:19.793035

See our article about a new diploma in Alabama that trades chemistry for carpentry. 
LOUISVILLE — It had been a slow morning at the Class Act Federal Credit Union. But a little after 11 a.m., a client walked through the door. 
“Who’s waiting on me?” said the elderly man, smiling.
“I will,” said Gracie Lacefield, one of three tellers behind the counter. “How are you doing? What can I help you with?” The man gave his account information to Lacefield, and then handed her his money to deposit. 
The Class Act Federal Credit Union isn’t a typical bank. Jefferson County school employees founded it in 1954 to provide educators with financial services; it began setting up  branches in high schools in 2011 as a way to offer students work-based learning. Lacefield and the two other tellers are high schoolers. 
The credit union became one small piece of a districtwide effort, Academies of Louisville, to embed career and technical education, or CTE, alongside core subjects like math and English and require every student to pick a career pathway by 10th grade.
 Piloted in 2017 at 11 high schools, the model has expanded to all 15 of the district’s main high schools. As part of that effort, the district has also launched a career exploration program at 14 middle schools, partnered with local colleges and universities to provide dual credit courses and smoothed the path for students to graduate with industry-recognized certifications. 
Ford Next Generation Learning
The Academies of Louisville is one of roughly 30 such programs that are working to provide CTE for all students, regardless of whether they plan to go to college or directly into the workforce, according to Jessica Delgado, marketing and communications director of Ford Next Generation Learning, which helps school districts adopt the approach. The Ford Motor Company Fund made Louisville part of the network in 2014.
This “CTE for all” model has grown in popularity as support for the idea of “college for all” has eroded amid high tuition costs and low completion rates. The “CTE for all” model has support from employers interested in meeting local and regional workforce needs. And some experts argue that combining workforce and academic learning makes students more engaged and helps them build professional networks.

“A lack of access to work-based learning can actually limit the career prospects and economic mobility of youth and adults,” said Kyle Hartung, associate vice president for education at the nonprofit Jobs for the Future. He noted that there’s some evidence for the effectiveness of individual “CTE for all” programs and models, although data on the impact of the approach as a whole remains scant. 
Meanwhile, the career academies model requires a significant overhaul of the traditional high school model, and without buy-in from teachers, families and local and regional business leaders, it’s unlikely to work. In late November, Anchorage School District in Alaska postponed fully adopting the model after parents and school board members raised concerns about shorter class periods and the possibility that some core subjects would be replaced by career-themed courses. 
Dozing through chemistry, engaged in welding
For Marty Pollio, now Jefferson County Public Schools superintendent, the inspiration to adopt career-oriented education sprouted from a desire to engage more students in learning. He remembers as principal of Jeffersontown High School in early 2010 walking into a chemistry class to find one of the students asleep. 
After Pollio woke him up, the student explained that he didn’t care about the class and asked why he had to learn about the periodic table. Next period, the same student was attentive and engaged in the school’s welding lab, Pollio said, even as the class talked about some of the same content the chemistry class had covered. 
“We have a kid who has a passion for welding, why are we not teaching science from that perspective? Why are we not teaching math from that perspective?” Pollio recalled thinking. He encouraged his teachers to experiment and collaborate to find real-world applications for lessons. To help make science lessons more concrete, for example, the chemistry teacher began holding her class in the welding lab and both the chemistry and welding teachers began interweaving projects and lessons into each other’s classes.

Around that time, the district was seeking to expose more students to career pathways, especially after the state legislature in 2011 expanded how it evaluates schools to include students’ career readiness, a metric it has continued to refine since. In 2014, the city of Louisville was designated a Ford Next Generation Learning Community, and it joined the network of school districts that intend to provide CTE for all students. In 2016, Jefferson County leaders and principals, including Pollio, visited nearby Nashville, one of the first cities to launch the career academies model.
Adopting the model in Louisville required a shake-up of how the schools were organized: Every school created a freshman academy and two to three career academies, each with a designated principal and counselor (in addition to the schoolwide executive principal). 
Today, across the 15 high schools, there are 56 academies offering a total of 155 different industry pathways. As freshmen, students are introduced to each career pathway available at their high school before selecting one. Sophomore year, students start taking career courses in their chosen pathway, getting hands-on education.

Depending on the pathway, students earn either an industry certification or college credit through local postsecondary institutions such as Jefferson Community and Technical College. Students from the same academy also move through the majority of their core classes together, when possible. 
At Jeffersontown High, for example, students can join one of three academies: business and leadership, build and design, or the health sciences. Within those academies, students specialize in an industry pathway like engineering, teaching and learning, welding, allied health or marketing. Students in the business and leadership academy’s financial services pathway can work at their campus Class Act Credit Union. Other schools offer pathways in fields including healthcare, aviation, manufacturing, computer science, civil service and media arts. 
The program looks a little different at every school, said Kim Morales, an executive administrator of high schools for the district. Some combine instruction in core subjects like math with career instruction while others take a less integrated approach, she said.
Academy model requires teachers to be more creative, flexible
Fern Creek High School is among the schools that have tried the combination approach. On a Tuesday morning in late December, in the school’s engineering lab, students were building robotic cars they’d spent months designing. 
Down the hall, a computer science class was reminiscent of a real-world software development company — students worked in teams as lead developers, software developers, business analysts and technical writers for a class project. A few doors down, students in the fire science pathway were creating budgets for how to invest $2,000 to expand either the fire science program or the fire department. Students would present their plans to the Fern Creek Fire Department later in the semester. 
Upstairs, juniors in the early education pathway had just completed a lesson on the characteristics needed for effective early childhood educators and had started to work on the professional resumes they’d need to land internships or part-time jobs at child care centers and preschools that partner with the district. Elsewhere in the school, culinary students studied for a certification exam, while students in the JROTC pathway practiced with air rifles for an upcoming drill competition. 
Ryan Scott, who teaches biology and Advanced Placement Biology within the high school’s engineering, computer sciences and skilled trades academy, said the academy model requires core content teachers like him to be more flexible and creative. It can also help them focus their attention on certain content because their students tend to have shared interests, he said: “I can draw specific examples from computer science, from fire science, from plumbing, to teach my biology kids things, and it gives me kind of like an anchor point.” 
In an ecology unit on how ecosystems change over time, for example, Scott said he talked with his fire science students about the impact of forest fires on an ecosystem, and how sometimes firefighters use burning in specific areas to regenerate land.

Sara Abell, a former Advanced Placement teacher who now leads the academies at Fern Creek, said her thinking on whether students need college has morphed over time. “We need to make sure that we’re preparing all of our students, and college isn’t for everybody,” she said. “Kids don’t need to go to college and waste a bunch of money just to figure out that this isn’t for them and that they could have done something in a skilled trade.”
Students say the focus on career education has shaped them in different ways. Parker Bowdy, a senior in Fern Creek’s fire science pathway, had planned to join a fire department directly after graduation. But recently he said he’s considering college because it would open up more leadership opportunities within the fire service industry. 
Rayna Stewart, a junior at Fern Creek, is in the early childhood education pathway. She plans to pursue a college degree in chemistry, but said the education pathway has taught her a lot about how kids develop mentally and physically. It’s also given her a new perspective on the teaching profession. 
“It made me think more about what my teachers have to do in order to teach us,” Stewart said. “It’s made me think about how it would be as a teacher — like, ‘Oh would I enjoy being a math teacher?’ ”
The model has not expanded to the school’s magnet, specialized or alternative high schools. That’s largely because those schools already offer their own career-focused education, said Mark Hebert, a district spokesperson.
Parental pushback in Alaska
Across the country, in Alaska, the Anchorage School District launched the Academies of Anchorage this past fall — with much controversy. The district rolled out the model with a mandatory career exploration academy for ninth graders, after deciding in June to allow older students to opt out following parental pushback. 
Then, in November, the district emailed parents announcing that it would postpone further changes for at least a year after parents, teachers and school board members raised additional concerns about budget constraints and core classes being cut or replaced in order to make room for the academy changes. In January, the district released an updated plan saying that beginning with the 2025-26 school year, each of its main high schools would offer at least two career pathways, pending budget approval, which would be open to students in all grades but not mandatory. 
Jarrett Boling, a parent with two kids in the district who has been critical of the program’s implementation, said in December that district leaders never clearly explained the academy model and why it was being launched at a time when the school system was already facing teacher shortages and a budget deficit. Nor did the district answer questions about how the model would affect students’ ability to take honors or AP classes, he said. 
He said parents were surveyed about what academies they wanted but weren’t given much context about the model except that it would help increase the district’s graduation rate and build a better working relationship with the business community. “Part of my frustrations have been, I would say, mostly steered toward the school district itself and its kind of lack of transparency and information out to the public,” he said. 
MJ Thim, chief of communications for the Anchorage School District, wrote in an email that the district would not make officials available for an interview for this story, saying that “we are reworking a few things with the program.”
Big cost, big payoff, says superintendent
While Louisville’s model hasn’t generated much criticism, it hasn’t been an easy journey.
The model is expensive: $5.7 million in startup money, in addition to annual costs. “It’s a big cost yearly for us, however the payoff is very well worth it,” said Pollio.
“What’s happened historically is our kids … the ones that are the most successful are on a pathway. The ones who are struggling the most are not. They are just randomly picking classes to graduate and that’s not good for engagement,” Pollio said.
Pollio credits the model, for example, for helping to boost the district’s graduation and postsecondary readiness rates. Those have risen from 81 percent to 87 percent, and 50 to roughly 80 percent, respectively, between 2018 and 2024, according to district officials. At this time, the school system does not collect employment data on its graduates.

District leaders said the program remains little-known in Louisville, even among some parents, in part because it can be complicated to explain. This year the district has done more to publicize it, working with KentuckianaWorks, the regional workforce development board, to expand partnerships with local and regional businesses. Helping local employers understand that the district has 22,000 kids in career and technical education who are graduating with employable skills is “going to change this city long-term,” said Pollio. 
For Fatima Avila, the Jeffersontown branch coordinator at Class Act Credit Union, the model has been transformative. 
Eight years ago, when she was a junior at Southern High School, the district launched the academies model, and a branch of the district’s credit union opened at her school. She became one of its first student employees, and continued to work there part-time while earning her bachelor’s degree in social work at Northern Kentucky University. 
After graduation, she worked at a sober living home, but the role wasn’t as hands-on as she wanted and she missed the camaraderie and relationships she’d developed working in various Class Act branches. In June 2024, after Jeffersontown High School opened its own credit union branch, Avila was hired to lead it and work with students who are in the business and health sciences academy at the school.
“When I graduated high school, I did not think I would be back at Class Act like five years later,” Avila said. But she said she enjoys how the job allows her to mentor students and work with the wider community.
Lacefield, the Jeffersontown student, said she started picking up extra hours at the credit union after school to make money and because she enjoys it so much. A sophomore in the financial services pathway, she said she isn’t sure yet about her plans after high school but the credit union experience has been a positive one. 
“I ended up really, really loving getting to work with members, getting to work with people,” Lacefield said. “I just know that I really want to stay, whether I make money or not.”

The inset shows a closeup of a single strand. (Image by National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases)HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) appear to be a slowly rising tide in the Ocean State, according to the most recent data from the state health department. 
STI surveillance data is reported on a lag, so the March report issued by the Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) contains long- and short-term data ending in 2023, plus some tentative findings for 2024. But recent increases in infections could also be trends returning to their baseline prior to the pandemic. 
“If you look at the data starting in 2020 we did see some significant declines starting with the pandemic, and that is because we were seeing less testing, less healthcare visits,” said Dr. Philip Chan, a primary care physician with Brown University Health and a medical consultant on the RIDOH report.
But people’s behavior also changed during that time, Chan added. “People were more likely to stay at home, more likely to isolate. What we were seeing on the ground was that a lot of people had a lot less sex partners, so there was just a lot less sex going on.”
The good news is that the state usually succeeds in treating HIV, with outcomes more positive than national averages and patients’ illness often stops before the virus progresses into AIDS. Less ideal are higher rates for other STIs like syphilis and gonorrhea, which climbed past pre-pandemic levels in 2023.
“From year to year, it’s tough to tell exactly what’s happening,” Chan said. “But I think that the trends the last couple years are clear that things are going up.”
Data for the more ubiquitous infections includes:

Syphilis has increased 58% from 2014 to 2023. There were 328 cases recorded in 2021, the highest number in decades. That fell to 240 cases in 2022, and 190 in 2023 — about the same as pre-pandemic levels, which had already risen since 2014. Preliminary data for 2024 shows similar trends. From 2020 to 2023, there were also about 10 cases of congenital syphilis — the state’s first instances in about a decade, and one example of testing’s importance in early detection, Chan said.

Gonorrhea cases rose 183.4% over the last 10 years. There were 590 cases in 2014, compared to 1,672 cases in 2023. There has not been a year with fewer than 1,000 cases since 2016. Men account for about twice as many cases as women.

Chlamydia cases have remained more consistent since 2014, and rose 21% over the decade, from 4,349 cases in 2014 to 5,269 cases in 2023. Women ages 20-24 exhibited the highest increase over that same period, but the report notes that women access routine screenings more than men, who are often asymptomatic when infected. 

“A key theme for all these STIs is that most people may not have symptoms,” Chan said. “And so the only way that you know that you may have it is to get tested, and that’s why testing is so so important.”
Chan pointed to primary care doctors and sex education as two ways people can become educated about the necessity of screening. Only 52% of adults ages 18 to 64 who had multiple sex partners received an STI test in the past year, according to 2022 data. Only 60% had ever received an HIV test.  










What we were seeing on the ground was that a lot of people had a lot less sex partners, so there was just a lot less sex going on.

Demographic and geographic factors also shaped the data. Racial disparities exist: In 2023, HIV rates were four times higher among Black residents and nearly sevenfold higher among Rhode Island’s Latino population, compared to caucasian residents. New HIV cases among Latinos have risen 132% since 2019, while dropping 63% among Black Rhode Islanders. Of newly diagnosed HIV cases in 2023, 31% were diagnosed in people born outside the United States, most frequently in the Caribbean and Central and South America.
Younger people ages 15-24 account for most new STI diagnoses, about half. The state’s urban core of Providence, East Providence, North Providence, Pawtucket, Woonsocket, Central Falls, and Cranston consistently reports the highest STI rates, with cases numbering in the dozens to hundreds, compared to fewer than five reported cases in many smaller towns.
“A lot of these STIs do disproportionately affect communities of color and other sorts of underserved populations,” Chan said. “It’s important, from a public health perspective, to think about how to continue and promote and increase access to care for those groups in order to address disparities like we see in STIs and frankly, many other things.”

Early diagnosis, prevention making a difference 
While an assortment of drugs can stop bacterial infections, there’s no cure for HIV. But HIV-positive people are living longer than ever due to modern antiretroviral drugs that suppress the virus and prevent it from progressing to a more serious diagnosis of AIDS. An adequately suppressed viral load can also make the disease intransmissible, and greatly improves quality of life by halting the virus from replicating. Advances in HIV drug therapy largely account for the deep reduction in the rate of HIV-related deaths, which nationally fell by almost half from from 2010 to 2017.
In Rhode Island in 2022, 93.2% of people living with HIV knew their status, 76% were receiving treatment and 71% had achieved viral suppression. And 93% of people who received their medical care within Rhode Island achieved viral suppression. 
Still, there was an above average number of HIV diagnoses, the preliminary 2024 data showed. From 2019-2023, RIDOH also observed that about 20% of people newly diagnosed with HIV had progressed to stage 3, or AIDS. On average, it takes eight years for HIV to develop into AIDS. 
Rhode Island has tried to prevent those outcomes by early diagnosis, and by fortifying its residents against HIV through preventative measures — namely, PrEP, or pre-exposure prophylaxis. Patients who adhere to the schedule for taking this group of antiretroviral drugs can have up to a 99% lower chance of contracting HIV from unprotected sex. PrEP provides an approximate 74% reduction in the likelihood of contracting HIV via injectable drug use.
Successful state laws from 2023 and 2024 made PrEP as widely available as possible by slashing away potential restrictions from insurers and eliminating out-of-pocket costs. Chan, only had “good things to say” about those laws — including the resulting interactions with insurers, who have largely been quick to correct mistakes in patient billing. The main challenge now, Chan said, is when interruptions occur, and a person loses their job, insurance, and access to PrEP.

 Several sexual health clinics and community health centers in Rhode Island offer low or no cost services and assist in minimizing any out-of-pocket costs associated with PrEP prescriptions and testing. For a list go to Rhode Island’s PrEP Champions Network. 

“I actually had a patient of mine for several years who had insurance and was on PrEP,” Chan said. “They lost their insurance for a couple months and had to go off PrEP, and they actually, unfortunately, acquired HIV during that time. This was just a month ago.”
RIDOH continues to promote the Rhode Island PrEP Champions Network, which has participating clinics across the state that expedite access to PrEP as well as its sibling PEP, or post-exposure prophylaxis, which is taken for about a month, starting within 72 hours of possible HIV exposure. Properly taken, the drug prevents HIV infection.
The comparable treatment for preventing bacterial STIs is DoxyPEP, which usually consists of a single, two-pill, dose of doxycycline taken after sex. Doxycycline is an old drug, and thus an inexpensive means of lowering contraction rates, Chan suggested. 
“DoxyPEP is the newest kid on the block,” he said, noting that the nationwide rollout is still in its early stages. But so far the data looks good, with evidence from places like San Francisco suggesting it can make a difference.
“We’re very optimistic about it, and I think the coming years will be able to tell whether or not it’s making a significant impact on overall population trends,” Chan said.

(Getty Images)Kentucky teachers took an undeserved financial hit from the Kentucky legislature during the 2025 session.
For background, the “Shared Responsibility” law (House Bill 540) was passed in 2010. The Kentucky Teachers Retirement System (TRS) board and education community members, including active and retired teachers, school board members, superintendents and experts, collaborated to find a solution.  
The bill established the TRS retiree health fund (health insurance trust), which exists independently from the Kentucky Teachers’ Retirement Fund. At the time, although suggested and requested due to a history of underfunding by the state, the legislature refused to include increased matching contributions by the state into the Kentucky Teachers’ Retirement Fund to begin addressing its much-publicized unfunded liability. 
The funding structure of HB 540 required active teachers to pay 3.75% of their salary, retired teachers under the age of 65 to pay the equivalent of the monthly cost of Medicare Part B, and school districts to contribute 3% of their gross payroll to the health insurance trust.  
Notably, HB 540 included a provision stating that once the health insurance fund achieved sufficient prefunding, as determined actuarially, the 3.75% contribution from active teachers shall be “decreased, suspended, or eliminated.” The same was true for the amount school systems paid in.
While receiving widespread praise for its collaborative development, the Shared Responsibility bill passed through the Kentucky House and Senate without any opposing votes. Gov. Steve Beshear signed it into law on April 13, 2010. 
Overall, the bill was a significant step towards securing financial support for retired teachers’ health care. It reflected a commitment to the education community while relieving Kentucky taxpayers of a $5 billion liability.  
Sounds good?  Right?  Not so fast. The 2025 Kentucky legislature put the brakes on the “shall, in an actuarially accountable manner, be either decreased, suspended, or eliminated” part related to active teachers’ and school systems’ contributions to the health insurance trust.
Now that the retiree health insurance trust is nearly 100% funded, lawmakers voted to renege on the deal that was made in 2010 by passing House Bill 694 (AN ACT relating to Teachers’ Retirement System benefit funding). 
To paraphrase the new law, when the Teachers’ Retirement Fund and the health insurance trust are fully funded, the 3.75% presently going to the health insurance trust may be decreased, suspended, or eliminated. In addition, the school funding for the retiree health insurance trust will be diverted to the Teachers’ Retirement Fund.
According to the actuarial analysis of HB 694, the Teachers’ Retirement Fund will not be 100% funded until 2047. This means teachers will have to wait many more years than initially legislated to have a reduction in the 3.75% deducted from their paycheck. Heavy sigh.
Gov. Andy Beshear vetoed HB 694. In his veto message, he stated,  “House Bill 694 breaks a promise made to teachers in 2010 and does so without even giving them an opportunity for input.”  That’s right; the education community was left out of the bill-making process this time around.  
Beshear went on to mention that teachers would “need to pay much longer than the law calls for” and that “breaking this promise is unfair to the teachers we rely on to guide our children and the future of the Commonwealth.” 
Disappointingly, 67 members of the House and 29 members of the Senate voted to override Beshear’s veto, basically on partisan lines, with the overwhelming majority of the “yea” votes coming from Republicans. 
No doubt, this legislation takes money right out of the pockets of hard-working teachers. 
Like many others across Kentucky, teachers have children to raise, student loan obligations to meet, car and mortgage payments to make, utility bills to pay and groceries to buy, all on a limited budget. In addition, teachers purchase school supplies, necessities and extras for their classrooms.  
The 3.75% deducted from Kentucky teachers’ paychecks equals approximately $1,400 to $2,800 annually. This amount adds up over time while straining  teachers’ monthly budgets. This move does nothing to retain and recruit Kentucky teachers at a time when teachers are becoming harder to find. 
It is the job of those in power in the legislature to fulfill their obligations to teachers.     Transparent and authentic commitments supporting teachers that ensure fair compensation and benefits are vital in creating sustainable educational environments. Before passing legislation that hurts educators’ financial bottom line, lawmakers would be wise to keep in mind that our Kentucky public school teachers have the future of the commonwealth in their classrooms.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/teachers-desk-1024x1024.jpeg,,,2025-04-21 06:04:19.793035

Matters of little consequence often get major time and attention. And vice versa. Two energy bills in the Colorado Legislature this year, one about nuclear energy and the second about electrical transmission, illustrate this.
The first bill, House Bill 25-1040, which is now law, declared that nuclear energy is clean. It proclaims that utilities can meet clean-energy targets with nuclear. It also allows private projects access to financing restricted to clean energy development.
The bill sailed through the Legislature. Gov. Jared Polis signed it into law March 31. For believers, those who want to believe that nuclear energy will be the answer, it was a big win.
To what effect? Likely none. Forget about nuclear waste and safety concerns. Cost of energy from new nuclear plans remains exorbitant.

Some of this was sorted through in a four-hour committee hearing in March. Chuck Kutscher was among several dozen individuals given two-minute slots to testify. He deserved more time. A nuclear engineer by training, he subsequently moved into renewables, retiring from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory several years ago.
At a later meeting in Jefferson County, Kutscher explained why he expects nuclear energy to play no role in Colorado’s energy transition. It comes down to cost.
“I like to give credit where credit is due. And the fact is that nuclear power in this country has saved a heck of a lot of carbon dioxide and air pollution emissions,” he said. “Nuclear provides almost half of U.S. carbon-free electricity, which is pretty impressive.”
As for costs, Kutscher cited two metrics courtesy of Lazard, a financial company that monitors electrical generation. The cost of building new nuclear plants comes in at $8,000 to $13,000 per kilowatt of generating capacity. Solar comes in at $1,400, wind at $2,000.
A broader metric, the levelized cost, includes capital, fuel and operating costs over the life of an energy plant. “The longer a plant runs, the lower its life-cycle costs, because it’s producing more energy,” Kutscher explained. By this measure, nuclear still comes up short: 18 cents a kilowatt-hour compared to solar and wind for 5 and 6 cents.
Might costs drop with a new generation of small modular reactors? SMRs can generate 300 megawatts or less. One was planned in the West, but in 2023 the Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems pulled out of its contract with nuclear company NuScale — because of cost.
If nuclear costs make it a non-starter in Colorado, can renewables deliver us to an emission-free electrical system? The sun vanishes daily, and sometimes winds on our eastern plains die down, even for days. Kutscher sees possible solutions in improving storage technologies and expanded transmission. Transmission can enable electricity to be shared across multiple time zones and weather systems.
Transmission technologies
Even moving electricity around Colorado more efficiently has value. The second bill, Senate Bill 24-127, proposes to do that. It would require investor-owned utilities to investigate tools called advanced transmission technologies. They will enable more use from existing transmission lines and associated infrastructure.
Larry Milosevich, a Lafayette resident, decided six years ago to devote himself to fewer pursuits. He says he chose the role of advanced technologies for transmission because of its oversized impact.  The transmission system developed during the last century has many inefficiencies.
“I would love to see advanced transmission technologies get a little more light,” he says. Why hasn’t it happened? “It doesn’t have sex appeal.”
This bill will not solve all problems. “You need a lot of arrows in your quiver to get there. And it’s not one technology that’s going to save the day,” says Leah Rubin Shen, managing director of Advanced Energy United, an industry association that advocates for technologies and policies that advance decarbonization.
More transmission will still be needed. Approvals take time. Using these tools can more rapidly expand capacity at lower cost. “We characterize it as a no-regrets solution,” says Rubin Shen.
State Sen. Cleave Simpson, a Republican from Alamosa, was the primary author of the bill. “We can increase the capacity and resilience of our infrastructure without having to undertake expensive, large-scale construction projects,” he told committee members at a March meeting.
The committee that day heard from fewer than a dozen witnesses. It passed an amended bill and moved on within 45 minutes. Several weeks before, the same committee heard nuclear testimony for hours.
In a later interview, Simpson described the bill, slimmed greatly in ambition from its original iteration, as “maybe a tiny step forward, but a doable one.”
Unlike nuclear, not the answer, but a doable one.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)The plot is thickening in the Rhode Island Department of Education’s (RIDE) takeover of Providence public schools. It’s been five years. Providence wants them back ASAP. But neither side has offered ways to rebuild the foundations that cement the dysfunction.  
Until now.
Useful ideas are emerging at the State House, with increasingly specific proposals that have actual meat on nice-sounding principles. In a true act of forward movement, Sen. Sam Zurier, a Providence Democrat, introduced three bills on March 7 that could really improve how Providence schools govern themselves, deploy their own resources, and maintain high quality staff. 
Zurier’s bills were introduced a month after Gov. Dan McKee and RIDE outlined nine conditions the city must meet to regain local control by June 2026.
Basically, the city must provide more money, fiscal transparency, a trained and well-informed board, and improved facilities. No argument there, but where are changes to education policy per se? One condition told the city to “establish performance-based outcomes for contracts at the Providence Public School Department, such as custodial services.” Wait. Custodial contracts?!  
The nine conditions seemed tone deaf to report after report. Like the Providence Blueprint for Education, which called the school district “confused about priorities.”
Like the Johns Hopkins Institute for Education Policy 2019 review that precipitated the takeover by documenting a laundry list of problems, from the majority of students performing below grade level to demoralized teachers and unsafe school buildings. 
Like last year’s Senate Education Commission’s report, identifying the Providence teachers contract as a huge obstacle to student success.   










Sen. Sam Zurier, a Providence Democrat, introduced three bills on March 7 that could really improve how Providence schools govern themselves, deploy their own resources, and maintain high quality staff. 


RIDE Commissioner Angélica Infante-Green soon followed up with a substantial, detailed letter to the city clarifying and reducing nine conditions to five overarching concerns: Governance, Finances, Facilities, Legislation and a Transition Plan. 
Four of the concerns have numbered and bulleted details with educational asks, like requiring the school board to shift its focus from adult inputs to student outcomes — the very heart of the matter.
But “Legislation” has only a vague sentence requesting an intergovernmental team to work on state laws “to remove legislative barriers to improving outcomes and opportunities for Providence’s children.”  
While clearly anti-kid and anti-education, legislative barriers seem immutable because no one wants conflicts with our powerful teachers unions. Remember this: A public-sector teachers union is a private-sector business whose mission is to benefit and protect teachers. The laws serve adults.  
Thankfully, the trio of bills from Zurier offer a better way. Here’s how:
Senate Bill No. 745 – Expedited grievance process  
State law imposes a grievance procedure so onerous, administrators rarely try to discipline or fire a non-performing teacher. Unions argue they “counsel out” poor teachers with a stern conversation, and sometimes that does work. But teachers’ union dues entitle members to full-throated legal protection if they want it. 
Abundant stories, now too old to threaten confidentiality, include the 80-year-old who slept through classes, but whom the union protected on the grounds that the district had not supplied adequate professional development.  
The commission offers an example of the onerous process with the story of a 2014 grievance that originated with an evidence-filled termination letter to a certain teacher. After several district hearings, the grievance went to RIDE for “an appeal to a hearing officer, a review by the commissioner, a second review by the commissioner, an appeal to the Council on Elementary and Secondary Education and an appeal to the Superior Court which upheld the termination.” The Supreme Court is still an option. 
Solution: End blanket protection of all teachers no matter their performance by shortening the wealth of opportunities to appeal administrative decisions. At the same time, this bill would create guardrails to protect teachers who serve students well. The guardrails legislate against arbitrary or vengeful terminations by including a list of specific grounds for reprimand or dismissal. If the shorter appeals process doesn’t work, the matter goes to binding arbitration by specified outside parties whose decision is final. These revisions are fair to teachers and create flexibility for administration.
Senate Bill No. 746. Mandatory annual salary step increases
By law, districts and their municipalities must stick to a “a salary schedule recognizing years of service” with up to 12 annual pay increase steps. This “lock-step” pay system is a throwback to the 1960s automotive factory workers’ contracts on which our teachers’ contracts were modeled. Districts can not negotiate innovative pay systems that incentivize our best teachers to stay in the profession by, for example, advancing up the salary scale more quickly by taking on leadership roles. Conversely, teachers who need to improve get the same salary bump as everyone else.  
Solution: Eliminate the “lock-step” mandate so schools have the freedom to deploy their resources where they’re needed. The adjusted bill allows Providence to “negotiate alternative salary schedules” outside of the rigid factory-model uniformity, which may include other “bases for increased compensation” including paying “teachers willing to take on greater responsibilities.”
Senate Bill No. 747. Laying off teachers by seniority
State law mandates hiring, laying off and re-hiring teachers by seniority, which is to say, who has the oldest date of original hire. If student enrollment declines, unionized teachers must be retained or re-hired by seniority. Administrators don’t get to decide to keep the most effective educators on staff. It’s LIFO, or Last In, First Out. 
Another old story: Years ago, the district dismissed a famously popular Teacher of the Year because his three-year probation wasn’t up yet. Senior teachers who had not been rehired by a failing school that was being rebooted (“reconstituted”) had legal rights to his job. The public hew and cry made no difference. Seniority is the law. Even if contract negotiators agree to suspend strict seniority, they invite lawsuits.  
Solution: Limit LIFO, with caveats. The new bill is longer than the original 1960s-era legislation because it details what teachers might be retained regardless of seniority. They include bilingual teachers, teachers with excellent evaluations or needed skills, teachers of the year and others. For the record, teachers of color are more likely to be new, so LIFO upsets efforts to diversify the workforce. 
It’s worth noting that these bills were assigned to the Senate Labor Committee instead of the Education Committee, again prioritizing adult concerns over kids.
There’s still time, though. The legislature can still make the needed changes. If not, the dysfunctional Providence district will be a hot potato passed back and forth between the state and the city, neither of which really has the tools to succeed. 
If that happens, the Providence students will be right back where they were in 1993 when these problems were first reported. 
Remember the local cliché: “As goes Providence, so goes the state.”

States worry that an executive order and federal funding cuts could weaken their cybersecurity efforts. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)For the first half of his career in law enforcement, working as a police officer in South Florida, Chase Fopiano did not think cyberattacks on police agencies were a serious threat.
Many of his law enforcement colleagues were under the same impression — that since they were the most likely to investigate the attacks, there was no way cybercriminals would go after them.
By about 2015, as technology advanced and hackers became more creative, that changed, Fopiano said. Now, from the U.S. Secret Service to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, there are thousands of attempts to compromise networks or organizations every day, he said.
“A lot of those [attempts] are toward government or even police, especially because they know that we’re not as prepared as we should be,” said Fopiano, who now oversees cybersecurity as part of a regional task force.
Spanning health care facilities to court systems, states and local communities are facing a rise in cyberthreats. They include threats to critical infrastructure, increased activity from foreign actors, continued ransomware attacks and more, according to a recent report from the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center.
But President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order shifting some of the responsibility from the federal government to states and localities to improve their infrastructure to address risks, including cybercrimes. And federal cuts have reduced resources for state and local officials, including a cybersecurity grant program and a key cybersecurity agency.
States and localities are taking steps to address the problems, such as establishing new penalties for tampering with critical infrastructure, centralizing state IT personnel and setting standards in areas from elections to health care.
But the Trump order and federal funding cuts, a shortage of IT experts at the local level and an overall lack of preparedness could weaken their efforts.
In December, a major cyberattack forced Rhode Island to take down its online portal used by residents to obtain Medicaid benefits and SNAP, commonly known as food stamps. The personal data stolen from Rhode Island’s public benefits network — including Social Security numbers and banking information — was later found on the dark web.
In February, a “sophisticated cyberattack” hit the office of Virginia Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares, which led agency officials to shut down computer systems and resort to paper court filings.
Last week, hackers also breached the computer network of the Fall River School District in Massachusetts. The school district is working with third-party experts and law enforcement to determine if anyone’s personal information was targeted, according to MassLive.
In 2023, of the 48 states that participated in the Nationwide Cybersecurity Review, a voluntary self-assessment conducted by federal agencies that examines how well governments are prepared to respond to cyberattacks, only 22 states reached or surpassed the recommended levels of security in their systems.










The notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.


– Samir Jain, Vice President of Policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology


Cybersecurity has become increasingly important over time because more government services and data are digitized, said Samir Jain, the vice president of policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology, a nonprofit that advocates for digital rights and freedom of expression.
But a national shortage of people with that expertise — especially at the local level — creates a challenge.
“The federal government has traditionally played at least some role in trying to fill some of those gaps,” Jain said. “And so the notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.”
Local governments and law enforcement agencies also have other priorities, Fopiano said. The police need cars, guns, shields and other resources that generally take precedence over cybersecurity.
Today, Fopiano is the cybersecurity chair of the Southeast Regional Domestic Security Task Force in Florida, overseeing cyber activity from South Florida to the Florida Keys. The attacks continue to rise, he said.
“Terrorist groups are getting into cybercrime, cartels are getting into cybercrime, you have kids just learning about hacking and just fooling around,” he said. “The audience of who’s doing it has definitely expanded and led to that rise in overall cybercrime.”
Cuts to federal resources
In 2022, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced a first-of-its-kind cybersecurity grant program, providing more than $1 billion in funding for states, localities, tribes and territories to address cybersecurity risks and threats.
The State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program, created under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, awarded $279 million to states and localities in fiscal year 2024. The Tribal Cybersecurity Grant Program awarded another $18 million for tribes in its first year.
But the grant program is set to expire in September, with no current plans to renew it. At a hearing this month, several state and local officials urged Congress to reauthorize the program. But U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who refused the federal aid during her tenure as governor of South Dakota, questioned the program’s efficacy.
The Trump administration is also cutting as many as 1,300 employees from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, which administers the grants alongside the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
The program has allowed states to assess the security of their networks, develop cybersecurity training, implement multi-factor authentication features — which requires users to provide more than one form of verification to access a site or service — and much more, said Alex Whitaker, the director of government affairs at the National Association of State Chief Information Officers.
“This has been a really great program because we’re seeing a lot of great evidence for how states and their counterparts in local government are improving their cyber defenses,” Whitaker said.
Counties also rely on a number of federal resources to strengthen their defenses, including services provided by CISA, said Rita Reynolds, the chief information officer at the National Association of Counties and managing director for County Tech Xchange. NACo is an organization that represents county governments across the United States.
The Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center, for instance — a key collaboration between CISA and the Center for Internet Security to help state and local governments with cybersecurity operations — lost some of its federal funding for certain programs last month, Reynolds said.
In trying to keep up with emerging threats, counties are still trying to find resources to help them implement multi-factor authentication, convert government pages to “.gov” domains and other methods of protecting their infrastructure, she said.
“Are counties prepared?” Reynolds asked. “I would say they’re not as prepared as they’d like to be. And in some cases, they are looking at how to strategically approach this now that resources are disappearing.”
In a statement, CISA spokesperson Jared Auchey said Trump’s executive order empowers state and local governments “to make risk-informed decisions and investments to improve their preparedness.” The agency will work with state and local officials to ensure they have the information and support they need, Auchey added.
Lawmakers step up
In 2024, 33 states adopted resolutions or enacted legislation regarding cybersecurity, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan public officials’ association.
Many of those measures sought to protect states’ critical infrastructure, including water systems, government services, health care and more. Florida, Louisiana, West Virginia and other states created new criminal and civil penalties for people who attempt to tamper with critical infrastructure.
In Minnesota and Washington state, lawmakers passed measures allowing or requiring state and local governments to invest in cybersecurity protections related to election administration. Connecticut and Florida also passed legislation to secure health care facilities from cyberattacks by having hospitals create plans or by supporting investments in new technologies.
Other states are looking for solutions from outside vendors. South Dakota has set aside $7 million for a company to examine local governments for vulnerabilities to hackers.
With attacks occurring at every level of government, New Mexico Democratic state Sen. Michael Padilla, the Senate majority whip, sponsored legislation in 2023 to create the state’s office of cybersecurity. As chair of the Senate Science, Technology and Telecommunications Committee for 10 years, he plays a significant role in most of the state’s cybersecurity legislation.
Through the committee’s work, Padilla says New Mexico is in good shape to fend off cyberattacks — and the state’s cities and counties are joining in.
“I think New Mexico is in a very good position because what we decided to do by creating that office is to ensure that any transactions that occur with state government here [in New Mexico] have to meet a minimum set of security standards,” he said.
In Indiana, Republican state Sen. Liz Brown filed legislation that would encourage state agencies and groups to develop cybersecurity policies. The bill was approved by both chambers, with the Senate agreeing to changes sent from the House.
“You have to protect your infrastructure,” Brown said. “We don’t want utility systems to be shut down. We don’t want wastewater or freshwater treatment plants or even the water supply being contaminated or harmed in some way. Our systems all have backups, but even so, we know there are bad actors.”
Some states are also preparing to reshuffle their offices or create new ones to centralize their cybersecurity efforts. Arkansas, for example, enacted legislation this month to create a new state cybersecurity office, which will monitor the state’s computer networks and respond to cyberthreats.
In Alabama, rather than having information technology people scattered throughout the government, Republican state Rep. Mike Shaw wants cybersecurity personnel centrally managed.
Shaw’s legislation, which passed the House and is currently in the Senate, would give the Alabama Office of Information Technology central authority to maintain the needs of all of the state’s departments.
The centralization would make it easier to pursue cybersecurity initiatives in the future, Shaw said.
“The federal government is really big, and it’s really hard to come up with a one-size-fits-all solution for things like cybersecurity, data privacy and technology in general,” Shaw said. “So, in some sense, it’s good that the states are coming up with their own.”

Before everything went black, Tamika Jackson felt like she was drowning. While in labor giving birth to her baby boy, her body felt heavy and her breaths shallow.
“I can’t breathe,” she croaked to the anesthesiologist.
“If you couldn’t breathe, you wouldn’t be able to speak,” she recalled the doctor telling her, dismissing her as having a “panic attack.”
Minutes later, the 37-year-old’s lungs gave out. Her heart stopped beating.
Clinicians were able to resuscitate Jackson. Her baby boy was born via C-section, and the Michigan mom lived to tell her story of giving birth to Cree, who’s turning 3 next month.
Jackson is now a maternal health organizer at Mothering Justice, a Michigan-based nonprofit. She spoke with Stateline while on a bus to the Michigan Capitol, where she participated in a Black Maternal Health Week panel and pushed for a legislative package — nicknamed the Michigan Momnibus — which aims to increase obstetric patient protections and improve care for moms of color.
The Michigan Senate passed the package Thursday, and it now heads to the House.
Black moms like Jackson are three times more likely to die than white mothers and suffer higher rates of pregnancy-related complications.
But in its bid to eliminate federal diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, initiatives, the Trump administration has terminated community health grants and closed federal offices that support state efforts to tackle racial health disparities. Experts say the moves will hinder efforts to improve Black maternal health.
“DEI is not about politics. It’s about survival,” Jackson said. “This is about community-based solutions — and they’re undoing that.”
Jackson added that without federal dollars, “We’re going to be left trying to do a whole lot with a whole lot of nothing.”
The Trump administration has cut grants for maternal health studies and research on health disparities in various populations, including patients of color and LGBTQ people. It has laid off most staff at the federal Division of Reproductive Health, and removed maternal health data from federal agency websites.
It also is considering cutting next year’s budget for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services from about $121 billion to about $80.4 billion, according to The New York Times. The administration plans to create a new Administration for a Healthy America, which would focus on maternal and child health, among other issues.
HHS and its National Institutes of Health did not return requests for comment in time for publication.










DEI is not about politics. It’s about survival.


– Tamika Jackson, Michigan mom and maternal health organizer at Mothering Justice


Researchers and advocates like Jackson say that amid the Trump administration’s erasures, their work will continue.
Among those losing grants are nonprofits, health care systems and universities, including the Morehouse School of Medicine, a historically Black medical school in Atlanta, which received a $2.96 million grant for a center to improve the health of Black pregnant and postpartum women. Georgia has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the nation.
“We are reviewing the situation to assess how it may affect our research,” a Morehouse spokesperson wrote in an email. “More broadly, it is important that we all recognize the critical role medical research plays in developing potential life-saving innovation that will mitigate disease and improve the health and well-being of many people.”

The Morehouse center was selected among an initial 10 research centers funded under the NIH’s Maternal Health and Pregnancy Outcomes Vision for Everyone, or “IMPROVE,” Initiative.
Columbia University and community groups throughout New York also received the grants. One goal was to connect postpartum moms with doulas to detect conditions such as postpartum preeclampsia, according to principal investigator Dr. Uma Reddy, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Columbia. Reddy said the grant was developed with communities who voiced their needs.
“We can actually prevent these deaths and these serious complications,” Reddy said. “This is a way to focus on a high-risk population and provide them with the resources that they don’t have available.”

Tufts University maternal health scholar Ndidiamaka Amutah-Onukagha said she’s had several meetings in Washington, D.C., get canceled, and while she’s thankful to have almost completed one federal grant project, there’s uncertainty about other grants she’s applied for, including a Black postpartum support research initiative.
The professor runs the Maternal Outcomes for Translational Health Equity Research (MOTHER) Lab and Center for Black Maternal Health and Reproductive Justice at the Tufts University School of Medicine.
“It not only stalls progress, but it actually actively endangers the most vulnerable among us,” she said. “These policy decisions can cause and will cause lasting harm to people who are already underserved by our health care system.”
Amutah-Onukagha said she is urging researchers and advocates to have “cautious optimism.”
“Most people are in the space of gloom and doom. I do get that, and I’m vastly in and out of that,” she said. “But because of the work that I do in maternal health, we have to remain optimistic. That lens cannot die. If it does, then the communities that we serve are going to be even more disadvantaged.”
Amutah-Onukagha, who recently testified before the Massachusetts Joint Committee on Public Health, said her team will continue to work with organizations around the state, such as Birth Equity & Justice Massachusetts and Resilient Sisterhood Project.
“We’re stronger in numbers,” she said.
Diana Greene Foster, research director in reproductive health at the University of California, San Francisco, conducted the seminal Turnaway Study documenting the harms women suffer from abortion denials.
She was in the middle of another study, funded by a federal grant, tracking post-Roe abortions and the efficacy of health exceptions in abortion ban laws. Her team was interviewing emergency room doctors about whether they could provide abortions amid major pregnancy complications such as eclampsia, a serious consequence of preeclampsia, which is a dangerous form of high blood pressure that disproportionately affects Black mothers.
The administration pulled her grant.
Foster, who is fundraising to continue her study, said she feels the administration’s actions send a message of “turning their back on science, on compassion, on caring about women.”

Tina Sherman, a doula and national director of maternal justice at MomsRising, a nonpartisan women and mothers advocacy group, said she worries about data the administration has removed, including the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System.
The surveillance system is a comprehensive tool states use to track maternal health and formulate policies to improve it.
“An attempt to erase the data,” said Sherman, “doesn’t erase the harm that has been done and creates additional harm.”
Without data, states can’t target where resources are needed and which communities are disproportionately harmed and how, said Sherman, who co-chairs the North Carolina Maternal Mortality Review Committee.
“We’re going to be going backwards,” she said.
The Trump administration also canceled several grants focused on intimate partner violence, a leading cause of pregnancy-associated death which disproportionately affects people of color.
One such grant was supporting a University of North Carolina project studying intimate partner violence against pregnant women shortly before they give birth.
“The issues remain. The urgency is pressing as it ever was. The reality is this: Black mothers and birthing people continue to carry the weight of a crisis that we did not create,” Amutah-Onukagha said. “We did not create it, but we are leading the fight to solve it and dismantle it, and we know that the systemic barriers existed before this administration.
They will continue to show up — but we will also continue to produce cutting-edge research here at the center.”

“This has been a really great program because we’re seeing a lot of great evidence for how states and their counterparts in local government are improving their cyber defenses,” Whitaker said.
Counties also rely on a number of federal resources to strengthen their defenses, including services provided by CISA, said Rita Reynolds, the chief information officer at the National Association of Counties and managing director for County Tech Xchange. NACo is an organization that represents county governments across the United States.
The Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center, for instance — a key collaboration between CISA and the Center for Internet Security to help state and local governments with cybersecurity operations — lost some of its federal funding for certain programs last month, Reynolds said.
In trying to keep up with emerging threats, counties are still trying to find resources to help them implement multi-factor authentication, convert government pages to “.gov” domains and other methods of protecting their infrastructure, she said.
“Are counties prepared?” Reynolds asked. “I would say they’re not as prepared as they’d like to be. And in some cases, they are looking at how to strategically approach this now that resources are disappearing.”
In a statement, CISA spokesperson Jared Auchey said Trump’s executive order empowers state and local governments “to make risk-informed decisions and investments to improve their preparedness.” The agency will work with state and local officials to ensure they have the information and support they need, Auchey added.
 Lawmakers step up

In 2024, 33 states adopted resolutions or enacted legislation regarding cybersecurity, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan public officials’ association.
Many of those measures sought to protect states’ critical infrastructure, including water systems, government services, health care and more. Florida, Louisiana, West Virginia and other states created new criminal and civil penalties for people who attempt to tamper with critical infrastructure.
In Minnesota and Washington state, lawmakers passed measures allowing or requiring state and local governments to invest in cybersecurity protections related to election administration. Connecticut and Florida also passed legislation to secure health care facilities from cyberattacks by having hospitals create plans or by supporting investments in new technologies.
Other states are looking for solutions from outside vendors. South Dakota has set aside $7 million for a company to examine local governments for vulnerabilities to hackers.
With attacks occurring at every level of government, New Mexico Democratic state Sen. Michael Padilla, the Senate majority whip, sponsored legislation in 2023 to create the state’s office of cybersecurity. As chair of the Senate Science, Technology and Telecommunications Committee for 10 years, he plays a significant role in most of the state’s cybersecurity legislation.
Through the committee’s work, Padilla says New Mexico is in good shape to fend off cyberattacks — and the state’s cities and counties are joining in.
“I think New Mexico is in a very good position because what we decided to do by creating that office is to ensure that any transactions that occur with state government here [in New Mexico] have to meet a minimum set of security standards,” he said.
In Indiana, Republican state Sen. Liz Brown filed legislation that would encourage state agencies and groups to develop cybersecurity policies. The bill was approved by both chambers, with the Senate agreeing to changes sent from the House.
“You have to protect your infrastructure,” Brown said. “We don’t want utility systems to be shut down. We don’t want wastewater or freshwater treatment plants or even the water supply being contaminated or harmed in some way. Our systems all have backups, but even so, we know there are bad actors.”
Some states are also preparing to reshuffle their offices or create new ones to centralize their cybersecurity efforts. Arkansas, for example, enacted legislation this month to create a new state cybersecurity office, which will monitor the state’s computer networks and respond to cyberthreats.
In Alabama, rather than having information technology people scattered throughout the government, Republican state Rep. Mike Shaw wants cybersecurity personnel centrally managed.
Shaw’s legislation, which passed the House and is currently in the Senate, would give the Alabama Office of Information Technology central authority to maintain the needs of all of the state’s departments.
The centralization would make it easier to pursue cybersecurity initiatives in the future, Shaw said.
“The federal government is really big, and it’s really hard to come up with a one-size-fits-all solution for things like cybersecurity, data privacy and technology in general,” Shaw said. “So, in some sense, it’s good that the states are coming up with their own.”

(Vlad Gavrilovic / Norfolk Transit Department)Virginia’s Department of Rail and Public Transportation has just released their draft six- year improvement program for fiscal year 2026, totaling roughly $7 billion. The funds cover both operational costs and larger sums for capital improvement projects statewide. 
The City of Alexandria, for example, will get money to help cover the $200,000  operational cost for their GO Alex program, which is the city’s outreach program to get residents to ride transit, carpool and commute by bicycle. Hampton Roads’ transportation department will receive funds towards replacing two large buses, a project that will total $1.6 million – and that’s just one of their more than 30 plus capital improvement projects. Localities depend on the state money to update the equipment used to serve the public in various regions of Virginia.
“We of course got money to buy new buses. We have a fleet of over 300 buses,” said Ray Amoruso, chief planning and development officer for Hampton Roads Transportation. “The average life of a bus is either 10 or 12 years and at some point they have to be replaced. So every year we ask for bus money.”
 How the six-year funding program works

The Six-year Improvement Program (SYIP) is an annual funding program that both DRPT and the Virginia Department of Transportation administer to help fund rail — including freight – and public transit programs across the state. The different amounts of funding found in the six-year projects is derived by formulas established by Virginia law. Individual projects, which localities apply for, are funded by the SYIP and are evaluated and given scores by DRPT, then approved by the Commonwealth Transportation Board. 
“The state updates their six-year improvement plan every year. So it’s like a moving window. Each year we progress,” said Amoruso. “Sometimes we ask for the same money if they didn’t award it to us [the first time]. Next year, we’ll do this all over again.”
Here’s a breakdown of how the funds will be allocated in the upcoming fiscal year:. 

Public Transportation: $332 million
Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA): $442 million
Virginia Railway Express (VRE): $17 million
Rail (DRPT) $20 million
Transforming Rail in Virginia (VPRA) $232 million

Amoruso said the district gets federal operating assistance based on the size of their metropolitan area and the number of people who live in that area. The Hampton Roads Transportation District covers six cities: Chesapeake, Hampton, Newport News, Norfolk, Portsmouth and Virginia Beach.
“A lot of folks who aren’t familiar with HRT or don’t use HRT think that the money they drop in the fare box pays for their ride,” he said. 
One capital project that Amoruso is excited about getting funding to build is an off-street transfer facility off Chesapeake Boulevard known as the Evelyn T. Butts Transfer Station, named after a local Civil Rights activist. Since 1999, riders have had to wait on the street to transfer buses.
“It’s not a pleasant environment. Nine routes come together and people run up and down the block along the length of the block to make connections to other routes,” said Amoruso. “It’s the third busiest transfer center we have in terms of moving human beings back in and out every day.”
 Federal funding could be in jeopardy 

Though next year’s state transportation fiscal funding is taking shape, the uncertainty of future federal support weighs heavy on Amoruso, he said. 
President Donald Trump’s administration and Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency have committed to cutting over a trillion dollars in government spending they deem wasteful, targeting scores of federal programs with special emphasis on eliminating ones supporting diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives (DEI). A January executive order by Trump sparked panic with its directives to federal agencies, including the Department of Transportation, to pause millions in federal funds disbursements, including money allotted for capital improvement projects through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, and for electric vehicle and clean energy infrastructure development. 
“It’s not just us, every transit property in the country is nervous because the administration is targeting certain discretionary programs that are connected to DEI initiatives, climate change initiatives,” Amoruso said.  “We in the past have been successful in getting grant awards for low-emission, no-emission buses, meaning electric buses.”
Amoruso said HRT had a goal to convert their 300 diesel buses to a 100% hundred emissions-free, all electric bus system by 2045.
“This administration doesn’t look like they have an appetite to support those kinds of investments,” he said. “That’s just one example, but there are other programs that are at risk related to DEI and all the transit properties in the country are nervous about that and [are] watching very carefully these discretionary grants.”
One grant program Amoruso is watching is a capital investment initiative administered through Congress to help build out bus rapid transit, such as Richmond’s Pulse line or other light rail systems. 
“That’s under the microscope of the federal government right now,” said Amoruso, “which is making a lot of people nervous for high capacity transit projects.”
Department of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has stated to cut federal funding to Democratic-led states and cities, like New York and California, if they don’t release information on transit crime and safety funding, according E&E News by Politico. 
 Public input needed

The public is invited to comment on all the projects that have been recommended for funding in the draft six-year plan. The Commonwealth Transportation Board will host nine meetings across the state from the week of April 22 through May 15. Online comments, email or regular mail are also being accepted. 
The first meetings take place this week, starting in Richmond, followed by a meeting Wednesday in Lynchburg and one on Thursday in Hampton Roads. 
On June 17 staff from DRPT will present the draft, including any changes, to the Commonwealth Transportation Board for approval. On July 1, all the approved funding will become available.

(Ben Cunningham/ Allegheny-Blue Ridge Alliance.)The future of the Shenandoah Valley Railroad Corridor is coming into clearer focus after the Virginia Department of Transportation recently released its highly anticipated rail with trail assessment and completed a series of related public hearings. 
In 2021, the agency completed its first study of Norfolk Southern’s 50-mile corridor, which local leaders and community organizers, who are part of the Friends of the Shenandoah Rail Trail, hope will lead to converting the rail corridor into a trail. 
VDOT’s second corridor review comes after the Shenandoah Rail Corridor Coalition, a smaller group of community members, questioned the possibility of restoring the Manassas Gap railroad and constructing a trail alongside it. 
The rail corridor, first established in the 1850s, runs from Front Royal to the town of Broadway in Rockingham County. As interest declined in freight service, the company began discontinuing sections of the corridor in 1989, moving operations to Norfolk Southern’s Crescent Corridor, which runs east.
Kate Wofford, executive director of the Alliance for Shenandoah Valley, said her group is “eager” to convert the corridor to a trail, a goal shared by their colleagues, the Friends of the Shenandoah Rail Trail.
“We wanted to get going with it years ago,” said Wofford. “So the sooner we can get started with this wonderful project, the sooner it will start bringing benefits to quality of life, local economic development, tourism (and) to the towns.”
Keven Walker, executive director for the Shenandoah Valley Battlefields Foundation, part of the Shenandoah Rail Corridor Coalition, was asked for comment, but did not immediately respond.
The foundation is facing a lawsuit from one of its members over plans to restore the inactive Manassas Gap rail line in the Shenandoah Valley. The suit claims the foundation’s involvement strays far from its mission and threatens its federal tax-exempt status.
 The assessment

Phase 1 of the study to assess the proposal for restoring the railroad and constructing an adjacent trail details projected costs, risks, and public feedback.
While the assessment did not provide a precise total cost to taxpayers, state lawmakers stipulated that “up to $35.0 million shall be allocated to the Shenandoah Valley Rail Trail for the purposes of land acquisition, initial planning, and site” development through the 2020-2022 state budget negotiation.
Some of the costs that would need to be considered are $66 million to repair the existing bridges, $4 million to $18 million to bring the rail line up to the FRA Class II standards, and funding to purchase easements and right of way and land acquisitions, given the narrow 33-foot setback from the centerline of the rail.
The study identified several unknown design factors and associated risks compared to the rail-to-trail concept, including the cantilevered trail structures on existing bridges, which would require retrofitting and may present maintenance and trail user safety concerns. 
The agency also received feedback from county administrators and town managers from 12 localities along the corridor; all of them said their communities supported the rail-to-trail proposal.
The consensus among the leaders is that business use of the rail isn’t in high demand. The study stated, “no localities indicated a strong interest from the business community for freight rail service.” 
However, the agency noted that two existing businesses, which were not identified in the study, have shown interest in using rail. Other industries, such as food processing, have indicated that rail does not fit their business model. 
Several economic development offices have received inquiries from businesses that perceive the ability to increase their customer base from trail users, the study found.
 What’s next

VDOT is currently in Phase 2 of the project to assess the corridor. The process will continue throughout the year with experts reviewing how water moves through the targeted area to inform flood prevention plans, assessing the train tracks and bridges and conducting in-person public meetings and an online public survey.
Phase 3 will conclude with a review of ownership and maintenance and a presentation of the cost estimate and assessment report, with public meetings to follow between the winter and spring of 2026.

(Courtesy Virginians For Reproductive Freedom)“Politicians shouldn’t control your body,” reads a billboard that will soon be unveiled in Central Virginia and Hampton Roads as part of a new campaign highlighting an in-progress legislative effort to enshrine reproductive health care options like abortion, contraception and in vitro fertilization into Virginia’s constitution. 
These issues, longtime priorities for Democratic state lawmakers, will likely feature prominently in this year’s House of Delegates elections, where all 100 seats will be on the ballot. 
“It’s going to be in our hands, then it’s going to be in your hands,” Sen. Jennifer Boysko, D-Fairfax, said at a press conference earlier this year when touting the amendment. Boysko sponsored the amendment that would cement access to abortion care in Virginia’s code in the state Senate this year, which the legislature advanced. 
As Republican incumbents have opposed the measure, a coalition of organizations have rallied for an ad blitz spotlighting the matter. 
To support candidates who share the amendment’s goal, a cohort has emerged called Virginians For Reproductive Freedom,. The consortium includes Repro Rising Virginia, Planned Parenthood Advocates of Virginia, League of Women Voters of Virginia, and Birth In Color and other organizations. It also includes Virginia’s chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. 
VRF recently announced plans for the billboards to be placed near college campuses in Hampton, Norfolk and Williamsburg and 100 sidewalk decals with similar messaging will be installed in high foot-traffic areas around Norfolk and Richmond. 
Multilingual multimedia content is planned that will break down how the constitutional amendment process works. Having passed the legislature this year, it will need to pass again next year before appearing as a referendum on ballots statewide. 
But that may only be possible if Democrats retain or grow their majority in the House of Delegates this year, as the amendment advanced this year on partisan lines. 
Virginia’s current law allows most abortions up to 26 weeks of pregnancy with limitations and approval required for the procedure to take place later. Many state Republicans have consistently opposed the current law, with some seeking to reduce the limit to 15 weeks, and others having supported near-total bans. This year, Del. Kim Taylor, R-Petersburg, introduced a bill that would have specifically protected abortion as a treatment for nonviable pregnancies, but it was never docketed or put up for a vote.
Republican abortion bill banned from Virginia’s 2025 legislative session

“Miscarriages and ectopic pregnancies are nonviable pregnancies, and therefore cannot be confused with elective abortion procedures,” she told The Mercury at the time. “This would have put any doubt about the law to rest.” 
Abortions at or after 21 weeks are rare, making up just 1% of cases nationwide.  When they do occur, it’s often due to severe fetal anomalies that aren’t detected earlier through testing or because of life-threatening complications later in pregnancy. 
If Virginia’s constitution were amended, the three-physician approval threshold for later-stage abortions would be reduced to one. 
Earlier this year, House Minority Leader Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah called the resolution a “word salad” designed to “cloud the true intentions” of the amendment. He argued that reducing the current requirement for three doctors to sign off on a procedure to just one would lower safeguards.
“The abortion doctor can do that,” Gilbert said. 
But supporters of the amendment have stressed that it could be particularly critical in rural pregnancy health crises, where patients already have to travel further for care. 
If enshrined in Virginia’s constitution, abortion access and other reproductive rights would become far more resistant to legislative shifts, shielding from the kind of partisan turnover that has shaped abortion laws in other states. But constitutional amendments are hard to undo — and equally hard to pass.
With the resolutions now clearing the legislature for the first time, the real test comes next year, when lawmakers will have to approve them again before voters get the final say at the ballot box.

There are many shortcomings in the new proposed state budget approved by the North Carolina Senate last week – the inadequate pay raises for teachers and state employees, the failure to invest in numerous core public services that have been reeling from staffing shortages, the giveaways to unaccountable special interests.
But if there’s an overarching flaw that lies at the heart of the proposal, it is the plan to plow ahead with new and regressive tax cuts at a time when state economists are warning of significant budget shortfalls in the near future.
Republican Senate leader Phil Berger – a smalltown lawyer with no credentials in economics – says the consensus forecast of the state’s economists is wrong. He claims the state’s fiscal picture will remain rosy even with new corporate and personal income tax cuts taking effect and massive new reductions in federal aid from the Trump administration.
It’s a remarkably oblivious stance.
The bottom line: North Carolina public services are already running on a shoestring and the Senate’s decision to pull that string even tighter is a huge mistake.

Maggie Hassan (left) speaks with substance use disorder treatment specialists at Elliot Health System during an event in Manchester on April 14 about how Medicaid cuts would affect their work. (Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)Abby L’Heureux, a physician and addiction specialist at the Center for Recovery Management in Manchester, is already worried about some of her patients who have lost Medicaid coverage. Now, as Republicans in Washington, D.C., make massive cuts to the federal budget — which experts say will most likely impact Medicaid — she and her colleagues could see even more of their patients lose coverage for the care they need.
At an event organized by U.S. Sen. Maggie Hassan and Elliot Health System in Manchester earlier this month, L’Heureux told the story of a 30-year-old man who started using cocaine, alcohol, and opioids as a teenager and was incarcerated for the first time at 13. She said he has an extensive family history of substance use disorder as his mother died during an overdose and all his parents and grandparents have been incarcerated. On top of that, he has a seizure disorder and was homeless when he first began treatment with the center. While he hasn’t yet achieved stable long term sobriety, she said they were beginning to see success when they got him on a medication regime that includes an injectable.
“He’s just been doing so well and we continue to have little slips here and there, and we’re working on things, but he keeps coming,” she said. “And that’s a win for us, that he keeps showing up, and he keeps trying. And we always have hope that it’s just one step closer to his goal. His goal is abstinence and so, and we’re just gonna keep walking with him, one step closer, one step closer, and we’re gonna have setbacks, and that’s just a part of the process. But, he’s been doing so well, so much better, now that we’ve got him on a medication that works for him.”
L’Heureux said he’s feeling so well that he’s begun working full time again because he “just functions much better when he’s working full time, and really has things to do during the day.” However, this came with a drawback. He just lost the Medicaid coverage he uses to pay for the treatment because he’s now making too much money. She said his injectable alone costs $2,000 monthly without insurance and he has 10 different medications. She said they worry about how the Medicaid change will impact his progress, though he’s worked with a peer support coordinator to find marketplace insurance.
“That’s one of the things that we have to continue to focus on,” Hassan added. “Somebody is getting well enough to work, which is the goal — one of the goals — and then, but we don’t want them to lose insurance in the process. We want them to be able to keep coming here.”
Conversely, L’Heureux spoke of a 37-year-old man who started using cocaine at age 13, opioids at 15, and crystal meth at 22. He began working with her at the Center for Recovery Management and is taking 16 milligrams of a combination product of multiple opioid use medications. Now, he’s been sober since August 2023 and has become an advocate for his peers who speaks at commitment meetings and runs his own sober living facility. She said he even saved somebody from an overdose recently using the emergency medication Narcan. He is still able to use Medicaid for his treatments, which she said has been huge in his recovery.
The April 14 meeting came amid growing fears that Medicaid, the country’s public health care program for those with low income or high needs, could be heavily scaled down in the federal budgeting process. On April 10, the U.S. House of Representatives voted to approve legislation outlining the federal budget. That outline, which was passed 216-214 entirely through Republican support, calls for $1.5 trillion in spending cuts to clear the way for President Donald Trump’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act — which has long been lambasted by the left and economists as disproportionately benefitting the wealthy — to be renewed.
The outline instructs several committees to make varying levels of cuts to different areas of the budget. That includes the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which has been tasked with cutting its portion of the budget by $880 billion over 10 years. It doesn’t explicitly specify that these cuts must come from Medicaid, but because the program comprises about $8.2 trillion of the $8.6 trillion the committee can cut from, it would be impossible to do so without reducing Medicaid or Medicare. Some Republican lawmakers have floated the idea of cutting Medicaid by about a third over 10 years.
Meanwhile, Democrats on the Congressional Joint Economic Committee, including Hassan, estimate that roughly 24 million people would lose their health care coverage if this one-third cut went into effect, 10 million of whom would be children. In New Hampshire, that’s 60,000 people and 30,000 children.
Almost 1 million people receive medication treatment for opioid use disorder through Medicaid, according to committee Democrats. Nearly 10,000 of them live in New Hampshire. Of those 10,000, an estimated 70% or more are able to do so only through the Medicaid expansion, which New Hampshire enacted in 2014.
That expansion program is at perhaps the greatest risk in potential Medicaid cuts. This is because in 2018, New Hampshire state legislators (Medicaid is operated and funded jointly by the federal government and states) passed a trigger law which would eliminate that expansion should federal funding for the program fall below 90% of the cost of the program. This would mean an estimated 7,000 New Hampshire residents receiving opioid treatment medication through Medicaid would lose access to it.
At this month’s event, health care providers emphasized that funding substance use disorder treatment doesn’t just help people deal with their drug issues, it also prevents those issues from turning into more costly issues later on.
“People who are not in treatment end up in medical care,” Greg Baxter, president and CEO of Elliot Health System, said.
Meanwhile, fentanyl, a dangerous type of opioid drug, is ravaging communities across the U.S., including New Hampshire. Additionally, New Hampshire was among the hardest hit states in the opioid epidemic that began in the 2010s. From August 2022 to August 2023, over 110,000 Americans died from drug overdoses or poisonings, according to the Drug Enforcement Agency. In New Hampshire alone, there were 483 drug overdose deaths in 2022, the most recent data available, according to the National Center for Health Statistics.

“We got into business to keep costs low for the ‘good guys,’ but tariffs or anything else that raises prices keeps us from doing that,” said Whalen, co-founder of Sumuri LLC in Magnolia, Delaware, which makes computer workstations for police and government investigations. Whalen has to buy materials overseas, often from China, and he said the tariffs could force him to triple his price on some workstations to $12,000.
Tariffs are the main tool President Donald Trump is wielding to try to boost manufacturing in the United States, calling the achievement of that goal “an economic and national security priority.” But the higher levies have led to retaliation and suspended shipments, and Whalen said they are just one of several Trump administration actions squeezing his small manufacturing business.
The wave of federal spending cuts, which has affected grants to state and local governments, could make his customers put off purchases. And the administration has moved to cut off funding for a $175 million state-based program that provides expert advice to smaller factories like his.

The Delaware version of that program, the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, helped Sumuri fit expanded product lines into the limited space in its small-town factory.
“We were really having a tough time trying to figure out how to utilize our space efficiently,” Whalen said. “They came here and helped us organize and optimize, and it made a huge difference.”
On April 1, the Trump administration cut off funding for 10 such manufacturing programs that were up for renewal in Delaware, Hawaii, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota and Wyoming. Other state MEP programs will expire over the next year.
The administration gave a reprieve to those 10 states until the end of the fiscal year after objections from Democrats in the U.S. House and Senate. The National Institute of Standards and Technology, which manages the program, extended funding for the 10 states “after further review and consideration” and will “continue to evaluate plans for the program,” said agency spokesperson Chad Boutin.
The program has come under fire from Republicans since the George W. Bush administration first tried to end it in 2009, and again during the first Trump administration, but Congress has continued to fund it. The conservative Heritage Foundation said in a 2023 book that MEP’s functions “would be more properly carried out by the private sector.”
‘Dots don’t quite connect’
Buckley Brinkman, executive director of the Wisconsin Center for Manufacturing and Productivity, which works with his state’s MEP program, said it didn’t make much sense for the administration to shutter the program as it seeks to boost the number of U.S. manufacturing jobs.
“It’s one of those things where the dots don’t quite connect,” Brinkman said. “I mean, jeez, here’s a part of government that doesn’t cost a whole lot, in the grand scheme of things — less than $200 million a year — that’s returning 10-to-1 to the national treasury, working on a priority for the president.”
A 2024 Upjohn report found an even higher return: 17-to-1 on $175 million in the 2023 fiscal year, creating $3 billion in new federal tax revenue.

In Wisconsin, which has lost more than 138,000 manufacturing jobs since 2000, some parts makers report that business is booming as manufacturers seek to avoid tariffs by finding U.S. alternatives to Chinese manufacturers, Brinkman said. But more broadly, he doubts that the tariffs will spark a manufacturing boom in the state.
“Do we want all this manufacturing back? Do we have the will to get it back? The answer to both those questions is ‘no,’” Brinkman said. “Even without the tariffs we don’t really want Americans doing a lot of those jobs that are in Chinese factories right now.”











I mean, jeez, here’s a part of government that doesn't cost a whole lot, in the grand scheme of things … that's returning 10-to-1 to the national treasury.


– Buckley Brinkman, director of Wisconsin Center for Manufacturing and Productivity



In Delaware, the MEP helped Sumuri manage its expansion, but unpredictable tariffs and budgets are now a bigger danger, said Jason Roslewicz, Sumuri’s vice president of business development. He’s had to devote two employees to monitoring supply lines, tariff news and competitor pricing to stay afloat.
“We went from putting things together in a basement to a 19,000-square-foot facility, doing exactly what we’re supposed to do here in the U.S., and it’s all in danger of coming apart because of this problem,” Roslewicz said.
Other small manufacturers express similar concerns. TJ Semanchin, who owns Wonderstate Coffee in Madison, Wisconsin, said his business roasting and distributing coffee is in crisis because of the tariffs.
Wonderstate’s costs have almost doubled between tariffs on imported coffee and packaging materials from China, plus a cyclical rise in coffee prices. “I’m borrowing money to pay for this and at some point we’ll have to raise prices. We’ll have no choice,” Semanchin said.

But many Republican state officials, and even some Democrats, have backed Trump’s tariff push, including Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who credited the Trump administration with “reshoring manufacturing and restoring this middle class which has been eviscerated over the last 20 years.”
“There’s dislocation in the short term, there’s long-term opportunity,” Youngkin said in an April 15 interview on CNBC. He said his state is hearing more interest from manufacturers looking to build or expand local factories since Trump took office. For instance, Delta Star recently announced a plan to add 300 jobs building power transformers in Lynchburg.
“The president has been clear that there will be some level of tariffs, and folks are coming, and that’s good for Virginia,” Youngkin said in the CNBC interview.
Virginia’s MEP program, called Genedge, claims successes in streamlining production and quality control for local factory products including TreeDiaper, an automated tree watering device made in Ashland, and for advising EDM, a Lynchburg plastic product assembler that needed more efficient production to keep overseas competition at bay. But Virginia’s MEP is one of the state programs slated to expire in the next year.
Long-term trend
The slide in U.S. manufacturing jobs has continued on and off since 1979, and many experts say tariffs will not bring them back. Despite a modest bounce back under the Biden administration, the number of manufacturing jobs has declined from nearly 20 million in 1979 to less than 13 million today, even as the total U.S. workforce has grown from 89 million to 159 million during that period.
Manufacturing already has made a comeback

Manufacturing faces labor shortages, with many factories operating below capacity because they can’t find enough workers, according to Jason Miller, a professor of supply chain management at Michigan State University.
That doesn’t bode well for a mass reshoring of factories from China and other countries, but Miller doesn’t expect that to happen anyway.
“Firms are not planning on reshoring much of the work that was offshored 20 to 25 years ago,” Miller said. “I’m not concerned about having enough workers for manufacturing jobs that would be reshored because this isn’t going to happen.”
In a 2024 survey by the libertarian Cato Institute, 80% of Americans said America would be better off if more people worked in manufacturing, but only 25% said they personally would be better off working in a factory. The Chinese government has poked fun at the idea with memes of American workers struggling to make Nike sneakers with sewing machines.
Joseph McCartin, a labor historian at Georgetown University, said the idea of a manufacturing rebirth is a “mirage being conjured to attract the support of workers who have been underpaid in an increasingly unequal economy for the last 40 years, and are desperate for some hope of renewed upward mobility.”
Manufacturing “isn’t the magic wand to make that happen,” McCartin said.
“What we need is to raise workers’ wages and make the economy less prone to producing inequality,” McCartin said. “That mission is not at all what Trump is about. He is dealing in stale nostalgia.”

LINCOLN — An assessment of restoring the historic Mayhew Cabin and John Brown’s Cave site in Nebraska City estimates it would cost in excess of $20 million to make it a viable attraction again.
Most of the cost, the report indicated, would be demolishing several of the seven existing structures on the site, which have been damaged by flooding and neglect.
Building a new museum to interpret the cabin, a site used by escaping slaves on the Underground Railroad during the Civil War, would cost $3 million alone, according to the assessment by the architectural firm, Clark & Enerson.
Back to Square One?
Cathleen Van Winkle, the president of the foundation that owns the Mayhew Cabin complex, said she was not surprised by the expensive repair estimate, given the extensive damage caused by flooding in 2019 and 2013.
Van Winkle, in an email on Friday, said that the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission, which paid for the assessment, has told the Foundation that there is “little likelihood” that the Nebraska Legislature will appropriate money to rebuild the museum due to state budget shortfalls.
Still, she said, she’s hopeful something might be done during the current legislative session.

“If funding fails, the Foundation will have no choice but to go back to square one to begin looking for other partners and alternative plans to save the cabin and its rich history,” Van Winkle said.
Another member of the Foundation board, Robert Nelson, an Underground Railroad historian and former columnist with the Omaha World-Herald, said he’s hopeful the cabin can be saved and become part of a historic byway being developed along the “Lane Trail.” That is a Civil War-era pathway from Iowa to Kansas used by escaping slaves as well as Abolitionists — including John Brown — seeking to join the fight against pro-slavery forces in Kansas.
“We’ll do anything to save the (Mayhew) cabin,” Nelson said in an interview. “We’d love it to be as close as possible to this trail.”
Unsuccessful lawsuit
The Mayhew Cabin, which is listed on the National Park Service Underground Railroad Network to Freedom, has been closed since the 2019 flooding. The flooding prompted the Mayhew Foundation to sue unsuccessfully the City of Nebraska City, claiming it was negligent for allowing runoff from the nearby ravine to damage the site and its structures.
Other calamities have damaged the site, including a 2013 flood, a large tree that fell atop a church on the property, and a series of sewage backups at a museum structure, which has a sinking foundation. The museum also has seen two break-ins in recent years.

– Cathleen Van Winkle, president of the foundation that owns the Mayhew Cabin complex


The recent study indicated that the underground tunnel — a “cave” that a Mayhew family member has said was used to store potatoes, not by escaping slaves — was deemed unstable and in need of replacement.
Replacement was also recommended for the museum, which the engineers estimated would cost $100,000 to demolish and $3 million for a new museum.
Also recommended to be demolished and replaced were a railroad depot, a church and a picnic shelter on the property, which are all owned by the Foundation.
Due to a lack of funds, the Foundation has been unable to make any repairs since the site was closed in 2019. In 2023, the Foundation signed a letter of intent to donate the site to the Game and Parks Commission, which led to the site assessment.
Fans have other ideas
Some fans of the Mayhew Cabin site have other ideas. That includes a Peru State professor, Sara Crook, who does historical portrayals of the older sister of John Kagi, an abolitionist who brought escaped slaves to the cabin and was a friend of John Brown.
Crook, who is on the state Hall of Fame Commission, said that in her opinion, only the Mayhew Cabin needs to be saved and preserved, which would reduce the cost of restoring the site substantially.
In an email to the Examiner, Jim Swenson, the assistant director of the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission, said that after meeting with the Mayhew Foundation board this week “there may be revisions in scope to reduce the cost.”
Crook also said that the Nebraska State Historical Society would be a more appropriate agency to lead the restoration, rather than the Game and Parks Commission.
Whether the cabin should remain where it is, in a flood-prone location, or moved elsewhere in Nebraska City or Lincoln or another community, is another question.
The site assessment recommended that the cabin — which was moved from its original site due to the widening of an adjacent highway — be relocated onto a more stable foundation.



Spotlight shifts to Mayhews, John Kagi
John Brown’s Cave has served as a tourist attraction since the 1930s. But over the years, the focus of the site has shifted from the cave and any connection to the famed abolitionist John Brown, to the role of the Mayhew family and of one of its relatives, John Kagi.
Kagi, who lived several months at the Mayhew Cabin, helped slaves escape northward from nearby slave states, like Missouri, to reach freedom. He was second in command to Brown during the failed raid on Harper’s Ferry, West Virginia, on Oct. 17, 1859. Kagi was killed during the raid.
Four years earlier, Kagi had lived with his sister Barbara Mayhew and her husband, Allen, at a Mayhew Cabin.
A 2002 article for the Nebraska State Historical Society’s magazine stated that Kagi had once brought 14 escaped slaves to the Nebraska City cabin, who, after eating breakfast, continued on foot northward.
A letter from Edward Mayhew, Barbara and Allen’s son, refuted earlier newspaper accounts that Brown himself had guided escaped slaves to freedom through a tunnel underneath the Mayhew cabin. The son said the cave was dug for storing potatoes, that slaves never used it and that John Brown never visited it.
The cabin was moved to its current location in 1937 to accommodate the construction of Highway 2, which has since been relocated to the south edge of Nebraska City. The tunnel beneath the cabin was dug in hopes of attracting tourists, according to a 2014 article evaluating sites on the Underground Railroad.

More than 1.7 million Michiganders live with a mental illness, yet fewer than two-thirds are getting treatment. The result is felt across emergency rooms, homeless shelters, courtrooms, and schools—places never designed to provide long-term care but now functioning as last resort.
Behind this growing crisis is a system struggling to meet the demand. Providers are overwhelmed. Psychologists, social workers, case managers, and peer specialists are stretched thin and forced to focus on administrative paperwork rather than patient care. Michiganders in all 83 counties are trying to get the care they need in their communities.
Michigan’s behavioral health system is built on a structure it can no longer support. It is fragmented, hard to navigate, and often unfair to the organizations trying to keep it together.
As the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) considers rebidding its behavioral health contracts, the state has a rare opportunity to rebuild a system that is more responsive, accountable, and equitable for everyone.
When people get into the community mental health system, they succeed.
Michigan’s community-based behavioral health system was created to keep people out of institutions and help them thrive in their communities. And when it works, it works well.
But getting into the system—and staying connected to care—isn’t easy.
One of the biggest hurdles is how services are managed and paid for. Michigan’s system is built around 10 regional Prepaid Inpatient Health Plans (PIHPs), which manage Medicaid behavioral health funding. In some regions, those PIHPs are also Community Mental Health Service Programs (CMHSPs), the entities that provide or contract services in the community. Services they can’t offer are given to community-based service providers.
The result is a model in which a single organization often acts as both the funder and the provider of care. This creates deep conflicts of interest, with serious consequences.
When your funder is your competitor, the playing field isn’t level.
Many safety net providers across the state, including those providing mental health services and substance use disorder (SUD) services, are nonprofits and are disadvantaged by the current system of care when their funder is also their competitor. There needs to be a way to create fair competition.
Under the current system, these safety net providers face lower reimbursement rates, lose staff to higher-paying public entities, and often compete for funding from the agencies delivering services themselves.
There’s also the issue of fairness. When the same entity sets the rules, delivers care, and controls the money, there’s little incentive for transparency—or accountability. Rate structures may favor internal programs. Disputes can go unresolved. And smaller, independent providers often operate without the same access to data or decision-making power.
This imbalance doesn’t just hurt organizations—it directly affects access to care. Gaps in funding and staffing mean more waitlists, fewer options, and higher barriers for people trying to get help. In a crisis, those delays can mean the difference between recovery and relapse, between housing and homelessness, or between safety and incarceration.
Administrative barriers drain time and resources.
 Despite shared goals to improve outcomes and ensure transparency, the current model often leads to fragmentation and inefficiencies. Each PIHP can impose its compliance systems, audits, and data reporting protocols. For organizations working across regions, this leads to duplication of effort and a mounting administrative load that does little to improve care quality.
Even within the same state contract framework, the interpretation and application of rules vary widely. Providers suggest aligning administrative requirements with the state’s master contract and streamlining oversight functions could significantly reduce the burden and help stabilize an already stretched workforce.
There is a path forward.
Michigan’s 2026 budget includes funding to expand Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics (CCBHCs), higher Medicaid reimbursement rates, and workforce development. But without structural reform, those investments will fall short.
CCBHCs offer a promising model—comprehensive, no-wrong-door care that meets people where they are. However, to fulfill their promise, Michigan must ensure these clinics are accessible to experienced nonprofit providers and protected from the same funding conflicts already plaguing the system.
What’s needed now is clarity and separation of roles. Funders should not be service providers. Oversight should be independent. Every provider—regardless of affiliation—should have a fair shot at delivering care and competing for talent and services.
Why it matters.
Behavioral health reform isn’t just about systems—it’s about outcomes. When people don’t get the care they need, communities absorb the cost. Hospitals fill up. Jails become de facto treatment centers. Families lose hope. And too many Michiganders end up unhoused, unemployed, or worse.
But when the system works—when it’s fair, transparent, and community-based—it saves lives, keeps people out of crisis, and supports recovery, stability, and dignity.
The opportunity before Michigan is not just about fixing what’s broken. It’s about building a system that works for the future—one where every person, regardless of diagnosis or zip code, can access the behavioral health care they need to live a full life.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/behavioral-therapy-mental-health-GettyImages-1140393669-1-1024x682.jpeg,,,2025-04-21 06:04:19.793035

A larger-than-expected crowd went to the Ohio capitol on Saturday to protest President Donald Trump and the many controversial actions of his young administration. It was one of at least 47 across Ohio and more than 700 across the United States.
Columbus police said that the crowd appeared to approach 3,000. That was smaller than the roughly 5,000 who turned out on April 5, when millions protested nationwide. But with the Easter holiday and fewer sponsoring organizations, smaller crowds were expected on Saturday.
Large crowds also gathered in Cincinnati, rainy Akron, and other cities across the Buckeye State. They were sponsored by the group 50501.

Organizers chose April 19 to protest in part for its symbolic value. On that day in 1775, the first battles of the Revolutionary War were fought in Lexington and Concord, Mass.
Playing off of that theme, many carried signs Saturday denouncing Trump and accusing him of trying to be a king. 
Trump has been raising such concerns in several ways. They include by trying to gut the independent federal antitrust watchdog, and by empowering the world’s richest man to fire tens of thousands from the Social Security and Veterans administrations, the National Park Service, and numerous other agencies.
But perhaps more concerning is that his administration has been invoking a law not used in 80 years, accusing some migrants of membership in gangs, and deporting them to a notorious Salvadorean prison. He has defied court orders — including one to bring back a man whom the administration admitted was deported in error.
The U.S. Supreme Court early Saturday morning ordered a temporary halt to the deportations. So the stage seems to be setting for a confrontation between the judiciary — which has no army to enforce its orders — and an executive who sometimes has been disinclined to heed them.
That was on the minds of many at the Columbus protest. Chuck Ardo of Lancaster said that his family migrated to the United States from Slovakia when he was a child, and that his parents survived the Holocaust.
“Fascism is something I’ve always been aware of,” he said. “Due process and the Constitution, that’s what matters. I don’t know if these people are deportable or not. But they all deserve due process and that’s what’s missing here. They’ve labeled them ‘terrorists,’ but on what grounds? What proof have they shown?”
Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., last week visited the wrongly deported man, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, at the Salvadorean prison. He said that if Trump has evidence that Abrego Garcia is in a gang, he needs to present it court — not just claim it on social media.
For Ardo, Trump’s actions have a disturbing historical echo.
“Donald Trump is doing many of the things Hitler did as he rose to power,” he said. “Hitler attacked the courts. He attacked the universities. I’m not accusing anybody of being a Nazi here, but while history doesn’t repeat itself, it rhymes.”
Debbie Wood of Powell said the president has been acting like a king in other ways as well.
“Trump did not win in a landslide,” she said. “More people voted for someone else than for him. He does not have a mandate. Even the people who voted for him did not vote to ruin the VA. They didn’t vote to fire people who do cancer research. They didn’t vote to take food out of the mouths of hungry people. Ruining the national parks. Nobody voted for any of that stuff.”
She added, “People are getting more and more angry. He’s sending people away to concentration camps without due process. Ignoring court orders. Who does that? We would be in jail.”

Gary Bennett of St. Clairsville stood at the base of a monument to former President William McKinley holding a sign that mocked Trump and slammed him for gutting the staff at the National Park Service. He said that’s just one problem among many he has with the new administration.
“We could make signs every day of the week and there would still be signs to make,” he said. “Me and my wife just retired, and we don’t want him to take away our Social Security. That’s just one thing.”
Chris Glass of Delaware said she’s also upset about many things Trump is doing, and that protesting helps.
“There is something very nice about the camaraderie,” she said. “It’s a sense that people do care. I think we represent the country better than our current government does.”",https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/20250419_124710-1024x626.jpg,,,2025-04-21 06:04:19.793035

Getty Images.A recent report from an Ohio-based health institute emphasizes the importance of prevention and testing after decades of study and treatment on HIV, calling it a “pressing public health concern in the United States” as the Trump administration proposes eliminating research and programs on the disease.
According to the Equitas Health Institute’s study on HIV research, the pressing public health concern is being faced by young adults the most, with the age group ranging from the early teens to early 30s accounting for 58% of the estimated 32,100 new HIV diagnoses in 2021.
The importance of sex education and awareness of HIV status is always important, researchers said, but in the current political climate, “HIV is often caught in the crossfire of health care debates and shifting policies.”
“Access to funding resources, education and prevention programs is inconsistent and, in many areas, highly inadequate,” the study found. “Navigating sexual health is about building resilience and showing young adults that they are not defined by a diagnosis, the politics surrounding sexual health, or the uncertainty of living with HIV.”
The study comes as the Trump Administration sets its sights on HIV research as part of vast funding cuts within the federal government. Funding is already gone for HIV-related research grants within the National Institutes of Health, including research at U.S. universities and international efforts.
Of the terminated grants, two went to the Ohio State University for studies on “the influence of developmental assets on intersectional stigma and HIV prevention in Black (men who have sex with men)” and a study on “client and clinician priorities” regarding two HIV prevention medications.
Cuts to research and funding
But more chops may be coming as the Trump administration plans to restructure the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services could include elimination of federal HIV prevention and research programs. Those cuts could include the “Ending the HIV Epidemic: A Plan for America” initiative, a government move that aimed to reduce new HIV infections by 90% by 2030.
The initiative was started under the previous Trump administration, but the CDC web page on the initiative now mentions a court order requiring the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to restore the website as of Feb. 14. Text at the top of the page then claims any information on the page “promoting gender ideology is extremely inaccurate and disconnected from the immutable biological reality that there are two sexes, male and female.”
“The Trump Administration rejects gender ideology and condemns the harms it causes to children,” the page now states, adding that it “does not reflect biological reality and therefore the Administration and this department rejects it.”
HIV is a disease that attacks the immune system by going after white blood cells, which can develop into the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome, or AIDS. Symptoms don’t always present with HIV, so testing is necessary to identify it, according to Equitas Health.
AIDS wasn’t formally identified in the U.S. until the 1980s, and even then, researchers said governmental response was “minimal,” and then-President Ronald Reagan wouldn’t use the term until 1985.
Community response came in the form of a grassroots effort called ACT UP in 1987, and in 1990, the Ryan White HIV/AIDS program was established for low-income individuals living with HIV, an organization that exists to this day, currently housed under the U.S. Health Resources & Services Administration. The Ohio Department of Health still houses a Ryan White Part B Program for HIV-related services, funded through federal grants, according to the state.
The first treatment method for AIDS was approved in 1996, and cases of the disease began decreasing after the first antiretroviral therapy was released, addressing a disease that was then the leading cause of death for all American adults ages 25-44.
Though the HIV/AIDS epidemic was connected to gay men from the moment it was officially identified, data from the early 1990s showed the disease was present in other groups, including members of various genders, sexualities, races, socio-economic levels and health statuses, according to Equitas Health.
Prevention efforts were started at the local and state public health level, as well as in partnerships between the CDC and national minority organizations.
Testing is an “essential component of HIV prevention, treatment and care,” according to the report, and a lack of awareness about the illness “contributes to the spread of HIV, as individuals who are unaware of their infection statues are more likely to engage in behaviors that can transmit the virus to others.”
“Barriers to testing include stigma, lack of awareness and limited access to testing services,” the report stated. “Stigma may occur within the patient, their community or health care providers.”
Ohio law effective since 2012 requires the Ohio Department of Health to develop and administer AIDS and HIV-related programs, including a system to determine the number of cases, development of counseling and testing programs, risk reduction/education programs to at-risk groups and pilot programs for long-term care.
A treatment now exists to prevent HIV transmission, and the FDA approved the first HIV home-testing kit in 2012, with the CDC funding nearly 2 million tests per year, according to 2021 data.
“Despite medications improving lives and reducing transmission, there is still no cure for the disease,” researchers at Equitas Health stated. “There are two objectives in HIV research: sustained viral suppression without medication and total eradication of the virus.”
Even with improved treatment and testing, HIV rates began to increase during the 2010s, researchers stated, pointing to young adults as a disproportionately affected group.
Sex education
A lack of required sex education also has impacts, according to the report. Sex education in Ohio has been seen as lacking in many ways, with advocates for sex education increasing the push for requirements after Roe v. Wade, the U.S. Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion in the 1970s was overturned, and the discussion of reproductive rights and sexual health was put to individual states.
Ohio law regarding education curricula including sex education has been changed numerous times over the years, with the most recent change enacted in October 2024. That change came via the Republican-led Senate Bill 168, which, among other education-related changes, amended references in Ohio law from “venereal disease” education to “sexually transmitted infection” education.
A bill passed last year was harshly criticized for forcing school districts to notify parents if a child identifies as LGBTQ+ and allowing parents to opt out of “sexuality content.” During the committee process in the Senate, however, an amendment was added to the bill to specify that content the bill deemed objectionable was not targeting STI education.
While STI education is in Ohio law, advocates for more sexual education say abstinence-focused instruction and the other provisions currently in law aren’t enough.
The non-profit Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States said Ohio’s sex education curriculum”is not required to be comprehensive, medically accurate or include instruction on topics such as consent, sexual orientation or gender identity, or contraceptive options.”
“This leaves local school districts to decide what sex education curriculum they provide,” the group stated.
The research from Equitas Health recognized the resilience of young adults, despite being a population that is understudied among HIV study.
“Young adults with marginalized identities require diverse and targeted approaches within HIV care,” the report concluded. “However, adults within sexual, gender and racial minority groups are often excluded from HIV discourse. The unique needs of young adults must be considered.”

(Photo courtesy of Maria Wilkinson)In 2015, just four months after graduating from Concord High, I arrived in California to begin a year of service to my country. Not through the military or college, but through AmeriCorps National Civilian Community Corps (NCCC) — a program that would change my life in ways I never expected.
On our first day, we were told: “You’re not here to help others — you’re here for yourselves.” At first, that felt selfish. But over the next 10 months, I came to understand what that meant. Yes, we were serving others — but through that service, we were also learning, growing, and transforming ourselves.
I was assigned to the West Coast campus and placed on a team with 11 other young people from all across the country. We lived together, cooked together, worked out together — and most importantly, we served together.
In Montana, we helped build homes with Habitat for Humanity. In California, we spent months clearing brush to reduce wildfire risk. In Utah, we served as camp counselors for individuals with disabilities. On weekends, we volunteered in local communities — cooking Sunday breakfasts at churches, planting trees to prevent erosion, cleaning up community gardens.
We lived on less than $200 a month. We didn’t join AmeriCorps for the money — we joined because we wanted to be part of something bigger than ourselves. I wasn’t ready for college right out of high school. I needed to see more of the world first. AmeriCorps NCCC gave me that chance.
This program taught me what it really means to serve my country — not just through military service or government jobs, but through compassion, manual labor, teamwork, and meeting people where they are.
That’s why it’s devastating to see AmeriCorps NCCC being defunded and dismantled. Doing so doesn’t just take away a year of service — it takes away a path of purpose, growth, and opportunity for thousands of young Americans.
Cutting AmeriCorps NCCC isn’t a budgetary win. It’s a national loss.
To the young people who won’t be able to finish their year of service, and to those who will never get the chance to start: I’m sorry. You deserve this opportunity. And our country needs programs like this more than ever.

A Republican Ohio Senator wants higher education appropriations to be tied to compliance to Senate Bill 1, the new higher education law banning diversity efforts and regulating classroom discussion that will take effect this summer. 
“We’re not kidding around,” State Sen. Jerry Cirino, R-Kirtland, said Thursday during a City Club of Cleveland forum. “This law will not be ignored. It will be welcomed. … We’re going to make sure that all the work we’ve done doesn’t go to waste because it’s being ignored. We’re going to make sure it happens and nothing speaks like money.”

The new law will ban diversity efforts, prohibit faculty strikes, regulate classroom discussion of “controversial” topics, create post-tenure reviews, put diversity scholarships at risk, create a retrenchment provision that block unions from negotiating on tenure, shorten university board of trustees terms from nine years down to six years, and require students take an American history course, among other things.  
Cirino introduced S.B. 1 earlier this year which quickly passed the Ohio Senate and House. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine signed S.B. 1 into law at the end of March and it will take effect on June 27. Members of the Youngstown State University’s chapter of the Ohio Education Association are collecting signatures in the hopes of trying to get a referendum on the Nov. 4 ballot. 
“Opponents of Senate Bill 1 have said it will destroy higher education in Ohio,” Cirino said. “Well, the governor signed the bill a couple of weeks ago, and to my knowledge, higher education is still pretty well intact in the state of Ohio.” 
More than 1,500 people testified against S.B. 1 — including many college students, faculty and staff who said they would leave Ohio if this bill became law. 
“Certainly for some of them that would be OK,” Cirino said. “Some of the ones who came to testify, I will help them pack.” 
The Ohio Capital Journal recently talked to a Cleveland State University student who is transferring to a New York university after spring semester because of the new law. 
Cirino talked about the need for a higher education law like this given “the predominance of left-leaning faculty, which has skewed things on our campuses.”
“Without the very best educational system, we will not have a properly trained workforce, and without a trained workforce, we will not have a robust economy here in Ohio,” Cirino said. “If our universities and community colleges are fixated on DEI, separating students by race and hiring professors who follow a monolithic liberal agenda, we are not preparing our students to learn how to analyze research and come to their own conclusions.”
Cirino said the new law creates more opportunities for speech, reiterated that it’s not anti-union and makes education available to everyone. 
“Some of our universities have been spending tens of millions of dollars on infrastructure for DEI which has become institutional discrimination,” he said. “You can’t solve discrimination by having other discrimination. The best way to eliminate discrimination is to eliminate discrimination.”
The new law also bans faculty strikes, something Cirino said is a student rights issue, not a labor issue. 
“When a student signs up for a semester and pays for it, that’s a contract between them and the university,” he said. “Nothing should interrupt that. Nothing at all.”
Even though the law only applies to Ohio’s public universities and community colleges, private colleges would be required to comply with parts of S.B.1 if they want to continue to participate in the Governor’s Merit Scholarship, according to language from the House’s version of the budget. The budget is now in the hands of the Senate where Cirino is the chair of the Senate Finance Committee.

States worry that an executive order and federal funding cuts could weaken their cybersecurity efforts. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)For the first half of his career in law enforcement, working as a police officer in South Florida, Chase Fopiano did not think cyberattacks on police agencies were a serious threat.
Many of his law enforcement colleagues were under the same impression — that since they were the most likely to investigate the attacks, there was no way cybercriminals would go after them.
By about 2015, as technology advanced and hackers became more creative, that changed, Fopiano said. Now, from the U.S. Secret Service to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, there are thousands of attempts to compromise networks or organizations every day, he said.
“A lot of those [attempts] are toward government or even police, especially because they know that we’re not as prepared as we should be,” said Fopiano, who now oversees cybersecurity as part of a regional task force.
Spanning health care facilities to court systems, states and local communities are facing a rise in cyberthreats. They include threats to critical infrastructure, increased activity from foreign actors, continued ransomware attacks, and more, according to a recent report from the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center.
But President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order shifting some of the responsibility from the federal government to states and localities to improve their infrastructure to address risks, including cybercrimes. And federal cuts have reduced resources for state and local officials, including a cybersecurity grant program and a key cybersecurity agency.
States and localities are taking steps to address the problems, such as establishing new penalties for tampering with critical infrastructure, centralizing state IT personnel, and setting standards in areas from elections to health care.
But the Trump order and federal funding cuts, a shortage of IT experts at the local level and an overall lack of preparedness could weaken their efforts.
In December, a major cyberattack forced Rhode Island to take down its online portal used by residents to obtain Medicaid benefits and SNAP, commonly known as food stamps. The personal data stolen from Rhode Island’s public benefits network — including Social Security numbers and banking information — was later found on the dark web.
In February, a “sophisticated cyberattack” hit the office of Virginia Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares, which led agency officials to shut down computer systems and resort to paper court filings.
Last week, hackers also breached the computer network of the Fall River School District in Massachusetts. The school district is working with third-party experts and law enforcement to determine if anyone’s personal information was targeted, according to MassLive.
In 2023, of the 48 states that participated in the Nationwide Cybersecurity Review, a voluntary self-assessment conducted by federal agencies that examines how well governments are prepared to respond to cyberattacks, only 22 states reached or surpassed the recommended levels of security in their systems.
Cybersecurity has become increasingly important over time because more government services and data are digitized, said Samir Jain, the vice president of policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology, a nonprofit that advocates for digital rights and freedom of expression.
But a national shortage of people with that expertise — especially at the local level — creates a challenge.
“The federal government has traditionally played at least some role in trying to fill some of those gaps,” Jain said. “And so the notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.”
Local governments and law enforcement agencies also have other priorities, Fopiano said. The police need cars, guns, shields and other resources that generally take precedence over cybersecurity.
Today, Fopiano is the cybersecurity chair of the Southeast Regional Domestic Security Task Force in Florida, overseeing cyber activity from South Florida to the Florida Keys. The attacks continue to rise, he said.
“Terrorist groups are getting into cybercrime, cartels are getting into cybercrime, you have kids just learning about hacking and just fooling around,” he said. “The audience of who’s doing it has definitely expanded and led to that rise in overall cybercrime.”
Cuts to federal resources
In 2022, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced a first-of-its-kind cybersecurity grant program, providing more than $1 billion in funding for states, localities, tribes, and territories to address cybersecurity risks and threats.
The State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program, created under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, awarded $279 million to states and localities in fiscal year 2024. The Tribal Cybersecurity Grant Program awarded another $18 million for tribes in its first year.
But the grant program is set to expire in September, with no current plans to renew it. At a hearing this month, several state and local officials urged Congress to reauthorize the program. But U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who refused the federal aid during her tenure as governor of South Dakota, questioned the program’s efficacy.
The Trump administration is also cutting as many as 1,300 employees from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, which administers the grants alongside the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
The program has allowed states to assess the security of their networks, develop cybersecurity training, implement multi-factor authentication features — which requires users to provide more than one form of verification to access a site or service — and much more, said Alex Whitaker, the director of government affairs at the National Association of State Chief Information Officers.
“This has been a really great program because we’re seeing a lot of great evidence for how states and their counterparts in local government are improving their cyber defenses,” Whitaker said.
Counties also rely on a number of federal resources to strengthen their defenses, including services provided by CISA, said Rita Reynolds, the chief information officer at the National Association of Counties and managing director for County Tech Xchange. NACo is an organization that represents county governments across the United States.
The Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center, for instance — a key collaboration between CISA and the Center for Internet Security to help state and local governments with cybersecurity operations — lost some of its federal funding for certain programs last month, Reynolds said.
In trying to keep up with emerging threats, counties are still trying to find resources to help them implement multi-factor authentication, convert government pages to “.gov” domains and other methods of protecting their infrastructure, she said.
“Are counties prepared?” Reynolds asked. “I would say they’re not as prepared as they’d like to be. And in some cases, they are looking at how to strategically approach this now that resources are disappearing.”
In a statement, CISA spokesperson Jared Auchey said Trump’s executive order empowers state and local governments “to make risk-informed decisions and investments to improve their preparedness.” The agency will work with state and local officials to ensure they have the information and support they need, Auchey added.
Lawmakers step up
In 2024, 33 states adopted resolutions or enacted legislation regarding cybersecurity, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan public officials’ association.
Many of those measures sought to protect states’ critical infrastructure, including water systems, government services, health care, and more. Florida, Louisiana, West Virginia, and other states created new criminal and civil penalties for people who attempt to tamper with critical infrastructure.
In Minnesota and Washington state, lawmakers passed measures allowing or requiring state and local governments to invest in cybersecurity protections related to election administration. Connecticut and Florida also passed legislation to secure health care facilities from cyberattacks by having hospitals create plans or by supporting investments in new technologies.
Other states are looking for solutions from outside vendors. South Dakota has set aside $7 million for a company to examine local governments for vulnerabilities to hackers.
With attacks occurring at every level of government, New Mexico Democratic state Sen. Michael Padilla, the Senate majority whip, sponsored legislation in 2023 to create the state’s office of cybersecurity. As chair of the Senate Science, Technology, and Telecommunications Committee for 10 years, he plays a significant role in most of the state’s cybersecurity legislation.
Through the committee’s work, Padilla says New Mexico is in good shape to fend off cyberattacks — and the state’s cities and counties are joining in.
“I think New Mexico is in a very good position because what we decided to do by creating that office is to ensure that any transactions that occur with state government here [in New Mexico] have to meet a minimum set of security standards,” he said.
In Indiana, Republican state Sen. Liz Brown filed legislation that would encourage state agencies and groups to develop cybersecurity policies. The bill was approved by both chambers, with the Senate agreeing to changes sent from the House.
“You have to protect your infrastructure,” Brown said. “We don’t want utility systems to be shut down. We don’t want wastewater or freshwater treatment plants or even the water supply being contaminated or harmed in some way. Our systems all have backups, but even so, we know there are bad actors.”
Some states are also preparing to reshuffle their offices or create new ones to centralize their cybersecurity efforts. Arkansas, for example, enacted legislation this month to create a new state cybersecurity office, which will monitor the state’s computer networks and respond to cyberthreats.
In Alabama, rather than having information technology people scattered throughout the government, Republican state Rep. Mike Shaw wants cybersecurity personnel centrally managed.
Shaw’s legislation, which passed the House and is currently in the Senate, would give the Alabama Office of Information Technology central authority to maintain the needs of all of the state’s departments.
The centralization would make it easier to pursue cybersecurity initiatives in the future, Shaw said.
“The federal government is really big, and it’s really hard to come up with a one-size-fits-all solution for things like cybersecurity, data privacy and technology in general,” Shaw said. “So, in some sense, it’s good that the states are coming up with their own.”

Ron Estes (second from right) poses with other U.S. representatives during a trip to El Salvador last week. (U.S. Embassy in El Salvador)We do not elect kings in Kansas or the United States.
We do not dole out justice through lynch mobs or popularity contests either.
Yet there U.S. Rep. Ron Estes stood in a picture from the U.S. embassy in El Salvador, lending tacit approval to a mob that has all but condemned Maryland father Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia to death, at the behest of a would-be tyrant in Washington, D.C.
The facts of the case are simple and damning. Garcia was sent to a gulag without due proxies of law, and President Donald Trump’s administration has defied a 9-0 Supreme Court order in keeping him there. The White House has attempted to smear the man in absentia, with all the crudeness of those who used to accuse Black boys of taking liberties with white women.
This, apparently, is fine and dandy with Estes.

On Tuesday, Republican Reps. Jason Smith of Missouri and Riley Moore of West Virginia posed proudly in pictures from CECOT — the notorious El Salvadoran mega-prison where the United States has shipped hundreds without due process. Estes did not post such pictures. However, the 4th District congressman stood in a lineup with Smith and Moore in an image posted Wednesday by the embassy, along with Reps. Kevin Hern of Oklahoma, Mike Kennedy of Utah, Carol Miller of West Virginia and Claudia Tenney of New York.
Credit must go at this point to independent journalist and Kansas Reflector friend Marisa Kabas, who first reported about the Republicans’ visit. She reached out to the lawmakers for comment, hearing back only from Hearn’s office: “We cannot confirm or comment on the Congressman’s location for security purposes.” Tenney subsequently tweeted that she had also toured CECOT.
I reached out via email to Estes spokesman Roman Rodriguez to ask whether the representative had gone to the prison or was concerned about Garcia’s welfare. He did not respond.

Prison pipeline
We cannot close our eyes to the brutal reality of CECOT or El Salvador’s government.
According to Ana Piquer, Americas director at Amnesty International: “El Salvador is implementing a systematic state policy of massive and arbitrary deprivation of liberty. After three years, more than 85,000 individuals remain behind bars without sufficient admissible evidence, the victims of a judicial system now transformed into a tool for collective punishment and widespread repression. Attempts to export this policy to the situation of Venezuelan migrants and refugees in the United States highlights the lack of protection and the risk that hundreds of thousands of people now face of having their human rights violated by not one, not two, but three different states.”
You can’t confuse this gulag with any kind of American facility. In our country, attorneys and law enforcement must still abide by the law. Not in El Salvador. Conditions there go beyond mere cruelty.
Officials have decided to create a concentration camp, one in which prisoners are denied due process and tortured.
In the words of Human Rights Watch: “People held in CECOT, as well as in other prisons in El Salvador, are denied communication with their relatives and lawyers, and only appear before courts in online hearings, often in groups of several hundred detainees at the same time. The Salvadoran government has described people held in CECOT as ‘terrorists,’ and has said that they ‘will never leave.’ Human Rights Watch is not aware of any detainees who have been released from that prison.”
Juanita Goebertus Estrada, director of the Americas Division of Human Rights Watch, said that while the mega-prison was built more recently than other facilities in the country, he understands that conditions are similar to other prisons in the country.
“This includes cases of torture, ill-treatment, incommunicado detention, severe violations of due process and inhumane conditions, such as lack of access to adequate healthcare and food,” he said.
No one should go to such a facility. Not even the most notorious criminals, of any country or any citizenship status. No one.

(Photo via Van Hollen on X.)
Trump temper tantrum
Regardless of pushback from courts at every level, President Donald Trump has persisted in his quest to send immigrants out of this country and to the most brutal and dehumanizing conditions.
No matter their ideology or party, our elected officials must step up and speak out against such authoritarian violence. Estes, during his visit to El Salvador, had every opportunity to do so. He could have joined Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen in meeting with Garcia and urging his immediate release from detention. He could have spoken up for the rule of law and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as codified by the United Nations.
Instead, he posed for the picture and made no public comment. He lent his silent assent to a governmental lynching.
Garcia may have been a gang member. He may have beaten his wife. He may have leaked the COVID-19 virus from a lab and caused Francis Ford Coppola’s Megalopolis to bomb at the box office. Any or all of these stories may be true. But he has been convicted of none of them. If the Trump administration actually believes such accusations against Garcia, bring him back and criminally charge him.
Due process of law means due process for everyone, citizens and noncitizens alike. Respect for the rule of law means respecting all court decisions, even those with which you disagree. Without following these precepts, our democratic society crumbles. You support the ruthless mob, willing to hang a man on mere suspicion.
Estes might be OK with that. On his website, he touts support for a bill that would strip power from judges. The same figures tasked with defending the rights of everyone.
Perhaps he has decided to declare fealty to a king rather than support a mere president.

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)Nebraska’s 13 private colleges and universities might do well to keep an eye on Harvard University’s recent resounding “no” to the president who wants the feds to have a say in the school’s inner workings, including teaching and hiring. 
Harvard’s hard pass meant the federal government froze $2.2 billion earmarked for the nation’s most recognizable university, primarily for scientific and medical research including work in artificial intelligence, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s — areas in which Harvard is recognized as a leader. As of this writing, the president is also threatening to yank the school’s tax exempt status, something he can’t do unilaterally.
What the White House wants is essentially a measure of control at Harvard. It has dressed that demand as a worthy cause: the elimination of antisemitism on campus. In a letter to the Cambridge university, the government accused Harvard of not having the correct “intellectual and civil rights conditions” to allow further federal funds to make their way to the famed campus. 
The letter also demanded that the college name names by reporting to the feds students “who are ‘hostile’ to American values” and require — without explanation — academic departments to be something called “viewpoint diverse” and hire government-approved auditors to see if any programs, policies or departments “fuel antisemitic harassment.”
Harvard stands firm
Whew! And that was only part of the ultimatum. Finding the directives out of line with the mission of the university, Harvard stood firm. The university’s president said, “No government — regardless of which party is in power — should dictate what private universities can teach. … The University will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights.”
Most of Harvard’s massive endowment is earmarked for specific projects. Even so perhaps more than any other private school in the nation, it is financially equipped to meet the challenge of such defunding. Surely, a Creighton or a Midland or a Concordia would have to meet such pressure in another way.
Harvard is one of nearly 60 colleges and universities under scrutiny by the federal government for practices the government alleges might contribute to anti-semitism. Efforts to curb that distemper are smart and justified when and where they are needed. Indeed, some of the five dozen colleges and universities, including Harvard, have made changes toward protecting Jewish students who feel threatened on campus. 
While none of Nebraska’s private colleges and universities made the list, the University of Nebraska at Omaha was notified by the Trump administration last month that it was under investigation for “race exclusionary practices” having to do with the awarding of scholarships to graduate students. UNO had closed its DEI office in February. The University of Nebraska-Lincoln closed its DEI office in August 2024. Even so, a bill in the Nebraska Legislature to outlaw any office of diversity, equity and inclusion on any public college campus in the state hasn’t gained much traction to date.
Part of broader battle
The battle for the soul of post-secondary education, however, is old news. Many on the right see colleges as breeding grounds for what they see as the scourge of “woke” culture, a pedagogical petri dish growing an array of evil anagrams from DEI to CRT to ESG. Campus protests over Gaza since late 2023 have stoked these culture war fires. Two years earlier, eventual vice-president J.D. Vance famously said, “the universities are the enemy.”  
I spent four years as a member of the adjunct faculty and part of the academic support staff at Hastings College, a small private institution in south-central Nebraska. “HC” is a beautiful campus, not unlike a New England setting, nestled in a neighborhood just north and east of downtown Hastings. 
Hastings College is obviously not Harvard, nor is it a big public system such as the University of Nebraska. The task there, however, was similar: train young minds to think critically, research thoroughly and act decisively on the outcome of each. I’m also happy to say that I saw diversity, equity and inclusion — intentional and otherwise — fostered and celebrated. 
The mission of a college is a goal, not always the exact outcome. And individual college experiences don’t always live up to expectations. But when campuses are diverse, vibrant and vital places, when they challenge students and faculty to be the best versions of themselves, when they get it right, when the lights brighten, the research adds up and the solutions solve problems, the rest of the world is better for it … whether it’s Harvard University or Hastings College.

Photo submitted by Chattahoochee Riverkeeper. Photo submitted by Chattahoochee RiverkeeperRoutine water sampling conducted by the Chattahoochee Riverkeeper as part of a federal partnership revealed alarming levels of bacteria discharged into the river by Fulton County’s largest wastewater treatment plant in 2023.
The Georgia Environmental Protection Division issued several violations and a $300,000 fine against the city of Atlanta for maintenance problems causing numerous illegal discharges of pollution at the RM Clayton Water Reclamation Facility in northwest Atlanta.
Chattahoochee Riverkeeper’s Chris Manganiello considers the Fulton County pollution drama as a reason to sound the alarm over the now-uncertain future of the U.S. Geological Survey’s South Atlantic Water Science Center in Norcross.
The center’s lease recently appeared on the Elon Musk-led U.S. Department of Government Efficiency’s list for possible terminations by the end of 2025, but it’s still unclear what that means for the staff and the program’s mission.
The U.S. General Services Administration, which manages federal property, did not respond to the Recorder’s emailed questions about the terms of the lease and the fate of the staff.
Since the early 2000s, the Chattahoochee Riverkeeper and the federal agency have collaborated on the BacteriALERT program that provides live updates to the public of the amount of E. coli contamination in a river that is a source of drinking water for millions of Georgians.
“Eventually after working with Fulton County, they came to an agreement with us that their plant was not functioning,” Manganiello said. “This is a situation where we’re pretty sure that we wouldn’t have identified this problem without the help of collection from USGS sources.”
Environmentalists and Democratic congressional members are expressing concerns about the planned lease termination, which the DOGE website says will save the federal government more than $1.3 million.
The center is one of more than a dozen government offices in Georgia that could have its leases ended under the Trump administration’s cuts.
Riverkeeper members said that water gauges are essential for maintaining compliance with state and federal permits. The data collected by these gauges tracks flood levels and the National Weather Service contracts with the center to collect rainfall data.
Manganiello, the Riverkeeper water policy director, said that the closure of the Norcross office and potential layoffs could at a minimum disrupt water monitoring for several months, which could lead to a significant decline in water quality and compliance.
“It’s one thing if we all knew they’re going to close this office because they moved into another location, that would be okay,” he said. “But because we don’t know what’s going to happen if the lease is terminated and these people don’t have a place to physically work, that means there’s going to be a disruption in the maintenance of the physical equipment and to data collection and data processing.”
Chattahoochee Riverkeeper Jason Ulseth said the center operates water flow gauges essential for monitoring everything from bacteria to water flooding levels impacting water management in Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina.
“This science center is critical for many reasons, including the fact that they run all of the flow gauges for Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina,” Ulseth said. “These flow gauges tell us how much water is in any part of the river throughout the system and is essential to municipal water to decision makers, dam operators, (utility) power operators and fishermen.”
The government water monitoring benefits the Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area, which draws 3.5 million annual visitors.
The scientific water surveying covers a 48-mile stretch between the Buford Dam and Atlanta. The employees also track water levels, flooding and dam releases at the Buford Dam.
“They’re fishing, they’re tubing, they’re kayaking,” Ulseth said. “So the health of the river and the amount of pathogens that are in the river are very important to the people that are going there. With the bacteria alert program, we are able to actually predict the current levels of E. coli and give public health advisories in real time, which is a one-of-a-kind program in the entire country.”
Atlanta Democratic U.S. Sens. Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock expressed their concerns about potential layoffs in a letter to U.S. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum.
The relocation plans remain unclear despite the office lease set to terminate in a few months, the senators wrote Tuesday.
“Staff at the (center) perform water quality testing to ensure the safety of drinking water and maintain water gauges across Georgia, including Lake Sidney Lanier and on the Chattahoochee River, which supplies most of metro Atlanta’s drinking water,” Ossoff and Warnock wrote. “Local officials in metro Atlanta rely on gauges at Lake Lanier to ensure enough water is drawn from the lake to provide water to millions of Georgians every day. These gauges also inform water flows for Georgia’s agriculture industry, nuclear reactors across the state, and Department of Defense installations, among others.”
The potential ramifications of staff layoffs at the Norcross science center is also being watched closely by Suwannee Riverkeeper John Quarterman in south Georgia.
He said his organization relies on the data to predict the risk of flooding in areas like the Skipper Bridge on the Withlacoochee River north of Valdosta.
“It will be a problem for flood preparedness if (flood mapping) goes away, or if either of those gauges does,” Quarterman said.

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)The environment in Pierre today is “more strident” than it was when David Owen began lobbying South Dakota lawmakers in 1998. Much has changed since then, Owen said, but that’s been the biggest shift.
Owen said Pierre’s deeply divided political environment, particularly among Republicans, is one where policy debates turn personal. He describes it as “a cancer in the system.”
“We used to have battles, take the vote, then go on and see each other at dinner. Those days are gone,” Owen said.  
Owen, 70, is retiring. He’s been president of the South Dakota Chamber of Commerce and Industry for nearly three decades, representing the state’s business interests in and out of the Capitol building. Before that, he worked for various Midwest chambers, including in Kansas and Montana.
Owen’s favorite part of the job has always been explaining the policymaking process, whether to state lawmakers or a boardroom of business leaders. He’s known for his sharp wit and policy knowledge, and has earned a reputation for occasionally breaking from the pack, especially when compromise or principle demanded it.
Ahead of his August exit from professional life, Owen sat down with South Dakota Searchlight to reflect on the art of lobbying, shifts in the Legislature, and what he sees as both the promise and peril of South Dakota politics. 
The following conversation has been edited for length and clarity.
What made you interested in lobbying lawmakers?
I’ve always been interested in policy and politics. So I chose chambers that were involved in those kinds of issues. 
I was going to be a teacher. And what I like about what I’ve done is that I teach every day. 
I teach legislators the perspective of the chamber, which gets difficult at times. And I have to teach my board about the issues and pressures around us. Because my board’s full of really smart people, successful business people, who get frustrated with the ups and downs of politics. 
What is the biggest misconception about lobbying?
There’s this idea that the lobbyists always win.
We do have a tremendous advantage over citizens who come to the Legislature. It’s something I’m uneasy about. A bill has its hearing, and then they vote on the bill. That means a lot of citizens show up to say “Me too” and bring their concerns. They’ve got their piece of paper. They’ve never done this before. They’re really nervous. 
Meanwhile, the paid lobbyists, including the one you’re talking to, already have a pretty good idea what the vote’s going to be, because we’re there all day. We catch legislators in the hall. We don’t bribe anybody, but we’re familiar with them. 
South Dakota is increasingly becoming pay-to-play. They do fundraisers and we have a political action committee, but legislators are independent enough that we don’t have the kind of control over them that the public seems to think. Otherwise, nobody would lose.
This year, I was talking to some of the freshmen legislators who had never served before. 
I heard from like five of them, the same answer that was pretty different than in the past. I asked the question, “What prompted you to run?”
I heard more about concerns about “society” and how they thought they could help straighten out “the culture” by being in the Legislature. That’s a big task. That brings you to introducing things like school vouchers. That brings you to thinking the Ten Commandments in every classroom will help structure a moral code that will solve some of these social problems. 
And there are two influential lobbying groups up there, we’ve got more, but two groups in particular, that have added to the schism: the abortion people and the gun people. They don’t reach across any aisle. 
Other lobbying groups, like the chamber, are involved in all kinds of business. We’re involved in a whole bunch of issues. We’ve got lobbyists that are banging on each other on one issue, working together on another. The abortion people don’t do that. The NRA doesn’t do that. Instead, they send nasty postcards out. 
You used to be a Republican and later registered as an independent. Why?
What finally got me to pull the trigger on leaving the party was Merrick Garland’s proposed nomination to the Supreme Court, him not getting a hearing. Because Republicans were all saying you can’t do this when there’s a presidential election. 
And then, with unbelievable speed, closer to the election than that, Republicans got Amy Coney Barrett confirmed. And that was perfectly OK.
I just thought, “I don’t think we have any principles here.” 
I had run ballot campaigns 12, 13 times in two states by then. I get roughness. I get things getting ugly. But I’d like to think that we have some principles that we will stand by, and that just flushed it out of me. 
How has the business of lobbying itself changed?
My wife, Debra, who had been a lobbyist for the local chamber, was recently terminated. So, she spent some time as a contract lobbyist. 
And I now understand this whole game of contract lobbying better. So, I don’t know if I’m noticing changes or if I’m better educated.
In the world of contract lobbying, you have two camps. You have a camp where people are coming to certain lobbyists because they have a reputation of being very effective. And they charge a certain range, starting around $20,000 and it goes up. And then some people are just starting, kind of looking for clients.
It’s interesting to me the number of out-of-state groups, national groups, that have some agenda and are hiring these contract lobbyists. 
There’s more people with money forming groups, that in turn hire lobbyists to do, quite honestly, some fairly obscure crap. 
For example, another lobbyist reached out to me, and he had a group of trailer manufacturers who wanted to change one of our laws that requires trailer manufacturers to be affiliated with dealerships. 
So, this group in some orbit around some star finds him and says, “Can you help us change this?”
What are the right reasons to want to become a lobbyist? 
I’ve done what I’ve done for 45-plus years, 27 sessions, because I’m called to stand in this scene between business and government. 
I have profound respect for people who work for the public. I have great respect for my members and my board members. They’re two totally different systems. The balance sheet for legislators is how they vote and how they feel. That’s not a balance sheet for a business. 
My advice is to deal with facts. Listen. You can learn a lot. Be yourself, unless you’re an a—–. And know why you’re there, but respect and try to learn why other people are there. 
Every time we find something in the law that looks really stupid, I go back to when it passed. Every mistake we’ve made, we made on purpose. There was a reason that they convinced everybody in 1920 to vote for, I don’t know, tying up horses. 
I think the right reason is to solve problems. If you’re there sincerely, I think that’s the right thing. I don’t like the process when it sinks to the level of win-at-all-costs. I don’t like when it gets abusive – when they’re sending out postcards cards because they found out a lawmaker against their cause was picked up for a DUI when they were 18 years old. 
The wrong reason is just wanting to publicly humiliate those opposing your cause. That makes good people fearful of getting involved. And we’re going through some of that right now. 
The Republican Party is clearly divided into two sides. Right to Life, the NRA, the carbon pipeline people, those groups like to send out nasty cards. I think that’s a cancer in this system. If you’ve got to do that to win, I wish you’d find another occupation. Go be a bartender; leave the state.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/EM8A2138-1024x679.jpg,,,2025-04-20 18:04:40.892626

The planned casino will sit near the border of Ada and Elmore counties in southwest Idaho. (Courtesy of the Shoshone-Pauite Tribes)The Shoshone-Paiute Tribes are developing their first resort and casino along Interstate 84 halfway between Boise and Mountain Home.
For decades, the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes were the only tribe in Idaho without revenue. But the proposed resort and casino is estimated to generate tens of millions of dollars annually for Idaho’s economy and create thousands of regional jobs. The Shoshone-Paiute Tribes also plan to share 5% of their net gaming revenues to support local schools and education programs.
Shoshone-Paiute Chairman Brian Mason said in a press release he dreams of a future where tribal members have the resources, education, health care and employment opportunities they need to sustain their families and preserve their culture.
“Today, we have no meaningful economic opportunities and our community is facing some heavy challenges because of it,” Mason said. “We want to solve our own problems and provide for our people. Tribal gaming will allow us to make these dreams into a reality.”
Shoshone-Paiute Tribes partner with Coeur d’Alene Tribe
The tribes are partnering with the Coeur d’Alene Tribe, who has successfully run gaming operations in North Idaho for more than 30 years.
The Coeur d’Alene Tribe is providing a large upfront investment to help with the permitting and development process, and once it is built, the Tribe will enter into a management contract with the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes to help sustain the casino.
Coeur d’Alene Chairman Chief Allan said the tribe is honored to help its “brothers and sisters” secure the same benefits they have experienced from gaming.
“When I was growing up, many tribal members lived in poverty and could not find jobs,” Allan said in the press release. “Today, we have a state-of-the-art medical center, ample employment for tribal members and can financially support every tribal member who wants to earn a college degree. None of this would be possible without tribal gaming.”
Tribal gaming already contributes more than $1.4 billion of annual economic activity to the state, over $47 million in annual tax revenue and it sustains 12,500 Idaho jobs, according to a press release from the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes.
Tribe chairman says casino will provide resources to strengthen community
The Duck Valley Indian Reservation spans about 450 square miles in the southwest corner of Idaho, half split into parts of Nevada.
The tribes, according to the press release, face high rates of suicide and unemployment, and given its isolated location in the high desert, the Shoshone-Paiute community struggles to provide emergency services to its members.
Medical emergencies require lifesaving air transportation to Boise, which takes at least 45 minutes. A typical 911 call can take two hours to be answered because there are no tribal law enforcement officers exclusively dedicated to serving Duck Valley. Education funding is another major issue, and the school cannot attract enough certified teachers because of limited housing and other resources in the area, according to the press release
“The challenges we face daily are not insurmountable. We simply need resources to invest in long-term solutions for our people,” Mason said. “Gaming will give us the tools we need to strengthen our community, grow our infrastructure and provide more opportunities to our youth for generations to come.”
The planned location is where the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes used to live, hunt and care for the natural resources. The planned casino will include gaming machines, luxury hotel rooms, a spa, entertainment center and fine dining options.
To build this project on tribal land outside of the reservation, the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes will follow the established process set out by the U.S. Department of the Interior and plan to submit their initial application later this year.

  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
On March 17, Beson was noticed walking on Village Road near Wayman Lane toward Hwy. 47 on the Lac du Flambeau Reservation.
Six days later, family members reported Beson missing on March 23.
Beson was last seen wearing red sweatpants, a black sleeveless shirt, and a gray sweatshirt. She is a Native American female, 5’7”, with a medium build, brown hair, and brown eyes. She has numerous tattoos on her neck, arms, and legs.
Ground searches began on March 24 and 25, and aerial and underwater drones covered the Bear River in the vicinity where Beson was last seen.
Over 360 surveillance cameras positioned near tribal properties and monitored by full-time police employees had recorded footage reviewed without any evidence of Beson.
Subsequent ground searches were hampered by the heavy snowfall, but since most of the snow has melted, ground searches have resumed.
Lac du Flambeau Tribal Police Chief TJ Bill reports that on April 16, a Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR) plane provided aerial coverage, and he expects the DNR aircraft will again be available on Monday, April 21.
So far, Bill said, searchers have covered over 824 acres of forest.
“We are not saying she is out in the forest, but we need to make sure, and this is why we are doing the searches,” said Bill.
Recently police received reports that Beson was seen in the Wausau area. 
Beson’s mother, Winifred Ann Beson, “Winnie,” told the Wisconsin Examiner on Tuesday, April 8, that her daughter might be with friends and she noted her daughter also likes to travel to other states, but in the past, Beson has always stayed in communication.
“Usually, she calls me if she needs money or is in trouble, but she hasn’t called me,” she said.
“We have been getting numerous reports Melissa is in the Wausau area,” said Bill, “but nothing has been substantiated. We have our officers travelling to Wausau and other areas.”  
Beson’s mother also said she is afraid Melissa might have been kidnapped by human traffickers. Native Americans have been targeted by human traffickers who prey on vulnerable populations where there is poverty and high drug use.
According to the Indian Law Resource Center, Native American women experience the highest rates of sexual assault of any group and are10 times more likely to experience domestic violence than white women. On some reservations, Native American women are murdered at a rate that is 10 times the national average. 
The missing and murdered Indigenous women plus relatives (MMIW/R) movement has strived to raise awareness of the plight of Indigenous people in North America. 
May 5 is Red Dress Day,  a national day of awareness for MMIW/R.
Wisconsin has a MMIW/R Task Force that is part of the Department of Justice, but Wisconsin doesn’t have a full time office as in Minnesota, which monitors  MMIW/R cases, assists families,  coordinates information for r law enforcement agencies and offers rewards for information.
Concerning the search for Beson, Bill said his office has one officer dedicated to the case who is also coordinating the searches with the help of the tribe’s emergency management office.
“Our two detectives are spending the majority of their time on the case, working social media search warrants for cellular telephones (Verizon), Facebook, Snap Chat and Google, working with these entities on past history locations,” said Bill. “If we’re not handling current cases/calls coming into the PD, we are working this case non-stop.”
Bill said the public may be invited to help in the search for Beson, but he is concerned that volunteers stay safe in the large forest where it is easy to become disoriented and lost.
“These areas are dangerous to the novice, and we cannot afford the volunteers to work the swamp and bog areas,” he said. “There is still some ground freeze, but areas of the swamps have thawed areas with deep mud. We got stuck at times [Thursday] in the swamps.  When safe and weather conditions are good, we will ask for volunteer support.”
Anyone with any information regarding Beson’s whereabouts should call the Lac du Flambeau Tribal Police Department at (715) 588-7717 or Vilas County Sheriff’s Office at (715) 479-4441.
Acknowledgements
Bill wanted to acknowledge organizations that have helped with  the search for Beson.
“We literally have thousands of hours into this investigation, which involves so many entities, not just ourselves,” said Bill.
Organizations that have helped include:
LDF Emergency Management, LDF Tribal Roads,  LDF Tribal Wardens, LDF Natural Resources, LDF Victim Services, LDF Economic Support, LDF Prosecutor, Newbold Fire Search and Rescue, LDF Fire and EMS, Arbor Vitae Fire and EMS, Vilas County Sheriff’s Office and Dispatch, Vilas County Sheriff’s Office Jail, Vilas County IT Department, LDF IT Department, Manitowoc County Sheriff’s Office, DNR, Wisconsin Emergency Management, Wausau Police Department, Mountain Bay Metro Police, Taylor County Sheriff’s Office, Medford Police Department, Forest County Sheriff’s Office, Crandon Police Department, Kenosha County Sheriff’s Office, Atkins County Sheriff’s Office – Minnesota, Milwaukee High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA) agency, Vilas County Emergency Management, State of Wisconsin Department of Criminal Investigation, State of Wisconsin Department of Corrections Probation and Parole, Lake of the Torches Casino surveillance, Missing Murdered, Indigenous, plus Relatives  (MMIW/R) Wisconsin Task Force, and Native American Drug and Gang Initiative (NADGI) Task Force.

(John Gray / Verite News)NEW ORLEANS – Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill is pushing forward with her efforts to force Orleans Parish Sheriff Susan Hutson to drop a longtime policy that generally prohibits deputies from directly engaging in federal immigration enforcement within the city’s jail.
In legal filings, Murrill claims the policy — which the state characterizes as a so-called “sanctuary city” policy —  is in direct conflict with a newly passed state law that requires state and local law enforcement agencies to cooperate with federal immigration agencies.
“The consent decree now sits fundamentally at odds with state law as applicable to immigration detainers,” Murrill said in court documents filed Friday (April 11).
A federal court will now determine whether to allow the state of Louisiana to join a 2011 federal suit that resulted in the policy and whether to throw out the policy altogether. A hearing has been set for April 30.

The state’s campaign against “sanctuary” policies comes as President Donald Trump is pushing local law enforcement agencies to join the federal government in his promised immigration crackdown. Since his inauguration, Trump has ordered the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to push for more partnerships between local law enforcement units and federal immigration agencies. A few have already signed up. Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry, a longtime immigration hardliner and Trump ally, has worked with Republican lawmakers in the state to enact laws that encourage those collaborations.
As attorney general, Landry criticized a policy adopted by the New Orleans Police Department, under a long-running federal consent decree that blocks officers from enforcing immigration laws.
Neither Murrill’s office nor representatives for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement responded to requests for comment.
In court filings, Murrill said Hutson “does not oppose the [state’s] intervention” in the case.” But a spokesperson for Hutson said that’s not exactly true.
“It’s more accurate that we take no position regarding the state intervention,” a Sheriff’s Office spokesperson said in an emailed statement on Wednesday.
While she has not taken a position for or against increased collaboration with ICE, in an interview with Fox 8 in December, Hutson noted that the jail’s resources were far too stretched to take on immigration enforcement.
“I’m a lawyer. I believe in following the law and court orders and we do that and so that’s what we’re gonna do, continue to follow the law, but I cannot do ICE’s work,” she said. “It’s too big of a load.”
Potential conflict
The sheriff’s policy stems from a 2013 federal court settlement in a civil rights case involving two New Orleans construction workers picked up on minor charges in 2009 and 2010.
Mario Cacho and Antonio Ocampo sued after they were allegedly illegally held in the city’s jail past the completion of their sentences. The two were held at the request of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The agency issues such “detainer” requests to local law enforcement agencies, asking them to hold onto arrestees who are suspected of immigration violations.
Local agencies are only supposed to honor the hold requests for 48 hours, after which they should let detainees free. But in 2009 and 2010, then-Sheriff Marlin Gusman detained Cacho and Ocampo for months, according to legal filings in their case against the office.
Ocampo and Cacho settled the case with the Sheriff’s Office in 2013, and Gusman agreed to adopt a new policy on immigration investigations. The resulting policy blocks the agency from investigating immigration violations and from detaining immigrants for ICE without a court order, except in certain cases where they are facing charges for a small number of serious violent crimes.
Attorneys for Cacho and Ocampo declined to speak with Verite News on the record. However, filings they submitted to the court last week opposing the state’s intervention in the case argue  that Murrill has “blatantly misrepresented the OPSO policy” by falsely claiming it forces the Sheriff’s Office to disregard all ICE detainers.
The sheriff’s office, like the NOPD, has been under a sweeping federal consent decree for more than a decade. But unlike the NOPD, the jail’s consent decree does not demand that deputies stay away from federal immigration enforcement, only that it release anyone subject to an immigration hold after two days. The Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, which is a party to both consent decrees, has not entered any filings since Murrill moved to bring the state into the Cacho and Ocampo case.
The Department of Justice did not respond to a request for comment.
The OPSO policy remained in place for more than a decade without any controversy until last spring, when the Louisiana Legislature passed a bill — Act 314 — that blocks so-called “sanctuary” policies prohibiting state and local law enforcement officers from cooperating with federal immigration agencies like ICE.
A sheriff’s office spokesperson spokesperson said the agency’s policy on ICE detainers is “governed” by the consent judgement in the case. She declined to comment further, as the state is currently challenging the policy, but affirmed that OPSO is “in full compliance with all applicable state laws and valid court orders related to ICE detainers.”

OKLAHOMA CITY — On the 30th anniversary of the deadliest act of domestic terrorism in U.S. history, former President Bill Clinton said Americans must unite despite their differences, and that Oklahomans can help lead the way by serving as that role model for the rest of the nation.
Clinton, who was president at the time of the attack, returned to the site of the 1995 Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building bombing Saturday to deliver the keynote address to a crowd of over 1,600 that attended to remember and honor those who died and were injured in the attack.
While the event is typically held outdoors at the Oklahoma City National Memorial and Museum, the site of the bombing, it was moved indoors due to inclement weather. The crowd that arrived to commemorate the anniversary was so large that once the pews were packed, people stood along the walls and filled an overflow room.

“The domestic terrorists who did this awful thing believed that it would spark a nationwide upheaval against the American government, and would eventually destroy our government, our democracy and our life,” Clinton said. “Instead, you gave them, as the mayor said so eloquently, the Oklahoma Standard. You gave them service, honor and kindness.”
Clinton, a Democrat, came to Oklahoma City days after the 1995 attack to address a devastated crowd assembled at the Oklahoma State Fair Arena. He said he’s returned to Oklahoma City in subsequent years to commemorate the event.
Three decades later, Clinton said that the country has again grown more polarized. When Oklahoma City was the “center of polarization” 30 years ago, it chose to move forward together, he said.
“America needs you, and America needs the Oklahoma Standard,” Clinton said. “And if we all live by it, we would get a fairer economy, a more stable society. We would understand one another, and we wouldn’t feel weak if we admitted we were wrong about something.”
Thirty years ago, a fertilizer and fuel oil bomb placed inside a Ryder truck outside the Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City exploded at 9:02 a.m., killing 168 people, including 19 children, and injuring around 850.
Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols were arrested for their roles. Both were found guilty. McVeigh was executed June 11, 2001, by lethal injection at the Federal Correctional Complex in Terre Haute, Indiana. Nichols was sentenced to life in prison.
Michael Fortier was sentenced to 12 years in prison for failing to report his knowledge of the bombing plot.
Investigators said McVeigh held extremist views and planned the bombing on the anniversary of the end of the Waco siege between law enforcement and the Branch Davidians.
Other speakers at Saturday’s remembrance event included prominent Republican officials such as Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, former Gov. Frank Keating, and U.S. Sen. James Lankford. Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt also spoke. Most of Oklahoma’s congressional delegation was present, as were a few other former governors, current state lawmakers and other officials.
There have been nearly “11,000 tomorrows” since the bombing and in Oklahoma City, Holt said, and the city has grown in that time. He said 30 years since the bombing signifies a “generation.”
While younger Oklahomans may not remember the bombing, Stitt said, they live in a state shaped by it and the “commitment to service, honor and kindness” that followed.
Lankford said Oklahomans need to ensure the lessons learned from the bombing and its aftermath are passed to future generations to ensure there is “no generation that rises up that does not remember.”
The federal building housed agencies like the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Secret Service, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,  Firearms and Explosives, the agency that initially launched the Waco raid. But the building also held a day care, military recruitment offices and other various federal agencies.

Family members of victims read the 168 names to the crowd Saturday in an effort to “humanize” the people, said Kari Watkins, president and CEO of the memorial museum.
The building was imploded after the rescue operations and evidence collections were completed. A new federal building was built nearby.
The memorial was built where the old federal building once stood. The 168 chairs erected at the site each represent an empty seat at the dinner table. The smaller chairs represent the children who died. A reflecting pool represents the time between 9:01 a.m. and 9:03 a.m. April 19, 1995. Officials were able to preserve an American elm tree that survived the blast. It is known as the “Survivor Tree.”
In the aftermath of the attack, the state became known for the “Oklahoma Standard,” a term used to describe the “selfless actions” of thousands who offered help.

Where are the 92 percent?
That has been a persistent question since the presidential election, referring to the Black women who overwhelmingly organized and voted for Kamala Harris and then seemingly went dark after November 5. For many of them — who have largely rejected Donald Trump in his three campaigns for president — Harris’ loss felt like a betrayal, and another signal of disrespect from a democracy they have long worked hard to shape.
In the early days of the Trump administration, there have been feelings of anger, resolve, resignation and exhaustion among Black women and many other Americans frustrated with the president’s actions and the current political climate. Earlier this month, millions of protesters took to the streets in cities across the country to make their voices heard as Trump and ally Elon Musk have sought to dramatically remake the federal government, with consequences for real Americans.
The crowds were overwhelmingly White, not the typical makeup of other recent protest movements. Many of the Black women who have been among the leaders of such movements in the past decade, were noticeably — and intentionally — absent.
The Black women I talk to said they are being strategic, pragmatic and creative about what their resistance looks like now, preparing for a long fight ahead, and rejecting narratives that suggest their lack of visibility in this moment translates into inaction.
“People are paying more attention to what Black women are doing because of the impact we had in the election,” said Janai Nelson, president of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. “We pointed people in the right direction and they did not follow. We may be out of sight to some people, but we’re not checked out by any stretch. The crisis in America is certainly not out of our minds.”

Within weeks of the election, a meme began to circulate of a group of Black women sitting on the roof of a building, sipping their beverages and watching the country burn. The message: Black women would do nothing to help if the democracy they’d tried to save went up in flames.
This month, another image quickly gained traction during the “Hands Off” protests: a photograph of White marchers filing past a restaurant while Black people having brunch looked on, unbothered.
While the idea that Black women deserve rest is showing up in organic social media content, it’s also part of a campaign of misinformation, said Esosa Osa, founder of Onyx Impact, a nonprofit dedicated to researching Black online communities and fighting harmful information that targets Black voters. Emphasizing Black women talking about rest can discourage others in this key Democratic voting bloc from engaging civically.
“We are seeing bad actors trying to influence and suppress Black engagement in a really targeted and hostile way,” Osa said. “We should be cautious of any narrative that’s just, ‘Black women won’t turn out or won’t engage civically.’  Those are the types of narratives that folks working against Black power would want to uplift and amplify. Just because you don’t see your Black friend at a protest doesn’t mean we’re not working or being strategic.”
A lot of that strategy is happening behind the scenes, said Kimberlé Crenshaw, who coined the term “intersectionality” and is a leading legal and civil rights scholar at UCLA and Columbia Law School. Crenshaw added that she has been skeptical of much of what she has seen online about Black women “resting.”
“I see a contrast between what’s being given to me on social media and what I’m seeing in the trenches,” Crenshaw said. “Are we tired? Yes. Are we heartbroken? Absolutely. Are we willing to roll over and let this … happen to us without hearing from us? I’m not seeing that, not in the circles I talk to. We don’t have an option not to fight.”

Nelson is among the Black women in the fight now, tapping into LDF’s long history of legal activism to make American democracy live up to its values. The group was among several civil rights organizations that filed a lawsuit earlier this month challenging Trump’s executive order calling for sweeping election changes.
Fatima Goss Graves, head of the National Women’s Law Center, said Black women are leading a lot of the strategy in this time, pointing to colleagues like Alexis McGill Johnson of Planned Parenthood; Melanie Campbell of the Black Women’s Roundtable, a network focused on the political and economic power of Black women; and SEIU President April Verrett. In February, Graves’ organization, a nonprofit advancing gender justice, filed a lawsuit challenging the president’s executive orders that take aim at diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives.
Asked about this month’s protests, Graves said she was not surprised to see White Americans — who make up the majority of the federal workforce — as the main participants.
“The folks who usually come to the streets first are the ones who see the direct impact,” Graves pointed out. “You haven’t always seen groups like that in the streets. I actually feel good about Black women’s leadership at this time. They understand the assignment fully.”
And there are others, focused on building community, messaging to counteract negative narratives and protesting with the power of their purses.

In the days leading up to Trump’s joint address to Congress, an idea was launched by Black activists, organizers and strategists including Angela Rye, Leah Daughtry and Tamika Mallory to provide an alternative to the president’s speech: a marathon of online programming aimed at educating and empowering Black Americans impacted by the new administration.
“State of the People” streamed for 24 hours and has since evolved into a 10-city tour starting April 26 in Atlanta that will include mutual aid, political education and town halls.
“We have not stopped; we are focused on not just surviving, but making sure we don’t lose ground on what we have achieved as a people in this country,” said Campbell, one of the organizers of the State of the People effort. “This is designed to build a larger, intergenerational movement, showing the potential of long-term, sustained organizing on the ground and online.”
During the Lenten season, Jamal Bryant, pastor of the Atlanta-based mega congregation New Birth Missionary Baptist Church, called for a 40-day boycott of Target after the retailer announced it would scale back its DEI initiatives. The campaign came in the wake of the Trump administration’s executive orders calling for an end to such programs, which the president referred to as “radical and wasteful.” Black consumers, many of them women, make up nearly 9 percent of Target shoppers. While the full impact of the boycott is unclear, the company’s stock price has dropped, foot traffic to stores has slowed significantly and net quarterly sales decreased as a result.
Last month, 100 women did a “buy-in” at a Washington, D.C.-area Costco to show support for the store’s commitment to DEI as part of an annual summit organized by the Black Women’s Roundtable. Campbell said the gathering also included a day on Capitol Hill hosted by Angela Alsobrooks and Lisa Blount Rochester — the nation’s two Black women senators — focused on federal budget priorities including Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security.
Campbell said she has been part of different organizing efforts since the election and strategizing around protecting Black women’s leadership in this moment.
“Part of resistance is self-care,” Campbell said. “That does not have anything to do with not fighting, because we are. We said we were going to take some rest after November 5, but there was never any notion that we weren’t going to fight for our freedom in this country.”

Resistance to the Trump administration, including for Black women, is still taking shape. Campbell said she invites allies whom she felt left down by after the election to step up now. What is clear in this unprecedented moment is that it will not look like it has looked before.
Nelson said Black women’s roles now must be “very targeted, very pinpointed, because we are in a crisis unlike anything we have seen in modern history for Black women.”
“We’re taking it very seriously,” Nelson said. “To the extent people sense silence or reserve, those energies are being put to good use, just in a quiet way.”
When the moment is right, Graves predicted that Black women could also take their protest to the streets.
“That’s part of being a strategist,” she said. “We’ll know when it’s time for us to engage, and that’s OK.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-15-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-04-20 11:07:07.320676

(Photo by Maddie McGarvey for KFF Health News)For many years, Eric Wunderlin’s health issues made it hard to find stable employment.
Struggling to manage depression and diabetes, Wunderlin worked part-time, minimum-wage retail jobs around Dayton, Ohio, making so little he said he sometimes had to choose between paying rent and buying food.
But in 2018, his CareSource Medicaid health plan offered him help getting a job. It connected him to a life coach, who helped him find full-time work with health benefits. Now, he works for a nonprofit social service agency, a job he said has given him enough financial stability to plan a European vacation next year.
“I feel like a real person and I can go do things,” said Wunderlin, 42. “I feel like I pulled myself out of that slump.”
Republicans in Congress and several states, including Ohio, Iowa, and Montana, are pushing to implement work requirements for nondisabled adults, arguing a mandate would encourage enrollees to find jobs. And for Republicans pushing to require Medicaid enrollees to work, Wunderlin’s story could be held up as evidence that government health coverage can help people find employment and, ultimately, reduce their need for public assistance.
Yet his experience is rare. Medicaid typically does not offer such help, and when states do try to help, such efforts are limited.
And opponents point out that most Medicaid recipients already have jobs and say such a mandate would only kick eligible people off Medicaid, rather than improve their economic prospects. Nearly two-thirds of Medicaid enrollees work, with most of the rest acting as caregivers, going to school, or unable to hold a job due to disability or illness, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.
Existing efforts to help Medicaid recipients get a job have seen limited success because there’s not a lot of “room to move the needle,” said Ben Sommers, a professor of health care economics at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Most Medicaid enrollees already work — just not in jobs with health benefits, he said.
“The ongoing argument that some folks make is that there are a lot of people freeloading in Medicaid,” he said. “That’s just not supported by the evidence.”

Using health programs to encourage work
The GOP-controlled Congress could allow or require states to implement a Medicaid work requirement as part of revamping and downsizing Medicaid. The first Trump administration encouraged those work mandates, but many were struck down by federal judges who said they were illegal under federal law.
Policy experts and state officials say more attention should be paid to investments that have helped people find better jobs — from personalized life coaching to, in some cases, health plans’ directly hiring enrollees.
They argue work requirements alone are not enough. “The move to economic mobility requires a ladder, not a stick,” said Farah Khan, a fellow with the Brookings Institution, a nonpartisan think tank.
While Medicaid work requirements have been debated for decades, the issue has become more heated as 40 states and Washington, D.C., have expanded Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act to the vast majority of low-income adults. More than 20 million adults have gained coverage as a result — but Republicans are now considering eliminating the billions in extra federal funding that helped states extend eligibility beyond groups including many children, pregnant women, and disabled people.
Only Georgia and Arkansas have implemented mandates that some Medicaid enrollees work, volunteer, go to school, or enroll in job training. But a study Sommers co-authored showed no evidence work requirements in Arkansas’ program led to more people working, in part because most of those who could work already were.
In Arkansas, more than 18,000 people lost coverage under the state’s requirement before the policy was suspended by a federal judge in 2019 after less than a year. Those who lost their Medicaid health care reported being unaware or confused about how to report work hours. Since 2023, Arkansas has been giving Medicaid health plans financial incentives to help enrollees train for jobs, but so far few have taken advantage.
Some plans, including Arkansas Blue Cross and Blue Shield’s, offer members $25 to $65 to complete a “career readiness” certificate. In 2024, some Arkansas health plans offered enrollees educational videos about topics including taxes and cryptocurrency.
Health plans don’t have an incentive to help someone find a better-paying job, because that could mean losing a customer if they then make too much to qualify for Medicaid, said Karin VanZant, a vice president at Clearlink Partners, a health care consulting company.
Rather than offering incentives for providing job training, some states, such as California and Ohio, require the insurance companies that run Medicaid to help enrollees find work.
In Montana, where some lawmakers are pushing to implement work requirements, a promising optional program nearly collapsed after state lawmakers required it be outsourced to private contractors.
Within the program’s first three years, the state paired 32,000 Medicaid enrollees with existing federally funded job training programs. Most had higher wages a year after starting training, the state found.
But enrollment has plummeted to just 11 people, according to the latest data provided by the state’s labor department.
Sarah Swanson, who heads the department, said several of the nonprofit contractors that ran the program shuttered. “There was no real part in this for us to deliver direct services to the folks that walked through our door,” she said. The state hopes to revive job training by allowing the department to work alongside contractors to reach more people.
The hunt for results
State officials say they don’t have much data to track the effectiveness of existing job programs offered by Medicaid plans.
Stephanie O’Grady, a spokesperson for the Ohio Department of Medicaid, said the state does not track outcomes because “the health plans are not employment agencies.”
Officials with CareSource, which operates Medicaid plans in multiple states, say it has about 2,300 Medicaid and ACA marketplace enrollees in its JobConnect program — about 1,400 in Ohio, 500 in Georgia, and 400 in Indiana.
The program connects job seekers with a life coach who counsels them on skills such as “showing up on time, dressing the part for interviews, and selling yourself during the interview,” said Jesse Reed, CareSource’s director of life services in Ohio.
 
Since 2023, about 800 people have found jobs through the program, according to Josh Boynton, a senior vice president at CareSource. The health plan itself has hired 29 Medicaid enrollees into customer service, pharmacy, and other positions — nearly all full-time with benefits, he said.
In 2022, California started offering nontraditional health benefits through Medicaid — including help finding jobs — for enrollees experiencing homelessness or serious mental illness, or who are otherwise at risk of avoidable emergency room care. As of September, it had served nearly 280,000 enrollees, but the state doesn’t have data on how many became employed.
The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, which is among the largest private employers in Pennsylvania, running both a sprawling hospital system and a Medicaid plan, has hired over 10,000 of its Medicaid enrollees since 2021 through its training and support services. Among other jobs, they took positions as warehouse workers, customer service representatives, and medical assistants.
The vast majority left low-paying jobs for full-time positions with health benefits, said Dan LaVallee, a senior director of UPMC Health Plan’s Center for Social Impact. “Our Pathways to Work program is a model for the nation,” he said.
Josh Archambault, a senior fellow with the conservative Cicero Institute, said Medicaid should focus on improving the financial health of those enrolled.
While the first Trump administration approved Medicaid work requirements in 13 states, the Biden administration or federal judges blocked all except Georgia’s.
“I don’t think states have been given ample chance to experiment and try to figure out what works,” Archambault said.

They also marched along the sidewalks surrounding the Capitol, joining protests taking place in cities across the country.
The sound of church bells around downtown Lansing coincided with the start of the rally organized by Stand Against Extremism, or  SAGE, and promoted on social media, highlighting their call for freedom, equality, and justice, and their solidarity with nationwide protests organized by grassroots protest group 50501. 
Protests were also held across Michigan, including in Coldwater, Detroit, Flint, Grand Rapids, Livonia, Port Huron, and Portage.
As the first speakers took their positions at the entrance to the Capitol, hundreds more people approached the Capitol grounds with anti-Trump, anti-authoritarianism, and anti-Nazi signs and banners.
“This is the anniversary of the beginning of the American Revolution, and the democratic rights that were established during that revolution, and later confirmed and developed in the American Civil War, are now under attack,” said Tim Rivers, 65, a member of the socialist movement, during his speech.
“Hundreds have already been sent [to the El Salvodoran prison known as CECOT], and now Trump is threatening to take American citizens and deport them to El Salvador,” Rivers added.

On April 17, Juan Carlos López-Gómez, 20, was released after being arrested in Florida by federal immigration agents, despite being a natural-born American citizen. However, Lopez-Gomez was not the only U.S citizen who had an encounter with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE.

Ramiro Martinez, a Mexican immigrant and U.S. citizen, was surrounded and detained by ICE in Michigan earlier this month.
Additionally, concerns about border patrol agents’ actions under Trump’s policies have been fueled by emails sent on April 11, around the country, by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to immigrants who entered the country using CBP One, a mobile app developed by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, with an American citizen in Michigan also receiving those messages.
Around 12:30, the march began on W. Allegan Street and marched once around the Capitol, as protesters chanted against the current administration.

“The purpose of our march was basically to defend our democracy. We wanted people to come out and express their discomfort with what is going on a national scale,” said Daniel Pfau, 37, a volunteer with SAGE. “I hope that people see this event is by the people, for the people. We didn’t need a national organization in charge. We showed up, and we took care.”
After the march, a series of speakers took the microphone to express their concerns to the audience. Among the speakers were community members, social activists, and elected officials who primarily spoke out against the federal government’s targeting of immigrants across the country.
“They are trying to distract us. They want people divided. They want to bring out the worst impulses in many people’s hearts,” said State Rep. Jasper Martus (D-Flushing) during his speech. “We need to think about all those folks who are going to church tomorrow morning and saying they’re okay with deporting people who are here illegally. I’m a believer, but that’s not what I believe in.”
During the speeches, support was given for Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident the Trump administration erroneously deported to his native El Salvador, which was echoed and chanted by the audience in favor of his release and return to the US.
Abrego Garcia was arrested March 12 as he drove his 5-year-old son home, and was informed by ICE agents that his status had changed, despite an order that determined it was more “likely than not that he would be persecuted by gangs in El Salvador” if he were returned there, according to court documents.
Although ICE accepted his deportation was due to an administrative error, and the Supreme Court of the United States later ordered his return, on April 14, U.S. President Trump and El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele announced in the Oval Office that they would not release Abrego Garcia.
Toward the end of the demonstration, near the Capitol, on the side of North Capitol Avenue, a Trump supporter counter-protested, giving speeches and holding a sign that read “God, put Trump in.” This situation generated tense moments among the protesters, who approached to confront and argue with the lone counter-protestor. 
By the end of the day, no acts of violence or physical confrontations had been reported.

Sign up for their newsletter here.
The Trump administration proposed a new rule Wednesday that would rescind widespread habitat protections for species protected under the Endangered Species Act, a landmark law enacted in 1973 to conserve the country’s imperiled animals and plants.
That would open the door for developments across the country to be approved even if they significantly disrupt critical habitat for species listed under the Endangered Species Act. The proposed rule, posted in the U.S. Federal Register by the U.S Fish and Wildlife Service, would “rescind the regulatory definition of ‘harm,’” which is defined as any significant habitat modification or degradation that actually kills or injures wildlife.
Environmental groups lambasted the proposal.
“There’s just no way to protect animals and plants from extinction without protecting the places they live, yet the Trump administration is opening the floodgates to immeasurable habitat destruction,” said Noah Greenwald, co-director of endangered species at the Center for Biological Diversity. “This administration’s greed and contempt for imperiled wildlife know no bounds, but most Americans know that we destroy the natural world at our own peril. Nobody voted to drive spotted owls, Florida panthers or grizzly bears to extinction.”
If approved, he said, the rule would mean endangered species would only be protected from actions that intentionally lead to the harm of a species. “It’s just foundational to how we’ve protected endangered species for the last 40-plus years, and they’re just completely upending that,” Greenwald said.










This administration’s greed and contempt for imperiled wildlife know no bounds.


–  Noah Greenwald, Center for Biological Diversity


Just the day before Wednesday’s proposed rule, the Trump administration put out a rescission notice to roll back a rule that put conservation on equal footing with extractive uses on the nation’s public lands. The two decisions, along with scores of others in recent months since President Trump took office, threaten species and the habitats they depend on across the country, experts and environmentalists say.
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service did not respond to a request for comment.
 What does ‘harm’ mean? 

By law, the ESA prohibits the “take” of an endangered species, which includes actions “to harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect, or to attempt to engage in any such conduct.” Historically, the “harm” part of this mandate encompasses “any activity that can modify a species’ habitat.”
This interpretation of “harm” has long been used by agencies to extend protections for endangered species to the land or ocean area that it relies on. For example, an oil or gas project may not be able to drill or be forced to modify operations in a certain area that provides habitat for an endangered animal, such as a dune sagebrush lizard. In many cases, the “harm” rule has not blocked projects altogether, but rather resulted in different designs that reduce impacts on endangered species.
In 1995, a group of landowners and timber interests in the Pacific Northwest and the Southeast challenged the regulation’s interpretation in a push to log forests where endangered northern spotted owls and red-cockaded woodpeckers lived. In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court upheld the broad definition of “harm” on the basis of the Chevron Doctrine, a principle that defers to federal agencies’ expertise for carrying out laws. Last year, however, Chevron was overturned, and the Trump administration has seized on that in the new proposed rule.
The new proposal would eliminate this “harm” definition—and the habitat protections that come with it, according to Dave Owen, an environmental law professor at the University of California, San Francisco.
“The shift here would be to say that just habitat modification that is detrimental to a species, even if the detriment is fairly direct, is not encompassed within the word ‘harm,’” Owen said. The majority of habitat protections related to the ESA fall under the “harm” interpretation, according to a 2012 study by Owen. Now, under the proposal, “the word ‘harm’ is essentially going to be read as an inconsequential nullity,” he said.
The Trump administration says that its proposal is more in line with the language in the ESA, arguing that the regulations surrounding the word “harm” should be defined as an “affirmative act directed immediately against a particular animal,” rather than one that could indirectly harm an endangered species’ population, according to the posting of the proposed rule in the Federal Register. However, research shows that habitat loss is a primary driver of extinction in the United States.
In the case of the spotted owl, nests must have a 70-acre circle of land around them protected, even on private lands used for timber. “With this change, they don’t have to do that anymore,” said Greenwald with the Center for Biological Diversity.
The Trump administration’s proposal is the latest in a series of deregulatory moves to undermine the ESA, which Republicans have long attacked for stifling economic development and interfering with states’ ability to manage wildlife. Rolling back its ability to protect species was outlined in Project 2025, the conservative roadmap published before the 2024 elections guiding much of the administration’s actions.
On Inauguration Day, President Donald Trump declared a “national energy emergency,” which outlined a process to enable fossil fuel projects to bypass the typical environmental reviews associated with approval, including those required by the Endangered Species Act. The order directed the heads of all agencies and the secretary of the Army to identify projects “that may be subject to emergency treatment” within 30 days. By mid-February, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers marked for review more than 600 permit applications for energy-related projects that could qualify for the fast-pass treatment, though environmental groups argue these efforts would disrupt crucial wetlands.
To support efforts for “unleashing energy dominance,” the secretary of the Department of Interior, Doug Burgum, issued several orders in February that aim to “suspend, revise, or rescind” several ESA regulations enacted during the Biden administration. This new proposal to rescind the harm definition could also pave the way for new energy projects, experts say.
The historic interpretation of the regulation served “as sort of a caution to people not to go down and knock down trees where red-cockaded woodpeckers were nesting. And if you change the definition, I think there’s the risk that people are going to go out and engage in that behavior in the real world,” said Andrew Mergen, the director of Harvard Law School’s Emmett Environmental Law and Policy Clinic. “The rule plays a really important role in preventing people from doing that sort of thing, and at the same time, it has hardly damaged the economy, or made economic progress impossible.”
The public will have 30 days to submit comments on the proposal. Environmental groups like Earthjustice have vowed to challenge the rule in court.
 A series of attacks on conservation

Meanwhile, on Tuesday, the administration proposed rescinding the Public Lands Rule—a landmark achievement of the Biden administration that placed conservation on equal footing as extraction across the nation’s public lands following an extensive public comment period. Ninety  percent of comments received supported the rule. Another rule implemented last year that restricts oil and gas development across millions of acres of public lands in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska was also rescinded.
“This is not policy—it’s a blatant giveaway to industry that threatens to dismantle decades of conservation progress, shut down public access, harm wildlife and accelerate the reckless sell-off of our natural resources,” said Alison Flint, senior legal director at The Wilderness Society, in a statement concerning the two proposed rescission notices.
Already this year, a series of executive orders and actions by Trump have removed protections across millions of acres in national forests to boost the logging industry, streamlined the permitting process for mines, made the extraction of minerals on public lands with suitable resources the priority use, and targeted national monuments elimination. Staff at national parks have also been gutted.
All of this has come despite polling showing that conserving public lands is universally popular across party lines.
“The Trump administration is just working to undermine all protections for air, for water, for wildlife and climate—systematically and rapidly,” Greenwald said.

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)MANSFIELD — When DeSoto Regional Health System took out $36 million in loans last year to renovate a rural hospital that opened in 1952, officials were banking on its main funding source remaining stable: Medicaid, the joint federal-state health program for low-income people and the disabled.
But those dollars are now in jeopardy, as President Donald Trump and the GOP-controlled Congress move to shrink the nearly $900 billion health program that covers more than 1 in 5 Americans.
DeSoto CEO Todd Eppler said Medicaid cuts could make it harder for his hospital to repay the loans and for patients to access care.
“I just hope that the people who are making these decisions have thought deeply about it and have some context of the real-world implications,” he said, “because it’s going to affect us as a hospital and going to affect our patients.”

One of the decision-makers is Eppler’s representative in Congress: House Speaker Mike Johnson, who lives about 35 miles north of here. He said he knows the Republican leader and his staff understand hospitals’ plight: The mother of Johnson’s chief of staff is CEO of a rural hospital in the district.
“I’ve never met a congressman yet that wanted a rural hospital in their district to close, and certainly Mike is no exception to that rule,” Eppler said.
Last year nearly 290,000 people in Johnson’s district were enrolled in Medicaid, about 38% of the total population, according to data compiled by KFF, the health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.
About 118,000 of them are in the program thanks to the Affordable Care Act, which allowed states including Louisiana to expand Medicaid to cover low-income adults, many of whom were working in low-paying jobs that don’t provide health insurance.
Louisiana ranks second in Medicaid enrollment, at nearly 32% — a reflection of the state’s high poverty rate. As Republicans weigh cuts, their actions could have dramatic consequences for their constituents here. Of the eight GOP-held House districts with the most Medicaid enrollees due to the expansion, four are in Louisiana. Johnson’s largely rural district ranks sixth in expansion enrollees.
Among them is Chloe Stovall, 23, who works in the produce aisle at the SuperValu grocery store in Vivian. She said her take-home wage working full time is $200 a week. She doesn’t own a car and walks a mile to work.
The store provides health coverage, but she said she won’t qualify until she’s worked there for a full year — and even then, it will cost more than Medicaid, which is free.
“I’m just barely surviving,” she said.
In February, Johnson pushed a budget resolution through the House that calls for cutting at least $880 billion over a decade from a pool of funding that includes Medicaid, to help fund an extension of Trump’s tax cuts and his border priorities. Republicans in Congress are now considering where to make cuts, and Medicaid is likely to take a big hit.
Defending the plan, Johnson said that Medicaid is “not for 29-year-old males sitting on their couches playing video games.”
Stovall said almost everyone she knows on Medicaid works at least one job. “I don’t even own a TV,” she said.
Contacted for comment, Johnson’s office pointed to his remarks at a conference in Washington last month. “We’re going to be very careful not to cut a benefit for anyone who is eligible to receive it and relies upon it,” Johnson said.

KFF Health News spoke with two dozen Medicaid enrollees in Johnson’s district. Most said they were unaware their congressman is leading the Republican charge to upend the program. Those informed of the Republican plan said it scares them.
Some GOP members of Congress want to eliminate the ACA’s Medicaid expansion funding, which led to 20 million working-age adults gaining coverage and helped slash the nation’s uninsured rate to its lowest level in history. Forty states and the District of Columbia have agreed to the change, which promised extra federal funding in exchange for expanding eligibility.
In this heavily Republican district, where Johnson won with 86% of the vote in November, 22% of residents live in poverty.
Like Trump, Johnson says he wants cuts to Medicaid but hasn’t elaborated other than saying the program should not cover “able-bodied” adults without imposing a work requirement.
“Everybody is committed” to preserving Medicaid benefits “for those who desperately need it and deserve it and qualify for it,” Johnson said at a news conference in February. “What we’re talking about is rooting out the fraud, waste, and abuse.”
Medicaid recipients in Johnson’s district, told about GOP plans to cut the program, said their lives are hard enough in a state where the minimum wage is $7.25 an hour. Without Medicaid, they said, they couldn’t afford health coverage.
In Vivian, near the borders with Arkansas and Texas, close to half of the 2,900 residents live in poverty. The main-street shops are mostly shuttered, except for a thrift store and a mom-and-pop restaurant that specializes in fried pork chops.
“Most everybody you know is on Medicaid here,” said Doris Luccous, 24.
Luccous said she makes $250 a week after taxes as a housekeeper at a nursing home while raising her 2-year-old daughter in her childhood home. While shopping with her father — who doesn’t work, because of a disability — she said she counts on Medicaid for her bipolar medicines and to pay for therapy appointments.
“I don’t know where I would be without it,” she said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Neither Luccous nor Stovall said they voted in the last election, and neither knew that Johnson is their representative in Congress.
Vivian has few large employers, and most employers pay the minimum wage, which hasn’t changed since 2009. “We are just stuck,” Stovall said.
Still, she said, “it’s a community where everybody knows everybody, and people are always willing to lend a hand because so many are in difficult financial circumstances.”
Willie White is CEO of David Raines Community Health Centers, which operates six outpatient clinics in northwestern Louisiana that serve primarily Medicaid enrollees. He said that Louisiana already ranks among the worst states for people’s health and that Medicaid cuts would only worsen the situation.
“You cannot expect health outcomes to improve if people can’t afford to access care,” White said.
While the clinics provide primary and dental care on a sliding fee scale for uninsured patients, signing them up for Medicaid gives them better access to specialists and brings the health centers revenue to cover the cost of delivering care.

Many of the centers’ patients gained coverage through Medicaid expansion. Afterward, rates of screenings for colon and cervical cancer went from 10% to 50%, White said.
But if Congress cuts Medicaid, the health centers would be forced to cut services, he said.
“Mike Johnson has been here and knows us, and he and his office have been responsive about our issues,” White said. “The message in prior years was, ‘We need additional funding,’ but now it is asking for no cuts.”
Community health centers, which in 2023 provided care nationally to more than 32 million mostly low-income people, have seen funding increases from Republicans and Democrats for decades.
“Everyone is supportive, but the question remains what that support will look like under the current administration,” White said. “If there are to be reductions, they need to be done with a scalpel.”
Expecting cuts, the health centers have already restricted travel and put a hold on filling vacant positions, White said.
Sitting in a David Raines clinic in Bossier City, Benjamin Andrade, 57, said having Medicaid has been a lifesaver since he needed heart surgery in 2020. Andrade is a chef and said he supports his wife and two children on $14 an hour.
He had not heard about any potential cuts to the program. Without Medicaid, he said, “it would be very hard for me to pay for all the medicines I take.”
Dominique Youngblood, 31, who was at the clinic for a dental checkup, said she’s had Medicaid most of her life. “Medicaid helps me so I don’t have to pay out-of-pocket going to the doctors,” she said.
Youngblood, who has two children, makes $12 an hour at a day care center. Asked about GOP efforts to scale back the program, she said, “It’s not fair, because it helps a lot of people who cannot afford medications and emergency room trips, and those are costs you can’t control.”

Back in Mansfield, Eppler’s hospital is more than just a health facility — it’s where many people in town come for lunch. The cafeteria was packed on a recent Friday as workers served boiled shrimp, fried okra, and baked fish.
Eppler said he’s aware Republicans in Congress are targeting a system of taxes that some states, including Louisiana, levy on hospitals and other health providers to draw down more federal Medicaid funding. That money helps finance what are known as supplemental payments to providers. Some conservatives belittle the extra funding as “money laundering.”
But that money accounts for about 15% of the DeSoto health system’s budget, said Eppler, a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel who has been CEO for a dozen years. “We are using that money to invest in the next 50 years of Desoto Parish, to build a hospital that they can have that will be sustainable,” he said.
The supplemental payments, for example, help pay to provide mental health services at three outpatient clinics. “If that $4 million went away, we would have to limit services — it’s just that simple,” he said.

Recent lawsuits in Arizona, Tennessee and Texas have attempted to slow voter-passed projects.
In Nashville, Tennessee, voters passed a $3.1 billion referendum in November to raise the city sales tax half a cent and fund expanded bus service, pedestrian improvements and 54 miles of “all-access” transit corridors. But a Tennessee court, while upholding most of the project, ruled last week that the city could not use the funds raised to purchase land for affordable housing or parks.
The ruling affects only 1% of the total revenue, the court said. But it was a signal that even well-funded, voter-backed transit efforts are vulnerable to some legal roadblocks.
After voters in Maricopa County, Arizona, last year approved an extension of a half-cent sales tax for transportation, the county GOP sued to try to invalidate the results, arguing the vote didn’t meet a 60% supermajority.
In Austin, Texas, a 2024 class-action lawsuit attempted to block the city from collecting property taxes unless it excludes a tax approved by voters in 2020 to fund Project Connect — a major transit expansion. But a judge dismissed the lawsuit late last year.
Public support for expanded transit is surging across the United States. In 2024 alone, voters approved 46 of 53 transit-related ballot measures, unlocking over $25 billion in new funding for transit projects and improvements, according to the American Public Transportation Association.
But despite support at the ballot box, cities often face legal, zoning and political barriers.
Nashville, in particular, is becoming a case study in both momentum and resistance to transit investment and development, according to researchers at the Urban Institute.
“There’s been a sea change,” said Gabe Samuels, a research analyst in the Housing and Communities Division at the Urban Institute. “Nashville had two failed transit referenda in the past decade. This time, it passed decisively. Voters want alternatives to sprawl and traffic.”
But transit-oriented development — the strategy of clustering housing and businesses near high-quality transit — is often hindered by outdated zoning, Samuels and colleague Yonah Freemark told Stateline.
According to an Urban Institute study, more than 90% of Nashville’s residential land is zoned for single- or two-family homes, a pattern common in Southern and Midwestern cities. That zoning limits the density needed to support high transit ridership, the report said. Currently, only 13% of Nashville’s housing lies within a quarter-mile, what the report calls easy walking distance, of its planned transit corridors.
“You’re investing millions — sometimes billions — into transit systems,” said Freemark. “If you’re not thinking about land use and density alongside that, you’re wasting the opportunity.”
