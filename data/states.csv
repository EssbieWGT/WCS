(Courtesy of the Library of Congress)Montanans are still liable for damages they cause during a duel, at least as far as the state’s archaic legal code goes.
Of course, the actual act of standing at 10 paces and killing someone, even if mutually consensual, remains a criminal offense.
But the Montana Senate on Friday voted down a bill that sought to remove a statute requiring an individual to “provide for the maintenance of the spouse and minor children” of their opponent, and pay all of their debts.
House Bill 247, brought by Rep. Braxton Mitchell, R-Columbia Falls, was billed as a simple code cleanup bill requested by the lieutenant governor’s office. 
In the first hearing on the legislation in January, Lt. Gov. Kristen Juras said that due to the illegality of killing another individual, the 1895 statute needed to be removed because “it implies that dueling is legal. It is not.”
The bill passed the House, 84-16.
But the Senate had a different view, with several senators taking great pleasure in the idea of keeping hypothetical duels in Montana statute. 
“Dueling is not specifically illegal in Montana. It’s against public policy because it’s against public policy to kill people,” Sen Andrea Olsen, D-Missoula, said on the Senate Floor. “…I do think if you’re willing to kill somebody over an issue, you should be willing to die over it. And I even think it’s a great thing if you’re willing to compensate the family for the damages you’ve caused. That’s what this statue is, it’s the remedies for dueling.”
Olsen said that the only reason given in committee for removing the statute was that it was considered “code clutter.”
“This is at least code clutter that brings a smile to everybody’s face. It actually hearkens back to the past in a way that is very interesting,” she had said during committee. 
Sen. Daniel Zolnikov, R-Billings, said the statute was one that gave him peace of mind. 
Laying out a scenario where in order to defend his honor, he challenged Sen. Greg Hertz, R-Polson, to a duel, Zolnikov said he would likely lose that fight. 
But, “he’s now responsible for making sure my child and spouse are taken care of. And I like that in law,” Zolnikov said. 
Hertz said it would “be my honor,” to take care of the remaining Zolnikovs, if he won such a duel.
Before the Senate voted down the bill, 16-34, Sen. John Fuller, R-Kalispell, reminded his colleagues that anybody challenged in a duel has the right to designate the weapons and conditions of the face-off. 
“I suggest they do as Abraham Lincoln did,” Fuller said. “Cow pies at 10 paces.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Duel-etching.jpg,,,2025-04-29 18:11:29.530364

Chad Caldwell, R-Enid, listens during the governor's State of the State Address in the House chamber of the state Capitol on Feb. 3. (Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — House lawmakers overwhelmingly rejected a proposal that would have required schools to add an extra instructional day for every $25 million more the Legislature appropriates to common education.
Supporters of Senate Bill 409 said that having students in the classroom for an extra day would help improve lagging student outcomes by providing additional face-to-face instruction time, and give taxpayers and lawmakers something concrete to show for their extra investment. 
A bipartisan coalition of lawmakers panned the idea, questioning how much benefit an extra instructional day would provide relative to its cost. They also questioned how far a $25 million investment would go amid soaring costs related to maintaining school property, inflation and the growing list of unfunded legislative mandates. 
Rep. Danny Sterling, R-Tecumseh, said requiring schools to add an additional day solely because they received a level of new funding does “nothing but make a mockery of the public education system.” 
He said lawmakers would be wasting taxpayer money on a strategy that has no valid data indicating it will produce benefits.
Rep. Chad Caldwell, R-Enid, the House author of the measure, said lawmakers in the past four years have put more money into Oklahoma schools than ever before, but outcomes have not kept up. In fact, he said, they’ve gotten worse.
He said he hopes something like this will reverse the trend.
“If our teachers spending more time in front of our students isn’t helpful, isn’t impactful for the outcomes in their education, then man, we’ve got to have some other conversations because something must be wrong with the system somewhere,” he said.
Caldwell said most data will show that probably the single greatest determining factor in a child’s education is a quality teacher.
“So it just stands to my simple brain that if we give that teacher another day or two or five or 10, that’s going to be better for the child,” he said. “And when the senator, (Adam Pugh, R-Edmond), asked me to run this bill, I just never thought that I’m going to have to really fight to say teachers in front of our kids for an additional day that that’s actually a good thing. I felt like that was pretty universal.”
He said one extra day isn’t going to “drastically change the trajectory” of poor academic outcomes, but maybe it will get the state a step closer.
“We get asked every single year to invest more money in our schools, simply just giving it there and hoping that we get something out of it hasn’t seemed to be working,” he said.
Caldwell said taxpayers have a right to expect a return on their investment.
Rep. Forrest Bennett, D-Oklahoma City, said the concern is that one extra day isn’t going to move the needle and spending legislative time fighting over adding a single day is distracting from bigger priorities.
“We could be spending today on curriculum,” he said. “We could be spending today on reining in the state superintendent, but we’re instead spending it on this one piece of legislation that might add an extra day and cost extra money.
Rep. Andy Fugate, D-Oklahoma City, said he’s concerned about the impact of inflation and the growth of expenses on schools. He said property and casualty insurance is increasing in cost. Student enrollment is growing as are the number of programs and tests lawmakers are asking districts to implement.
“What does this bill do about those kinds of increases in expenses that might eat up to $25 million?” he asked.
House lawmakers voted 22-63 to reject the bill.

According to the state's top education official, some Mass. schools have reported ""extended absences"" for students as a result of the Trump administration's aggressive immigration enforcement.
The post Tutwiler: Immigration chill leading to “extended absences” appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","SOME MASSACHUSETTS schools have reported “extended absences” for students as a result of the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement, according to the state’s top education official.Education Secretary Patrick Tutwiler on Tuesday devoted a portion of his regular report to the state Board of Elementary and Secondary Education to recent clashes between Massachusetts elected officials and the federal government, including on K-12 school funding.Although he did not offer specific data about a rise in students missing school, Tutwiler said some areas have seen a rise in absences amid reported concerns about immigration crackdowns.“Federal actions around immigration are also a concern for many of our school communities, in some cases, resulting in extended absences for students,” he said. “We are working with the attorney general’s office and the state Office for Refugees and Immigrants to keep districts updated on policy changes that can impact immigrant status.”Some districts, like Lynn, reported significant increases in student absences early in President Donald Trump’s second term, according to CBS News. Sen. Brendan Crighton of Lynn spoke Monday about a Lynn high school student who was detained by federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement and moved to Maine in January. Though the student was released, Crighton said fear of a similar situation exists throughout the city’s schools.Tutwiler also recounted the Trump administration’s move to rescind $106 million in federal funding from K-12 schools in Massachusetts, which Attorney General Andrea Campbell challenged in a lawsuit alongside more than a dozen other states.Campbell joined another case last week over the U.S. Department of Education’s threat to withhold dollars from state and local agencies over diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in schools.“We continue to push back against harmful federal funding cuts and policy changes that threaten the stability of our local school districts and well-being of our students and educators and here in Massachusetts,” Tutwiler said. “We’ve said this before: We’ll stay true to our department’s educational vision of all students being known, valued and having the support that they need to succeed.”The post Tutwiler: Immigration chill leading to “extended absences” appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Tutwiler.webp?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-29 18:11:29.530364

Five of the chamber’s 13 Republicans voted against the measure, which had support from all Democratic and Progressive members.

Becca White, D-Windsor, right, on Tuesday, April 15. Photo by Shaun Robinson/VTDiggerMONTPELIER — The Vermont Senate voted Tuesday to condemn “the manner and circumstances” of the arrest of Mohsen Mahdawi, a Palestinian activist and yearslong Upper Valley resident, by federal immigration agents in Colchester earlier this month.   Senators advanced a resolution about Mahdawi’s arrest on a 24-5 vote, with the “nays” all coming from among the chamber’s 13 Republicans. The measure, S.R.13, also called for Mahdawi — who’s been detained for more than two weeks at Northwest State Correctional Facility in St. Albans Town — to be “immediately released” as his case proceeds in federal court, adding that he also should “be afforded due process.”The vote comes a day before a hearing is scheduled in Mahdawi’s case when a judge in Burlington could rule on whether the federal government must release him. The Senate resolution is slated for a final vote Wednesday, and is expected to pass. Its lead sponsor, Windsor County Democratic Sen. Becca White, was with Mahdawi in Colchester shortly before he was arrested by masked, armed agents at an appointment for U.S. citizenship.“This is an issue about which the Vermont Senate has a direct tie,” said the chamber’s President Pro Tempore, Phil Baruth, D/P-Chittenden Central, on the floor. “We have a witness,” Baruth continued, who “has helped us to see the urgency of this moment.” The Vermont House approved a similar statement criticizing Mahdawi’s detention last week. That measure, H.R.8, passed on a voice vote, so individual members’ decisions aren’t on the record — though a number of “nays” were audible around the chamber.Attorneys for the Columbia University student, who is a lawful U.S. resident, argued last week in court that the federal government illegally targeted him for his pro-Palestinian speech at campus protests and that he shouldn’t have been detained. President Donald Trump’s administration, meanwhile, has said that Mahdawi should be removed from the country because his presence “would have serious adverse foreign policy consequences and would compromise a compelling U.S. foreign policy interest,” according to court filings.READ MORE

Several Vermont senators who voted against the resolution Tuesday made remarks on the floor opposing it. Sen. David Weeks, R-Rutland, said he had spoken with a “law enforcement specialist” who reviewed the details of Mahdawi’s arrest, and Weeks thinks that, while “absolutely unusual,” it was “in keeping with law enforcement procedures.”Baruth responded on the floor that while he understood there are situations where police operate with anonymity, he thinks Mahdawi’s detention deserves to be called out because it’s part of a larger pattern of similar arrests of students in recent weeks.Sen. Russ Ingalls, R-Essex, then told his colleagues he did not “think that there was much to talk about” regarding whether Mahdawi’s arrest was carried out lawfully, considering also, he said, “the amount of illegal immigration that was perpetrated by the previous administration,” referring to former President Joe Biden.In addition to Ingalls and Weeks, Sen. Terry Williams, also a Rutland Republican; Sen. Steve Heffernan, R-Addison; and Sen. Robert Norris, R-Franklin, voted against the measure. Sen. Larry Hart, R-Orange, wasn’t on the Senate floor for the vote.During Mahdawi’s appointment earlier this month, which was at the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services office in Colchester, the student affirmed his commitment to “defend the Constitution and laws of the United States of America against all enemies, foreign, and domestic,” according to court filings submitted by his attorneys.But afterward, an immigration official told Mahdawi he needed to “‘check’ on some information,” and “ICE agents, masked and visibly armed, entered the interview room and shackled” Mahdawi, court filings state.The federal officers ushered Mahdawi into a vehicle and attempted to get him on a plane en route to Louisiana, his lawyers have said. But Mahdawi’s attorneys quickly filed a lawsuit, and a judge issued a temporary order to keep him in Vermont.Mahdawi, who grew up in a refugee camp in the occupied West Bank, told NPR in an interview the outlet published Tuesday that he arrived at the appointment thinking it would be his final step to becoming a citizen after spending 10 years in the U.S.“I am centered internally. I am at peace,” he told the outlet, speaking at the prison in St. Albans Town. “While I still know deeply that this is a level of injustice that I am facing, I have faith. I have faith that justice will prevail.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont Senate votes to condemn Mohsen Mahdawi’s arrest by immigration agents.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/baruth-hinsdale-white-senate-immigration-ICE-MOU-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-29 18:11:29.530364

(Courtesy of the Utah Senate)Utah state leaders are taking the next steps in their efforts to make Utah a major nuclear energy development hub and a “national leader” in developing next-generation energy technology, reaching beyond state lines to do it.
It starts with Utah signing two memorandums of understanding with Idaho and Wyoming as part of a strategy to fire up innovation and collaboration in the region.
As part of Gov. Spencer Cox’s “Built Here: Nuclear Energy Summit,” which his office said brought together leaders from across the nuclear energy industry on Tuesday, Cox joined Idaho Gov. Brad Little and Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon in signing an MOU that calls for the three states to work together coordinating nuclear infrastructure, accelerating nuclear development, and advocating for “commonsense federal policies.”
“The West will lead the next chapter of energy abundance and American prosperity,” Cox said in a statement announcing the alliance. “Today, we brought together industry leaders, investors, and policymakers to chart the course for nuclear energy. Our new compact strengthens our shared commitment to aggressively pursue more affordable, reliable energy across state lines.”
According to Cox’s office, the states agreed in the MOU to collaborate on:

Aligning energy policies to support innovation and private investment.
Coordinating the development of critical energy infrastructure.
Jointly navigating regulatory and environmental challenges.
Advocating for federal support of regional energy priorities.
Enhancing energy resilience and grid reliability.
Expanding workforce development efforts to support the growing energy sector.
Ensuring continued delivery of affordable energy to residents. 

The tri-state agreement comes the day after Utah officials and the Idaho National Laboratory — one of 17 national labs in the U.S. Department of Energy complex that’s focused on nuclear research — signed a memorandum of understanding Monday evening after ceremoniously signing a slate of energy bills Utah lawmakers passed earlier this year. 
The MOU between Utah leaders and the Idaho National Laboratory establishes a “formal, long-term collaboration on advanced energy research, workforce development and technology deployment — particularly on nuclear innovation,” according to the governor’s office. 
“This partnership will accelerate Utah’s efforts to become the nation’s nuclear hub,” Gov. Spencer Cox said in a prepared statement issued Monday evening. “By linking our universities, labs, and industry partners with the expertise of Idaho National Laboratory, we are strengthening our ability to serve Utahns with reliable and affordable energy.”
Idaho National Laboratory Director John Wagner, who signed the MOU, said he and other lab officials are “excited to partner with Utah to address urgent energy needs by focusing on advanced nuclear and energy innovation.” 
Glowing pains: Developing nuclear power could cost Utah tens of billions

“This partnership establishes a cooperative framework for scientific, technological and workforce development to help Utah realize an abundant, secure, resilient and competitive energy future,” he said. 
The MOU, according to the governor’s office, creates a “structural, interdisciplinary alliance” between Utah and the Idaho National Laboratory. It envisions Utah as establishing a new institute called the Advanced Nuclear Energy Institute as a “key coordinating hub” between the Idaho National Laboratory, Utah’s system of higher education, the Utah Office of Energy Development, and the Utah San Rafael Energy Lab. 
“By linking the capabilities of INL with the talent and resources of Utah’s higher education institutions, this partnership positions Utah as a national leader in developing the next generation of clean, secure and resilient energy technologies,” the governor’s office said in Monday’s news release. 
This new institute, state officials say, will enable Utah’s universities to collaborate with other organizations to pursue federal research grants. 
“Beyond academic research, the focus is on applied innovation — ensuring resources are used effectively to develop commercially viable, scalable technologies,” the governor’s office said. “This approach will accelerate the deployment of real-world energy solutions and help build a broader, more robust nuclear energy ecosystem in Utah and the surrounding region.”
With more local input, Legislature signs on to the beginning of Utah’s nuclear future

Through the MOU, state leaders say Utah and the Idaho National Laboratory will work together to: 

Accelerate development of “next-generation” nuclear technologies.
Enhance scientific research in energy sectors.
Strengthen cybersecurity and physical security for energy infrastructure.
Build up the workforce needed to meet demands of a future energy economy.

The Utah Legislature’s top Republican leaders both applauded the move as crucial for Utah’s future. 
“Affordable, reliable energy is the driving force behind Utah’s prosperity — powering everything from the lights in Utahns homes to the unstoppable growth of the state’s vibrant economy,” Senate President Stuart Adams, R-Layton, said in a prepared statement. “As energy demands increase and technologies rapidly evolve, we as a state are committed to staying ahead of the curve through strategic partnership that ensures both innovation and stability.”
House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper, said Utah “is leading the way with smart, strategic investments in our energy future.” 
“This partnership drives innovation and keeps energy reliable and affordable for Utah families and businesses,” Schultz said. “It’s about long-term solutions that protect our economy and strengthen our position as a national energy leader.”

According to the complaint, “at the behest of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency,” AmeriCorps leadership placed all members serving in the National Civilian Community Corps on leave and told them their participation in the program would end on April 30; placed 85% of its staff on administrative leave and subsequently sent them reduction in force notices. Leadership then began notifying State Service Commissions, which distribute AmeriCorps grants, that $400 million worth of AmeriCorps programs were immediately terminated.
“AmeriCorps is a vital public service program in our country, and its sudden dismantling is not only reckless—it’s unlawful,” Torrez said in a statement. “Here in New Mexico, these cuts will hurt students, families, and underserved communities who rely on AmeriCorps-supported programs for education, housing, and critical community services. I’m proud to stand with my colleagues to defend this agency and protect the federal commitment to service, equity, and local resilience.”
According to a news release, New Mexico on April 25 received notice from the federal government of termination of its AmeriCorps grant programs, which support volunteer and service effort. The more than $2 million in AmeriCorps grants will impact a variety of programs in Albuquerque, Santa Fe, Las Vegas, Taos and Ruidoso, as well as programs serving rural, tribal and underserved populations across the state. The funding went to programs that include: “culturally responsive education, after-school and youth mentoring programs, special education services, teacher preparation, environmental conservation, and housing and support for at-risk and homeless youth.”
U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), described as the first AmeriCorps member to serve in the U.S. Senate, said in a statement that AmeriCorps participants “do critical work in New Mexico, connecting veterans to services, helping fight the opioid epidemic, helping older adults age with dignity, and rebuilding communities after disasters. I will not stand idly by as Donald Trump, Elon Musk, and DOGE dismantle these programs in order to line the pockets of billionaires.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/20240716-182348-0aa-Attorney-General-Raul-Torrez-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-29 18:11:29.530364

(Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)The head of Maine’s child welfare agency shared a small but significant milestone with lawmakers on Tuesday: Over April school vacation last week, no child in state custody stayed in hotels or hospital emergency departments.
“I’m hopeful we are seeing some baby steps toward less children and less time being spent in hotels,” said Bobbi Johnson, director of the Office of Child and Family Services, told members of the Health and Human Services Committee during a briefing Tuesday.
Children in custody are placed in hotels and hospitals for a variety of reasons, including if the department is unable to place them with a resource family. The practice puts a significant strain on children and frontline workers, who have to work additional hours to supervise them in those settings.
Although the school vacation week was a bright spot, there were four children back in hotels or emergency departments as of Monday, Johnson said. 
As the agency continues to implement policy changes and recommendations to improve the system that was under scrutiny by the legislative watchdog last session, Johnson updated lawmakers on staff vacancies, another ongoing challenge for the department, in particular in the Lewiston office.
Two of the children back in hotels are based in the agency’s Lewiston district, which has seen particular difficulty with staff retention recently, Johnson said. 
Of the 56 caseworker vacancies across the state, 27 of them are in the Lewiston office, Johnson said. She noted that children in this district have been staying in those alternative settings for extended periods of time, putting even more strain on the limited staff.
As of March, the agency had almost 200 people approved to be “community sitters,” who are able to supervise the children at hotels and emergency departments in place of caseworkers. Johnson said those individuals covered more than 1,500 shifts last year for a total of 6,275 hours. Comparatively, OCFS staff covered more than 6,200 shifts totaling nearly 25,000 hours. 
Staff have told the agency that the workload and overtime required to supervise children in those settings are the biggest factors in the high turnover in the Lewiston district. While vacancies in that district had gone down, Johnson said they are trending up again. She attributed this to a variety of factors, but noted that the district has the highest number of kids in care. 
Since the Lewiston district covers a large geographic area in central Maine, Johnson said the agency is opening an office in the Farmington area with the hope of attracting new case worker candidates. Those positions have been posted, she said. 
Johnson also said the agency has been meeting with resource parents and other stakeholders about short-term homes and other potential supports for the children who would otherwise be housed in alternative settings. She described the first meeting, which was held in the Downeast region, as hopeful and optimistic. The next meeting is scheduled to take place in the Lewiston district. 
Johnson also said the agency is working on a strategic plan to incorporate the suggestions from the lawmakers with state and federal goals that is expected to be complete in the coming months. 
During the presentation, lawmakers also raised the issue of potential cuts in the next federal budget impacting Maine’s child welfare agency.
Rep. Michele Meyer (D-Eliot), who co-chairs the committee, said the potential for “deeply devastating” funding cuts from the federal government to social safety net programs and domestic violence resource centers weighs heavily on her. She said such reductions could have real impacts on the safety and wellbeing of children in Maine. 
Johnson said she’s communicated with the Maine Child Welfare Action Network about how to collaborate and be proactive if those cuts come to fruition.

Darrin Camilleri (D-Trenton) speaks at the Michigan Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on PreK-12. April 29, 2025 | ScreenshotMichigan Senate Democrats put forward a more than $1 billion funding increase for the state’s public schools Tuesday, with an emphasis on lowering elementary schools’ class sizes.
The plan, introduced by state Sen. Darrin Camilleri , would raise per-pupil funding by $400, from $9,608 to $10,008, with districts required to use 50% of that increase to boost teacher pay. It would also include $2.5 billion in investments for student mental health, a continuation of the program providing free breakfast and lunch for every Michigan public school student, and upgrades for school building infrastructure, including “clean and functional” HVAC systems. 
Camilleri, a former teacher and chair of the Senate PreK-12 Appropriations Subcommittee, said the budget proposal reflects their responsibility to provide students with a safe and supportive high-quality education.
“By investing in mental health resources, modernizing our school facilities, and helping students focus in school through free school meals, we are setting up every child for success. We’re also making critical investments to ensure teachers are paid fairly and classrooms remain small, so that every student gets the attention and support they need to thrive,” Camilleri (D-Trenton) said in a press release.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The plan would increase the School Aid Fund budget by 5%, from the nearly $20.8 billion in Fiscal Year 2025, which ends on Sept. 30, to just over $21.8 billion for the FY26 budget. 
Among the new provisions is $400 million for districts to reduce class sizes in kindergarten through third grade classrooms, which would be paired with a $65 million competitive grant program to do the same.
The budget proposal passed the appropriations subcommittee Tuesday on a party-line 6-1 vote, with majority Democrats in favor. The lone no vote was from the only Republican present, Sen. Thomas Albert who asked why $232 million in incentives for implementation of best practices at low performing schools that had been proposed by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in her executive budget recommendation was missing from this plan.
“I actually took that as a positive step to trying to right some of the ways we’ve been approaching education in the state,” Albert (R-Lowell) said.
Camilleri said Democrats remained open to that in budget negotiations, but they believe there is a greater priority for those funds to assist at-risk students.
“We know that many of these school districts that do need additional supports, they need it because they’re dealing with high concentrations of poverty for their student population,” Camilleri responded. “And so investing an additional $258 million in those programs gives school districts the flexibility that they need to lower class sizes, to pay teachers better, and to hopefully invest in those interventions with at-risk funding that we do think can fix some of these systemic educational challenges that our kids face.”
That focus was cheered by Peter Spadafore, executive director of the Michigan Alliance for Student Opportunity, which called the Senate education budget proposal a “significant step forward” in serving at-risk students.
“We are especially encouraged by the proposed 25% increase in the Opportunity Index, which would direct an additional $250 million to schools serving students with the greatest needs. Building upon previous investments, this targeted support will help ensure more equitable opportunities for students across Michigan,” Spadafore said.
The Senate education budget plan sets up a confrontation with the GOP-controlled state House, which has proposed a road funding plan removing the 6% sales tax on gas and instead increasing the motor fuel tax by 20 cents which would be wholly dedicated to funding road upkeep. Currently the motor fuel tax is 31 cents per gallon.
Because more than $700 million a year derived from the gas sales tax goes to the School Aid Fund, House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) proposed to replace that lost revenue from the state’s general fund, an idea House Minority Leader Rep. Ranjeev Puri (D-Canton) likened to “robbing Peter to pay Paul.”
While Democrats hope to have a state budget plan for schools in place by July 1, which is the start of the fiscal year for most school districts, House Republicans have already passed a $20 billion stopgap spending plan to maintain government services in the event of a government shutdown. That would occur if a state budget is not in place by Oct. 1, the start of the state’s fiscal year.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-29-173224-1024x509.png,,,2025-04-29 18:11:29.530364

This story was originally reported by Grace Panetta of The 19th.  Meet Grace and read more of her reporting on gender, politics and policy.
Democrats are slamming policy proposals the Trump administration is reportedly considering that aim to raise birth rates in the United States and encourage women to have children, arguing they should instead enact paid leave and expand the current child tax credit to better support mothers and families.
The debates over family policy come as congressional Republicans hammer out a tax and spending cut bill that could significantly reduce funding for policies and programs focused on supporting women and families.
On Tuesday, the House Democratic Women’s Caucus sent a letter to Trump, shared first with The 19th, expressing their “outrage” that the White House is weighing policy proposals to raise birth rates while implementing sweeping cuts to federal employees and programs that focus on researching fertility and maternal health.
“We write not only as lawmakers, but also as women and mothers who have lived these struggles,” said the letter, signed by Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández of New Mexico, the caucus’ chair, and 38 other House Democratic women lawmakers.
“Many of us have raised children while working full-time, struggled to find and afford child care, navigated high-risk pregnancies, and fought for paid leave and affordable health care,” the letter said. “If you are serious about supporting women and families, we urge you to rescind these proposals and invest in policies that actually meet the needs of women and working families.”
The New York Times reported last week that White House aides have fielded proposals aimed at increasing birth rates and encouraging women to have children. They’ve included reserving a portion of government-sponsored academic scholarships like the Fulbright, which is already selective, for married people and parents; giving a $5,000 “baby bonus” to new mothers; and allocating more government funding for menstrual cycle education and classes. In their letter, the Democratic Women’s Caucus members said “the reported proposals are not only ineffective and out of step with reality, but they also fail to seriously address the challenges of motherhood.”
Social conservatives and Trump have been engaged in a long-standing, if transactional, alliance to limit abortion and promote an ideal of a heterosexual nuclear family. In Trump’s first campaign for the presidency, he promised to appoint justices to the Supreme Court who would vote to end a federal right to abortion.
After the Supreme Court overturned the Roe v. Wade decision in 2022, ending federal abortion rights and sending decisions about it to the states, social conservative activists have turned their focus to limiting the availability of medication abortion and increasing birth rates.
Trump has called himself “the fertilization president” and pledged to make in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment more affordable on the campaign trail, despite some anti-abortion groups’ opposition to IVF. So-called pronatalists, who believe that falling birth rates pose an existential threat to American society, have gotten the ear of the White House. One of the most visible pronatalists is billionaire Elon Musk, the world’s richest person and someone who has fathered over a dozen children and is also a prominent Trump ally.
Trump has told reporters that he thought the baby bonus, which would have to be funded by an act of Congress, was “a good idea.” But Democrats and family policy advocates have panned the proposal as insufficient to support families given the high costs of raising a child.
Republicans also generally oppose increasing spending on social programs. The United States remains one of the only wealthy nations without universal paid leave, and many parents struggle to afford child care. Republicans’ sprawling tax and spending cut agenda could bring cuts to programs including Medicaid, federal food assistance and Head Start, which provides early education services to low-income children. It’s unclear whether the bill will permanently increase the current child tax credit, which was temporarily expanded during the pandemic and has bipartisan support.
“It is estimated parents spend over $20,000 in the first year of a baby’s life,” the letter said. “A $5,000 baby bonus could help families—but mothers deserve support to care for their families, not pressure to grow them.”
Prominent pronatalist advocates Simone and Malcolm Collins have also pitched the White House on bestowing a “National Medal of Motherhood” to women who have six or more children, The Times reported, drawing comparisons to similar medals given out to mothers of multiple children in Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia under Joseph Stalin. The Democratic Women’s Caucus letter charged that the idea “is taken directly out of the playbook of authoritarian regimes designed to control women and restrict how families live — it’s appalling.”
Instead, Democratic women said, the Trump administration should support establishing paid leave, making child care more affordable, investing in women’s health research and expanding the child tax credit.
“We are committed to building a country where every woman and every family has the freedom —and the resources—to decide if, when, and how to grow their family,” the letter said. “Women are not mere vessels for childbirth as contemplated in The Handmaid’s Tale.”

Karla Rose Hanson, D-Fargo. (Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota officials on Tuesday described new legislation as improving “off-ramps” from the criminal justice system, with one of the off-ramps coming before offenders get into the court system. 
“We know that people who get into the criminal justice system tend to stay there,” said Tom Erhardt, director for parole and probation within the North Dakota Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. He said by improving the off-ramps, it will reduce the number of crime victims, reduce the number of repeat offenders and save the state money. 
North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong on Tuesday had a signing ceremony for three criminal justice reform bills, trying to keep people out of the court system, making it easier for them to comply with probation and helping former inmates integrate into society.  
The bills were based in part on a study conducted after the 2023 legislative session and a collaboration with the corrections department and the Department of Health and Human Services.

(Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor)
“Given the volume of support from prosecutors, public safety officers, community partners and several state agencies throughout the legislative process, it’s clear that these policies move our criminal justice system in the right direction,” said Rep. Lawrence Klemin, R-Bismarck, the sponsor of the three bills. 
Erhardt said he thinks House Bill 1425, which focuses on diversion and deflection, has the potential to be the most impactful. 
It provides $1 million for a pilot program in three counties to be selected by the corrections department. The county state’s attorney would be able to develop a program focused on keeping people out of jail, using tools such as mental health and substance abuse services. Law enforcement could be part of the deflection process. 
The counties will report back on the pilot program before the start of the 2027 legislative session. 
The bill includes $750,000 through the Department of Health and Human Services for mental health services. 
“We have crisis centers around the state, through our human service centers, where someone can come in and get withdrawal management or detox or get assessed for mental health, they may never have to go to the jail,” said Pam Sagness, executive director of the behavioral health division of HHS. 
House Bill 1417 would eliminate fees for people on supervised release. Not paying those fees can lead to a return to jail. The fees are also seen as a burden for low-income people. 
The corrections department bills about $6 million in supervision fees per biennium with a collection rate of around 25% or $1.5 million.  
Legislative Management may also do a study of court fines and fees before the next legislative session. 
Trio of bills addresses justice reform, crowded North Dakota jails 

The third bill, House Bill 1549, would create a grant program for local jails for programs that help people adjust after being released from jail, referred to as reentry. 
“Most jails don’t have anything set up for reentry,” Colby Braun, director of the North Dakota Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, said after the ceremony. “When you’re done, the clothes you came in with, that’s pretty much what you leave with.” 
The corrections department would assist with getting a driver’s license or identification card and getting Medicaid or other assistance through the Department of Health and Human Services. 
The grants from the corrections department would help local jails set up a reentry program.
“So this is really focusing on those local jails to say, ‘Hey, if you guys want to build something up, we’ve got some dollars,’” Braun said. 
The bill also creates a task force to study housing issues for people leaving jail and a possible study of criminal record sealing and expungement. 
The diversion and deflection bill will take effect July 1; the other bills will take effect Aug. 1.

Traci Koster on the House floor on April 29, 2025.The Florida Legislature is sending Gov. Ron DeSantis a bill that would remove the barrier that has kept dozens of wrongfully incarcerated people from receiving the financial compensation that they were entitled to over the past two decades.
That’s because, after several unsuccessful attempts, the House on Tuesday unanimously passed a measure (SB 130) amending a 2008 state law that was designed to provide financial compensation for individuals wrongfully convicted of a crime. The measure previously passed unanimously in the Senate as well.
That 2008 legislation called for eligible exonerees to receive $50,000 for each year they were wrongfully incarcerated, capped at $2 million. However, since its passage, only a handful of exonerees have actually received such compensation, due to a “clean hands” provision barring compensation for people with earlier, unrelated, felonies — the only such restriction of its type in the country.
“Since almost 20 years ago enacting our wrongful incarceration compensation statute, we have 19 exonerees in our state who have lost over 306 years of their freedom, because we as the state of Florida put them in prison,” said Tampa Bay Republican Rep. Traci Koster, who has sponsored this same bill ever since she was elected to the House in 2020.
Koster’s bill (sponsored in the Senate by Northeast Florida Republican Jennifer Bradley) would remove that clean-hands provision. It would extend the filing deadline for those who have been exonerated from 90 days to two years, and allow a wrongfully incarcerated person both to bring a civil lawsuit and file for compensation under the 2008 law.
However, a claimant would have to repay the state if he or she receives monetary awards both through a compensation claim and a civil lawsuit.
In presenting the bill, Koster said she believes  Florida had one of the strongest criminal justice systems “in the world.”
“But just because we have one of the best systems in the world, doesn’t mean it’s perfect,” she added. “And even the best sometimes don’t get it right.”
In making a moral case for the legislation, Volusia County Republican Webster Barnaby cited the case of Joseph in the Bible and former South African President Nelson Mandela as individuals wrongfully incarcerated.
“There are people are wrongfully incarcerated,” he said. “And it’s our job as legislators to be truthful for those poor victims, because that’s what they are, victims, who were wrongfully incarcerated. It’s important for us to see people as people.”
“I’ve been here seven years and I’ve watched people come trying to get compensation, and it’s been a very, very difficult task,” said Tampa Democratic Rep. Dianne Hart. “When we incarcerate somebody for 35 or 40 years of their life, there is no compensation that can compensate for the time that they have spent for being incarcerated.”
91 people
Since 1989, 91 people in Florida have been exonerated or released from incarceration as a result of post-conviction DNA testing, according to the National Registry of Exonerations. That includes Robert DuBoise, who served 37 years on rape and murder charges but was exonerated in 2020 by the Conviction Review Unit of the Hillsborough County State Attorney’s Office after DNA evidence testing excluded him as the perpetrator.
However, the clean-hands provision of state law precluded him from being eligible for compensation because of two nonviolent property felony crimes which resulted in probation when he was a teenager. He ended up suing the city of Tampa in federal court in 2021 and, ultimately, the city council approved a $14 million settlement for him in 2024.

(Courtesy of Courtnie Washington)A state grand jury has decided not to indict the Jersey City police officer who shot and killed a man in psychiatric crisis in 2023, the state Attorney General’s Office announced Tuesday.
Andrew Washington, 52, died on Aug. 27, 2023, after authorities sent police to his home in riot gear who pounded on his door, broke it down after a brief standoff, and then shot him with a gun and Taser when he rushed out the door armed with a knife. Washington’s family had called a mental-health hotline for help.
The police’s response flouted departmental de-escalation protocols and violated Washington’s civil rights, his family said in a wrongful death lawsuit they filed last year.
Grand jurors voted Monday not to criminally charge Officer Stephen Gigante, the “trained negotiator” who fired the fatal shots, after reviewing a 911 call, body-worn camera footage, witness interviews, photographs, ballistics reports, and autopsy results, the Attorney General’s Office said.
Washington had several mental health disabilities, including bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and bouts of psychosis that involved auditory hallucinations, his family said in their lawsuit, which remains ongoing. They called a mental health hotline because they wanted him to go to the hospital, they said.
Responding officers reported that Washington, communicating through his closed door, referred to a “suicide mission” and seeing ghosts, refused to talk with EMTs, and then went silent altogether, spurring supervisors’ decision to breach the door, according to the Attorney General’s Office. When the officers did, Washington ran at them with a 13-inch knife, the office said.
Attorney Amelia Green, who represents Washington’s family, said they were disappointed by the grand jury’s decision. But the decision does not exonerate the officers, Green added.
“We will prove these officers violated Drew’s constitutional rights in multiple ways when they shot and killed him when he was in the midst of a mental health episode,” Green said in a statement. “Drew’s death is the result of ongoing systemic failures by the Jersey City Police Department in its interactions with those with mental health disabilities. The grand jury’s decision only makes the family’s civil rights lawsuit all the more important in holding the Jersey City Police Department accountable for Drew’s death.”
Washington’s slaying came just five months after Paterson police gunned down community activist Najee Seabrooks after a similar standoff in March 2023. That incident drove the state to take over the Paterson police force. A grand jury decided in March not to indict two officers for Seabrooks’ death.
Both deaths and resulting community protests prompted state Attorney General Matt Platkin to amend the statewide use-of-force policy in encounters involving people in mental crisis and expand a statewide program that pairs police with trained mental health professionals to handle such calls.

State Rep. Brandon Guffey has repeatedly called on Congress to pass legislation protecting children online after his 17-year-old son, Gavin Guffey, died by suicide three years ago while being extorted with intimate photos he had shared by direct message on Instagram.
Guffey, R-Rock Hill, recounted the story of his son’s suicide to the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this year during a general discussion about protections for children online. The bill passed the House with a vote of 409-2 on Monday.
SC House passes bill requiring parental consent for social media

Every South Carolina representative in Congress voted for the bill, which will go to President Donald Trump for his signature.
“I think that’s a big first step,” Guffey told the SC Daily Gazette.
The bill, dubbed the TAKE IT DOWN Act, is among several for which Guffey has been advocating. Another federal proposal that would make social media platforms legally responsible for protecting children on their apps and websites from sexual exploitation has yet to get a vote in either chamber.
The passage of the first proposal could lead to others, Guffey said.
“Hopefully it’ll begin that snowball,” Guffey said.
In recent years, the state has put in place some of its own protections for children online. Gavin’s Law, named after Guffey’s son, passed in 2023, banning sexual extortion, also known as “sextortion.”
Several other proposals have advanced but not reached the finish line, including a bill requiring children to get permission from their parents before creating social media profiles that passed the House earlier this year.

(Photo courtesy of Jon Bahr/MilkShake Factory)The number of births in some Western states that are adding new housing rose last year, reversing losses the year before in many cases, according to new federal statistics released Wednesday.
Increases from 2023 to 2024 were highest in Colorado (4.5%), Idaho (3.8%), Utah (3.6%), Washington state and Nebraska (each 2.6%). Births increased around 2% in West Virginia, South Dakota, North Carolina, Montana, Rhode Island and South Carolina.
Almost all those states had decreases in births the previous year, and many have been building housing rapidly since 2023. Idaho, North Carolina and Utah have issued enough building permits in 2023 and 2024 to add about 4% to their housing stock, the highest in the nation.
Melissa Kearney, an economics professor at the University of Maryland who specializes in families and fertility, said there could be a link between homebuilding and more babies.
“It is quite possible that increased access to home ownership, coming from a reduction in the price of houses in places that are building more houses, could meaningfully increase birth rates,” Kearney told Stateline in an e-mail.
Many of the other states with increases in births are also seeing building booms: Colorado, Nebraska, South Carolina, South Dakota and Washington state are all set to add more than 2% to housing stock based on permits issued in 2023 and 2024, according to a Stateline analysis of U.S. Census Bureau Building Permits Survey data.



Building permits can take up to two years to translate into finished houses and apartments, but they indicate which states are most willing to allow new housing that can boost population, tax receipts and the workforce. In Colorado, Denver County is set to add almost 10,000 housing units and in Idaho, Ada County, which includes Boise, could add 11,200 units based on building permits.
Nationally births were slightly higher in 2024 than the year before, by about 1%, according to provisional federal numbers from the National Vital Statistics System within the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The fertility rate also increased slightly, but it remains below the “replacement level” needed to keep the population stable — 2.1 children for each woman over her lifetime.
All the increase nationally was in births to Hispanic and Asian mothers, with births continuing to decline for Black, American Indian and white mothers. Births to teenagers and women ages 20-24, in sharp decline since 2007, continued to drop last year, while births increased for women 25 and older.
The number of births dropped most in states struggling with stagnant population: falling about 4% in Louisiana, 3% in Mississippi, and 2% in New Mexico and New Hampshire. All those states had little or no population growth between mid-2023 and mid-2024, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates.

Free.,U.S. House GOP starts reconciliation work with increase for border security,"Ariana Figueroa, Jennifer Shutt",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-gop-starts-reconciliation-work-increase-border-security,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. House Republicans on Tuesday kicked off their work to build consensus on “one big, beautiful bill,” to fund President Donald Trump 's priorities, including a major funding boost for immigration enforcement and border security. After returning from a two-week recess, House lawmakers started debating and amending the various sections of the bill with markups in the Armed Services, Education and Workforce, and Homeland Security committees.Congressional Republicans are using reconciliation — a special procedure that skirts the Senate’s 60-vote filibuster — to put together one bill to fulfill the White House’s priorities on border security, tax cuts, energy policy and defense.The Homeland panel’s bill, which would increase funding for border security by $70 billion, aligns with Trump’s second-term agenda, which has centered on an immigration crackdown.The Homeland Security portion of the reconciliation package recommends $46.5 billion to construct a barrier along U.S. borders and $5 billion for Customs and Border Protection facilities, including $4.1 billion to hire 3,000 Border Patrol agents and 5,000 CBP officers. It would also set aside $2 billion for retention and signing bonuses for CBP staff.  “It is critical that the Republican majority do what the people elected us to do, approve funds for effective border security and enforcement measures,” House Homeland Security Chairman Mark Green of Tennessee said.The bill also includes $2.7 billion in technology surveillance along U.S. borders and roughly $1 billion for inspection technology at ports of entry. The top Democrat on the committee, Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, said Democrats were unified in their opposition to the proposal. He argued that roughly $70 billion in funding would only aid the Trump administration in its plans of mass deportation and not address border security.“House Republican leadership is putting lipstick on this pig of a reconciliation package by pretending it’s about border security,” Thompson said.Votes on all three committees' bills, and amendments mostly from Democrats raising objections to the package, were expected late Tuesday or after midnight Wednesday. The committees are not expected to adopt any of the Democratic amendments.Summer floor votesSpeaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said Tuesday he expects the House will spend the rest of this week and next week debating the 11 different bills in committee before rolling them all into one reconciliation package.The full House will debate and vote to approve the legislation before Memorial Day, under the current timeline.“I don’t know how long the Senate is going to take to do their piece,” Johnson said. “But I was very encouraged after the meeting yesterday, frankly. Leader (John) Thune and Sen. (Mike) Crapo are on point. The Senate Republicans have been working very hard together.”Thune, of South Dakota, is the Senate majority leader and Crapo, of Idaho, chairs the tax-writing Finance Committee.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said the administration would like the package to clear Congress before the Fourth of July, though Johnson said he “hopes” to finalize a deal before that deadline.Thune said later Tuesday that the reconciliation package’s final look will be decided by what policies have the votes to get through each chamber.“Ultimately, what gets included in a reconciliation bill will be determined by what there are 218 votes for in the House and 51, or 50, votes for in the United States Senate,” Thune said.Democrats object to deportationsDemocrats on the Homeland Security panel introduced amendments to signal their opposition to the administration's deportation agenda.Louisiana Rep. Troy Carter was one of several Democrats to sharply criticize the recent deportation of three U.S. citizen children to Honduras during the Homeland Security Committee’s markup.He noted that one of the children removed with his mother to Honduras, is a 4-year-old battling Stage 4 cancer.“This is not border security,” Carter said. “This is state-sanctioned trauma.Democrats introduced amendments to bar federal funds being used to detain immigrants at a foreign prison, following an agreement between the U.S. and El Salvador to detain more than 300 men in a notorious mega-prison. Experts have raised concerns the agreement could violate a law against funding foreign governments engaged in human rights abuses.“This is not an idle possibility,"" Democratic Rep. Seth Magaziner of Rhode Island said.He pointed out that Trump asked El Salvador’s president Nayib Bukele to consider taking “homegrown” criminals, meaning U.S. citizens.“This is insane,” Magaziner said. “It is outrageous and every American should be terrified by this prospect.”Several other Democrats introduced amendments related to the Trump administration’s use of the prison in El Salvador.Boost for PentagonThe House Armed Services Committee portion of the reconciliation package would bolster defense spending by $150 billion over the next decade.That funding would be divvied up between numerous national security priorities, including $25 billion for Trump’s goal of having a countrywide missile defense system, similar to Israel's Iron Dome.The defense bill would appropriate $34 billion for shipbuilding and the maritime industrial base, $21 billion for munitions purchases, $14 billion for “initiatives to scale production of game changing new technology,” $13 billion for nuclear deterrence and $12 billion to enhance military readiness, according to a GOP summary of that bill. Chairman Mike Rogers, R-Ala., said at the beginning of his committee's markup that the bill would make a “generational investment in our national security.”“It is clear we are no longer deterring our adversaries,” Rogers said. “The threats we face today from China, Russia, Iran and North Korea and others, are much more serious and challenging than we have ever faced before.”Washington Democratic Rep. Adam Smith, ranking member on the panel, said there’s “no question that the Department of Defense has needs and there's also no question that we as a country face threats.”But Smith criticized Republicans for moving the defense funding boost within the massive reconciliation package, which will increase the deficit.“We’re, once again, saying to the American people, ‘This is important but not important enough to actually pay for it.’ So the budget itself is a huge problem,” Smith said. “And you really can’t support the additional $150 billion for defense if you don’t support the overall reconciliation bill because that’s what this is. And the overall reconciliation bill, I firmly believe, is a disaster for this country.”Smith criticized Republicans for proposing additional dollars for the Pentagon while it is run by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who is under investigation for sending information about a bombing campaign in Yemen to a group chat that inadvertently included a journalist and a different group chat that included his wife, brother and others.“They have not even begun to prove that there is a chance in hell that they will spend this money intelligently, efficiently and effectively,” Smith said. “Secretary Hegseth has proven himself to be completely incapable of doing the job of secretary of Defense.”Cuts for Pell grantsThe Education and Workforce Committee’s markup fell along similar partisan lines, with GOP lawmakers lauding the bill and Democrats rejecting Republicans’ plans seeking to overhaul federal spending.Chairman Tim Walberg, R-Mich., said the legislation would cut $330 billion in federal spending over the next decade by reshaping federal student loan programs and Pell grants for low-income students, among several other changes.“Dumping more federal money into a broken system doesn’t mean that system will work,” Walberg said. “In fact, government spending on higher education has reached record highs, yet millions of students benefiting from those funds will ultimately end up with a degree that doesn’t pay off or fail to finish school altogether.”The GOP bill, he said, would “bring much-needed reform in three key areas: simplified loan repayment, streamlined student loan options, and accountability for students and taxpayers.”Walberg scolded former President Joe Biden for not working with Congress to overhaul federal grant and loan programs for higher education, saying the former administration “was determined to keep pouring taxpayer funds into the abyss in a futile attempt to keep up with the unacceptable and unaccountable institutional prices.”Virginia Democratic Rep. Bobby Scott, ranking member, said that Congress should look at ways to make college more affordable through reforms, but said the GOP bill “misses the mark.”“This current reconciliation plan would increase costs for colleges and students. It would limit students access to quality programs, which would then reduce their likelihood of finding a rewarding or successful career,” Scott said. “And then take the so-called savings to pay for more tax cuts for the wealthy and the well-connected.”Republicans “limiting the students' access to Pell grants and federal loans,” he said, could increase the number of people who have to rely on “predatory, private loans” to pay for college.“Put bluntly: The Republican plan will limit how much money middle- and low-income students can borrow from the federal government,” Scott said. “As a result, limiting the federal student aid that students can receive means that millions of students will not be able to access federal assistance that they need to complete their degrees. Moreover, this bill will force student borrowers into unaffordable repayment plans.”",,,,2025-04-29 17:10:12.616239
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-29 20:58:48+00:00,CT Mirror,"After 100 days of Trump, CT Democrats know where they stand",Mark Pazniokas and Lisa Hagen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/29/trump-first-100-days-ct-lawmakers/,CT Democrats say President Trump’s performance is actually worse than his dismal polling reflects. Republicans say it’s too early to judge.,"In Connecticut, Democrats lined up Tuesday to say President Donald J. Trump’s performance actually is worse than his dismal polling reflects, while Republicans say it is too early to judge one of the most consequential starts to a new administration since Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s first 100 days in 1933.
Gov. Ned Lamont contrasted FDR’s efforts to calm a nation rocked by the Great Depression with Trump’s destabilization of a solid economy with a trade war on America’s closest allies, unpredictable shifts on tariffs and the threat of deep federal budget cuts and layoffs.
“People are scared. People are holding back. We’re going the wrong way, driving the economy into a ditch, as opposed to ‘The only thing you have the fear is fear itself.’ You might as well say, ‘If you’re scared today, just wait ’til tomorrow,’” Lamont said.
A new NPR/PBS News/Marist poll found that twice as many people gave Trump a failing grade of F as gave him an A, and a Gallup assessment of first 100 days polling going back to Harry Truman found Trump’s approval rating was 42%. Only Trump’s first-term mark of 41% was lower.
Lamont spoke outside the state Capitol, joined by the Democratic state chair, Roberto Alves, and Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz, Secretary of the State Stephanie Thomas, Comptroller Sean Scanlon, Treasurer Erick Russell and Attorney General William Tong.
Republicans, mindful that Trump has lost badly in Connecticut in each of his three runs for the White House, staged no similar event in Hartford, though the state GOP chair, Ben Proto, and House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, offered varying degrees of praise, or at least calls for patience, when called for comment.
“I start with promises made, promise kept,” Proto said. “That’s one of the biggest problems the Democrats have: They are going to have to start keeping promises.”
In Proto’s view, Trump has accomplished what he promised: controlling the southern border and taking steps to deport migrants in the U.S. without legal status, especially those implicated in crimes.
“I think there is good and bad with President Trump,” Candelora said. “He certainly controlled the border crossing. He is trying to address the immigration crisis, trying to reposition our manufacturing bases in the country with his tariffs. I think it’s too early to say whether he is successful. I think he is taking a path that brings a lot of anxiety.”
Candelora said he was not supportive of the president’s calls for the impeachment of judges who have issued adverse rulings in challenges to executive orders and expressed a wariness about Trump’s withholding federal funding from universities that have displeased him.
But Candelora said he resented the challenges from Democrats for Republicans to stand up to the president, saying they are “gaslighting” Republicans with exaggerated claims of how the initial cuts have impacted federal services or its aid to state governments.
“I have an assessment of the first 100 days of the Connecticut Democrats, and that is they have completely lost their minds, and they wouldn’t know the truth if it hit them in the face,” Candelora said.
Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, held a press conference Tuesday to criticize Lamont for agreeing to a deal that will remove Connecticut State Colleges and Universities Chancellor Terrence Cheng from his leadership post but allow him to collect his base annual salary of $442,187 until his contract expires next year.
Harding offered no assessment of Trump, but he had plenty to say about Lamont tolerating Cheng’s controversial wining and dining expenses. The governor should have pressed the Board of Regents to fire Cheng for cause, he said.
“We’re focusing on the things that we actually can control here in the state,” Harding said. “The governor can do something about this. The governor can turn around and tell the Board of Regents, ‘No, do not offer an extension on this contract. We’re going to fire this individual.’”
Scanlon, the Democratic comptroller whose office audited Cheng at Lamont’s request, said Harding should be able to comment directly on Trump, who is provoking a constitutional crisis with his use of executive powers, even when contradicted by federal law.
“I think it’s important that we talk about that. It’s not apples for apples. Here we are acting on this situation,” Scanlon said of Cheng. “That situation has been dealt with. The governor asked me to do an audit of that gentleman, and that audit, I think, bore out as to why they decided not to re-up his contract with them.”
In Washington, Republicans praised the president.
House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana said he spoke twice with Trump ahead of the president’s big speech Tuesday night in Michigan to celebrate his first 100 days. Johnson argued Republicans’ electoral wins gave them the leverage and authority to reshape parts of the federal government and the ways in which they are trying to address inflation and immigration.
“We got a mandate to do exactly what we’re doing right now. We have not wasted a moment,” Johnson said at the Republican National Committee’s headquarters that sits a few blocks away from the U.S. Capitol.
He acknowledged some of the challenges facing the administration when pressed about the recent drops in Trump’s approval rating. Johnson believes there will be an eventual payoff of Trump’s tit-for-tat tariff policies that have led to market volatility.
“There’s been a little question and concern about the rocky start — some of the stock market, some of the tariff policy and all that,” Johnson said. “But right now, even today, people are beginning to see the dust settle on that. They understand there was a master strategy behind this, and they’re seeing the results.”
While the strategy may be a slower burn, Republicans believe Americans will see the promised results when they hash out and pass their major tax package, which is currently still in the beginning stages. They are promising relief for families and entertaining proposals like no taxes on tips. But they will also need to reckon with not further driving up the deficit and making enough spending cuts that could possibly lead to disruptions in some programs.
Johnson and his leadership team also took some shots at the Democratic Party, which had initially struggled to respond to Trump amid an onslaught of executive orders. Some Democrats, like U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy, have openly criticized the party for not addressing the concerns of working families. Republicans believe they are still operating without a message.
“They don’t have any message. They don’t have any clear leader. They don’t have a clear vision. They don’t know what to do. Their platform has been repudiated, and they’re turning on themselves,” Johnson said, noting that one of the vice chairs of the Democratic National Committee will fund primary challenges against some incumbents in safe blue seats. 
Republicans call it obstruction. Democrats see it as a renewed resistance movement.
And Democrats argue they have now found their footing since Trump took office in January.
U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., sees a big change in the energy over the past 100 days. The mood was “despairing and despondent” at earlier town halls, but he said things feel differently whether it was at his weekend town hall in Middletown or at an event in Michigan.
“People are ready to go on offense. We need to do more than just attack Trump,” Blumenthal said Tuesday from Washington. “What I saw in the town halls and the reaction from people generally is disgust and anger.”
Members of Connecticut’s congressional delegation have held town halls and events over the past few months to hear out constituents. And in other states and districts that aren’t getting facetime with their members, Murphy, who has become one of Democrats’ go-to messengers, has sought to fill in the gaps and hold town halls in red states with his colleagues.
Connecticut, like every other state, has grappled with swift changes coming out of the White House — and the occasional walkback of some policies. Within a week of Trump taking office, his administration planned to pause all federal grants and loans. That was ultimately reversed, though the short-lived policy had a lingering effect and caused delays for some sectors.
Since then, other federal funding streams have started to see cuts or completely disappear, whether for food banks, public health agencies or universities. That has led Tong to join multiple lawsuits looking to block a number of those actions.
Cuts to federal funding mean states like Connecticut will likely need to fill in the gaps if programs and services are at risk.
“Gov. Lamont and the legislature have planned pretty meticulously and budgeted carefully, and now Trump is pulling the rug out from under all the states that have tried to forecast and plan responsibly like Connecticut,” Blumenthal said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_7408-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-04-29 17:10:12.616239

(Photo by Peter Dazeley/Getty Images)Iowa’s public universities and community colleges would see flat funding for the upcoming fiscal year if proposed education appropriation legislation is passed, causing concern for some lawmakers.
Senate Study Bill 1231 would set fiscal year 2026 state funding for the Iowa Department of Education, Iowa Board of Regents and the institutions it governs, Department for the Blind and other individual programs.
Under the bill, general university funding for the University of Iowa would stay at almost $223.5 million, Iowa State University funding would remain at more than $178.4 million and funding for the University of Northern Iowa would remain at almost $101.9 million.
While neither the University of Iowa or Iowa State University requested any general funding increases, the University of Northern Iowa asked for an additional $2.5 million for the upcoming year, which was not reflected in the bill.

Sen. Cindy Winckler, D-Davenport, said Tuesday during a subcommittee meeting on the bill that data from the board of regents shows around 66% of the higher education system budget is driven by tuition, with less than 30% made up of state appropriations.
“I’m very concerned about the level funding for both our community colleges and our regent universities,” Winckler said. “That would mean, as costs are going up for the provision of education, that tuition will go up, and in many cases, that is very difficult for families.”
Public education is incredibly important, she said, and when the Legislature keeps funding flat for state universities and community colleges — especially with national challenges all colleges must weather — the students and families paying to attend them feel the hurt of rising costs.
Funding for community colleges is listed at close to $235.9 million, the same as last year. Katrina Holck, representing Community Colleges for Iowa, said many community colleges are concerned  about the proposed funding as well.
Lobbyists expressed general support for the legislation during the meeting, including proposed funding of $10 million for a health care professional incentive program and more than $2.3 million for the therapeutic classroom incentive fund for school districts.
Representatives of Des Moines University said in the past, the private college and the UI have been allocated funds for a loan program to either keep alumni practicing in Iowa or bring professionals back to the state to work, and expressed their wish to see it continue.
“The loan program has been really helpful for our alumni to stay here and practice or come back and practice in rural areas,” said Joseph Jones, chief of staff in the president’s office at DMU.
Other funds left out of the legislation mentioned by commenters included the Iowa Tuition Grant program, $14 million for paraeducators and other civil work personnel and a $335,000 ask for a dyslexia endorsement tuition reimbursement program.
Subcommittee chair Sen. Jesse Green, R-Boone, said in total, the bill allocates more than $1 billion from the state general fund for fiscal year 2026, an increase of more than $7 million from last year, as well as about $33.7 million from other funds.
Sen. Sandy Salmon, R-Janesville, had no comments but joined Green in signing the legislation forward. It will head to the full Senate Appropriations Committee for further review.
Green praised Gov. Kim Reynolds for urging the Legislature to allocate $1 million to the UI for cancer research, as well as the health care professional incentive program. In speaking with his constituents about actions taken last year to increase starting teacher pay, Green said it has really helped rural teachers and schools, and similar efforts should continue.
“This year, when I have gone out and I’ve talked to the communities, it resonates with a lot of people that we need to maybe expand our rural teacher loan incentives,” Green said. “That’s something that I would like to continue to pursue in the future, for me personally.”

Patrick Morrisey signed a pair of education bills that will ban the use of cellphones in classrooms and require teachers to display “In God We Trust” in schools. 
Students, Republican lawmakers and others joined the governor at Lincoln Middle School in Shinnston, West Virginia, on Tuesday for a bill signing ceremony.
Morrisey prioritized banning cellphones in schools, mentioning it in his State of the State address. It was the only piece of education legislation that the governor requested in his first legislative session.
“I think this is going to make a significant difference for our teachers and students,” Morrisey said. “We know that the use of personal electronic devices in the classroom increases distractions, academic misconduct and bullying and, overall, it creates a negative learning environment.”
Morrisey also mentioned that the bill would help curtail students’ addiction to cellphones that could harm their mental health. 
House Bill 2003, which overwhelmingly passed the House of Delegates and Senate, prohibits students from using a personal electronic device during instructional time. County boards of education are required to create and adopt a policy that includes whether cellphones are permitted on school grounds and what the consequence would be for students who violate the policy. 
If a county board decides that cellphones will be permitted on school property, students may be required to store the devices in containers or pouches provided by the county board, according to the bill. 
  Sen . Jay Taylor, R-Taylor
“The kids throughout the state had influence on this bill and helped work it. That’s incredible,” said Sen. Jay Taylor, R-Taylor. “Don’t take this as, ‘We don’t want you to use cellphones.’ We want you to learn to use them responsibly.”
Morrisey also signed Senate Bill 280, which requires public schools and higher education institutions to display a durable poster or framed copy of the United States motto, “In God We Trust.”
Sen. Mike Azinger, R-Wood, has sponsored the measure for three years.
“First of all I want to give honor to God for this bill. It tells Americans and kids … what our U.S. motto is,” Azinger said. “If America stays with that motto in our hearts and West Virginia stays with that motto in our hearts, we’ll be OK.”
  Sen. Mike Azinger, R-Wood
The display must contain a representation of the United States flag centered under the national motto and cannot have any other words or images.
It didn’t come with funding for schools to purchase the signage, but schools can accept private donations for the now-required display. 
“We have to ensure that we’re teaching kids about the founding principals of our country — a true and accurate retailing of civics and American life and history,” Morrisey said.
Morrisey noted the state’s near-bottom ranking in student academic performance and teacher pay.
“We’re not going to get where we need to be without having every West Virginia child having the ability to access a top-notch education system,” he said.  
Session ends without teacher pay raises
During his State of the State address, Morrisey called for teacher pay raises as West Virginia’s public school teachers are the least paid in the nation. But the governor didn’t request a bill to implement a pay increase. 
A bill sponsored by Sen. Eric Tarr, R-Putnam, sought to implement “locality pay” for teachers. It would have determined their potential raise by the median home prices in their county. The bill failed to make it to the full Senate for consideration.
Morrisey already signed lawmakers’ high-profile education measure that will give elementary teachers more authority to remove disruptive or violent students from their classroom. The measure is in response to West Virginia teachers’ call for help in addressing an uptick in elementary students’ violent and dangerous behavior that has resulted in teacher injuries and learning disruptions. 
The bill also mandates that school mental health professionals assess removed students to see what could be causing the behavior. 
Additionally, Morrisey signed lawmakers’ budget that includes $97 million in funding for the state’s education voucher program, the Hope Scholarship, that has a quickly-accelerating price tag. Lawmakers have already raised concerns about how the state will afford the program next year with its estimated price tag of $300 million. 
Morrisey has until the end of day Wednesday to sign the remaining bills.

The House passed House Resolution 34, which is in support of Montana beef producers, while down the hall, the Senate moved House Resolution 52 forward, which continues the discussion of a checkoff, or marketing and education program, for Treasure State cattle products.
HJ 34 was brought by Rep. Randyn Gregg, R-White Sulphur Springs, while HJ 52 was sponsored by Rep. Eric Tilleman, R-Cascade.
“I moo that this bill do pass,” Gregg said on the House floor.
His wasn’t the only bit of humor, as Rep. Katie Zolnikov, R-Billings, asked Rep. Bob Carter, a Missoula Democrat and a vice chair of the House Agriculture committee, about the bill.
“I just wanted to ask,” Zolnikov said. “Are you ‘mooved’ by this bill?”
The resolution calls for sustainable beef production and encourages state and federal governments “to prioritize policies that ensure fair market conditions,” and remove regulatory burdens.
The resolution also “strongly opposes” lab-grown meat, which the Montana Legislature voted to ban earlier this session with House Bill 401, currently on the governor’s desk.
As of January 2025, there were 1.2 million beef cows in Montana and, additionally, about 1 million calves in the state. Agriculture in Montana is a $6.5 billion industry. 
Tilleman’s bill would study ways to grow that, following up on a somewhat controversial checkoff marketing legislation, HB 119, that was tabled in the Senate Agriculture fCommittee earlier this session. The bill would have created the Montana Cattle Committee and asked about 9,600 beef producers across the state, through a vote, whether or not they wanted to be taxed per head of cattle for the program.
“We decided to do a study bill to where we can get it ironed out, make it work for everybody,” Tilleman told the Daily Montanan. “Because we know our beef in Montana is some of the best, and everybody keeps buying.”
That idea was based on the Montana Wheat and Barley Committee, which was established in 1967 to promote Treasure State versions of those products. That committee works with the Wheat Marketing Center in Portland, Oregon, Tilleman said.
“They’ll actually take our wheat from Montana,” Tilleman said. “And they design special dishes for each of the different countries to try to show that our wheat is the best.”
If the Montana Cattle Committee is created in a future session, that’s the direction Tilleman hopes it goes. HJ 52 will also target educational opportunities. 
Tilleman is the Office of Public Instruction’s agricultural education specialist and sees it first hand. In Kalispell, for example, there’s six agriculture teachers with around 600 students. Tilleman said about two-thirds of schools in the state have some sort of agricultural education.
“There’s a big push in our area for that,” Tilleman said.
Several bills have touched on livestock this session, including increased financial protections for goat and bison producers. 
House Bill 356, which is on its way to the governor’s desk, added black bears to a predation list. It allows livestock producers, through the Livestock Loss Board, to receive compensation for animals killed by black bears. The list was previously grizzly bears, mountain lions and wolves.
“We have a lot of good bills that we’re trying to kind of rectify some of our code and try to actually help mitigate livestock loss,” Tilleman said. “And that was the big ones I was pushing, is being able to use those dollars to help mitigate a little more and doing that education.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/52100786614_9103ba001a_k-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-29 17:10:12.616239

(Getty Images)On April 28, the president issued an executive order titled “Protecting American Communities from Criminal Aliens.” The order on its face is a screed against so-called sanctuary cities. It directs the attorney general to compile a list of sanctuary jurisdictions around the U.S. and, among other things, threatens to withhold federal funding from them. To me, an attorney in a city with a long, proud history of welcoming and protecting people from all over the world, the executive order reads like a temper tantrum. 
There isn’t a universal definition for a sanctuary city. The term refers to a non-federal jurisdiction — it could be a state, a county, or a city or town — that has laws in place that limit its government’s cooperation with federal immigration authorities. Communities choose these policies for a variety of reasons: to build trust and cooperation between officials and non-citizens; to maintain discretion of how to allocate limited law enforcement resources for public safety; and because they don’t want to be in the business of hunting down their neighbors for deportation.
Trump administration officials assert that sanctuary policies make our communities less safe. They point to highly publicized murders of American citizens at the hands of non-citizens and they allege the presence of transnational criminal organizations and terrorists in our communities. But research bears out that places with sanctuary policies have lower crime rates than places without them. Sanctuary policies encourage participation in community policing by all members of the community and engagement with social services and community and economic development initiatives that mitigate poverty.
The most recent executive order asserts that sanctuary policies are  “lawless insurrection against the supremacy of Federal law and the Federal Government’s obligation to defend the territorial sovereignty of the United States.” The Trump administration may feel that way — so many of its recent executive orders are more about feelings than what is actually legal — but courts have consistently held otherwise. 
Sanctuary policies do not explicitly interfere with immigration enforcement. They do not impede the Department of Homeland Security’s ability to arrest, detain and deport non-citizens and they do not shield or harbor those individuals from law enforcement. Refusing to cooperate within this legal framework does not prevent Immigration and Customs Enforcement or other federal agencies from doing their job; it just says: We’re not going to use our resources to do this job for you. 
This distinction is important because it is constitutionally protected. The 10th amendment has what’s called the “anti-commandeering” doctrine. What that means is that the federal government cannot conscript states and local governments to enforce federal laws. Courts have long held that sanctuary policies are protected by the 10th amendment. 
This is why the Trump administration is attempting to use withholding of federal funds to compel jurisdictions with sanctuary policies to comply and cooperate. It’s not unlike the threats to withhold federal funding from universities who are unwilling to bend the knee to the administration. But, with respect to sanctuary cities, this issue was litigated during the first Trump administration and a federal judge ruled against withholding funds saying: “Federal funding that bears no meaningful relationship to immigration enforcement cannot be threatened merely because a jurisdiction chooses an immigration enforcement strategy of which the President disapproves.” That same judge granted an injunction on April 24 against the Trump administration’s attempt to withhold funds from sanctuary cities.  
This explains the tantrum. Kinder people can call it political theater but it is just a tantrum. We are starting to see a pattern of the president lashing out at people, companies, universities, states, or even countries that don’t immediately bend the knee to his demands. Mass deportation is a marquis issue for the second Trump administration and whether threatening sanctuary jurisdictions, denying due process or ignoring court orders, officials are having to result in increasingly illegal strategies to implement it. As desperation grows, the administration is escalating baseless propaganda about non-citizens being heinous criminals or terrorists. Sanctuary jurisdictions have a legally protected right to stand up and say, ‘we don’t buy it.’ Sanctuary jurisdictions know what healthy and safe communities look like, which is why voters support the policies. 
There are challenges ahead for our leaders. In our sanctuary communities, we need to lean into the instincts that told us we will never be safer by throwing our neighbors under the bus and stand up with other cities against these threats. We know we are always stronger together, that’s why we passed sanctuary policies in the first place. And the law is on our side. We refuse to cooperate with the federal government’s orders to help detain and deport our neighbors and we must also refuse to back down as the threats escalate — no matter how angry it makes our tantrum-throwing president.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-924927966-1024x698.jpg,,,2025-04-29 17:10:12.616239

(Catherine McQueen/Getty Images)The Florida House has passed a measure (SB 118) that bans local governments in the state from interfering with any plans to construct a presidential library in Florida.
The motivation for the legislation comes from Florida Republicans who want to ease the pathway for a library for Donald Trump to be built in the Sunshine State.
“As the home to the 45th and 47th president of the United States, there is a high likelihood that President Trump will select Florida to be the site of his presidential library,” Central Florida Republican Jason Brodeur told the Senate Committee on Community Affairs back in February when he first introduced the measure.
“In anticipation of Florida’s first presidential library, we should roll out the welcome mat and offer the president maximum flexibility to construct this historic landmark here in Florida.”
In the House vote on Tuesday, two Democrats were dismissive.
“Please just vote on this bill. That is my debate,” said Orlando Democrat Anna Eskamani succinctly. 
The other Democrat who spoke out, Jacksonville Rep. Angie Nixon, blasted the entire notion, saying that there was “irony” in what the GOP-controlled chamber was doing.
“If we are going to support bringing this library here, we should support returning citizens all across the board, and not attack returning citizens, especially when they want to do things like vote, because we have one of the biggest returning citizens a/k/a felons in the administration right now,” she said referring to Trump being found guilty on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments in May 2024 in a New York courtroom.
Nixon’s comment about returning citizens was a reference to the 2018 constitutional amendment which legalized felons in Florida who had completed their sentence to be able to vote. However, an implementing bill in the following legislative session significantly narrowed the number of felons who can actually vote.
Not all Democrats were that critical, as five of them joined all Republicans in supporting the measure (the final vote was 89-20).
Associates of Trump have been looking  at several South Florida universities as possible locations for a presidential library, including Florida Atlantic University and Florida International University, the Associated Press reported last month.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/gettyimages-2148912235-1024x640.jpg,,,2025-04-29 17:10:12.616239

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Not without conflict, the Florida Senate took up 189 of Gov. Ron DeSantis’ appointees for boards and commissions across the state and approved all of them. 
Among the confirmations was former House Speaker Paul Renner to the State University System Board of Governors, former Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nuñez as chair of Space Florida, and former Sen. Rob Bradley to the St. Johns River Water Management District board. 
Two appointees, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission Chair Rodney Barreto and Board of Education member Daniel Foganholi, received pushback but ultimately were confirmed. 
Senators approved Foganholi by a three-vote margin, 20-17. 
Foganholi has been appointed to four positions by DeSantis, including two times to the Broward School District board. In November, he ran to keep his spot on that board and lost, receiving 20% of the vote. 
New Board of Education member thanks God, DeSantis for fourth appointment

After the loss, DeSantis appointed him to the state board. 
“The people of Broward County did not trust Mr. Foganholi to represent them and he should not be rewarded for his failure to win the confidence of his community with a higher appointment to the State Board of Education,” Sen. Tina Polsky said on the floor.
Foganholi, a first-generation American born to parents who came to the United States from Brazil, is a member of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Commission, to which DeSantis appointed him.
Miami New Times reported in August that Foganholi used to be a rapper. He told the outlet that he is proud of his music venture, but not of the music itself, which includes him “spitting bars about everything from getting women to getting high,” according to the New Times. 
Foganholi appeared in a music video that includes a depiction of him robbing a convenience store with a gun, the outlet reported, and published a screenshot of the YouTube video. The video linked in the article has since been deleted.
Polsky brought his rap career up on the floor.
“This is not the influence we need on our State Board of Education. We owe our children better,” Polsky said. 
Foganholi wrote an op-ed in support of gun open carry on campus following the shooting at Florida State University that killed two and injured six. 
“At FSU, the shooter used his mother’s legally-owned service weapon,” Foganholi wrote in The Spectator. “No law could have stopped him. But, had even one trained professor, staff member or responsible student been armed, this tragedy might have ended differently.”
He went on to write a similar sentiment about the 2017 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Polsky, who represents Parkland, site of the high school, said Foganholi misrepresented what happened that day in his op-ed, adding that he is “either so ignorant on our state’s tragedies or so willing to deliberately misrepresent them to promote his own agenda.”
“The students of Florida, of Parkland, and now of Florida State, continue to come to us, asking us to listen and prioritize their safety,” Polsky said. “How do we justify them appointing someone with such a poor understanding of safety on the Board of Education.”
More money more problems
Sen. Carlos Guillermo Smith requested that Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission Chair Rodney Barreto be removed from the consent list. 
Barreto, a Coral Gables resident, has been appointed to the commission by three different governors — Jeb Bush, Charlie Crist, and DeSantis. Barreto is a millionaire who owns property in four states and chaired the Miami Super Bowl Host Committee three times.
Smith said his and other senators’ email inboxes “have been blown up” by constituents concerned about Barreto.
During his Senate Committee on Environment and Natural Resources confirmation hearing earlier this year, Barreto was asked about submerged land he owns at Singer Island and the potential sale of the environmentally sensitive land.
“I’m not in the business of buying land and giving it to people,” he said at the time when asked about the sale. “I’m in the business of making money.”
Smith recalled that testimony on the Senate floor Tuesday.
“Of course, there’s nothing wrong with making money. It’s not a crime or a bad thing. It’s what makes our capitalist economic system work. But he didn’t strike me as an environmental advocate, certainly not someone who should be the chair of the Florida Wildlife Commission.
“In my opinion, Mr. Barreto’s personal financial and development interests directly conflict with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission’s mission,” Smith said.
But Sens. Ana Maria Rodriguez and Bryan Avila defended Barreto.
“I know that there’s a lot of noise and I think it’s important for us to sometimes put the noise aside and look at the accomplishments and look at the individual who has been leading the effort not just on Biscayne Bay not just on the Everglades but on preserving a lot of land in our state for conservation,” Avila said.
The Senate voted 31-7 to confirm Barreto.
Not everyone confirmed
The Senate did not vote on all of DeSantis appointees. 
Agency for Health Care Administration Secretary Shevaun Harris or Department of Children and Families Secretary Taylor Hatch were not confirmed. The Florida Phoenix was the first to report that the Senate wouldn’t confirm them. Both Harris and Hatch testified during the House of Representatives investigation into a $10 million payment to the Hope Florida Foundation by health care giant Centene. The payment was part of a Medicaid overpayment settlement Centene reached with the state.
One University of West Florida trustee, Adam Kissel, was rejected in committee.
If the governor wants Harris, Hatch, or Kissel to continue to serve, he must reappoint them to that post within days of the end of session. They can continue to serve until the next legislative session. Appointees who fail to win confirmation a second time must leave their positions.
Two other gubernatorial appointees to the UWF board resigned after senators showed hesitancy about DeSantis’ desired conservative makeover of the Pensacola institution. 
New process
The process the Senate followed for confirmations this year and next was outlined in a memo by Senate Ethics and Committee Chair Don Gaetz, himself a former Senate president, and committee vice chair Mack Bernard, a Democrat.
The memo explains that every gubernatorial appointee will be considered by their substantive committee as well as the Ethics and Elections Committee.

Members of the House are aiming to add North Carolina to the list of states in which consumers can limit this kind of online shadowing and prevent their personal information from being sold for targeted ads or data mining. 
House Bill 462 would allow consumers to confirm whether companies, called “controllers” in the bill, have their personal data. Consumers would be able to obtain their data, have it corrected, or have it deleted. Companies would have to tell consumers what third parties have their personal information. 
Consumers would be able to say they don’t want their personal data sold, and to opt out of targeted advertising. 
“For any company that is housing and keeping anyone’s data, they would have to be able to provide access to this data, even telling North Carolinians how their data is being used,” Rep. Terry Brown (D-Mecklenburg) told a House Judiciary committee. Brown is the lead sponsor of the bipartisan bill.
Nothing in the bill conflicts with federal law, he said.

Some social media companies would be required to have people younger than 18 obtain express consent from a parent or guardian before they can set up accounts. 
The bill excludes some companies from the age requirement, including “a social media company that allows a user to generate short video clips of dancing, voice overs, or other acts of entertainment in which the primary purpose is not educational or informative,” “a media company that exclusively offers interactive gaming, virtual gaming, or an online service,” and companies that provide information through subscriptions and whose primary purpose is not social interaction.
Since 2018, 19 states have passed data privacy laws, according to the International Association of Privacy Professionals. North Carolina is one of a dozen states where legislators are actively considering such bills, according to the association. 
The bill won unanimous committee approval on Tuesday. 
The privacy measure is important now that consumer data is more readily available, Brown said after the committee meeting. 
“We’ve all seen the targeted advertisements. They’re getting more and more pervasive and invasive. So, I want to do what we can to mitigate some of that,” he said. 
Brown told the committee that he’d worked on the bill with the Bankers Association and the Healthcare Association and was in continuing talks with the Retail Merchants Association and individual companies. 
The industry input won’t weaken the bill, Brown said later. 
“My intent is to keep the teeth in this bill and to make sure that we’re protecting North Carolinians first and foremost,” he said.  “But with any bill that I put forward, I want to make sure that I’m talking to the folks that are going to be impacted by it. And where we can reach a compromise, I’m always happy to do so.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/cybersecurity-laptop.jpg,,,2025-04-29 17:10:12.616239

Melanie Stansbury (D-NM) on Tuesday chastised the United States Forest Service for refusing to publicly detail how staffing and other cuts could affect the federal response to wildfires expected soon in New Mexico and elsewhere. 
Stansbury directed her comments to Forest Service Associate Deputy Chief Ellen Shultzabarger, during the latter’s testimony to the U.S. House Federal Lands Subcommittee, on which Stansbury and fellow New Mexico Democrat Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández serve. Shultzaberger was there speaking in favor of a pair of bills that would allow specific, small pieces of federal forest land to be returned to states and cities, when questions from committee Democrats steered the conversation toward the upcoming wildfire season. 
“We are continuing to hire to have that goal of 11,300 operational firefighters, and we feel that we’ll be ready for the fire season,” Shultzabarger said. 
“With all due respect,” Stansbury responded, “I’ve been on the ground for the last couple of months, and Forest Service employees are terrified they’re going to lose their jobs, people are leaving in large numbers and thousands of people have been fired and not rehired. So while I appreciate that that is the company line here in this hearing, and I understand the position that you’re in, it’s just factually untrue. We are not prepared for this fire season.”
‘Stonewalling’: Forest Service mum on firings during wildfire briefing for congressional staff

Dozens of probationary Forest Service employees across New Mexico were fired or resigned since President Donald Trump took office. While judicial orders required the Trump administration to rehire those employees, many who tried to return were simply placed on paid administrative leave. 
While Forest Service officials have stressed that the mass firings were not aimed at employees whose sole job is dealing with wildfire, some outside estimates suggest three-quarters of those fired had “red cards,” meaning they could be called to help suppress a wildfire if one breaks out. A Colorado Democrat on the committee, Joe Neguse, estimated that 3,000 red card holders were fired. 
Meanwhile, Forest Service employees are awaiting the results of a “reduction-in-force” restructuring process that could take out another chunk of employees who are not on probationary status.

Asked about Stansbury’s comments after the meeting, Shultzabarger did not answer, instead deferring to Forest Service spokesperson Kyle Earnest, who did not provide further comment. 
Source New Mexico caught up with Stansbury after the hearing in Washington and asked her about the upcoming wildfire season, which forecasts predict could be dire and federal stonewalling on what used to be basic information. 
The following conversation took place during a short walk from the Capitol and has been edited for clarity and concision.
Source: Do you have any sense at all of what we could be looking at with reduction in force in New Mexico forests, in terms of employees lost?
MS: We have not received any specific plans. The New Mexico national forests have been heavily impacted by all the mass firings that have happened. The probationary firing that happened at the beginning of the DOGE effort resulted in dozens and dozens, both senior and junior, Forest Service employees, receiving notice that they’ve been fired. A lot of senior Forest Service officials did take the initial deferred departure offer, and we know that there is a RIF restructuring that is coming, but there’s been nothing released publicly, and there’s been nothing released internally. 
And so when I was home in New Mexico last week, during my town halls, I had Forest Service employees actually come to my town halls and speak to me privately about what’s happening. There’s a complete culture of fear. Nobody has any idea what’s going on. A lot of people are afraid they’re going to lose their jobs. …We’ve been heavily and disproportionately impacted. So we don’t have specific numbers, but we know that the entire workforce is in chaos and struggling right now.
Do you know the status of the interagency wildfire dispatch centers, including the one that’s in the Cibola National Forest office, which is on the DOGE termination list?
I don’t have any specific details. I mean, one of the things that I think has been really troubling about this entire DOGE exercise is that they claim that they’re doing it with transparency, and yet they refuse to come testify in front of Congress. They don’t even send political appointees to testify. Today, they sent a career staffer rather than a political appointee. And they transmit no information to congressional offices. And, you know, I say this all the time, but this is not normal. 
Heinrich gets ‘assurances’ that NM fire dispatch centers won’t close, but waiting on official word

In past administrations, regardless of what side of the aisle you are on, it has always been the norm and the practice that if you’re going to make a major change to a district, you notify the congressional offices, you notify the local officials, you notify towns and counties in the state, because all of them are impacted, and there’s zero communication at all between the administration DOG and local authorities, so we have no idea what they’re doing.
Do you think we’ll learn more in the president’s budget to be released this week about how those cuts will affect the New Mexico forests?
I don’t know. The word on the street is that the budget that will be transmitted this week is what they’re calling a skinny budget. So it will say, you know, [the] Forest Service’s budget is XYZ. It’s cut by XYZ amount and these programs, but I doubt it’ll have the level of detail that you see in a more fully fledged budget, where it describes in detail what their plans are. 
We ran into New Mexico State Forester Laura McCarthy near the Capitol, who told us she was here ‘lobbying’ but would not say for what bill or issue. Do you know?
She’s here? Wow, OK, I’m going to text her. I’m very good friends with Laura. My background is in water resources management, and she and I collaborated a lot on forest and water management in previous lives. So no, I don’t know what she’s up to here. But what I can say in general is that both states and tribes have been heavily impacted by the funding freezes. In fact, just yesterday, Mescalero Apache had a huge forest greenhouse project that had been on hold since the beginning of the Trump administration because they had frozen a [Bureau of Indian Affairs] grant they had received, and it was critical to growing seedlings for reforestation after these big fires, and they just found out yesterday that it had gotten unfrozen. 
Long-stalled NM uranium mines now ‘priority projects’ at Cibola Forest, leader tells employees

So my guess is that the states and tribes and local authorities are trying to track down grants and federal funding. I think folks are very, very concerned about the upcoming fire season, as I mentioned in the hearing. We have the lowest snow pack in recorded history. And the thing to understand about that is it means that both the river is drying up already, which is unseasonably early, but it also means soil moisture and vegetation moisture is very low, which means basically the entire state’s a tinder box for the fire season. So if and when fires hit us, we’re at a very, very, extremely high risk for a really catastrophic fire season. And as you know, our communities are still reeling and recovering from the last major fires, and we can’t do it without support from the Forest Service, FEMA and these programs that they’re talking about cutting. It’s a bad situation.
The Cibola Forest has recently listed a couple of uranium mines near Mount Taylor as priority projects. Do you think those uranium mines could become operational?
Well, this administration is absolutely moving forward with stripping away protections for permitting and for national forests. They just issued guidance last week that would reduce all federal permitting to 28 days. In the case of, for example, Mount Taylor — which is not only set aside as national tourist land, but it’s also a sacred site for the pueblos and tribes of New Mexico — you can’t do an environmental and cultural review in 28 days. That’s just going to result in lawsuits. I believe that the administration is going to do everything it can to green-light mining and extractive activities on sensitive lands, and we will fight them every step of the way.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_9579-1024x752.jpg,,,2025-04-29 17:10:12.616239

(Heritage Farm | Courtesy photo) A bill approved by Gov. Patrick Morrisey this week will allow the West Virginia Division of Natural Resources to issue permits to people to rehabilitate sick and injured wildlife. Morrisey signed House Bill 2836 on Monday. 
Rebecca Perry Franks, director of animal care and education at Heritage Farm and Museum in Huntington, helped champion the bill through the legislative session. 
A Huntington native, Franks said she fell in love with caring for sick and injured wildlife while interning at the Ohio Wildlife Center during college. She’s certified through the International Wildlife Rehabilitation Council but hasn’t been able to do that work since she returned to her home state. That made her start looking into how to change state law to make it legal for professionals here, she said.  
“It’s not something that everybody should be trying to do,” Franks said. “It takes training and careful consideration to make sure everybody is healthy, both people and animals throughout the process, but I truly believe that it has been hugely beneficial for the native wildlife of our surrounding states, and will be for ours as well.”
Under current West Virginia law, possession of wildlife outside of hunting season is illegal, said deputy DNR director Wendy Greene. The exceptions are avian centers, which are licensed by the federal government. 
Franks also runs a nonprofit wildlife hotline that takes questions from people who come across wild animals that are in danger or in need. Last year she fielded more than 270 calls between April and August, she said. 
“It continues to be very frustrating to have to tell everybody ‘hey, it’s currently illegal in this state to rehabilitate wildlife. All I can tell you to do is how to help keep it comfortable in its wild environment,’” Franks said. “Obviously that’s not the answer people like to hear. They want to be able to help. And a lot of people were taking matters into their own hands, against professional advice.” 
The bill authorizes the DNR to establish rules for the wildlife rehabilitation permit program.  While the bill is effective July 10, Greene said the DNR will have to establish rules and have them approved by the Legislature before it can accept applications. That won’t happen immediately, she said. 
“We won’t have anything definitive in place for several months,” Greene said. “…the law is passed, but it doesn’t mean folks can go out right now and grab up wildlife.”
The wildlife would be required to be returned to the wild unless it’s permanently impaired, the bill says. 
Heritage Farm currently has a nature center that educates visitors on native wildlife and domestic livestock. Once the application process is open, Franks hopes to be permitted to do wildlife rehabilitation and release as a part of her work there. 
“We’re an Appalachian history museum,” she said. “We celebrate natural history and cultural history, and why not help preserve our native wildlife as a part of that mission?”
The bill was sponsored by Del. Matthew Rohrbach, R-Cabell, who said the bill is a good way to help wildlife and, in the case of Heritage Farm, educate children who visit the Huntington attraction. 
“I think we all hope that it will help injured wildlife and also increase awareness of veterinary sciences,” Rohrbach said. “I could see a young child, perhaps visiting Heritage Farm, for instance, although it could be just as easily the [Oglebay] Good Zoo in Wheeling or other places, but seeing some of this being carried out, and then a young girl or young boy might get interested in veterinary science, go to veterinary school because of their exposure to something like this.”
The DNR intends to make the requirements the same as those of the International Wildlife Rehabilitation Council, Greene said. 
According to the bill, permits are prohibited for people who have been convicted of charges related to wildlife, animal cruelty or animal welfare. 
A fiscal note says the new program will cost the DNR about $92,000 per year. The division plans to assign a wildlife biologist and a secretary to work the program during half their time. The money for the program will be reallocated from other parts of the agency, the fiscal note says. Greene said the number is purely an estimate. 
“We have no idea how many people want to apply, how many people will be qualified,” she said. “We anticipate part of the application process being our biologist will go out to inspect facilities. So we were just guessing at how many we would have to process and inspect. It could be lower, it could be higher.”
Greene said the new law puts West Virginia in line with other Appalachian states that allow wildlife rehabilitation. 
“We were the only state in Appalachia that didn’t have a rehabilitation program for wildlife,” Greene said. “I think that, as an agency, we will be focused on rule development. We’ll be focused on making sure we’re still able to effectively control disease management. That would be one of our bigger concerns.”
Specifically, the DNR is concerned about chronic wasting disease, a fatal contagious disease in deer. She said the statute will allow the agency the authority needed to control the disease.
“I don’t know what that’s going to look like exactly,” she said. “My biologists — and I’m not a biologist, so I’m not going to speak for them — but they are currently working and looking at what we would need to do, whether that’s to control movement of different wildlife from different locations, or education. We’ll just have to see where we go with that.”

House File 299 was passed by the Senate 32-16. The bill requires all Iowa K-12 schools, as well as child care centers, community colleges, universities under the Iowa Board of Regents as well as private universities using the tuition grant program, to include information on exemptions when communicating with students and families about vaccine requirements. For child care facilities and K-12 schools, information on vaccine requirement exemptions must also be published on their website and be included in student registration documents.
Republicans who spoke in support of the measure said it was needed because there were some reports of school staff falsely claiming that vaccines were required — with no exceptions — for students to be able to attend school.
Sen. Dennis Guth, R-Klemme, shared a story from a mother who spoke on the bill during a subcommittee meeting. He said the woman claimed that while she was registering her child for an exemption to vaccine requirements, she witnessed another parent being told they needed to get vaccinations despite expressing they did not want to vaccine their child.

“The first mother came and said, ‘There are exemptions, you know, you don’t have to do that,’ and the school official said, ‘I’m sorry, no shots, no school,'” Guth said. “That’s just not the truth. We have a law in Iowa, and this will help make sure that that law is upheld.”
Iowa law requires students to receive vaccinations to enroll in schools, including receiving the polio, measles, hepatitis B, varicella and meningococcal vaccines while in the K-12 school system. However, families have the ability to opt out from these requirements if vaccinating their child “conflicts with a genuine and sincere religious belief.” The law does not require families to obtain a waiver or specify their religion to claim the exemption.
Medical exemptions can also be granted by a physician, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner who finds a required vaccination would be harmful to the health and well-being of the child or a member of their family.
While exemptions exist, Sen. Molly Donahue, D-Cedar Rapids, said the bill “risks sending a mixed message about the importance of the safety of vaccines” by emphasizing vaccine exemptions, potentially putting students in danger by diminishing herd immunity.
“The implications of this legislation could undermine public health efforts and lead to increased vaccine hesitancy, weakening our state and threatening our children,” Donahue said. “To be clear, vaccinations are safe. And this bill is particularly troubling when a resurgence of preventable diseases in areas with low vaccine rates is happening. Right now, we see measles popping up in multiple states.”
As of April 24, there have been a total of 884 confirmed measles cases in 29 states, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The largest outbreak has been in Texas, where two unvaccinated children died from the disease. Though no cases have been reported in Iowa since 2019, according to state public health officials, the neighboring states of Illinois and Minnesota have reported confirmed measles cases in 2025.
Senate Minority Leader Janice Weiner also emphasized the efficacy of the measles vaccine in the wake of the recent outbreak and deaths from the disease.
“I’m left wondering how many have looked at the numbers of graves of young children in cemeteries prior to the advent of these vaccines, or looked into the long-term effects of measles on the immune system,” Weiner said. “… It is preventable, completely preventable through vaccination, and that is the most effective way to protect individuals and communities from measles.”
Having a wide majority of a people vaccinated — 95% — is needed to provide overall community protection from measles, according to medical professionals, especially for those who cannot get vaccinated because of issues like age or other health problems. Weiner said the bill will allow families to “feel free and are actually encouraged to opt out of life-saving vaccines,” which will put others at risk.
“This is unnecessary and in my view, irresponsible,” Weiner said. “We have a duty to Iowans. We should be informing the public about the safety, efficacy and importance of the measles and other vaccinations, and working to keep kids healthy and Iowans healthy.”
But Sen. Jesse Green, R-Boone, said the measure is not taking a stance on vaccines. He called the bill “an honesty bill,” because it is requiring schools share accurate information on vaccination requirements — and the fact that parents can seek exemptions.
“What’s troubling to me is a handful of schools in the state that decide it’s okay to lie to parents, that if you don’t receive shots then you can’t send your kids to school,” Green said. “That is a lie, and our parents in the state of Iowa deserve better. And so that’s what this bill ensures. It ensures an honest conversation between the taxpayers, the parents and the schools.”
The bill, which the Iowa House passed in March, goes to Gov. Kim Reynolds for final approval.

(Photo courtesy of Madison Public Library)The Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction (DPI) received $1.6 million in grants from the federal Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) to support library operations and programming last week, though uncertainty remains for the program. 
Wisconsin libraries rely on funding provided by the federal government through the Library Services and Technology Act (LSTA) Grants to States Program, but that program has been in danger since President Donald Trump signed an executive order to downsize and begin the process of eliminating the agency. DPI and libraries throughout the state have warned that eliminating the funding would be a blow to statewide support for library programs as the grants fund staff for programs including the interlibrary loan system and other grants.
The notification message from IMLS to DPI stated that the partial payment is for the time period through April 2025. It also notified the state agency that “any additional amounts are subject to the availability of funds, IMLS discretion and other actions” and that “should those conditions be met, IMLS anticipates issuing supplemental awards and will send the allotment table at that time.”
“At this time, the DPI has not received a final allotment table indicating the amount of funding Wisconsin will receive,” the DPI stated in an update to libraries Tuesday afternoon. “This is not the typical fashion in which these funds are granted to states, but receiving a partial award provides some stability and relief in the short term.” 
The uncertainties for federal funding will still have some impact on the services that DPI carries out. Typically, the DPI Library Services office opens grant subawards, which are grants funded by federal funds and administered by the state agency, to library systems in Wisconsin in July. That won’t happen this year due to the uncertainty surrounding the amount and timing of future Grants to States funds.
“The DPI will prioritize the Library Services salaries and the tools necessary to do their jobs with this partial allotment,” DPI said in the email. The Library Services team is made up of about 20 people with 16 of the positions funded with federal dollars. “The team will reassess the viability of providing subawards once more is known about the future of IMLS and LSTA funding.” 
The amount that the state received is about half of the $3.23 million that Wisconsin received for the Grants to States Program received in 2024. 
Ben Miller, DPI library services director, had previously told the Examiner that the expected payment would serve as the next milestone for the state agency. There was uncertainty surrounding whether the payment would be sent given the gutting of staff for the IMLS office and the fact that other grants for libraries and museums have already been cut. Wisconsin is part of a multi-state lawsuit challenging the cuts to IMLS.
Miller had said that even if the agency received the payment, it will likely be cautious in proceeding with certain actions as the Museum and Library Services Act of 2018, the federal law that the grant program relies on, is up for renewal this fall. 
DPI spokesperson Chris Bucher said in an email to the Examiner that the state agency is “encouraged” by the first payment and is “optimistic given the IMLS note about issuing the supplemental awards.” 
“Our top priority remains being [of] service to Wisconsin kids and communities,” Bucher said. 
DPI also it would continue to provide updates to libraries as the situation evolves and thanked the library community for “sharing your stories, working with elected officials, and remaining steadfast in the incredible services you provide every day.” Libraries across the state have been working to inform the public about the potential cuts and to advocate for the federal funding with lawmakers. 
“Keep being loud and proud about the meaningful work happening in your libraries and communities,” DPI wrote.

Photo by Patrick McCaffrey via Wikimedia CommonsA federal judge has signed off on the sale of Burke Mountain Resort for $11.5 million, releasing the Northeast Kingdom ski mountain from nearly a decade of federal receivership. Judge Darrin P. Gayles issued an order Thursday in U.S. District Court in Miami formally approving the sale of Burke Mountain to Bear Den Partners LLC, a consortium of entities with longstanding ties to the ski resort. “A private sale to the Buyer is the only current viable alternative for preserving and capturing the value of the Assets for the benefit of the receivership estate,” Gayles wrote in the court order.The ski area’s buyer is a group that includes Burke Mountain Academy, a world-class ski racing school located in Burke, and the Graham family, who briefly owned the resort in the early 2000s. The group has pledged to put around $30 million into the resort to fund significant upgrades to its lift infrastructure and the hotel at the base of the mountain. Melissa Gullotti, a spokesperson for Bear Den Partners, said that pending a few administrative details being resolved, the group expects to formally close the deal in early May. The decision comes just days after Michael Goldberg, the lawyer overseeing the resort’s receivership, asked Gayles to approve the deal, writing at the time that the agreement was “in the best interest of the investors, the employees and the Burke ski community.”Gayles appointed Goldberg receiver of Burke Mountain Resort and Jay Peak, another Northeast Kingdom ski area, in 2016, when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission brought a civil suit against Ariel Quiros, the former owner of both properties, and Bill Stenger, former CEO of Jay Peak. The two men were accused of defrauding investors participating in the federal EB-5 visa program in what has since become the largest fraud case in Vermont history. READ MORE





 


Local group expected to acquire Burke Mountain ski resort

In 2022, Goldberg sold Jay Peak to Pacific Group Resorts Inc., a Utah-based management company, for $76 million. About $60 million of that went to defrauded investors, though it only covered an average of 22% of their losses. In court filings, Goldberg has suggested that much of the proceeds from the sale of Burke Mountain Resort would similarly go toward making the investors whole, although it’s unclear how much they would receive. Read the story on VTDigger here:  Federal judge approves $11.5 million sale of Burke Mountain Resort.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Burke-Mountain-Ski-Resort-Vermont.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-29 17:10:12.616239

On April 28, 2022, the Ole Miss baseball Rebels had won 23 games and lost 17 overall. They were 6-12 in the Southeastern Conference. The various Internet message boards were filled with posts calling for head baseball coach Mike Bianco’s dismissal. Yes, and two months later, Bianco and his Rebels won the College World Series.

Rick Cleveland
Contrast that with this: On April 28 of this year, Mississippi State’s Diamond Dogs had a 25-19 record overall, 7-14 in the SEC. The various Internets boards were filled with posts calling for head coach Chris Lemonis to be fired. He was.
In both those situations, the Mississippi teams were six games over the .500 mark overall. In both those situations, the teams had lost twice as many SEC games as they had won. Ole Miss stayed the course, and it paid off, remarkably so. In sharp contrast, Mississippi State pulled the trigger, and we shall see what happens next.
Another big difference in the two situations: Bianco had never won a national championship in his previous 20 years at Ole Miss. Lemonis won the first national championship in State history just four years ago.
You ask me, that national championship, not even four years ago, should have earned Lemonis, at the very least, the right to finish out this season. I don’t see anything to be gained with firing the man with three weeks remaining in the regular season. Most NCAA Tournament projections have Mississippi State listed as one of the first four teams out. The Bulldogs are ranked 45th in RPI against the nation’s 13th most difficult schedule. They are on the NCAA Tournament bubble, just as Ole Miss was three seasons ago.
This is not to say I believe that Lemonis, given the opportunity, would have done what Bianco did three years ago, But it is certainly within the realm of possibility. We’ve seen it happen. In baseball, more than any other sport, teams run hot and cold. State could have gotten hot, gotten on a roll in May and June and at least made it to the College World Series. It happens for someone nearly every year in college baseball. For that matter, it could still happen for State this year with interim head coach Justin Parker calling the shots.
And I know what many of those calling for the dismissal of Lemonis will say. They’ll say that in firing Lemonis now, State can get a head start on hiring a new coach to turn the program around. Not so. Any coach that the Bulldogs would hire is still coaching a team and will be coaching a team through at least May. 
Traditionally, Mississippi State baseball is one of the nation’s top programs. State baseball facilities are second to none. Fan support is among the nation’s best. 
But it is not, as athletic director Zac Selmon put it “the premier program in college baseball.” It is much more accurate to say State’s is a really good program in the premier conference in college baseball.
LSU, Texas, and Arkansas, all teams in the same conference, have similar fan support, terrific facilities and have enjoyed much more on-the-field success. Tennessee has improved dramatically. Ole Miss, Alabama, Auburn, Georgia, Texas A & M have made huge strides in facilities, fan support and baseball emphasis. 
And here’s the deal: Tradition, facilities and fan support, while still important, all have become secondary issues when it comes to ingredients for success in college athletics. You know what really matters most? NIL and the ability to attract players in the transfer portal, that’s what. This is no longer amateur sports. It’s pay-for-play. It’s professional sports in every respect.
The first question recruits ask: What can you pay me? The first question any prospective coach will ask Mississippi State: How much money will I get to pay players? In Monday’s press release announcing the dismissal of Lemonis, Selmon was quoted as saying State’s baseball “NIL offerings” are second to none. There’s no way of knowing for sure, but I have heard otherwise from numerous sources.
 I hate that we have reached this point in college athletics, but we most assuredly have. I also hate that Lemonis, a good man and a good coach, doesn’t get the chance to finish the season. I thought he had earned that.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/07084848/AP_443445095797.jpg,,,2025-04-29 17:10:12.616239

(Courtesy of Idaho National Laboratory)Officials with the state of Idaho and the U.S. Department of Energy have agreed to a waiver of the state’s 1995 nuclear waste settlement agreement, the two sides announced Tuesday.
The new waiver will allow for the shipment of spent nuclear fuel into Idaho for the purposes of conducting research at Idaho National Laboratory in eastern Idaho, officials said.
The waiver specifically allows for a high burnout nuclear fuel cask from the North Anna Power Station, a commercial nuclear power plant located in Virginia, to be sent to Idaho National Laboratory for research, according to a press release issued Tuesday.

The waiver was necessary because the 1995 settlement agreement called for limiting shipments of, and removing certain types of, spent nuclear fuel in Idaho.
“The collaborative effort between the state of Idaho, the U.S. Department of Energy, and the Idaho National Laboratory showcases our commitment to advancing nuclear energy research while upholding the goals of the 1995 Settlement Agreement,” Little said in a written statement.
“We are proud to support innovation in nuclear energy that will support national security and energy independence into the future.”
Research at INL to support licensing for extended storage of spent fuel at nuclear power plants
Idaho National Laboratory, or INL, is one of 17 Department of Energy national labs, and it employs or contacts with about 6,400 researchers and support staff.
Much of the nuclear research and energy research conducted by Idaho National Laboratory occurs at a vast research complex referred to as “the site” that is located in the eastern Idaho desert, between the town of Arco and Idaho Falls.
“Idaho National Laboratory is DOE’s lead lab for nuclear energy research and development, and it is critical that we continue to grow this research capacity and maintain American competitiveness,” U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said in a written statement. “This agreement between the State of Idaho and DOE ensures the lab can continue its cutting-edge research to advance nuclear technology, helping to meet President Trump’s commitment to unleash American energy dominance.”
In today’s press release, state and federal officials said the research will provide data to support licensing for the extended storage of spent fuel at 54 nuclear power plants in 28 states.
“As the nation’s center for nuclear energy research and development, we look forward to utilizing our unique facilities and expertise to support this critical national need,” Idaho National Laboratory Director John Wagner said in a written statement. “We are thankful to the Department of Energy and the state of Idaho for entrusting us with the safe and secure execution of our vital mission.”
1995 settlement agreement came after environmental, health concerns from disposal of nuclear waste in Idaho
As part of the new waiver, Idaho National Laboratory will also be allowed to safely manage small amounts of spent nuclear fuel from domestic university reactors. Without the waiver, some U.S. universities could have been forced to shut down their research reactors due to limits on spent fuel storage, officials said.
Signed in October 1995 by then-Gov. Phil Batt, the 1995 settlement agreement resolved a lawsuit filed by the state amid public concern about environmental and health resulting from disposal of nuclear waste in Idaho. The lawsuit was filed in order to keep Idaho from becoming a dumping ground for the country’s spent nuclear fuel, according to the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality.
The new waiver relaxes the annual limit on the amount of spent nuclear fuel and materials that can come into Idaho, officials said. The shipment could occur in 2027 under the waiver.

How’s that for regressive? 
Employment Security Department numbers show that middle- and upper-income people use paid leave far more than those with lower incomes. In fact, people making $60 or more an hour used the fund nearly twice as much as the lowest wage earners in fiscal year 2024. Meanwhile, full-time workers of all incomes already lose hundreds of dollars a year to this tax. (Calculate your losses here: https://paidleave.wa.gov/estimate-your-paid-leave-payments/.)  
The Paid Family and Medical Leave program is no safety net. It makes most workers less able to pay for the life needs they do have. The Legislature should have considered ending it this year.
Instead, lawmakers considered Senate Bill 5292, which in the end proposed taxing workers up to $2 of every $100 in earnings in the coming years for a benefit many will never see. That new, higher rate would’ve been more than double the current tax. The bill died, but the proposal could still be considered again next session. That’s likely because the funding now available for the program doesn’t cover its costs.
The Joint Legislative Audit and Review Committee said that administrative costs and benefits exceeded revenue for the paid-leave program in two of its first four years. And in 2023, the program got a $200 million bailout from the state’s general fund to deal with higher-than-expected claims. The fix was temporary, however. A state consultant forecasts that the program will likely see negative net income again in three of the next five years. 
That’s not hard to understand. People like it when other taxpayers help pay for their life wants and needs — especially when a portion of their wages has contributed to a pool of money during their working years.
Already burdensome
This year, the tax for the program is already 92 cents on every $100 a worker earns — up to the 2025 Social Security cap of $176,100. That’s more than twice the amount when the tax began in 2019 at 40 cents per $100 of earnings. (Employees pay about 72% of this tax. Employers contribute about 28% on behalf of their employees. That’s money that then can’t go toward increased worker pay or other benefits.)
The most recent version of Senate Bill 5292 outlined increases in the 1.2% Paid Family and Medical Leave tax rate cap. The bill called for raising it to 1.4% in 2027 and 2028, 1.6% in 2029 and 2030, 1.8% in 2031 and 2032, and 2% for 2033 and subsequent years.
While some supporters of this harmful worker tax brag that thousands have been helped by it, they fail to mention that millions of workers have not. And for some of those workers, making ends meet is more difficult because of it. The paid-leave tax penalty state lawmakers have placed on workers puts self-sufficiency further out of reach for some Washingtonians and should end. 
Federal law already allows workers 12 weeks of job-protected, unpaid family leave. It doesn’t pay people not to work while taxing those who do work but don’t have the luxury of taking weeks off, even with paid leave.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/taxes-coins-blocks-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-29 16:09:17.570475

(Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Analysis of potential congressional cuts to Medicaid indicated Kansas’ loss of nearly $350 million in the first year and more than $3 billion over 10 years could shrink coverage for vulnerable populations, escalate family medical debt and raise the risk of hospital closures.
Reductions in federal financing of Medicaid could lead to downsizing by 5% to 15% the number of Medicaid enrollees in Kansas and trigger a decline of 22% in Medicaid funding to hospitals in the state. Kansas has two-dozen rural hospitals at risk of immediate closure. Shrinking federal funding to Medicaid could add to the burden of uncompensated patient care and threaten hospitals operating on narrow margins.
The findings were in a report released Tuesday by REACH Healthcare Foundation and United Methodist Health Ministry Fund, both health-related philanthropies serving Kansans. The report incorporated analysis from Manatt Health, which provides strategic, policy and legal advisory services in the health care industry.
Impetus for the projections was upcoming debate in Congress on a goal of cutting $880 billion in federal spending on Medicaid in the next decade.
“The data is clear and deeply concerning,” said David Jordan, president and CEO of United Methodist Health Ministry Fund. “We will all pay the price – higher costs, increases in local taxes and less access to care – to offset these cuts. It’s critical that lawmakers, health care providers, advocates and the people of Kansas recognize the consequences before it’s too late.”
United Methodist Health Ministry Fund is a statewide foundation that has worked since 1986 to improve the health of Kansans.
Medicaid is a joint federal and state program offering health coverage to lower-income Kansas children, seniors, people with disabilities and pregnant women. Medicaid enrolls 366,000 Kansans, including 31% of the state’s children. Medicaid supports four of seven nursing home residents in Kansas as well as one in four working-age adults in the state who have a disability, the report said.
There is interest among congressional Republicans in adopting a national work requirement for recipients of Medicaid. The Kansas Medicaid program, known as KanCare, doesn’t extend coverage to working-age adults regardless of income unless the recipient was a parent, caregiver or a person with a disability.
“Medicaid is the largest source of federal funds in Kansas and any cuts to the program will have severe economic and health impacts felt in every corner of the state,” said Brenda Sharpe, president and CEO of REACH Healthcare Foundation.
REACH is a charitable organization striving to improve access to quality, affordable care for uninsured and medically underserved residents of Johnson, Wyandotte and Allen counties in Kansas and Jackson, Cass and Lafayette counties in Missouri.
Manatt Health relied on computer modeling to produce one-year and 10-year projections for Medicaid based on the idea of reducing federal expenditures by $880 billion within a decade. The work by Manatt Health was released before Congress completed work on spending adjustments, but the assessment aligned with policy parameters, options and effective dates outlined by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Medicaid-cut-report-2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-29 16:09:17.570475

(Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)A coalition of Colorado’s Republican members of Congress, Republican state lawmakers, county sheriffs and the Colorado State Shooting Association want U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi to review the constitutionality of nearly 20 state gun laws they say infringe on Second Amendment rights.
In a letter sent Monday, the group asked Bondi to take up the review using the Second Amendment Enforcement Task Force her office established in early April.
“Over the past few years, the State of Colorado and some of its larger cities and political subdivisions have, through a progression of increasingly oppressive and burdensome statutes and ordinances, engaged in a systemic and unrelenting campaign designed to restrict, impair, impede and ultimately extinguish Coloradans’ right to bear arms in violation of our Constitution,” the letter reads.
House Republicans sent a similar request to Bondi’s office a few weeks ago, but now more people are on board, including the state Senate Republican caucus, Colorado’s four Republican members of Congress, and 14 county sheriffs. The Colorado State Shooting Association is the state branch of the National Rifle Association.

They urged Bondi to investigate Colorado’s “anti-Second Amendment agenda” and identify “federal remedies” including litigation. They also want an assessment of how the laws impact “law-abiding citizens” and rural residents, hunters, people in poverty and people who rely on guns for self defense.
The letter mentions laws including the state’s high capacity ammunition law, “red flag” law, waiting period requirement, minimum age requirement and expanded training for concealed carry permits. The majority of the laws called out in the letter were passed in the last three years.
It also highlights Senate Bill 25-3, signed into law earlier this month, that sets training requirements to purchase most semiautomatic firearms with detachable magazines. The law is set to go into effect in August 2026. It passed the Legislature with entirely Democratic support.
The letter says that the new law fails to meet the “constitutional benchmarks” set by a series of gun-related U.S. Supreme Court cases. Throughout the lawmaking process, however, bill sponsors asserted that they believe it would stand up to a legal challenge. Colorado joins states including California, Washington and Oregon that require training to buy certain guns.
“I think this bill will make Colorado’s communities safer and prevent accidents as well as reduce gun violence, ultimately saving lives while protecting our Second Amendment rights,” Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, said as he signed SB-3.
In a statement, Attorney General Phil Weiser said SB-3 was “commonsense.”
“Colorado communities — from Aurora and Colorado Springs to Boulder and Littleton — have been devastated by gun violence. While each mass killing brings unique pain and trauma, they all have one thing in common: weapons that are more suited for war than for self-defense or hunting,” he said in an email. “I will continue to go to court to defend Colorado and our laws whenever they are attacked by the gun lobby or Washington, DC.”
It is likely SB-3 will face litigation from gun-rights groups.
The federal task force is composed of Bondi, the yet-to-be-confirmed associate attorney general, and representatives from the Department of Justice’s Criminal Division and Civil Rights Division, the Federal Bureau of Investigations, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. It has not yet met.

School district officials, educators did not keep information from high schooler’s parents or violate mother’s religious rights, federal judge concludes.
The post Judge: Rock Springs school didn’t violate parental rights in transgender pronoun case appeared first on WyoFile .","Sweetwater County educators did not keep information from the parents of a Rock Springs high school student who asked to be called by a preferred name and pronouns, a federal judge ruled Monday.
U.S. District Judge Scott Skavdahl reached that conclusion en route to dismissing a lawsuit brought by the child’s parents, who had alleged the district violated their rights by deliberately concealing information about their child’s name and pronoun choices. The student’s mother, a public school teacher in Sweetwater County, further alleged that her First Amendment religious rights were violated by district policies that direct staff about how to handle students’ preferred names and pronouns.
Skavdahl rebuffed both allegations, agreeing with Sweetwater County School District 1 lawyers that the case should be decided in the educators’ favor before it reached a jury.
“The undisputed facts establish that Defendants did not withhold or knowingly misrepresent any information regarding the Student from or to Plaintiff, and thus did not interfere with this right,” Skavdahl wrote. “Neither did Defendants’ conduct burden Plaintiff’s First Amendment right to freely exercise her religious beliefs as a parent or unconstitutionally interfere with her right to freely exercise her religious beliefs as a teacher.”
The student’s parents, Ashley and Sean Willey, sued Sweetwater County School District 1 leaders and educators in April 2023. They asked the court to bar the district from using any names or pronouns other than the ones their teenager was given at birth without prior written consent. 
Ashley Willey also asked the court to block the district from forcing her, as a teacher, to use her students’ preferred pronouns or names. Willey did not use students’ preferred pronouns and names as a teacher, and she testified she was never disciplined or retaliated against for her decision, according to Skavdahl’s ruling.
The Willey family filed the lawsuit amid rising concerns, often expressed by conservative-leaning parents, that schools were influencing student decisions about gender identity. That spurred efforts to ban or limit access to certain LGBTQ+ books at school and public libraries in Wyoming. State lawmakers also brought measures designed to prevent school districts and public employees from being required to use preferred pronouns and names, while requiring schools to provide parents with more information about their children. A school district pronoun bill died in the state Senate while the state-employee focused legislation became law without Gov. Mark Gordon’s signature.

Earlier this year, Wyoming’s schools superintendent, Megan Degenfelder, also pushed for a requirement that schools receive parental consent before using a child’s preferred name or pronouns.
Parental rights, district obligations
In the Willeys’ lawsuit, the parents alleged their child asked teachers and staff at Black Butte High School in Rock Springs to be called by a male name and pronouns starting in the 2021-22 school year. They accused the district of keeping that development from them by continuing to use the child’s gender assigned at birth in their presence, while using the teen’s preferred name and pronouns in school. 
During depositions, three school staff members testified they used the student’s preferred name and pronouns during the 2021-22 school year. Another teacher did so in an email exchange during the 2022-23 school year.
The Willeys asserted that the district should have proactively informed them about their child’s change in name and pronouns because parents have a right to make decisions about their children’s well-being, including their physical and mental health. 
But Skavdahl noted that such a stance would be impractical, as there are a “laundry list of circumstances that could affect a child’s ‘well-being’ even in the slightest that would require constant, detailed information sharing from the school, with constitutional consequences.”
The judge agreed that parents have a right to know about their child’s gender identity choices if parents seek that information from schools. But he drew a distinction between a district knowingly keeping that information from a parent and a district that provides such information only when asked.
“The Court does not think the information can properly be deemed ‘withheld’ to infringe on parental rights unless a parent inquired into or sought the information and it was intentionally concealed or they were lied to,” Skavdahl wrote. “Otherwise, an infinite amount of information would be deemed ‘withheld’ by schools on a daily basis in violation of parental rights.”
“The District and its staff members merely respected the Student’s voluntary choice to be referred to by preferred name and pronouns,” the judge wrote later in the opinion. “Neither the District nor its staff members required the Student go by preferred name or pronouns nor did they ‘discourage students from discussing their gender identities with their parents.’”
Moreover, the school district shared information with the parents about their child’s preferred name and pronouns when that information was sought, the judge noted.
Skavdahl also rejected the Willeys’ arguments that educators facilitated the student’s gender transition socially, and thus, invalidated the parents’ right to make medical decisions for their teen.
“Plaintiff offers no evidence that the school provided any type of ‘medical transition’ or even ‘facilitated’ the Student’s ‘social transitioning,’” Skavdahl wrote. “Defendants were not involved in changing the Student’s clothing or hairstyle. Plaintiff did not set forth any facts that staff members even encouraged or suggested the Student engage in such behaviors, but simply that staff members passively respected the Student’s request to be referred to by preferred name and pronouns.”
Freedom of religion
Skavdahl also denied Ashley Willey’s claims that the district violated her freedom of religion, both as a parent and as a teacher. She had argued the district’s failure to inform her about her child’s gender identity changes interfered with her religious beliefs because it kept her from information she needed to counsel her child.
But that reasoning would create an obligation on the part of the district to foster the exercise of Willey’s religious beliefs, the judge wrote.
To conclude that the District’s failure to act in accordance with Plaintiff’s religious beliefs is a constitutional violation would turn the First Amendment on its head.”Judge scott skavdahl
“Plaintiff’s allegations, more plainly, are that the District staff members’ use, at the Student’s request, of preferred name and pronouns were counter to Plaintiff’s own religious beliefs,” he wrote. “However, a person’s constitutional right to freely exercise their own religious beliefs does not require that the state also exercise those same religious beliefs … To conclude that the District’s failure to act in accordance with Plaintiff’s religious beliefs is a constitutional violation would turn the First Amendment on its head.”
As to Wiley’s assertions that being required to follow the district’s policies concerning preferred pronouns and names violated her religious rights, Skavdahl was unswayed. Those policies were “neutral laws of general applicability,” they don’t raise concerns about the free exercise of religion and must only be “rationally related to a legitimate government interest” to be considered constitutional. That interest, Skavdahl wrote, involved promoting an educational environment that’s both respectful and without discrimination.

(Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — The rate at which South Carolina women died because of pregnancy complications spiked in 2021, following years of decline, according to an analysis of the most recent data released Tuesday.
More rural health care, group doctor’s appointments and telehealth could help reduce the number of health issues women experience during and after pregnancy, suggests a report by the South Carolina Institute of Medicine and Public Health.
Better and more accessible health care could have prevented nearly 90% of pregnancy-related deaths in 2021, the latest year evaluated, the report found.
“We know that we have an infant and maternal mortality crisis in our state,” said Lisa Waddell, chair of the taskforce that wrote the report. “Moms are dying unnecessarily. Infants continue to die and don’t survive until their first year of life. And there are things that we can do.”
Maternal mortality
In 2021, 47 of every 100,000 live births in the state resulted in the mother’s deaths before, during or after delivery, according to a state committee’s analysis. The data consistently lags about three years.
For Black women, that ratio was nearly 72 for every 100,000 births. For white women, it was about 37.
That’s an increase from 2020, when the statewide maternal mortality rate was 32 for every 100,000 births. While maternal mortality rates for Black mothers steadily increased for at least four years, the rate for white mothers dropped from 2018 to 2020 before spiking again in 2021, according to committee data.
The exact reasons why are not clear because so many factors play into maternal mortality, said Maya Pack, executive director of the Institute of Medicine and Public Health. But it seems like spikes in COVID-19, which complicated risk factors already associated with pregnancy, contributed to the increase, Waddell said.
Between 2018 and 2021, the No. 1 cause of maternal deaths was infection, specifically from COVID-19, according to the report. Despite emerging in 2020, COVID-19 accounted for nearly 14% of deaths for pregnant women and new mothers during those four years, the report found.
With the virus being less of a concern, the hope is that the ratio of maternal deaths caused by COVID-19 infections has decreased in recent years, Waddell said.
Even in that case, though, the maternal mortality rate remains much higher than it should be, Pack said. For years, the state has consistently scored among the worst in the country for maternal and infant health.
“The persistence of this problem is really troubling,” Pack said.
Part of the problem is that pregnancy often exacerbates a woman’s existing health issues. For instance, if a woman has diabetes before becoming pregnant, as about one-third of people in the state do, that can cause life-threatening issues during pregnancy, according to the report.
“If we could promote healthier lifestyles and healthier communities throughout our state at all times, the women who are going to become pregnant are going to be more likely to be healthy and therefore have a healthier pregnancy and have a healthier baby,” Pack said.
Women in rural areas, where health care is less accessible, are especially at risk, the report found.
Some women must travel upwards of an hour to reach the closest birthing hospital or obstetrician and gynecologist. Since 2012, 13 labor and delivery units have closed in the state, and about one quarter of hospitals don’t offer obstetric care, according to the report.
“The farther a woman travels to their birthing hospital, the greater the risk of maternal morbidity outcomes,” the report states.
Women in rural areas are also less likely to have health insurance and to be able to afford prenatal and postpartum care. That translates to less revenue for the medical services that do exist in rural areas, causing fewer to locate there and worsening the problem, according to the report.
Health issues for rural women often come at a high cost to the state. Rural women are more likely to use Medicaid to pay for health care services, with the state-funded health insurance covering 71% of rural deliveries compared to 60% statewide, according to the report.
Increased Medicaid costs for maternal health, especially for emergency services on which women in rural areas often rely, amounted to about $357 million in 2019, according to the report.
“This is a great state to live in, but we need to ensure that our mothers are safe, that our infants are surviving,” Waddell said. “Anything less than that is not OK.”
Solutions
Some solutions are already in place to help pregnant women and new mothers access health care.
In January, the state Medicaid agency received a $17 million grant, to be handed out over the coming decade, “to invest in improving maternal health care for South Carolinians enrolled in the Health Connections Medicaid program,” according to the report.
The Department of Public Health is expected to launch mobile maternal health clinics over the summer in an effort to help reach women in rural areas without other nearby care.
Expanding programs already in place could address part of the problem, Pack said. Some programs have seen good results but operate only in specific cities or counties, she said.
Those organizations could also use more resources to increase awareness of services for mothers who may not know they have other options, she said.
“Understanding the resources available to one’s family at the community level is a big part of that health literacy,” Pack said.
Even as health professionals faced rising maternal mortality rates, the prevalence of programs trying to address the problems give researchers hope, they said Tuesday. That shows people are aware of the problem and trying to help, Waddell said.
Still, there’s more to be done. The report makes a dozen recommendations to help increase access to care, bolster the health care workforce and teach both doctors and patients more about maternal care, including other risk factors, such as mental health and substance use issues.
For instance, a grant program similar to the one the state’s Medicaid agency used to encourage hospitals to open more behavioral health care units could similarly increase maternal care in areas that need it, according to the report.
Group prenatal classes could encourage women to keep up with their appointments and be more engaged with their care. Opening maternal-specific care units in existing public health departments could create more access, even if it’s somewhat limited, the report suggests.
Dedicated transportation systems could help rural women reach health care providers, while more telehealth could allow women in rural areas to chat with their doctors without having to find a way to get to the office, the report suggests.
“All of these various programs that are being recommended will make a difference,” Waddell said. “I’m convinced that they will. We’ve got a lot of energy, optimism and excitement around really wanting to do things that are better for women and infants in our state, and I’m convinced that this report will help.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_2176-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-04-29 16:09:17.570475

(Screenshot/Capitol TV)Emily Mandel, a senior economist for Moody’s Analytics, opened her presentation to Rhode Island state budget crunchers Tuesday with a caveat:
“You will probably be very tired of hearing the word ‘tariff’ by the end of this.” 
Mandel’s comments came during the Rhode Island’s biannual Revenue and Caseload Estimating Conference at the Rhode Island State House.
The twice-a-year conference updating state revenue and spending forecasts aims to help lawmakers shape the state’s fiscal 2026 budget, which will take effect July 1. But Rhode Island’s financial future looks fuzzier than ever as question marks hang over federal funding to state governments and the fallout from the international trade war.
“Recession risks remain very high, and it’s evolving day by day,” Mandel said. “It will feel somewhat recession-adjacent.”
The average tariff rate of 21%, based on the existing 145% reciprocal tariffs with China and 10% tariff on goods from all other countries, is the highest the United States has seen since 1909.
“It’s not unprecedented, but it’s unprecedented over the last century,” Mandel said.
The country, and by extension Rhode Island, will see job growth and wages stagnate as consumer and business costs surge as tariff consequences take hold this summer. Assuming Trump backs off the tariff policies — still a major if — economic recovery is expected by 2027, according to Moody’s latest forecast.
Meanwhile, cuts to federal funding, including for Medicaid, threaten to devastate Rhode Island, which relies on an outsized share of federal funding in its spending relative to other states, according to analysis from Pew Charitable Trusts.

And, preserving the state’s declining population will become even more challenging as residents flee for less destinations in the South and mid-Atlantic, as well as cheaper New England states like Maine and New Hampshire. 
Moody’s analysts did not name specific income tax policies, such as a millionaire’s tax, as an influence on out-of-state migration. However, they noted that neighboring Massachusetts, which began an extra 4% tax on income over $1 million in 2023, has lost some residents to Rhode Island in recent years.
Legislation introduced in both chambers of the Rhode Island State House calls for a 3% surtax on the top 1% of state earners, setting off the perennial debate over what could be a new state revenue source, or a deterrent to wealthy residents.
Will rich Rhode Islanders flee because of a millionaires tax? Don’t believe it, advocates say.

A new report published Monday by The Institute for Policy Studies, a progressive D.C. think tank, showed the amount of top earners who live in Massachusetts, as well as their collective wealth, has increased since voters passed the “Fair Share Amendment” in 2022.  
Yet the greater Boston metropolitan area has also seen wage growth slow over the last year far more rapidly than the national average, or in the Providence area, according to federal labor data. Kumael Bilgrami, associate economist with Moody’s, blamed Boston’s weak job growth performance on its high cost of living, including housing.
Rhode Island, too, is facing a critical housing shortage that has driven up costs for buyers and renters. The housing crisis is not likely to ease anytime soon; tariffs have sent building material costs skyrocketing, suppressing demand for residential permits, while stricter federal immigration policies make it harder for the construction industry to keep and retain its foreign-born workforce, Bilgrami said.
Yet despite its reputation as a “first in, last out” state when it comes to economic recessions and downturns, Rhode Island has a few advantages over the rest of the country.

Chief among them is the state’s labor market, which has continued to enjoy strong employment growth relative to national and regional averages. The 515,600 jobs recorded in Rhode Island in March 2025 is the highest on record, according to Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training data. While the unemployment rate has ticked up to 4.8% as of March, and is expected to hit 5% by the end of 2025, Rhode Island continues to outperform the country and neighboring states, Massachusetts and Connecticut.
Another advantage for the state’s job market is its diversity of industries, which offers some “insulation” from the consequences of tariffs, Bilgrami said.
Rhode Island boasts an outsized share of finance, education and health care jobs relative to its total labor market, which will be shielded from tariff policies more than other industries like manufacturing.
“We think health care is going to remain relatively stable,” Mandel said.
Job growth forecast for Rhode Island through fiscal 2030 remains relatively unchanged from the last Revenue Estimating Conference in November. Moody’s has revised its projections for state employment upwards slightly since November.
Also consistent with November forecasts are the state’s “housing starts,” or increases in its housing supply, which remain low through the end of the decade, but not much worse now than six months previously.
The forecast does not account for slashing up to $880 billion in federal Medicaid spending nationwide, which would have dramatic consequences in Rhode Island, where federal funds supply more than half of the state’s annual Medicaid budget. The updated financial projections also don’t consider other federal funding cuts beyond the firing of 400,000 federal workers, most of whom are not based out of Rhode Island.
The May Revenue and Caseload Estimating Conference continues through May 9, when budget crunchers will update the amount of budget surplus, or deficit, expected heading into fiscal 2026, and beyond.

HB 247, sponsored by Rep. David Standridge, R-Hayden and called the Gulf of America Act, would have required all state and local entities and their employees to refer to the body of water as the “Gulf of America,” following President Donald Trump’s preference.
“We know the president did an executive order changing the name, and all the federal agencies are using that they’ve officially adopted, that the federal agencies have also since that time,” Standridge said to the committee, adding that some states have moved to change the name.

The legislation, which passed the House on April 18, would have also mandated that reasonable efforts be made to update pre-existing resources, unless it imposes an operational or financial burden on the entities. An exception allowed the term “Gulf of Mexico” to be used in academic instruction for historical purposes in public K-12 schools and institutions of higher education.
Democratic senators on the committee asked about the cost of implementing the name change. Senator Merika Coleman, D-Pleasant Grove, said the bill’s fiscal note states it would increase “administrative obligations” of state and local governments, but it does not state the amount.
“We’re supposed to be good stewards of the taxpayers’ dollars. So, do we have any idea how much of this is going to cost the taxpayers?” Coleman asked.
Standridge said “that is unknown” because the bill provides an exception if it would “impose an operational or financial burden” on state and local government.
The committee deadlocked on whether to report the bill on a 4-4 tie, effectively killing it. 
In response to the bill and President Donald Trump’s executive order, the National Maritime Museum of the Gulf of Mexico plans to change its name to the National Maritime Museum of the Gulf. The move was first reported by Lagniappe Daily.
“This change reflects the museum’s commitment to celebrating the rich history, ecology, and economic impact of this incredible body of water. Known by many names throughout its history, the Gulf has played a profound role in shaping the economy and culture of Mobile and other coastal communities from Texas to Florida,” said Karen Poth, executive director, in a statement on Tuesday.
The museum plans to implement the change in stages, according to Jason Johnson, a spokesperson for the Museum.  Physical printed materials will be updated as new orders are placed, and digital platforms are in the process of being changed.
While the name change is not expected to create new costs for the museum, updates to signage could cost approximately $40,000. 
There are currently no plans to update the name in existing or developing exhibits due to the extensive costs involved. Future exhibits will use “Gulf of America,” and an additional exhibit will reflect the name change and the Gulf’s historical names.

Youngkin’s political adviser under fire as extortion allegations rock Virginia GOP

After a Tumblr account with the same name as Reid’s shared sexually explicit images of men, Gov. Glenn Youngkin asked Reid to drop out of the race last Friday. Reid, who wasn’t in any of the online photos and has denied that the account is his, refused, saying he “won’t back down.” He also accused Youngkin’s PAC of extortion and some members of his party of attacking him because of his sexual identity.
“Let’s be honest: It’s because I’m openly gay and I have never bowed down to the establishment and I will not,” Reid said in a video response. 
So-called sex scandals involving heterosexual men are not new in U.S. politics. From dozens of members of Congress to presidents including Thomas Jeffferson, Bill Clinton and Donald Trump, most of their political careers survived scrutiny from constituents and colleagues. 
The same isn’t generally true for women in the political arena, where cultural norms about gender and sexuality have often prompted heightened scrutiny and scorn for female candidates and lawmakers. 
Former California congresswoman Katie Hill resigned after her nude images were shared on a right-wing blog in what she called “a smear campaign built around cyber exploitation,” and her admission of an extramarital affair with a woman campaign staffer. 
Virginia’s own Susanna Gibson faced online harassment and a chorus of calls to drop out of her 2023 state House of Delegates race when her sexually explicit live-stream video with her ex-husband, which they released to a limited audience on a porn site, was recorded and shared widely without their consent. 
“We have that culture of ‘boys will be boys’” said Virginia Wesleyan University professor Leslie Caughell, whose work focuses on the intersection of gender and politics. “Gibson (and others) didn’t get that treatment because ‘women aren’t supposed to do this.’” 
In his recently posted videos since the news broke, Reid has repeatedly emphasized that he is being targeted for his sexuality. 
“He knows that the rules that apply to a heterosexual man don’t apply to him,” Caughell said. 
“I am sickened and outraged at the weeks of veiled accusations and attacks on my family,” Reid said in a video posted to his campaign’s Facebook page Sunday. “I’m not going to continue to answer a never ending parade of questions and false accusations from people who we now know are solely motivated to stage a coup against a gay man, whom they didn’t want to be their nominee, but didn’t have the guts to run against.”
In a form of protest over the controversy, Phil Kazmierczak, a member of Youngkin’s LGBTQ+ Advisory Board, resigned from his position over the weekend.
Kazmierczak said in his resignation letter that he was “deeply shocked” Youngkin “would involve himself in a diabolical attack of this nature.” 
Even as Reid’s campaign emerged, this year’s legislative session showed that many Virginia Republican elected officials do not appear to support same-sex marriage. Though such unions are federally protected by a near-decade-old U.S. Supreme Court ruling, Virginia’s state constitution still has a defunct ban on them. 
A Democrat-led effort to undo this is underway and earlier this year, most Republicans in the House and the state Senate either voted against the measure or abstained from voting. It will need to pass both chambers again next year, where, should Reid become lieutenant governor, he could be a potential tie-breaking vote. All seats in the House are up for election in November.
Democrats have argued that without removing the ban, Virginians’ marriages could be at risk if the Supreme Court reversed its stance on same-sex marriage — a possibility Justice Clarence Thomas has expressed interest in doing.
If Reid were to drop out, the Republican Party of Virginia’s state central committee members would need to select someone to run in his stead. June 17 is the deadline for candidates from both or third parties to qualify for the November ballots. 
 Weaponizing sexuality in political contexts

Like Reid, defying critics to stay in the race is familiar ground for Gibson, who narrowly lost her 2023 House campaign in the competitive 57th District.

Though she said she agreed to her ex-husband’s request to live-stream sex acts on a porn website, they did not consent to it being recorded and shared beyond their initial, limited audience. After an anonymous “Republican operative” sent the content to The Washington Post in 2023 just before early voting started in Virginia, an echo of pundits noted potential uphill battle for her campaign. The Republican Party of Virginia later sent out mailers with screenshots from the live stream. 
She, like Reid, didn’t back down.
But behind the scenes, she endured the trauma of the situation along with subsequent online harassment. She said she’d received death threats and people loitered outside her home during the scandal. At one point a false call was placed to law enforcement, resulting in officers showing up at her house. The act, referred to as “swatting,” is often a tactic to target or harass public figures or activists. 
Following the election, she laid low before later emerging with a PAC dedicated to combatting the nonconsensual sharing of intimate digital images. A model policy the group wrote has been carried and advanced through both Republican and Democrat-leaning states. Gibson consulted with Del. Irene Shin, D-Fairfax, to adjust the statute of limitations on prosecuting “revenge porn” and other such crimes in Virginia. 
At the federal level, a bill to punish people who publish revenge porn — whether actual images of targeted individuals or artificially-generated ones — has recently cleared congress and is on its way to Trump’s desk. 
While the Tumblr account purported to be Reid’s shared other people’s content, it’s unclear if they had consented.
Virginia’s extortion laws make it a crime to threaten a person’s reputation, safety, property or immigration status to gain money, property or financial benefit. It’s a Class 5 felony in the state to use threats, accusations of criminal conduct or the misuse of immigration documents as leverage for personal or monetary gain. Potential legal battles could be on the horizon if Reid does pursue a suit against the governor’s PAC for alleged extortion. Reid’s lawyer has also sent a cease and desist letter to Moran. 
Political analysts have posited that as technology evolves and younger people enter politics, the risk of digital sexual content being used against candidates may increase. The sharing of intimate images to publicly shame or tarnish someone most often happens to women, multiple studies show, but it can happen to anyone. 
Gibson’s perspective on Reid’s predicament is nuanced, she said, because he used his platform as a radio host to call her a “legislative hooker” two years ago during the scandal she was at the center of. Still, she understands the myriad of feelings he may be coping with now as some in his own party have turned on him, and said it’s unacceptable for him to be targeted because he’s gay. 
“The attacks on Reid for his sexual expression are completely inappropriate and incredibly harmful and damaging, not only to him, but to his family and to the democratic process,” she said.
Gibson also took aim at Matt Moran, a Youngkin adviser who is involved with the governor’s PAC. 
“This is the second state election in a row that Matt Moran and Glenn Youngkin have attacked a candidate that they did not like on their sexuality,” she said. “It raises concerns for future elections and leadership of, honestly, both parties being willing to weaponize people’s sexuality and sexual expression in order to achieve some kind of partisan political outcome.” 
From her own experience, to “sexting” that becomes public, to the allegations against Reid which he’s so far denied, she worries these situations may discourage  people from running for office.
It’s something Caughill wonders about too — particularly concerning women and LGBTQ+ prospective politicians.
“It seems like standards for personal behavior don’t apply evenly to all candidates,” she said. “So you have to wonder if you’re a woman or you’re gay and you’re thinking about running, you might have concerns about what somebody could dig up about you to try to make it into an issue.”
As to Reid’s situation specifically, she said it shows where some of his party falls on supporting LGBTQ+ issues and people. Earlier this year, Reid’s ticket-mates Attorney General Jason Miyares and Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears joined Youngkin to boost support for lawmakers’ efforts to ban transgender student athletes from school sports. 
“I think (we’re) seeing some of the Republican Party’s discomfort with many of these transgender and gay issues. Having gay candidates as a voice for their party, at least to some segments, can pose a problem,” Caughell said. “You have to wonder, would Governor Youngkin have been so quick to ask him to step aside if he had been a heterosexual man?”

Kennedy Jr. speaks at a news conference on April 22. (Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. attracted notice — and in some quarters, outrage — for remarks about autism, a topic he’s clashed with scientists about for years.
Kennedy held an April 16 press conference pegged to a new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that found the prevalence of autism rising to 1 in 31 among 8-year-olds, the latest in a series of increases in recent decades.
Kennedy said “autism destroys families” and is an “individual tragedy as well.”
Kennedy said many autistic children were “fully functional” and had “regressed” into autism “when they were 2 years old. And these are kids who will never pay taxes, they’ll never hold a job, they’ll never play baseball, they’ll never write a poem, they’ll never go out on a date. Many of them will never use a toilet unassisted.”
He also said: “Most cases now are severe. Twenty-five percent of the kids who are diagnosed with autism are nonverbal, non-toilet-trained, and have other stereotypical features.”
Medical experts, along with people on the autism spectrum, told PolitiFact that Kennedy’s portrayal was skewed. A 2023 study written by CDC officials and university researchers found that one-quarter of people on the autism spectrum have severe limitations. But this is on the high end of studies, and many people in that one-quarter of the autism population do not have the limitations Kennedy mentioned.
The vast majority of people on the spectrum do not have those severe challenges.
“I wish he would spend some time with parents of other autistic children, and well-regarded scientists who have studied this condition for decades,” said David Mandell, a University of Pennsylvania psychiatry professor and director of the Penn Center for Mental Health. “He has a fixed, myopic view.”
The Department of Health and Human Services did not provide data on what share of people with autism diagnoses are unable to do the things Kennedy described.
“Secretary Kennedy remains committed to working toward a society where people with autism have access to meaningful opportunities, appropriate supports, and the full respect and recognition they deserve,” department press secretary Vianca N. Rodriguez Feliciano told PolitiFact. “His statements emphasized the need for increased research into environmental factors contributing to the rise in autism diagnoses, not to stigmatize individuals with autism or their families.”
The Washington Post reported that an HHS spokesperson said Kennedy “was referring to those that are severely affected by this chronic condition” and that “this was in no way a general characterization.”
We took a closer look at the available data and research.
What is autism spectrum disorder?
At root, “autism is a difference in how your child’s brain works that shapes how they interact with the world around them,” according to the Cleveland Clinic. People with autism diagnoses, the clinic says, “may excel more in certain areas and need more support in other areas compared to their neurotypical peers.”
Over the years, autism’s definition and diagnosis has changed.
In the 1950s and 1960s, “it is very likely that many people with profound autism were misdiagnosed with ‘mental retardation,’ a term in use at the time, or schizophrenia, while other autistic people probably got no diagnosis at all,” said John J. Pitney Jr., a Claremont McKenna College politics professor, author of the book “The Politics of Autism: Navigating the Contested Spectrum,” and a father of an autistic son who’s about to graduate from college.
In more recent decades, the diagnostic criteria for autism have broadened, producing a spectrum ranging from severe impacts to more modest ones. Today’s definition encompasses “individuals with milder symptoms, stronger language skills, and higher IQs,” said Christopher Banks, president and CEO of the Autism Society of America.
How common are the more limiting forms of autism?
Autism’s expanded definition means a minority of people on the spectrum have the kinds of severe limitations Kennedy cited, though it’s hard to say how many.
The highest total we found comes from a 2023 federal report, written by CDC officials and university researchers. It found that 26.7% of 8-year-olds with autism had “profound” autism, a newly framed (and not universally accepted) definition that included children who were nonverbal, were minimally verbal, or had an IQ below 50. (“Average” IQ is considered 90 to 109.)
People with profound autism “will require lifetime, round-the-clock care,” said Judith Ursitti, co-founder and president of the Profound Autism Alliance, a nonprofit. Ursitti said her 21-year-old son “is not headed towards employment or a career in poetry or baseball. Acknowledging this fact is important, as this population is often excluded from media portrayals and research.”
Other estimates are lower.
A study published in 2024, by researchers at the University of Utah and Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, looked at 1,368 U.S. children with autism. When parents were asked whether they would characterize their child’s autism as “severe,” 10.1% said yes. Among this group of children with “severe” autism, a minority — 38% — were classified as having a “severe” intellectual disability.
“Even among those with an intellectual disability, there’s huge variability,” Mandell said. “People with Down syndrome have an intellectual disability but often are quite capable and can do all the things RFK points to.”
The CDC published data in 2020 showing that 42% of people with autism had an IQ in the average or higher range, and another study has found that this figure could be as high as 60%.
Zoe Gross, the director of advocacy at the Autistic Self Advocacy Network, said limited available data suggests that Kennedy’s characterization is exaggerated.
Gross, who is on the spectrum herself, said a 2017 study found that 61% of people on the spectrum who were studied were employed. As for baseball, the Special Olympics, which was founded by Kennedy’s family and includes competitors who are on the spectrum, includes softball. At least two people who played major league baseball, Tarik El-Abour and Jim Eisenreich, were public about their autism diagnoses.
Gross said there is no official data on autistic poets, but she was aware of the poet DJ Savarese, a nonspeaking but highly literate advocate. Gross was also unable to find data on dating, but she said she’s married, and she pointed to the Netflix reality show “Love on the Spectrum,” which follows autistic people’s dating lives. It is now in its third season.
As for not using a toilet unassisted, the 2024 study that analyzed 1,368 U.S. children with autism and found that 10.1% were considered “severe” found that 67% of those in the “severe” category had trouble bathing or dressing, which, if generalizable to the entire autistic population, would be less than 7%. Another study found urinary incontinence reported by 12.5% of the autistic people studied and fecal incontinence by 7.9%.
Eric M. Garcia, who is on the spectrum and who has written the book “We’re Not Broken: Changing the Autism Conversation,” was covering Kennedy’s remarks as Washington bureau chief of The Independent. Hearing his words “felt so demoralizing,” Garcia told PolitiFact. “A lot of people will respond by saying, ‘He didn’t mean autistic people like you.’ But that doesn’t make it any better.”

Judge rejects effort to block noncitizen voting in Burlington

Because school budgets have statewide implications — school budgets are determined locally but are ultimately funded by the state — only U.S. citizens should be allowed to vote on them, the group’s suit claims.Chittenden County Superior Court Judge Samuel Hoar Jr. dismissed the case in February. The RITE group is now asking the state’s highest court to weigh in.The case is being headed by Brady Toensing, a former vice chair of the state GOP who also served in the Department of Justice during President Donald Trump’s first term. Attorneys Patrick Strawbridge and James Hasson are also listed on the appeal.While noncitizen voting is not permitted in federal elections, Vermont is one of several states to allow it in local elections. In addition to Burlington, both Winooski and Montpelier allow noncitizen voting.The national and state branches of the Republican Party sued both of those cities over the issue in 2021, alleging that their noncitizen voting measures were unconstitutional. Both lawsuits were eventually dismissed, though one was appealed. In January 2023, the Vermont Supreme Court upheld a 2022 Washington Superior civil court decision to dismiss the suit against Montpelier. The Supreme Court ruled then that Montpelier’s charter provision did not violate the state’s constitution.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Conservative group challenging noncitizen voting in Burlington appeals to Vermont Supreme Court.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/election-day-burlington-8-20221108.jpg?fit=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-29 16:09:17.570475

The new waiver will allow for the shipment of spent nuclear fuel into Idaho for the purposes of conducting research at Idaho National Laboratory in eastern Idaho, officials said.
The waiver specifically allows for a high burnout nuclear fuel cask from the North Anna Power Station, a commercial nuclear power plant located in Virginia, to be sent to Idaho National Laboratory for research, according to a press release issued Tuesday.

The waiver was necessary because the 1995 settlement agreement called for limiting shipments of, and removing certain types of, spent nuclear fuel in Idaho. 
“The collaborative effort between the state of Idaho, the U.S. Department of Energy, and the Idaho National Laboratory showcases our commitment to advancing nuclear energy research while upholding the goals of the 1995 Settlement Agreement,” Little said in a written statement. 
“We are proud to support innovation in nuclear energy that will support national security and energy independence into the future.”
  Research at INL to support licensing for extended storage of spent fuel at nuclear power plants 

Idaho National Laboratory, or INL, is one of 17 Department of Energy national labs, and it employs or contacts with about 6,400 researchers and support staff. 
Much of the nuclear research and energy research conducted by Idaho National Laboratory occurs at a vast research complex referred to as “the site” that is located in the eastern Idaho desert, between the town of Arco and Idaho Falls.

“Idaho National Laboratory is DOE’s lead lab for nuclear energy research and development, and it is critical that we continue to grow this research capacity and maintain American competitiveness,” U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said in a written statement. “This agreement between the State of Idaho and DOE ensures the lab can continue its cutting-edge research to advance nuclear technology, helping to meet President Trump’s commitment to unleash American energy dominance.” 
In today’s press release, state and federal officials said the research will provide data to support licensing for the extended storage of spent fuel at 54 nuclear power plants in 28 states.
“As the nation’s center for nuclear energy research and development, we look forward to utilizing our unique facilities and expertise to support this critical national need,” Idaho National Laboratory Director John Wagner said in a written statement. “We are thankful to the Department of Energy and the state of Idaho for entrusting us with the safe and secure execution of our vital mission.”

As part of the new waiver, Idaho National Laboratory will also be allowed to safely manage small amounts of spent nuclear fuel from domestic university reactors. Without the waiver, some U.S. universities could have been forced to shut down their research reactors due to limits on spent fuel storage, officials said.
Signed in October 1995 by then-Gov. Phil Batt, the 1995 settlement agreement resolved a lawsuit filed by the state amid public concern about environmental and health resulting from disposal of nuclear waste in Idaho. The lawsuit was filed in order to keep Idaho from becoming a dumping ground for the country’s spent nuclear fuel, according to the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality.  
The new waiver relaxes the annual limit on the amount of spent nuclear fuel and materials that can come into Idaho, officials said. The shipment could occur in 2027 under the waiver.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)A bill that would ensure that credits earned from prison-based classes count toward professional licensing requirements has passed in the Florida House of Representatives and is headed to Gov. Ron DeSantis’ desk for consideration.
The House on Tuesday unanimously passed the Senate version (SB 472), sponsored by Central Florida Republican Keith Truenow, which passed unanimously in that chamber earlier this month.
The measure requires the Correctional Education Program (CEP) within the Department of Corrections to provide educational programming to inmates in state correctional facilities. The CEP provides 92 career and technical education courses in 37 vocational trades that are aligned to Florida’s in-demand occupations, including barbering, cosmetology, electrical contracting, landscaping, plumbing, and HVAC contracting, according to a bill analysis.
The CEP has awarded 36,689 certificates and industry-recognized credentials over the last four years. However, these certificates were largely only valid while the people receiving them were incarcerated, and they are not recognized outside of prison, according to the Florida Policy Institute.
The House measure (HB 195) is sponsored by Miami-Dade Democrat Kevin Chambliss and Seminole County Republican Rachel Plakon.
“I’m reminded of the women who are girlfriends, who are wives and even the moms of the loved ones who are incarcerated,” said Plakon. “And the theme that comes up again and again is hope. They say, ‘Please give them something to hope for.’ And I think they’re right, because when someone has served their time and they want to choose a different path, let’s give them the education, let’s give them something to hope for a second chance.”
Chambliss has sponsored a version of this bill for the past several sessions, calling it a “labor of love.”
“We know that our prisons are overcrowded, but we also know that our  labor force has in-demand jobs that are readily available. This bill addresses that,” he said.
The measure is similar to a proposal that Gov. DeSantis vetoed last year, with one major omission.
In his veto message, DeSantis specifically referred to a provision that would have reduced the time from five years to three years that the Barbers’ Board and Board of Cosmetology could use a criminal conviction as ground to deny licenses. He wrote in his message that “there may be good reason for the board to have this information before making a decision regarding a particular applicant.”
This year’s bill does not include that provision.

(Photo by Leah Romero / Source NM)Former Doña Ana County Magistrate Court Judge Jose Luis “Joel” Cano and his wife, Nancy Cano, were released on separate $10,000 bonds Tuesday in connection to federal charges of tampering with evidence in an immigration case.
The Canos appeared in U.S. Federal District Court in Las Cruces Tuesday before U.S. Magistrate Judge Gregory J. Fouratt. Joel Cano faces one charge of tampering with evidence while Nancy Cano faces a charge of conspiracy to tamper with evidence. The couple’s charges relate to their alleged connection to Cristhian Ortega-Lopez, a Venezuelan national prosecutors allege resides in the U.S. unlawfully and has connections to the Tren de Aragua gang. 
The Canos have been in custody at the Doña Ana County Detention Center since Friday, according to the jail’s website. They appeared in court Tuesday in shackles, alongside over 70 other people facing criminal charges who were waiting to have their cases heard. The room had standing room only, and viewers included several of the Canos’ neighbors.
Fouratt agreed to release both defendants on $10,000 secured bonds, on the condition that they: provide DNA samples; notify the court of any address changes; surrender their passports and eschew new travel documents; don’t associate with Ortega-Lopez and avoid contact with possible witnesses to the case; don’t leave Doña Ana County without his approval; and provide pretrial service officials with information about their renters.
The Canos told Fouratt that they own nine rental properties and all but one are occupied. The judge said they must ensure they rent only to U.S. citizens or immigrants legally allowed to live in the U.S. Fouratt also said they must provide pretrial services with information about their renters and any overnight guests outside of immediate family.
The judge permitted the couple to continue to reside together in their long-time home, despite prosecutors’ worries that they might discuss the case. Fouratt said he could not legally restrict topics of conversation between married couples. 
“I want you to have a chance to convince any other judge you see” that the decisions the couple made related to this case were outside of their usual “decision-making,” Fouratt said during the hearing.
The U.S. Department of Justice announced the charges against the Canos in the same news release in which they announced the arrest of a Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Hannah C. Dugan for allegedly allowing a Mexican immigrant charged with domestic violence to temporarily avoid arrest by federal agents.
The Canos have not yet entered pleas to the charges, and neither of them have yet been scheduled for an arraignment hearing, according to court records.

District 12 is solidly Republican. According to election results, Harbison did not face opposition when he was elected in 2014 or in 2018. However, James Fields, a Democrat, ran against Harbison in 2022 where Harbison won 85% of the vote.

The deadline for qualifying with major political parties is 5 p.m. on May 13. The deadline for all independent candidates and minor parties is 5 p.m. on July 15.
“This special election is an important opportunity to help shape the future of your community – so, if you are in House District 12, make sure to get out and vote,” Ivey said in the release.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Gov. Dan McKee and top health care officials unveiled a new set of plans to mend Rhode Island’s ailing primary care system Tuesday, with strategies like grants for helping clinics serve more patients and asking big commercial insurers to pay more.
The Ocean State’s dearth of primary care doctors won’t be solved entirely, or even quickly. And the plan announced at a State House news conference by McKee and his Health Care System Planning Cabinet came a day before Anchor Medical Associates closes its Warwick office with two more set to close by June 30.
“We know that fixing these challenges will not happen overnight,” said Richard Charest, secretary of the Rhode Island Executive Office of Health and Human Services (EOHHS). “These problems have developed over very many years, and we take and it will take time to rectify that.” 
The state is short about 300 primary care providers, according to Dr. Elizabeth Lange, a pediatrician at Hasbro who attended the conference. 
The all payer claims database shows Rhode Island currently has about 520 primary care providers, said Dr. Jerry Larkin, the state health department’s director.
“So right now, we’re a little bit short,” Larkin told the crowd.
Solutions offered — like bigger primary care payments from commercial insurers, speeding up the Medicaid rate review process, and $5 million in grants for primary care practices — are all part of what McKee called “a full deep dive into all factors that are related to primary care delivery.”
“There’s still important work ahead, and we remain steadfast in our commitment to identify other strategies to strengthen our primary care system,” McKee said. “We know that it is alarming when people in the state of Rhode Island are unable to find a primary care doctor, and we’re going to do everything we can to connect them with the help that they are looking for.”
Anchor Medical Associates on Wednesday will close its Warwick office — the first of the physician group’s three locations which will all be shuttered by June 30. The Anchor closures announced earlier in April will affect about 25,000 patients, mostly children, who now need to find new primary care doctors. Charest told reporters he’d “rather not get into the specifics of that practice,” but characterized the closure being due to “internal operational challenges.”
“If we had been notified earlier, we may have been able to help stabilize that practice,” Charest said. “I think that they were at a position that they had no liquidity at the end.”


McKee’s big ideas to tackle primary care crisis
Accelerating Medicaid rate review for primary care.
Requiring commercial health insurers to increase funding for primary care reimbursements
Reducing red tape by easing prior authorization requirements
Providing grants to help primary care practices serve additional patients and hire new providers
Strengthening fiscal oversight of Rhode Island’s health care system
Expanding the primary care student loan forgiveness program


Low reimbursement the state’s Medicaid program pays providers have frequently been cited as a major contributing factor in the state’s primary care troubles. McKee said he is moving to stabilize the state’s primary care system by filing a budget amendment that would require the Office of the Health Insurance Commissioner (OHIC) to complete the primary care provider rate review process on an accelerated timeline. The rate review would be completed within a year instead of the usual two afforded to the rate review process for human services.
Cory King, the health insurance commissioner, said the rate review would be completed by September 2026 on the new timeline.   
“I don’t set rates. I make recommendations after data driven analysis,” King said. 
That data and King’s recommendations inform EOHHS’ annual budget ask of the governor, which is submitted to the General Assembly in January. If the budget passes with the rates intact, it then goes to the federal government, which pays about half of Medicaid rate increases. If approved by the feds, the rate increases would take effect at the start of fiscal year 2028.
“There’s some administrative tasks that have to happen before the actual rates are implemented,” Kristin Sousa, the Medicaid program director, told reporters. “Traditionally, when the legislature passes the budget, it’s effective on July 1. In this case, July 1 of 2027, we may not be ready to implement on July 1, but it will retro back to July 1.”
Several studies published on primary care in Rhode Island in recent years, including a 2024 study by the Rhode Island Foundation, have found the Ocean State’s reimbursement rates lag far behind Connecticut and Massachusetts. Could that data be used to inform the rate review process?
“I would say, ‘Share the data with us.’ Cuz I haven’t seen it,” McKee said.
King encouraged people to dig into that report’s numbers a little more. The Rhode Island Foundation report was not exclusively focused on provider reimbursement, he said, but rather “hospitals and patient and operation services.” Yes, reimbursement rates in other New England states are higher, King said, but this is consistent with higher health insurance premiums in those states. 










We know that it is alarming when people in the state of Rhode Island are unable to find a primary care doctor, and we’re going to do everything we can to connect them with the help that they are looking for. 


– Gov. Dan McKee


“In Massachusetts, of the 53 hospitals in the inpatient data set, only six hospitals are actually reimbursed at or above the statewide average, And in Connecticut, of the 26 hospitals in the inpatient data set, only eight of those 26 hospitals are reimbursed at or above that statewide average. So there are great variations that we need to consider when looking at reimbursement rates more granularly.”
Still, King cited the importance of primary care investment as a preventative measure for even more health care spending.
“My position has always been that putting money into primary care is a wise investment, as opposed to, say, putting money into emergency department reimbursement,” King said. “Primary care accounts for approximately 6% of what commercial payers pay for health care business services, but it helps control the other 94%.”
For a more immediate fix, McKee is proposing $5 million in grants to help existing practices serve more patients. Clinics can apply for up to $75,000 to take on new patients or up to $300,000 to hire primary care physicians or “mid-level” providers such as nurse practitioners or physician assistants. 
Applications for grants are available online through May 16.
Separately, the state is imposing new regulations on commercial insurers requiring them to double their primary care spending by 2029. The rules also mandate a 20% reduction in prior authorization requirements to help lower administrative burdens on primary care doctors.
‘Slapdash response’ comes too late
Rhode Island Attorney General Peter F. Neronha blasted McKee’s plans in a press release issued about 40 minutes after the press conference ended. 
“The Governor’s health care announcement today is a slapdash response to political and public pressure because of the dissolution of Anchor Medical, and unfortunately, I expected nothing more,” Neronha said.
Neronha, who has established himself as one of McKee’s most vocal critics, said the governor is “hanging his hat” on conducting future studies and reviews. 
“Our PCPs are overworked and overburdened by a state health care system that doesn’t support them,” Neronha said. “Our residents are scrambling to find primary care physicians to care for them through illnesses and fill prescriptions for live-preserving medications. We are in crisis. And some of us have been sounding the alarm for years.”
McKee said at the press event that Rhode Island surpasses many other states for health care access in quality, citing U.S. News and World Report’s ranking of Rhode Island as fifth in the nation in health care overall.
Neronha took issue with McKee’s rosy outlook, saying McKee was “once again showing how out of touch this Governor is with the reality of the situation.”

The resolution comes the same day Trump is slated to return to Michigan in his first visit to the state since retaking the White House last November, with a scheduled rally at Macomb Community College.
Ahead of introducing the resolution Tuesday in the Michigan House, state legislators issued statements decrying Trump for violations of the U.S. Constitution, namely forgoing legal processes in recent deportations. 
The resolution that Democratic state lawmakers are proposing specifically outlines the March deportation of Maryland resident Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, where the U.S. Supreme Court has ordered Trump’s administration to “facilitate” his return, which it has not complied with.
Salvadoran officials allow Van Hollen, Abrego Garcia to meet

The Trump administration’s decision to suddenly and without explanation revoke student visas for international students at the University of Michigan, Michigan State University and Grand Valley State University is also cause for concern, the resolution reads. And with Trump expressing interest in deporting legal U.S. citizens who are convicted of crimes, the resolution raises concerns that Trump is bypassing the justice system, denying residents protection from government overreach. 
“These cases are representative of a larger policy of reckless abuse of authority to undermine due process and, in turn, the protection of other fundamental American rights such as free speech and freedom of assembly,” the resolution proposed by Michigan state legislators reads.
It is the U.S. House of Representatives sole right to present articles of impeachment outlining supposed offenses by the president and the U.S. Senate’s sole right to hold a subsequent impeachment trial.
The Michigan state House of Representatives has very little oversight on the actions of Trump or his administration, Rep. Dylan Wegela (D-Garden City) said in a statement sponsoring the resolution supporting impeachment. But state lawmakers are very aware of the sentiments of their districts, Wegela said, and as Trump and his administration act like they are above the checks and balances of government and exempt from the processes of the U.S. legal system, it is the right of state lawmakers to sound alarm bells.
 “Our communities are under assault by this administration, and members of Congress need to take this seriously,” Wegela said. “It is unthinkable that a president would send innocent people to a foreign country’s prison known for its human rights violations. The constitution is clear in regards to due process and the freedom of speech for residents of the United States.”
The news release from Wegela’s office said Reps. Jason Morgan (D-Ann Arbor), Laurie Pohutsky (D-Livonia) and Jimmie Wilson Jr. (D-Ypsilanti) have signed on as cosponsors, as well as several others.
The state resolution follows Thanedar’s introduction Monday of a resolution presenting the necessary articles of impeachment to begin an impeachment process, outlining what he called, “unlawful actions [that] have subverted the justice system, violated the separation of powers, and placed personal power and self-interest above public service.”
Both the U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Senate are under Republican control, making any action of Thanedar’s effort unlikely.

Attorneys for the state filed court documents stating their intention to petition the nation’s highest court to overturn a decision from an appellate court that found a state election law conflicted with federal election laws. 
U.S. District Judge Louis Guirrola halted all lower court action until the proceedings with the Supreme Court are completed. 
The Republican National Committee, the state Republican Party and the Libertarian Party of Mississippi sued Secretary of State Michael Watson and local elections officials over a state law that allows election workers to process absentee ballots postmarked by Election Day for up to five days after the election. 
The political parties argue that Congress is the only entity that can set specific parameters for federal elections, while state officials contend that federal law defers to states on specific details for conducting elections.
Judge Guirrola initially ruled in favor of the state, but the plaintiffs appealed. A three-judge panel of the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, one of the most conservative appellate courts in the nation, overturned Guirrola’s ruling and struck down the state law. 
Now Mississippi officials are asking the Supreme Court to uphold the state law, a decision that could have broad implications for more than a dozen states that have similar laws on the books. 
The litigation does not impact state or local races, including Mississippi’s current municipal elections. Mississippi’s next federal election will be the 2026 midterm, where all four of Mississippi’s U.S. House members are up for reelection, as well as U.S. Sen.

Glenn Youngkin's Spirit of Virginia PAC. (Photo courtesy of John Reid) In a stunning escalation of Virginia’s Republican infighting, Matt Moran — head of Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s Spirit of Virginia PAC — has emerged as the central figure blamed for the widening rift between the governor and John Reid, the GOP nominee for lieutenant governor.
After Reid publicly accused Spirit of Virginia of extortion Sunday without naming Moran, his campaign lawyers fired a cease and desist letter directly at Moran Monday evening, accusing him of making “false and defamatory statements” about Reid — and threatening further legal action. 
Moran has declined multiple requests for comment. 
Meanwhile, pressure is building inside the party for accountability. Several GOP officials are urging the Republican Party of Virginia’s Executive Committee to confidentially review the explicit images that Moran allegedly showed Youngkin — images that reportedly convinced the governor to personally ask Reid to drop out of the race.
The result is a crisis that threatens not only to fracture Virginia Republicans months before Election Day but also to severely damage Youngkin’s national ambitions.
 Reid strikes back

The controversy escalated after Reid, a conservative radio host and the first openly gay statewide candidate from either party in Virginia, posted a spirited video Sunday afternoon on X, formerly Twitter.
“I had certainly hoped that we could put the bigotry and ugliness of last week behind us and unify our Republican ticket this year,” Reid said. “But shockingly, once again representatives of my campaign have been told by the leader of Governor Youngkin’s political organization that the attacks on me will continue unless I drop out of the race for lieutenant governor.”
Hours later, Reid’s legal team delivered a cease-and-desist letter to Moran, laying out accusations of defamation, extortion and reckless disregard for the truth.
“It has come to our attention that you provided information accusing our client of owning a Tumblr account containing unsavory images to multiple news organizations,” the letter reads. 
“While this account shared a common username with our client’s Instagram, he is not and never has been associated with the account.”
Reid’s attorneys said Moran crossed the line into defamation because the statements were “knowingly untrue,” and warned that “continued publication of these false claims would constitute actual malice.”
In a particularly damning passage, the letter alleged that Moran made direct threats in an April 27 conversation with Reid: “You literally said ‘him getting out of the race is the only way it stops.’”
The lawyers further argued that Moran’s accusations gave rise to defamation and defamation per se, noting that falsely alleging Reid was linked to criminal behavior “is so egregious that it is assumed to harm the plaintiff’s reputation without further need to prove harm.”
They demanded Moran “immediately cease and desist” from making or publishing any additional false claims, and instructed him to preserve all documents related to the case, including communications with consulting firms and journalists.
 GOP officials demand action

As the legal drama escalated, some Republican officials across the state voiced alarm at Moran’s handling of the situation — and called for transparency.
In a joint email sent to Republican Party of Virginia Chairman Mark Peake obtained by The Mercury, Rick Buchanan, chairman of the 5th Congressional District GOP Committee, and John Massoud, his counterpart in the 6th District, urged the party leadership to allow members of the State Central Committee’s Executive Committee to review any alleged evidence confidentially.
“As leaders of the Republican Party of Virginia, we are very concerned about our upcoming elections,” Buchanan and Massoud wrote. “Accusations have been made about our Lt. Governor nominee that are very serious. People are lining up on each side behind either the accuser or the accused, yet the evidence behind the allegations being made have not been forthcoming.”
They stressed the need for unity, warning, “In order for us to win this November, this affair must be put behind us. … Giving us the actual facts will make that possible.”
In a phone interview Tuesday, Buchanan went even further, telling The Mercury that Youngkin must fire Moran to salvage party unity.
“Either way we come out of this, it has caused a lot of turmoil within the party,” he said. “And I am very disappointed that the governor would listen to (Moran) without knowing the facts.”
Amid the unfolding controversy, an event scheduled for Wednesday at Atlas 42 in Henrico County featuring the full Republican statewide ticket — with Youngkin billed as a special guest — was abruptly canceled.
But Reid, undeterred, confirmed in a text message Tuesday that he still plans to go forward with the rally, even without his running mates.
 Moran silent as criticism mounts

In a text message Tuesday, Moran declined to comment. 
But Virginia GOP figures like Casey Flores, founder of the Richmond chapter of the Log Cabin Republicans, the nation’s largest Republican organization dedicated to representing LGBTQ conservatives, made clear that Moran’s position is becoming untenable.
“I think that this is blowing back on Governor Youngkin and Matt Moran more than they ever expected,” Flores said in a phone interview. “Matt’s being kind of the one-hit wonder — he had Youngkin’s victory in 2021, but I think Youngkin won in spite of him, not because of him.”
Flores accused Moran of trying to “scuttle anything that doesn’t make him money” and said his actions were now damaging the party’s broader chances.
“In the age of Trump, people really don’t care about all this, even if the accusations against John Reid were true, which they are not,” Flores said. “Firing Matt really is the only appropriate thing for Governor Youngkin to do.”

Moran, 36, has been a fixture in Virginia politics for over a decade. After managing one rural delegate’s campaign and serving as a legislative aide for another, he rose quickly — first as spokesman for then-House Speaker William J. Howell, R-Stafford, then as chief of staff to Speaker Kirk Cox, R-Colonial Heights.
He later joined Youngkin’s campaign and served as director of policy and legislative affairs in the governor’s office — but notably without taking a salary from the state. Instead, Moran stayed on leave from two consulting firms he had ownership interests in: Creative Direct and Link Public Affairs.
Critics said the arrangement created serious conflicts of interest.
“There’s certainly a cause for him to try to make money, both within the administration and outside of Spirit of Virginia through his other companies,” Scott Pio, chairman of the Loudoun County GOP Committee, said in a phone interview.
Pio, whose committee hosted a rally for Reid in Sterling Monday evening, suggested that Moran’s dual loyalties allowed him to shape Virginia policy while benefiting financially. 
“Since Matt doesn’t have a statewide client, he decides to throw this bomb,” Pio said, referencing the Reid controversy, which blew up just days after Fairfax County Supervisor Pat Herrity — a client of Moran’s — dropped out for health reasons last week. 
He also argued that firing Moran was a necessary step to rebuild trust: “Youngkin being a businessman, he should know when to hire and fire quickly. He should not keep people around that are being inappropriate.”
 Youngkin’s 2028 calculus and GOP damage control

Even before the Reid episode, Moran’s unpaid status within the administration had drawn scrutiny. In 2022, Youngkin’s chief counsel Richard Cullen in an interview with The Washington Post defended Moran’s arrangement, saying, “He would have been the hottest guy in Richmond (for lobbying). But Matt did the opposite and to his financial detriment.”
Moran declined an interview request for the same story but at the time issued a statement through Youngkin’s press office defending his arrangement. 
“I am on leave from all companies and as a result do not have clients with business before the governor or state government,” Moran said. “I formalized this arrangement with counsel’s office and I am fully committed to my service to the governor and the people of Virginia. It is a privilege to have the opportunity to serve the governor and work on behalf of the commonwealth.” 
His statement did not explain why he chose to forgo a state salary.
Now, however, political observers say Moran’s continued presence could be politically fatal — not just in Virginia, but nationally, as Youngkin positions himself for a possible 2028 White House run.
David Richards, a political science professor at the University of Lynchburg, said the scandal “has done tremendous damage” to Youngkin and the GOP in Virginia.
“It reveals a real limit to Youngkin’s power in the state GOP and has exposed an ugly underbelly of the Republican party here,” Richards said. “Someone in Youngkin’s circle will have to take the fall. It does not look like Reid will bow out.”
Richards also noted the ongoing silence from Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, the GOP nominee for governor, who has yet to comment publicly on the controversy engulfing her running mate.
“Her response so far raises a lot of questions about her ability to lead and make tough choices,” Richards said.
As of Tuesday afternoon, Youngkin, Earle-Sears, and Spirit of Virginia continued to dodge public comment. Reid, meanwhile, remains defiant and shows no sign of abandoning the ticket.

The crime novel explores the theme of Native American women who are missing or murdered.
Rendon is a member of the White Earth Nation in northwest Minnesota who now lives in Minneapolis.
  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
The story begins with the protagonist, Quill, a Native American wife and mother of two, who is jogging on the reservation when she hears a woman scream. That scream sends her into panic, which later leads to an investigation.
Rendon told the admiring audience that she is a crime junkie who loves to create page-turners, and that her goal with the new book wasn’t to provide a sociological study of indigenous life, but to tell a good story.
However, Rendon framed the book’s accounts of missing Native American women taken from a reservation and an infant kidnapped from a Walmart to the movement recognizing the issue of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Relatives (MMIW/R) 
Early on, Crow, Quill’s husband, expresses concern about his wife risking her safety chasing  down information on the possible identity of the woman she heard screaming:
“We’ve been hearing these horror stories of four thousand, maybe five thousand women missing across Canada. Missing down here. The stories of what has happened to women and children” – he emphasized children – “in the man camps over the Dakotas. And they are here now.” He jabbed two fingers onto the table when he said the word now. “Those same men are here now.” He jabbed the table again. “I don’t want anyone from my family to go missing. To end up dead in a ditch or a river. No. Not on my watch.”
When the book club members had an opportunity to ask Rendon questions, they didn’t focus on the plotline of the story but on the larger MMIW/R issue, what’s behind it and what could be done to address it.
In mainstream culture, Rendon responded, Native Americans are seen as invisible and their problems have not been taken as seriously.
“When I go out East to talk, most people out there think we’re all dead; that we disappeared with, I don’t know, the Black Hills gold rush, which also makes it easier for us to disappear if people don’t think we exist,” she said. “How can you disappear if you don’t exist?”
Although the MMIW/R issue has benefited from more public discussions, such as the upcoming May 5 MMIW/R Day of Awareness, Rendon said, when she was recently in Madison, she met a college professor who had never heard of the issue.
“Where They Last Saw Her” is an example of a work of fiction that raises awareness of a real crisis and provides insights into subcultures and their struggles.
In 2018, as part of a statewide program called Wisconsin Reads, several book clubs around the state collectively read and discussed “The Round House” by Louise Erdrich, a member of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians in North Dakota. That book also raised awareness of struggles on Native American reservations and, in particular, the complication of prosecuting a crime when there are competing jurisdictional authorities between a tribal nation and county and state authorities.
Rendon is also the author of the “Cash Blackbear” series, which involves a Native American 19-year-old woman who solves crimes in the Red River area of Minnesota/North Dakota in the 1970s. She said her editor at Bantam asked her about writing another book outside the series.
“She said, ‘Well, what’s the current issue in Indian Country?’ and I said, ‘missing and murdered Indian women.’”
However, Rendon was initially reluctant to write a story around the MMIW/R issue.
“I said, ‘there’s no resolution. If somebody’s missing or murdered, there’s no happy ending,” she said. “There’s no resolution to the story. They’re either dead or they’re still missing.’”
Rendon’s story is set in Minnesota at a fictional tribe on the outskirts of Duluth, Minnesota, where in real life there had been a major pipeline project on a reservation in the area, like the one in her book — the replacement of Line 3 by Enbridge on the Fond du Lac Reservation, completed in 2021.
Prior to the Line 3 permit being approved, there had been concerns by Native American groups about man camps and violence and harassment against Native women.
A 2021 article by The Guardian, “Sexual violence along pipeline route follows Indigenous women’s warnings,” reported that a local crisis center for survivors of violence had “received more than 40 reports about Line 3 workers harassing and assaulting women and girls who live in northwestern Minnesota.”
Rene Ann Goodrich, a member of the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians, and a member of the Wisconsin MMIW/R Task Force is one of several Ojibwe women from Northern Wisconsin who have also expressed concern over Enbridge replacing a portion of Line 5, currently located on the Bad River Reservation, but Enbridge has filed for permits to build outside the reservation. Besides environmental concerns, the new project could result in a man camp in the area and possible assaults against Native women.
Rendon said there is a strong relationship between the extractive industry and the MMIW/R issue, and she makes a strong correlation between the two in her book.
“Anytime you have an extractive industry, like the pipelines, gold mines, uranium mines, anytime you have an extractive industry where large groups of men are pulled in to do the extraction, there’s no police force. They show up without their wives and families. They show up without ministers or priests. It’s just like the Wild West,” she said. “There has to be something done about the extractive industries and this use of men in large groups to actually go out and do these extractive industries. I don’t know how you change this. But I think that awareness is a piece of it.”
However, Rendon said she had heard that some oil companies have responded to concerns about man camps by putting men up in hotels with their families.
“Talk about the power of women, right? Bringing your wife and she’ll make you go to church,” she said.
Rendon said it was vital for her to portray Native American women in a community. In the story, three women, Quill and her friends Punk and Gaylyn, often travel together as they pursue information about missing women or help with searches.
“In Native communities, you almost never do anything alone,” she said. “You know, if I’m going to go to the grocery store, somebody’s with me. There’s one family that, if you see them at the pow wow —  if you see them at the grocery store, if you see them downtown, in the courthouse —  it’s the mom, the grandma, the kids, you know; it’s like, it’s a whole group,” she said.
Regarding Native women and community, Rendon notes it was Indigenous/First Nation women in Canada who first gathered together and spoke out about the phenomenon of Indigenous women missing around the man camps of oil pipelines and mining operations.
“I knew that in this story about missing and murdered Indian women, what was important to me was a community of women, and so I knew that it wasn’t going to be just one person,” she said.
Rendon said she has received some criticism for including a male Native American who is abusive.
“We have bad people in our communities, too,” she said, “and then there’s the thing about domestic abuse, it happens in every community and in smaller communities. People know that it happens, but people don’t talk about it, or there’s this secrecy and stuff that happens around it.”
In Minnesota, the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) reports there were 716 Indigenous persons missing in that state in 2024, 57% of whom were women.
In Wisconsin the exact number of missing Indigenous persons is not published, in part because the state does not have a clearinghouse like Minnesota for gathering that data.
Rendon praised efforts in Minnesota to create an MMIW/R office that tracks MMIW/R cases, works with families, and provides support and even rewards for information. And she noted that in Minneapolis, the Indigenous Protectors Movement, a branch of the American Indian Movement, is active in putting out flyers and organizing searches for missing persons.
In researching the novel, Rendon said she was surprised by how often white women who went missing were blamed for causing their own victimization through their behavior, including having multiple sexual partners. In Native American communities, she said, there isn’t that cloud of guilt over women.
“The Native community clearly has said, ‘I don’t care what our women were doing, nobody deserves to be trafficked. Nobody deserves to end up dead in a ditch or in a gunny sack in the Red River Valley,’” she said. “So there’s a difference, a cultural difference that I saw, which surprised me.”

The proposal, Senate Bill 484, would allow employers to obtain an injunction and temporary restraining order against anyone who protests at their place of business to the extent of “hindering or preventing” work, using threats or force, or blocking workplace entrances, exits, or public roads and streets. It amends an existing law that centers on protecting employees from harassment, stalking, and violence.
Among the forms of relief available to judges in the bill are no-contact orders and prohibitions on visiting the workplace, punishable as contempt of court, which would open violators to fines and jail time.
“What Senate Bill 484 strives to achieve is a balance between those who want to peacefully protest and those who actually want to go to work and earn a living uninhibited by those that are protesting,” said Sen. Tim Moffitt (R-Henderson), a primary sponsor of the bill.
The bill comes amid a flurry of labor activity around the state as union efforts has risen in recent years, with the number of union election petitions nationally doubling from 2021 in the most recent fiscal year. In February, North Carolina saw a high-profile union election at Garner’s Amazon warehouse that spurred protest events from labor activists, though demonstrators gathered across the street from the warehouse rather than near any entrances or exits.
In an interview after the committee vote, Duke professor and labor organizer Orin Starn said he feels the bill aims to “discourage workplace demonstrations and picketing” regardless of the conduct of protesters.

A participant in the efforts to unionize the Amazon warehouse, Starn said employers already have “plenty of protections” when it comes to protests on their property. He noted that some members of the Amazon union campaign were arrested for trespassing by Garner police when they tried to collect union cards and give out food on the premises.
“This bill seems very much about weaponizing the law to keep workers from organizing,” Starn said. “Workers are already afraid of retaliation because there are minimal protections right now for workers who are trying to organize.”
Sen. Terence Everitt (D-Wake) asked whether protests at Tesla dealerships — which have drawn large crowds around the country as demonstrators have denounced CEO Elon Musk’s actions in the Trump administration — would be permitted by the bill so long as they remain peaceful and do not include threats or obstruction. Moffitt confirmed they would be.
Sen. Mujtaba Mohammed (D-Mecklenburg) proposed two amendments seeking to clarify the scope of the bill, aiming to avoid any prohibitions on federally protected labor activity. The first defines obstruction as a “sustained or deliberate physical blockage” that disrupts operations or public safety, and the second excludes from the bill any peaceful demonstrations, informational pickets, or protected labor activity — provided they do not rise to the level of violence, threats, or obstruction.
Both amendments passed, though Sen. Lisa Grafstein (D-Wake) said she still held concerns that workers may be intimidated from participating in labor protests by the messaging around the bill.
“We have a lot of efforts underway to protect employee rights, and I think it’s important that they not be limited or people be intimidated from participating in those,” Grafstein said. “I believe there are some aspects of this bill that could continue to intimidate people from engaging in peaceful protests.”
The bill is will proceed to a vote before the Senate Rules Committee, where it could then be scheduled for a hearing on the Senate floor.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/IMG_0607-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-29 15:08:12.243809

A lawsuit over a Des Moines Register poll that showed Kamala Harris leading Donald Trump in Iowa during the final days of the 2024 campaign has been moved to federal court.
The lawsuit, one of two related to the poll, is a potential class-action case filed by the Center for American Rights on behalf of one West Des Moines man, Dennis Donnelly, against the Register, pollster J. Ann Selzer, and the newspaper’s parent company, Gannett Co. It seeks actual damages totaling $2,799,600 — the alleged cost of an annual subscription for each of the Register’s 40,000 subscribers — plus punitive damages and attorneys’ fees.
Because the lawsuit involves litigants headquartered in different states, and the total damages could exceed $5 million, the Register’s parent company, Gannett Co., sought removal of the case from state court to U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa.

The lawsuit takes issue with a Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll that Selzer conducted for the Register in the final days of the 2024 presidential campaign. The poll, published the Sunday before the election, showed Harris leading Trump among likely Iowa voters 47% to 44%. Trump went on to win Iowa with 56% of the vote to Harris’ 43%.
The lawsuit alleges “a miss by 16 points is not an innocent error — it is either intentional fraud or reckless disregard for accuracy. Either way it is actionable.” It is based on the Center for American Rights’ claim that Donnelly, a Register subscriber, “was intensely frustrated by the inaccurate poll,” which was published on the Sunday before the election. It alleges Donnelly “felt like the Register was disserving him and other readers when it ran, and when its results were compared to the final outcome.”
The lawsuit seeks damages for alleged consumer fraud, professional malpractice and interference with the right to vote. The latter claim is based on the argument that “it looks like the Iowa Poll did, in fact, increase Iowa public opinion favoring Harris to win the state.”
The defendants in the case have denied any wrongdoing and the lawsuit has yet to win class-action status.
Donnelly’s lawsuit parallels one filed by Trump 
A separate lawsuit against the Register and Selzer over the same poll results was filed late last year on behalf of Trump, U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, and former state senator Brad Zaun in Polk County District Court. Like the lawsuit filed on behalf of Donnelly, Trump’s lawsuit has since been moved to federal court.
In that lawsuit, Trump and his co-plaintiffs claim the poll results in their races were intentionally skewed and that in the presidential race “Selzer was trying to generate fake enthusiasm and momentum for Harris.”
The defendants are seeking dismissal of the lawsuit, arguing the laws they are accused of violating are designed to regulate commercial businesses, not to constrain news reporting, and that polling results “do not qualify as falsified facts” merely because they don’t align with an election’s outcome.
“In our constitutional system, a claim for ‘fraudulent news’ does not exist. Full stop,” attorneys for the newspaper argue. “The remedy for disagreement with political speech one does not like is counter-speech — not court-enforced damages under the guise of commercial regulations.”
In that same case, the Center for American Rights recently asked permission to file a brief of its own in the matter, arguing that its lawsuit on behalf of Donnelly was based on largely the same issues and that the center hopes to challenge “the use and abuse of powerful and entrenched media institutions to distort our national debate.”
U.S. Magistrate Judge William P. Kelly ruled against the center two weeks ago, finding that while the center clearly had an interest in Trump’s lawsuit, the “core arguments” the center would make have already been made by the president and his fellow plaintiffs in the case.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Education Minnesota, the state’s largest union representing more than 86,000 members, elected its first Black president on Saturday.
Monica Byron ran unopposed to replace Denise Specht, who led the union since 2013. Byron started her career as a homeschool liaison for the Richfield Public Schools in 1995 before earning her teaching license. She taught elementary school in Richfield for 24 years, most recently as a math coach. In 2022, she left her teaching job when she was elected vice president of Education Minnesota.
Bryon takes over one of the state’s most influential unions at a critical juncture for public schools. More than 8 in 10 schools report having a shortage of teachers, and the union wants to increase pay to fill the ranks. But a looming budget deficit is tying the hands of state lawmakers who might otherwise support robust increases in school funding. At the federal level, the Trump administration has threatened to eliminate the Department of Education while also attacking unions.
This conversation was edited for length and clarity. 
Why did you run for president of the union?
I ran for president because I believe in the power of our union and to protect and strengthen things that matter most, like professional pay, secure pensions, affordable health care and respect for all of our educators.
You are the first Black president of Education Minnesota. What does that mean for your union and also organized labor in Minnesota?
I am really proud and honored to be the first Black president of Education Minnesota. I believe that I’m able to bring a unique and fresh perspective and voice to not only Education Minnesota but to the labor movement. I’ll be able to advocate not only for educators, but for our students and our community. And I’ll be able to ensure that all educators, but especially our educators of color, will have a voice.
The Trump administration has vowed to close the Department of Education and has threatened to withhold funding from schools with diversity programs, which was recently blocked by judges. What do you see as Education Minnesota’s role in responding to the Trump administration?
Education Minnesota has been publicly defending against the attacks on diversity, equity, inclusion and the other attacks from Washington, D.C. We are going to ensure that we have freedom to read. We’re going to make sure our history isn’t whitewashed. We’re just going to make sure that our students and our educators are able to teach and do all the things that they need to do.
What do you see as the biggest threats facing teachers and the union at this moment?
Right now, I think it’s just been the chaos and the executive orders coming. We have great partners though, from our national allies and our other labor allies. I think it’s just the unknown and the threats to the unions as a whole. But we are positioned well to be able to respond.
In 2024, just 28% of 8th graders rated proficient at reading, which is the lowest on record for the nationwide benchmark. In math, students’ abilities seem to be just as dire. I’m curious why you think teachers aren’t able to equip students with these basic skills of reading and math.
For me, the question is what resources and what other things our educators need. I believe that we need to ensure that all educators are equipped with those resources. They have the time to be able to teach and that we ensure that when it comes to class sizes, those teachers are able to reach each of those students.
Gov. Tim Walz, former teacher and union member, ran on being an education governor. Could you give him a grade on his tenure?
Education Minnesota has worked closely with Gov. Walz. President Speck is in charge when it comes to working with Gov. Walz. So as vice president, I’ve been able to watch and follow her lead. So I don’t have a grade at this time.
What are Education Minnesota’s top priorities at the Legislature this year?
Right now, our top priorities have been around professional pay, which includes a starting pay for our entry educators and $25 per hour for our ESPs. We have a pension bill, which would ensure that we have a career rule for our teachers. And we also have a bill around health insurance, so that our educators have quality health insurance. It would start a health insurance pool for our educators across the state. And we also are looking to protect the inflationary rule on education that we won last year.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/NN250429_0024-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-04-29 15:08:12.243809

Currently,  Iowa code defines bullying and harassment in schools as electronic, written, verbal, or physical acts or conduct that create an objectively hostile school environment for a student based on “any actual or perceived trait or characteristic.” There are 17 traits listed as potential characteristics of a student that could be used in bullying, including age, race, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability and political belief. The law states that bullying is not limited to these categories.
House File 865, approved 32-16, would remove this list and reference to students being bullied because of an actual or perceived trait of a student, instead defining bullying and harassment as “repeated and targeted” acts and conduct that create a hostile school environment for a student. Sen. Sandy Salmon, R-Janesville, said this change is needed because some schools are not addressing bullying incidents if a student is being bullied for a reason not related to a listed trait.

“Those schools don’t believe they are required to act unless the behavior is based on one of the traits listed, those school officials believing their hands are tied,” Salmon said. “This has resulted in an unequal treatment of students and underreporting of bullying. The bill removes that confusion and clarifies that all students should receive an equal level of protection.”
But Democrats said the measure will weaken Iowa’s laws on bullying. Sen. Sarah Trone Garriott, D-West Des Moines, said bullying is a “life of death matter” — she has known students who have died by suicide because of bullying, and Trone Garriott said it would be more difficult for families with students who are bullied to get support and responses from schools if the bill becomes law.
The law is not limited to the traits listed, Trone Garriott said, but having the 17 characteristics in law for reference helps schools and families both identify and track many of the major reasons why students are bullied, she said.
“I think the real intent might be to make it harder for folks on this list to get the support they need, and for the people of Iowa to know what’s happening in our schools,” Trone Garriott said. “This bill makes it harder. This bill removes guidance. This bill is not going to protect anyone. It’s going to make our students more vulnerable.”
Sen. Matt Blake, D-Urbandale, said he was bullied in school, and suffered severe depression during middle school and high school because of the bullying he faced. He said the bill will make it harder for students like him to seek help from schools, saying the definition of bullying as “repeated and targeted” acts and conduct will not cover much of the harassment students face.
“The instance of my life when I was the lowest, where I went home from school and cried for the entire day and the entire afternoon, is because some child, student, that had never bullied me before said one mean word to me, and that’s what set me off that day,” Blake said. “You never know what that behavior will be that sets a child off, and taking these restrictions and making it harder to protect our children is not something we should be doing in this body.”
Sen. Mike Zimmer, D-DeWitt, the former president of the Central DeWitt School Board, called for lawmakers to look at how their local school districts address bullying. He said Iowa school districts already have board policies created to define and address bullying, which includes the ability to report bullying and harassment incidents using an online form.
“The vehicle to address bullying and harassment is already in code, it is already in board policy,” Zimmer said. “It is in every single school district in this state. If an administrator is misinterpreting this, this is not going to solve that. That’s an issue that’s got to be handled internally between the superintendent their subordinates.”
He said a better approach, if there is a problem with school officials not addressing bullying if it does not involve harassment based on limited traits, would be doing more to inform parents about the existing policy and platform.
Sen. Lynn Evans, R-Aurelia, said that while Zimmer’s point was correct — a board policy and procedure on how to report bullying exists — he said there are some school districts misinterpreting the law so that if a bullied student does not have an identity or characteristic listed in the Iowa code, “they’re passing it off as just two kids that were having a disagreement or a misunderstanding or a skirmish.”
“Every child should be protected in schools, every child, not just because they match up some certain traits that we decided to laundry list a number of years ago in Iowa code,” Evans said. “The bill that is before us cleans up Iowa code. It makes it very clear that it should apply to the majority of school board policies already on the books, but it ensures that every kid — even though their traits may not be listed in Iowa code — that they get the same protections as everyone else.”
The measure heads to Gov. Kim Reynolds’ desk.

(Photo by Ty Wright/Getty Images)Former Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis plans to ask the United States Supreme Court to weigh in on whether she was protected by the First Amendment when refusing same-sex marriage licenses a decade ago, her lawyer announced Monday. 
This comes after the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals refused a request to re-hear her case, saying the panel of judges who ruled against Davis in March already considered the case fully. 
Mat Staver, the founder and chairman of conservative legal group Liberty Counsel, said in a statement that the nation’s highest court is “the next step to give Kim Davis justice in this case since the emotional distress damage award against her in her individual capacity is barred by the First Amendment.” 
Davis is fighting a federal jury’s decision that she should pay $100,000 to a couple she denied a marriage license in 2015. But her lawyers also want the case to result in same-sex marriage rights being revoked. 
“This case underscores why the U.S. Supreme Court should overturn Obergefell v. Hodges, because that decision threatens the religious liberty of many Americans who believe that marriage is a sacred institution between one man and one woman,” Staver said. “The First Amendment precludes making the choice between your faith and your livelihood.”
The move is expected. Staver, who argued on Davis’ behalf in Cincinnati in January before a 3-judge panel in the 6th Circuit, said at that time he intended to use her case to try and overturn marriage equality. 
Obergefell v. Hodges, the 2015 decision that guaranteed same-sex couples marriage rights, is “on the same shifting sand” that doomed Roe v. Wade, Staver said.   
“I think … it’s not a matter of ‘if,’ it’s a matter of ‘when’ Obergefell will be overturned,” Staver told the Lantern in January. “I have no doubt that Obergefell will be overturned, and the issue will be returned back to the states as it was before 2015.” 
The Kim Davis case 
Davis, then the Rowan County clerk, made national headlines in 2015 for refusing to issue marriage licenses to several same-sex couples based on her religious beliefs. 
In 2015, U.S. District Judge David Bunning ordered Davis to jail for five days for contempt for refusing to comply with a court order. 
In 2024, Bunning ordered Davis to pay $260,104 in fees and expenses to attorneys who represented one of the couples she refused a marriage license. Bunning earlier ordered Davis to pay the couple, David Ermold and David Moore, $100,000 in damages for violating their constitutional rights. Liberty Counsel has unsuccessfully fought Bunning’s decisions. 
Davis lost her bid for reelection as Rowan County clerk in 2018.
Her lawyers have argued she acted within her First Amendment rights when she refused to issue the licenses, though judges don’t agree. 
In March, the 6th Circuit refused to strike down the jury judgement against her on those grounds, saying she “cannot raise a Free Exercise Clause defense because she is being held liable for state action, which the First Amendment does not protect.” 
Liberty Counsel said the case raises the question “of whether a government official sued in an individual capacity and stripped of governmental immunity may assert a personal First Amendment defense to monetary damages.”
The group wants the Supreme Court to take up the case to “answer the question of ‘first impression,’ resolve any conflicts with Supreme Court precedent, and ensure that former government defendants standing before the Court in their personal capacity do not lose First Amendment protections.”

The byproduct was high in ammonia and very corrosive, according to DNR staff who responded to the incident and observed murky, brown water conditions flowing all the way into the Des Moines River. 
The majority of dead fish, 62,620, were observed in South Branch Lizard Creek, where the spill from CJ Bio America occurred. The company noticed the byproduct from manufacturing lysine had leaked into a stormwater drain, which staff blocked with a berm that they later realized had developed a breach. According to DNR, this allowed an unknown amount of the byproduct to flow to the surface intake of a neighboring field and into the creek. 
DNR valued the fish killed from the incident at $73,819. Most of the dead fish were small minnows, shiners, dace and chub, but other varieties included nearly 5,000 suckers, more than 2,000 rock and smallmouth bass and 37 northern pike. 
CJ Bio America did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the issue. 
DNR investigating wastewater spills in Boyer and South Skunk Rivers
DNR is investigating two recent wastewater spills, one from a meat processing facility near Denison into Boyer River and another from a wastewater treatment plant into the South Skunk River. 
A valve malfunction at Smithfield Fresh Meats Corp. in Denison led to an estimated 500-gallon spill of wastewater into the Boyer River. DNR staff were notified Sunday morning of the release, which was quickly stopped by Smithfield staff who closed the stormwater drain where the water was flowing. 
John Baker, environmental specialist with the DNR field office in Atlantic, said most of the wastewater was contained to the stormwater system, which is being cleaned. 
Baker said no dead fish have been observed in the Boyer River. 
In Story City, an estimated 1.5 million gallons of partially treated wastewater was released into South Skunk River over the weekend due to unusually high flows to a wastewater treatment plant. 
According to a press release from DNR, the wastewater was treated using an ultraviolet disinfection process before it was diverted into the river. High flows at the plant were caused by heavy rain over the past week. 
The plant began discharging the water around 2 p.m. on Saturday and ended Sunday around 4 p.m. 
No dead fish have been observed in the river as a result of the event.

“In light of today’s decision, it is now imperative that the Missouri General Assembly pass HB 567,” Kara Corches, president and CEO of the Missouri Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said in a press release, referring to the bill to gut paid sick leave.
The Missouri Supreme Court heard arguments last month seeking to strike down the law, filed by a coalition of business groups and individuals. The lawsuit argued the law should be thrown out for violating constitutional rules on ballot initiatives, including violations of the state constitution’s single-subject requirement and a lack of a clear title, which the court ruled it lacks jurisdiction over. 
Prop A passed with nearly 58% of the vote and had the support of numerous unions, workers’ advocacy groups, social justice and civil rights organizations, as well as over 500 business owners.
Senate Democrats have spent two nights this month blocking Republican efforts to overturn the law. They have worked on reaching a compromise regarding implementation details.
Lawmakers and business groups push rollback of Missouri minimum wage hike, sick leave law

Senate President Pro Tem Cindy O’Laughlin, a Republican from Shelbina, has been an especially loud voice urging full repeal. She has said that even though requirements go into effect May 1, the Senate could continue working to weaken the law until the end of session on May 16.
The bill sponsored by state Sen. Mike Bernskoetter, a Republican from Jefferson City, and state Rep. Sherri Gallick, a Republican from Belton, would overturn the law requiring most employers to provide paid sick time off for hundreds of thousands of qualifying workers. It would also modify the minimum wage law by removing the requirement that it be indexed to inflation.
State Sen. Brian Williams, a Democrat from University City, spent over two hours blocking action in the chamber with a filibuster Tuesday morning, saying some had been acting in bad faith during negotiations.
“This year, there’s been again, people going back on negotiation, bad faith efforts, distrust, people feeling deceived and members of the body feeling disrespected,” he said. “But most importantly, all in the name of disregarding voters. The very same voters that have sent us here.” 
Under the law, beginning May 1 employers with business receipts greater than $500,000 a year must provide at least one hour of paid leave for every 30 hours worked. Employers with fewer than 15 workers must allow workers to earn at least 40 hours per year, with larger employers mandated to allow at least 56 hours. The law also gradually increases the minimum wage.
“It is financially burdensome, just short of devastating, and its regulatory requirements are extremely difficult for single unit operators,” Buddy Lahl, CEO of the Missouri Restaurant Association, told The Independent Tuesday.
The bill would allow the minimum wage to increase to $15 per hour in 2026, as voters approved, but it would not be adjusted for inflation thereafter — a policy that has been in place since 2007. The sick leave provisions would be repealed entirely.
Prop A would make sick leave guaranteed for around 728,000 workers who currently lack it statewide, or over 1 in 3 Missouri workers, according to an analysis from the progressive nonprofit the Missouri Budget Project.

(Photo by Austin Fisher / Source NM)New Mexico lawmakers this week rolled out a plan to help prepare for potential hefty reductions in federal funding.
The Legislative Council, the group of state representatives and senators that oversees all lawmaking between New Mexico’s legislative sessions, voted unanimously Monday afternoon at its first meeting following this year’s session to create a new panel called the Federal Infrastructure Funds and Stability Interim Committee. 
House Speaker Javier Martínez and Senate President Pro Tem Mimi Stewart, both Albuquerque Democrats, told Source NM after the meeting that the committee, in a nutshell, will examine potential federal funding cuts and consider ways to adapt to them if they become real.
For example, the committee will look at proposals to cut funding to Head Start, a child care and early education program. This week, U.S. Sens. Martin Heinrich and Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.) joined 40 other senators in a letter to U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. demanding he immediately unfreeze Head Start funding and reinstate early childhood education workers who have either been laid off or furloughed as result of closures of the preschools, which rely on federal funding.
Similarly, the new legislative committee will track funds for Medicaid, the safety-net health insurance program for people with low incomes, Martínez said. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has said previously she might call a special session in the fall, should the state need to address federal shortcomings in programs such as Medicaid. The state also is also party to multi-state lawsuits challenging federal cuts.
Its members will also consider the Trump administration’s proposal to abolish the federal Department of Education, Stewart said. Federal funding accounts for 30% of New Mexico’s education budget, she said, including money for special education.
Stewart said the committee has no historical precedent in the New Mexico Legislature, noting “this is an ahistorical presidency.” The committee is intended to last for the remainder of the year, but could extend beyond that if needed, she said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Martínez told the Legislative Council the new committee will not duplicate the work being done by the Legislative Finance Committee and other legislative panels but, rather, supplement it with a “proactive approach to deal with any potential reductions in federal funding.”
“It will be what I consider to be a very nuts-and-bolts committee, with a tailored, specific focus,” he said.
Martínez appointed Rep. Patricia Lundstrom (D-Grants) as the panel’s co-chair from the House of Representatives, and Stewart appointed Sen. William Soules (D-Las Cruces) as the co-chair from the Senate. Attempts to reach Lundstrom and Soules for comment through spokespeople for their respective chambers were unsuccessful as of publication time.
Other members of the new committee include Reps. Susan Herrera (D-Embudo), Micaela Lara Cadena (D-Las Cruces), Mark Duncan (R-Kirtland) and Cathrynn Brown (R-Carlsbad); and Sens. George Muñoz (D-Gallup), Linda Trujillo (D-Santa Fe), James Townsend (R-Artesia) and Minority Whip Pat Woods (R-Broadview).
The panel is expected to hold an organizational meeting in May, Martínez said.

(Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — The state House on Tuesday sent a bill that would limit most public schools to two virtual days a year to the governor’s desk despite bipartisan opposition.
Beginning in the 2026-27 school year, Senate Bill 758 limits brick-and-mortar schools to 12 hours of virtual instruction as long as the state superintendent approves an online instruction plan or if there’s a governor-issued state of emergency affecting the district.
State Rep. Anthony Moore, R-Clinton, the bill’s author, said nothing in the measure eliminates the option for a four-day school week. More than two virtual days just couldn’t count toward instruction time. Moore said his bill ensures that districts not specifically approved for a four-day school week are not taking every Friday off by scheduling a virtual day, resulting in 37 fewer days of instruction.
“I think that I’m with you on this idea that we don’t want to be losing class time, but I’m not sure why virtual days are equating to not having instruction,” said Rep. Michelle McCane, D-Tulsa, a former educator. “Is that how it’s being applied? Because every virtual day I’ve ever been involved in really still required a lot of instruction and support on my part as a teacher.”
Moore said it should work that way, but it isn’t in a lot of districts. Schools are sending packets home with no teacher available online. His children had two virtual days last year where they had no instructional material. He said there are also young children that might not have parents at home who are able to help them complete their assignments.
“Who’s going to help that kid?” he asked. 
He said he’s received hundreds of emails about the bill.
Moore said the state wants to improve its poor academic ranking, and more face-to-face instruction will help.  
McCane said virtual school days should have structure and not be a packet sent home. But she said virtual school days should be an option in the event of bad weather or excessive teacher absences. Districts would lose the flexibility to utilize that option moving forward.
Rep. Cynthia Roe, R-Lindsay, said her grandson had a virtual day two weeks ago and completed his work in 45 minutes. This bill fixes that issue.
The measure passed the state House by a 53-32 vote.

Sharice Davids, D-Kansas, shared disappointment with President Donald Trump's policy agenda during the first 100 days of the Republican president's second term. (Kansas Reflector screen capture of House's YouTube channel)TOPEKA — U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids marked the 100th day of President Donald Trump’s second term by rattling off objections to handling of tariffs, threats to Medicaid and Social Security, and presidential adviser Elon Musk’s conflicts of interest.
Davids, a Democrat who serves the 3rd District in the Kansas City area, has stood out in her evaluation of Trump given Kansas’ three other representatives and two senators — all Republicans — endorsed Trump’s candidacy and remain supportive of the president.
“Kansas families deserve so much more than chaotic policies that raise their costs and weaken their freedoms,” Davids said Tuesday.
Davids said Trump’s tariff war could raise household costs by $3,800 per year and harm export markets for Kansas farmers and manufacturers. In response to imposition of tariffs, trade partners of the United States imposed retaliatory barriers to commerce. For example, Trump’s import duties on Chinese products were set at 145%. U.S. exports entering China face a 125% tariff.
Davids objected to federal legislation that could jeopardize Medicaid coverage and retirement security for thousands of her constituents in Kansas. She said she opposed “destabilizing” job cuts at the Social Security Administration and other federal agencies.
In addition to advocating for due process for Americans and judicial independence in the court system, Davids supported a bill to increase transparency of Musk’s work with DOGE or the Department of Government Efficiency. A U.S. Senate report indicated Musk’s role in the Trump administration could shield his companies from more than $2.3 billion in potential legal liability.
“I’ll always stand up for our community, whether that’s protecting Social Security, making child care more affordable or lowering prices at the grocery store,” Davids said.
U.S. Rep. Ron Estes, a Republican representing the 4th District surrounding Wichita, said the U.S. House’s passage of a federal budget framework before a two-week recess was a “major win for Kansans and President Trump’s American First agenda.”
Republican majorities in the House and Senate have been working on a legislative bundle that would extend tax cuts adopted in 2017 during Trump’s first term and authorize federal spending reductions that critics contend would have an impact on Medicaid, Medicare or Social Security.
“By voting ‘yes,’ we’re voting for a path to make the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act permanent,” Estes said. “A ‘yes’ vote prevents the largest tax increase for Americans in history.”
GOP U.S. Rep. Tracey Mann, who serves the 1st District of western and central Kansas, also voted for House Concurrent Resolution 14 that set revenue and spending targets for fiscal years 2026 through 2036.
“I was proud to advance this legislation and set the foundation for Congress to implement President Trump’s agenda,” Mann said. “I look forward to working with my committees in the coming weeks to identify even more savings for the American taxpayer and deliver the one big, beautiful bill Americans have asked for.”
The budget resolution passed the House 216-214 with backing from Estes, Mann and U.S. Rep. Derek Schmidt of the 2nd District. Davids voted against it. In the U.S. Senate, the budget framework passed 51-48 with support from Sen. Jerry Moran and Roger Marshall, both Kansas Republicans.
Mann said the resolution directed Congress to find savings for taxpayers, invest in border security and national defense, promote domestic energy production and prevent expiration of the 2017  tax cuts.
“Seventy-seven million Americans, including myself, gave Washington, D.C., a mandate to secure the border, lower taxes and get our country back on track,” he said. “These are the common sense policy solutions that the Big First District overwhelmingly voted for last November.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Sharice-Davids-on-house-floor-1024x508.png,,,2025-04-29 14:11:38.484534

The sole no vote was Republican state Sen. Mike Moon of Ash Grove. 
The bill garnered little opposition when it cleared the House last week 129 to 14, though a group of Republican lawmakers condemned the provision making it illegal for anyone under 18 years old to marry. 
“There are legitimate reasons for people 16, 17 to become married,” said state Rep. Dean van Schoiack, a Savannah Republican, who was also vocal in his opposition to the idea last year. “A pregnancy could be a legitimate reason to become married, for one thing.” 
He said he knows many couples who were married at 16 or 17 who are still together.
State Rep. Hardy Billington, a Poplar Bluff Republican, said “more babies will die” if the bill passes. 
“People at 16, 17 years old will have more abortions because they can’t get married,” he said.
Both Billington and Van Schoiack left the House chamber during a roll call on the legislation, and thus did not record a vote.
House Minority Leader Ashley Aune, a Kansas City Democrat, said the Platte County recorder of deeds shared with her “how horrifying his experience is when he has to assist a young woman with a marriage certificate, the look in her eyes when he knows that this is against her will.” 
She then turned her comments to Van Schoiack.
“And for you to stand up here and advocate for young women to be married off, it is disgusting,” Aune said. “Honestly, I can’t believe it. It’s indefensible. I can’t believe you would stand up in a microphone and say it out loud.” 
Under current Missouri law, anyone under 16 is prohibited from getting married. But 16 and 17 year olds can get married with parental consent to anyone under 21. 
Marriage would be banned for anyone under 18 under the bill that passed Tuesday. 
There was no discussion before Tuesday’s vote, but in 2023 Moon’s opposition to the child marriage ban garnered national attention when he said: “Do you know any kids who have been married at age 12? I do. And guess what? They’re still married.”
The ban on child marriage almost passed last year but was stalled by a small group of Republican critics.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The underlying bill, dealing with foster children, was sponsored by Republican state Rep. Melissa Schmidt of Eldridge, and handled by Republican Sen. Jamie Burger. Most of the provisions were added on by other members as amendments.
Among its many provisions is a ban on Missouri’s social services agency from seizing Social Security benefits from foster kids. 
Missouri’s child welfare agency takes millions of dollars each year in foster children’s benefits and uses the money to help pay for foster care. In fiscal year 2024, the Children’s Division spent over $10.6 million in children’s benefits. Over 1,200 foster kids were receiving benefits in Missouri of late last year, or just over 10% of all kids in care.
As a result, kids who are orphaned or have disabilities are responsible for paying toward the cost of their care in state custody. 
The bill would ban the state from using those benefits to pay itself back for routine foster care expenses. Instead, the division could use the funds for the child’s “unmet needs” beyond what the division is obligated to pay, such as housing as the child prepares to age out of foster care.
The effort to ban the practice won bipartisan support during last year’s session and was on the precipice of passing. But it died when GOP infighting forced the state Senate to adjourn early. 
House Speaker Jon Patterson, a Lee’s Summit Republican, pledged earlier this year that this legislation would be the first bill sent to the Senate, highlighting the issue as legislation that “should have been passed but fell victim to our inaction and politics.”
The bill also voids nondisclosure agreements in childhood sexual abuse cases. 
And it includes a proposal by Republican state Sen. Travis Fitzwater of Holts Summit that would assign foster children 14 to client-directed attorneys, meaning they would be required to act based on the goals of the children. Currently, foster children have guardians ad litem, who are attorneys tasked with acting in what they view as the child’s best interest. 
The shift, which would be subject to appropriation, goes into effect in 2028 unless a county opts into a pilot program.The judge in each case would still have the discretion to continue the guardian ad litem appointment. The bill also creates a commission appointed by the chief justice of the state Supreme Court to review family legal representation throughout the state, and make recommendations to bolster its uniformity and quality.
It would also require the state Department of Social Services to build a program of residential care for youth with severe behavioral challenges currently being held in inappropriate placements, by contracting with qualified service providers. This, too, would likely require funding by the legislature. 
Other provisions include:

Increasing a tax credit for donations to certain youth programs.
Clarifying that parents allowing children to engage in appropriate independent activities without supervision would not be considered abuse or neglect.
Stating that the state Children’s Division cannot hold itself harmless in contracts with private service providers when there are issues resulting from the state’s negligence.
Requiring Children’s Division caseworkers to present identification of themselves when conducting investigations of child abuse and neglect, and inform parents of their rights;
Requiring the Children’s Division to take into consideration the religion of the foster child when determining placement, in order to ensure children are in households of a similar religion to their families’ when practicable.
Modifying the Amber Alert system to add that the system will aid in finding not only an abducted child but an “abducted or missing African American youth.”

They found more detainees, and health care gaps",Wendy Fry,,,,,https://calmatters.org/justice/2025/04/ice-detention-center-investigation/,A California law empowers state investigators to check on conditions at ICE detention centers. A new report raises concerns about health care inside them.,"In summary
A California law empowers state investigators to check on conditions at ICE detention centers. A new report raises concerns about health care inside them.


A new report from the California Department of Justice finds that immigration detention facilities across the state continue to fall short in providing basic mental health care, with gaps in suicide prevention and treatment, recordkeeping, and use of force incidents against mentally ill detainees. 
The report’s release today comes alongside an aggressive expansion of immigration enforcement and broader changes to immigration policy under President Donald Trump’s second administration. The timing of the report’s release signals California officials plan to continue oversight as federal officials move to expand immigration detention capacity in the state.
It flagged that California’s detainee population has grown since the state’s last review: more than 3,100 people were held in immigration detention statewide as of April 16, up from the daily average of about 1,750 in 2021, the report found. About 75% of those detained had no documented criminal history.     
Investigators with the state’s Department of Justice inspected all six active immigration facilities in California. The inspections were conducted under a 2017 state law that mandated the Attorney General’s office review and report on immigration detention facilities operating in California. It’s the fourth report to be released on conditions in facilities where noncitizens are detained in California by federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement authorities. 
The findings come amid broader concerns about federal oversight: the report notes that the federal Department of Homeland Security recently moved to shutter internal offices tasked with investigating civil rights complaints and detention conditions. Last week, the homeland security department quietly removed more than 100 civil rights and civil liberties records from its website, sparking concerns about transparency and accountability in immigration enforcement. 
“California’s facility reviews remain especially critical in light of efforts by the Trump Administration to both eliminate oversight of conditions at immigration detention facilities and increase its inhumane campaign of mass immigration enforcement, potentially exacerbating critical issues already present in these facilities by packing them with more people,” said Attorney General Rob Bonta. 
The 165-page report details conditions at privately operated facilities where federal immigration officials detain people facing deportation. State investigators found “deficiencies in suicide prevention and intervention strategies” at every site, including missed mental health screenings and improper clinical decisions about when to release detainees from suicide watch. 
Staffing shortages, poor coordination between medical and mental health care providers, and widespread problems with record-keeping contributed to the risks for detainees, many of whom suffer from depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder, according to the report. 
Conditions that can worsen mental health, such as solitary confinement, remain common, the report found. At facilities known as Desert View Annex, Imperial, and Otay Mesa, investigators found that force was disproportionately used against individuals with mental health conditions, including cases where chemical agents were deployed. At the Mesa Verde facility in Bakersfield, officials failed to properly document or report the forced transfer of detainees who had participated in a peaceful hunger strike, the report said. 
Despite federal guidelines discouraging the isolation of detainees with mental illness, the California review found people with serious mental health conditions were routinely placed in segregation, sometimes for months at a time. Investigators found some facilities failed to properly inform detainees about protections under a federal court settlement that requires legal representation for people with severe mental health disorders. 
Pat-down policies at the Mesa Verde center discouraged detainees from seeking health care, the review found. Detainees reported feeling that invasive searches deterred them from attending medical appointments or accessing other services. 
A spokesman for Geo Group, the private company that operates several of the facilities, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the just-released report, but previously told CalMatters that the company provides high-quality medical services including “around-the-clock access to medical care, which is governed by the Performance-Based National Detention Standards set by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and independently accredited by the National Commission on Correctional Health Care.” 
“In all instances, our contracted services are monitored by the federal government to ensure strict compliance with Performance-Based National Detention Standards, which apply to all ICE Processing Centers,” Geo spokesman Christopher Ferreira said in December. 
ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

(Screenshot via Attorney General's X livestream)Attorney General James Uthmeier said his office is “putting our money where our mouth is” in announcing a state-funded legal team dedicated to enforcing parents-rights laws.
Addressing a crowd of fourth graders at Jacksonville Classical Academy Tuesday, Uthmeier said his office is “making sure that we’re walking the walk and setting examples” in enforcing laws related to gender transition, library materials, school surveys, and other topics that have dominated legislative, judicial, and executive conversations in recent years. 
Uthmeier announced the creation of the Office of Parental Rights, a “team of litigators focused on fighting the fights that parents bring to us.”
“It’s frustrating that we do have to go so far as to enshrine in law a lot of these rights that are indeed God-given,” Uthmeier said. “But at the end of the day, government is weak. Government cannot be trusted, and we want to protect parents everywhere we can.”
Uthmeier was flanked by Moms for Liberty co-founder Tiffany Justice, Patti Sullivan from Parental Rights Florida, Kim Hermann from Southeastern Legal Foundation, and January Littlejohn, a Leon County parent who claims a school aided her child’s gender transition, although the school has prevailed in court proceedings so far.
Uthmeier said his office will coordinate with the Department of Education to address complaints to be handled by the Office of Parental Rights. 
“I understand you guys probably don’t fully appreciate the importance of the announcement here today, but you will grow up fast,” Uthmeier said, addressing the fourth-graders. “You will have your own kids, your own families. It will happen much faster than you think. And I assure you, you will appreciate what’s being done here today.”

Uthmeier said Florida has been a “shining city on a hill, an example for the rest of the country to look to when it comes to enshrining parental rights.”
Lawmakers have focused heavily on enabling parents to remove books from school libraries they may consider to be “pornographic,” require parental consent to take surveys related to mental health concerns and sexual behavior, and parental notifications relating to a student’s education. 
Litigation for some of the laws has become costly. For example, in Escambia County, as of December, the school district had spent more than $640,000 to defend book-removal policies, the Tallahassee Democrat reported. 
“We’re certainly not looking to run up costs, but when it comes to fighting the right fights, I’ll spend every dollar we have,” Uthmeier said. 
Last week, a bill (HB 1505) to require parental consent for any survey offered to a child, including about mental health, politics, and sexual health, passed the House on a party-line vote. It would expand the state’s “Parental Bill of Rights” and includes mandatory parental consent for STI treatment.
Similar legislation is awaiting debate on the Senate floor.
Uthmeier has been in office less that three months. He was appointed by Gov. Ron DeSantis earlier this year, filling the vacancy created by former AG Ashley Moody’s appointment by DeSantis to the U.S. Senate.

Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/29/ned-lamont-arpa-interest-ruling/,But a GOP leader said Lamont's administration still was wrong for not reporting these interest dollars to legislators for nearly three years.,"Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration didn’t violate state law when it moved $340 million in interest earned on federal COVID relief grants into the state budget, Attorney General William Tong said Monday.
But while Tong settled the legal question, a Republican leader said the Democratic governor’s administration still was wrong for not reporting these interest dollars to legislators for nearly three years.
Though Connecticut received roughly $2.8 billion from Congress in March 2021 through the American Rescue Plan Act, Lamont’s administration didn’t shift investment earnings on that pandemic relief from an off-budget account into the General Fund until Jan. 8 of this year — roughly one month before the governor would propose spending most of that interest to expand child care services. (Most state programs and services and financed through the General Fund or other accounts within the formal state budget.)
Frustrated by that late disclosure and timing, House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, asked whether Lamont could move the funds into the budget without legislative approval.
Tong wrote that existing law stipulates all interest on investments must go into the General Fund, unless the legislature directs otherwise. And no special instructions were issued when Connecticut received the ARPA funds, which it’s used to bolster education, human services, municipal aid and other programs for the past four years.
The attorney general also noted the legislature is aware of its legal options. “The General Assembly knows how to override the default rule when it wants and has done so on several occasions,” he wrote.
And while the legislature set many special rules for Lamont to follow on spending ARPA dollars, the Tong noted they apply only to “federal funds designated for the state” and not on the interest those grants may generate.
“This opinion from Attorney General Tong confirms that our reporting of the interest income is consistent with statutory requirements,” the governor’s budget spokesman, Chris Collibee, said Monday.
“I never doubted in my mind that the Democrat attorney general would have a ruling favorable to the Democrat governor,” Candelora said Monday, adding it still doesn’t explain how hundreds of millions of dollars was not reported for years to the legislature “but magically appeared in the dark of night” shortly before Lamont would propose a use for it. “Fundamentally, I think that’s wrong for good government, and I think it’s wrong for transparency.”
When The Connecticut Mirror first reported that the interest dollars had appeared on a Jan. 15, 2025, revenue projections document that Lamont’s budget office and nonpartisan legislative analysts sent to the General Assembly, legislators from both parties expressed concerns about the timing.
Collibee said in January that the administration had asked the treasurer’s office in the spring of 2021, shortly after the ARPA funding had been received, to assign all interest earnings to the General Fund. But, he added, “There appeared to have been some miscommunication.”
And Jeffrey Beckham, Lamont’s budget director since early 2022, said in mid-January that his office wasn’t aware for years that tens of millions of dollars in ARPA-related interest due annually to the General Fund wasn’t being transferred.
“It became apparent to us in the last couple of months,” he added at the time.
State Treasurer Erick Russell, who succeeded fellow Democrat Shawn Wooden as treasurer in January 2023, has not speculated on communication between his predecessor and the Lamont administration.
But Russell noted in mid-January that the treasurer’s office provides four reports yearly to Beckham on how ARPA investments are performing. 
In other words, the Lamont administration had plenty of reminders each year that tens of millions of dollars in interest in ARPA investments were pouring in annually.
The Lamont administration co-writes revenue reports filed three times annually with the General Assembly that reported other interest earnings — but not the return on ARPA investments until this year.
Candelora added that Connecticut Democrats who are worried about President Donald Trump’s efforts to cut spending without congressional approval should be more concerned about Lamont’s handling of the ARPA interest.
“This very behavior,” Candelora said, “reeks of the things they accuse the president of doing.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Lamont-and-Tong-scaled.jpg,,,2025-04-29 14:11:38.484534

(Photo by Michael Moline/Florida Phoenix)Late in an acrimonious legislative session certain to run into overtime, House Speaker Daniel Perez on Tuesday announced an intensive study of property taxes with an eye toward taking reforms before the voters next year.
Perez announced he was creating a Select Committee on Property Taxes that would craft a proposed constitutional amendment that could be passed by lawmakers at the start of next year’s session in January, then go to the ballot in November 2026. 
Perez included in his remarks a shot at Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has pushed for the elimination of property taxes, for not coming up with his own detailed proposal.
“Several months ago, Gov. DeSantis introduced the exciting and provocative idea of abolishing property taxes in Florida. Naturally, many of us had the same questions. How would elimination of property taxes work? If property taxes go away, how would local governments pay for the services? We expect local government to provide by police, fire, and infrastructure,” Perez said.
 “Unfortunately, as the weeks have gone by, the governor has yet to come forward with any specific answers to those questions or with any specific plan or with actual bill language.”
Perez did stress, though, that the House would consider any proposal from the governor.
“If the governor comes forward with a proposal, we will hear it. All ideas are welcome. All voices are invited to be heard. This process is not about ego or pride of authorship or credit. This is about bringing the very best proposals before the people of Florida so that they have an opportunity to decide their own fate,” Perez said.

The speaker took another shot at the governor and the Senate for their proposed fiscal year 2025-26 spending plans, which run higher than the budget passed by the House.
“I am not oblivious to the impact that property tax reform would have on local governments, but we, as a House, have a unique credibility on this front, as we proposed to doing something neither the governor nor the Senate were willing to do, apply the same revenue restrictions to ourselves that we are asking local governments to endure.”

The speaker tapped Reps. Toby Overdorf and Vicky Lopez as chair and vice chair of the panel, respectively. Perez encouraged members who want to serve on the panel to come forward.
“However, please remember that this select committee will be meeting throughout the rest of spring, summer, and into the fall. So if you are interested, be prepared to work,” he said.
Five potential reforms
Perez wants the select committee to begin its work by “exploring a variety of potential reforms,” including:

Requiring every city, county, and special district to hold a referendum on the question of eliminating property taxes on homestead properties.
Creating a new $500,000 homestead exemption, as well as a $1 million homestead exemption for properties owned by Floridians aged 65 and older, or who have had a homestead for 30 years, applicable to all non-school taxes.
Authorizing the Legislature to increase the homestead exemption to any value by general law rather than constitutional amendment.
Modifying the assessment increase limitations on property values: For homestead properties, changing the cap from the lower of 3% or consumer price index to a flat 3% over any three-year period for all taxes. For non-homestead properties, changing the cap from 10% annually to 15% over any three-year period for all non-school taxes.
Protecting homeownership by eliminating the ability to foreclose on a homestead property due to a property tax lien.

Perez will announce the committee appointments Wednesday and the panel will meet this week. Usually, the last week of session (set to end Friday) is reserved for budget conferee meetings at which members of the House and Senate meet to hammer out the spending differences between the chambers.
The impasse over tax relief, though, has prevented that from occurring.
 Tax impasse

DeSantis has pushed for the elimination of property taxes while Perez has championed rolling back the state’s sales tax by 0.75%, to 5.25%. The speaker’s plan also would roll back all other sales tax rates by the same amount — commercial rent from 2% to 1.25%; electricity from 4.35% to 3.6%; new mobile home purchases from 3% to 2.25%; and coin-operated amusement machines from 4% to 3.25%.
Senate President Ben Albritton supports tax relief but earlier this session floated a more modest$2.1 billion  plan  centered around a permanent elimination of the sales tax on clothing and shoes costing $75 or less. Other parts of his plan include a permanent reduction in the business rent tax from 2% to 1%, a one-time credit for vehicle registration fees, and several sales tax holidays.
The difference between the House and Senate proposals for fiscal year 2025-26 is $4.4 billion. The Senate made seven spending and tax relief offers to the House as of Monday but none were accepted.
“Given the importance of this issue, you cannot afford further delay in moving this conversation beyond promises or generalities. We need to put in the time in order to give stakeholders meaningful opportunities and make sure that we put the very best proposal or proposals on the ballot as amendments to the Florida Constitution,” Perez said.

Mississippi nonprofit centers that serve survivors of domestic violence, dating violence and sexual assault have been unable to apply for crucial federal grants, creating uncertainty and potentially jeopardizing services and staffing.   
The U.S. Department of Justice awards tens of millions of dollars yearly through the Violence Against Women Act, but in February, grant information was taken down from the Office on Violence Against Women’s website right before the usual application deadline.
As of the end of April, the information hasn’t returned, and the office’s website announcing funding opportunities was last updated Feb. 6, telling applicants not to finalize any applications.
“So many times when you’re utilizing federal funds to pretty much run your organization, when those federal funds are cut, you have to start looking at cutting staff and services,” said Joy Jones, executive director of the Mississippi Coalition Against Domestic Violence, which receives VAWA funding. 
“That is detrimental to victims of crime,” she added. 
Since 2017, the U.S. Department of Justice has awarded nearly $50 million to Mississippi nonprofit centers, the State Department of Health and the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians. That’s money that has supported the operation of shelters, transitional housing, victim advocacy, education and more. 
Other funding through VAWA includes training for law enforcement officers and prosecutors as well as support for rural communities and college campuses. 
Meridian’s Care Lodge serves nine counties in the east central part of the state. Its executive director, Kim Neal, said federal grants support the organization’s emergency shelter, where over 200 women, men and children turned to last year. 
She said a lot of the funding is to ensure people have basic needs like clothing, food and a safe environment, in addition to advocacy, like when survivors want to file charges or to seek a protective order. 
Tupelo-based S.A.F.E., Inc. serves nine counties in northeast Mississippi. A rural grant has allowed the organization to do work at its domestic violence shelter and in the community, including throughout April – Sexual Assault Awareness Month. 
Through federal and state grants, S.A.F.E, housed 55 people last year, including those who are homeless as a result of domestic violence and sexual assault, said Zowee Shanks, S.A.F.E’s executive director. 
“When people are making these decisions to pull the grants out, they are not understanding these shelters do more work than at our 19-bed facility,” she said. 
Another federal funding source for domestic violence and rape crisis centers is through the Victims of Crime Act. That act created the Crime Victims Fund, which collects fines and penalties from people convicted of federal crimes and distributes the money to states. 
In October, the start of the federal government’s fiscal year, the crime fund is expected to be cut by $700 million, meaning less funding for states and victim service programs.
The Mississippi Department of Health uses VAWA and VOCA grants along with $12 million from the State Legislature to support victim services that many shelters provide, said Gregory Flynn, a spokesperson for the department. 
Currently, the Health Department funds support ten of the 11 domestic violence shelters across the state, including Care Lodge and S.A.F.E, Inc. 
At the same time as VAWA grants were frozen, the Justice Department cancelled funding for 365 grant programs for nonprofit organizations across the country working with crime victims. Some of the grant recipients were notified that their projects no longer “effectuate” the DOJ’s agencies, CBS News reported. 
“It certainly concerns us,” Neal said about the wait for answers about the federal grants.  
“Domestic violence doesn’t stop even though they may freeze the funding.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/29105536/AP18303679897225.jpg,,,2025-04-29 14:11:38.484534

I have a developmental disability, ADHD, but no one would ever know unless I share that information. My invisibility makes disability skeptics and critics shockingly open about their bigotry.
A former boss genuinely thought the whole point of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) was to ensure people in wheelchairs could apply for jobs, not provide individual workplace accommodations. Long before the current administration was in office, the owner of a salon told me she’d never hire anyone with a disability because she thought accommodations were a scam to increase her small business expenses.
Lest you think the current harsh commentary of people with disabilities lies only on one side of the aisle, even my progressive family members are quietly ideologically aligned with today’s attacks on the disability community.
So when I read headlines about how the disability community is to blame for a plane crash or how some of us “should just die,” I’m not surprised.  Instead, I look at what is causing such unfounded panic.
First, there are over 40 million of us with disabilities, and a bulk of them are over the age of 75.  That’s a lot of people to accommodate in individualized ways, so perhaps such a task is too daunting, but we’re not asking for the impossible.
Second, there is a real fear that individualized accommodations could lead to an unfair advantage.  What those complaints fail to acknowledge is that people with disabilities already begin with a significant disadvantage by merely having a disability. The world we live in was designed for neurotypical, able-bodied people and no one else.
Third, the recent alarm is partially based on the idea that disability accommodations create reliance on external assistance while simultaneously diminishing the need for personal responsibility. Yes, we do rely on external assistance to be healthy and productive every day, in the same way a person requires glasses to see properly or a person with diabetes needs insulin. Knowing your disability rights and asking for legally mandated accommodations is the epitome of personal responsibility and not letting a disability impede daily life.
Rather than even a lopsided playing field, critics would rather “fix” us so we can conform to a neurotypical world or risk shutting us out altogether.  (Whipping the ADHD out of children is one of the latest suggestions.  I have firsthand experience that this method doesn’t work.)
But I don’t want to be “fixed” because I am not deficient, ashamed or broken. People with disabilities are different, not better or worse or the same. What we want are basic human rights and dignity that include: the ability to live up to our potential; fairly compete with our peers; be a productive and contributing member to society; and the opportunity to fully participate in everything life has to offer.
A person living with paralysis from the waist down will never be able to walk up a flight of stairs in the same way I will never be an organized, focused student.  These behaviors are a matter of skill, not will.  If you think having a disability is a coveted status, try living with one every day in this country.  Live long enough and you eventually will.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GettyImages-1210226489-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-29 14:11:38.484534

(Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)To California Democratic state Sen. David Cortese, the idea of gaining Republican support for a bill to provide cash to certain residents would have seemed impossible just a few years ago.
But his proposed legislation to offer $1,000 per month to homeless youth has so far received bipartisan support in the state Senate.
“It’s being embraced,” said Cortese. “This was not even considered possible five years ago.”
Cortese is among more than 20 Democratic lawmakers from 17 states launching Legislators for a Guaranteed Income on Tuesday to advocate for programs that provide direct, regular cash payments to lower-income residents to help alleviate poverty. They join a network of more than 245 mayors and county officials who have pursued dozens of basic income pilot projects across the country.
Washington state House Speaker Laurie Jinkins, D-Tacoma, and Washington state Senator T’wina Nobles, D-Fircrest, are among the founding members of the state lawmaker group.
The lawmakers want to see states play a larger role in guaranteed income programs, which aim to help residents in need by handing out no-strings-attached cash.
The concept of basic income programs took off following a 2019 experiment in Stockton, California. There, 125 individuals received $500 per month for two years, which researchers found improved their financial stability and health.
Michael Tubbs, the former Democratic mayor of Stockton and current executive chairman of Mayors for a Guaranteed Income, said these kinds of efforts are more important now as economic uncertainty and high prices squeeze the most vulnerable people.
“The work around guaranteed income is moving from cities and counties to states,” he said. “We’re going to be organizing state officials across the country who see what we all see: that affordability is an issue, that the Trump tariffs and gross mismanagement of the economy has made the problem even worse.”
While the concept has gained traction across the country, Republican state lawmakers have pushed bills to ban basic income programs, arguing they disincentivize work.
Last year, then-state Sen. John Wiik sponsored successful legislation banning South Dakota localities from launching basic income programs. At the time, the Republican said he was worried about people growing dependent upon the government.
“So, if you get people addicted to just getting a check from the government, it’s going to be really hard to take that away,” he told Stateline.
Legislators for a Guaranteed Income says its 23 members have so far introduced 25 bills across 11 states.
Those include Cortese’s proposed legislation in California to create a new program to help homeless youth transition out of high school.
Eligible students would receive four monthly payments of $1,000 each beginning in May. That bill, expected to cost $40 million to $50 million, has passed through two state Senate committees.
Cortese previously advocated for a 2023 California program that was the nation’s first state-funded pilot of a basic income program targeting former foster youth. He pointed to research showing basic income programs supplement, rather than replace, the need for work. And he said growing these programs can eventually reduce costs for other social safety net programs.
“I’m so pleased to see the proliferation that we’ve seen so far,” he said. “I think that it will become ubiquitous as a way of doing things and that’s going to outlast me and my career.”
In Pennsylvania, Democratic state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta said he’s still exploring details on legislation for a basic income program there.
He said pilot projects across the country have proven that people pay rent, buy groceries and invest in small businesses when they have more financial freedom.
“So, this isn’t really some big experiment,” he said. “It is a proven way to reduce poverty, improve health care, boost our local economies and really get a real return on that investment.”
Kenyatta said so-called trickle-down policies that aim to boost business interests and high earners have failed many ordinary people.
“But basic income really flips that equation on its head,” he said. “It’s not about charity. It’s about power, and about giving people the power and the resources to breathe.”

Because the child did not travel outside the state, this indicates the first case of community spread this year, according to a press release. 
Measles is a highly contagious illness that can cause severe health complications. Symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose, conjunctivitis and rash, according to the health department. Patients are infectious both four days before and after they develop a rash. 
The individual was not fully vaccinated and lives in Faulkner County. While infectious, the person visited Conway Regional Greenbrier Family Medicine from 10:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. on April 18 and from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on April 21. The individual also visited Irby Dance Studio in Conway from 5:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. on April 23, according to the release. 
The state health department will be contacting potentially exposed individuals and is urging anyone at the identified locations to get up to date on the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine as quickly as possible. If the vaccine is given soon after exposure, it can stop the infection from developing, according to health officials. 
Poll: Belief in false measles claims correlated with lower vaccination rates

Anyone who may have been exposed to measles should monitor for symptoms for 21 days after exposure. People who develop symptoms should inform their health care provider that they were potentially exposed to measles and are now experiencing symptoms, according to the release.
Because there is evidence of community spread in Faulkner County, vaccine recommendations for anyone living in or traveling to Faulkner County and surrounding counties (Cleburne, Conway, Lonoke, Perry, Pulaski, Van Buren and White) have been updated.
ADH reported the state’s first case of pediatric measles since 2018 on April 10. The unvaccinated Saline County resident was exposed during out-of-state travel. ADH reported a second case that same day in an unvaccinated Faulkner County resident who was also exposed during travel.
There were nearly 900 confirmed cases of measles in 30 states as of April 24, more than three times the cases in all of 2024, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
The vast majority of confirmed cases, around 650 as of last week, are in Texas where an outbreak started in the western part of the state about three months ago. Two unvaccinated school-aged children living in the outbreak area have died, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. 
A new poll by the nonpartisan health research organization KFF found a correlation between false claims about measles and lower vaccination rates. 
More information about measles, including a list of Arkansas measles exposure locations, is available on the state health department’s website.

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)A Rapid City-based nonprofit that advocates for children in the state court system lost $15,000 last week after the federal government terminated grant awards to the National Court Appointed Special Advocates Association.
The decision “abandons American children” and will cause ripple effects throughout the state, said Seventh Circuit CASA Program Executive Director Kehala Two Bulls. The organization serves children in Pennington, Fall River and Custer counties. Seven other organizations serve South Dakota’s other circuit courts.
Volunteers with CASA advocate for children who’ve been removed from their families and placed in state care due to suspected abuse and neglect. The volunteers meet with the children and other contacts, such as teachers, therapists and caseworkers. They also write reports to judges about the children’s needs, strengths and interests to create “customized services and decision making,” Two Bulls said.


Federal fallout

Over 330 CASA volunteers worked with 658 children in 37 counties last year, according to the state Unified Judicial System.
The national organization suspended all services and support to state and local programs, it announced last week, after the Trump administration’s Department of Justice terminated funding.
In a statement to Reuters, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said grants were rescinded that “do not align with the administration’s priorities,” but she said the Department of Justice will “continue to ensure that services for victims are not impacted and any recipient will have the ability to appeal and restore any grant if direct impact on victims can be thoroughly established.” The national CASA office said it is appealing.
Though the Seventh Circuit was the only South Dakota CASA office receiving grant funds from the national office, other local organizations rely on services provided by the national organization. That includes training and coordination, Two Bulls said.
Shifting that administrative burden and coordination to states will result in redundancy and reduced efficiencies, she added.
“Children will be destabilized by these changes,” Two Bulls said. “It’s important for people to make these decisions responsibly. Whether people agree with this or not, there’s a need for people at a local level to partner with us and step up and come up with the funding, the infrastructure, the support needed, because these are real kids that deserve good futures.”
Seventh Circuit CASA was awarded $25,000 in grant funding this year — $5,000 to conduct background checks of volunteers and $20,000 to develop support and specialized services for older youth in the system. The organization already received and spent about $10,000, but won’t receive the remaining $15,000.
In 2014, 207 kids in the Seventh Circuit were in state care over the course of the year, Two Bulls said. In 2024, that grew to 795 children because cases are taking longer to resolve.
Older children are staying in the system longer and aging out once they turn 18 years old, she added. Last year, 35 kids aged out of foster care in the area. Nearly a decade ago, that number was closer to five children a year. About 80% of the Seventh Circuit CASA’s cases are Indian Child Welfare Act cases.










Children will be destabilized by these changes.


– Kehala Two Bulls, executive director, Seventh Circuit CASA Program


Youth who age out of the system are more likely to become homeless, incarcerated or die than their peers, according to the Annie E. Casey Foundation. Two Bulls said the grant was intended to build supplemental training for advocates focused on building life skills for older children.
The grants amounted to about 5% of the organization’s operating budget, Two Bulls said. While the terminated funding won’t shutter the program, she’ll have to reallocate funds or find new revenue for the increasing need the grant was intended to address.
“This action was completely disconnected from the need and the vulnerability in our community,” Two Bulls said. “What we have is less funding and less infrastructure to properly address it. We’re painfully aware of how many kids it leaves at risk.”
Greg Sattizahn, state court administrator for the South Dakota Unified Judicial System, said in a news release that the state is committed to “providing leadership, support and encouragement” to the eight CASA nonprofits across the state.

Rep. Terry Falk, R-Kalispell, said Gov. Greg Gianforte handed legislators a bloated budget, and it was still too big on the cusp of its near final vote.
Although it was Day 83 of a session that’s a maximum 90 days, Falk said it wasn’t too late to trim the budget, to return more money to taxpayers, contrary to the lyrics of a country song, it’s “too late to do the right thing now.”
“That might be true in love. I don’t think it’s true in budgets,” Falk said.
As the session nears a close, the argument brought political divisions into focus, including a dynamic in the Senate. There, “The Nine” Republicans and all Democrats teamed up as a working majority, frustrating more conservative Republican leadership.
In the House debate, members of the Freedom Caucus condemned Gianforte for presenting a “smoke and mirrors” budget in House Bill 2, and hardline Republicans faulted their colleagues for going along with it.
But Republicans in support of HB 2 said its critics wanted to unfairly characterize the budget as a failure to score political points, and Democratic supporter Rep. Mary Caferro of Helena said it takes care of the basics.
“The House passed a fair budget over to the Senate, and then the Senate made it even more fair, particularly for the working-class people of Montana and their families,” Caferro said.
Monday, the House voted 67-33 to agree with the changes the Senate had made to HB 2 last week, with support from all 42 Democrats and 25 Republicans, albeit some frustrated ones.
In support of taking the budget to the finish line, but against the idea to send it to committee for a trim, Majority Leader Steve Fitzpatrick said any more work on the budget would just backfire.
Fitzpatrick, R-Great Falls, said he didn’t have any particular love for the budget, but it was high time to be done with it before it grew even bigger.
He pointed in particular to a lack of restraint in the subcommittee that handled the health department — “our Section B can’t say ‘no.’” But he said neither could others along the way.
“I sit here and pull my hair out some days wondering what happened to the Republican party,” Fitzpatrick said.
In a later debate over another bill, he told Republicans it was time to be “fiscal conservatives, not part-time fiscal conservatives.”
On the floor, however, sponsor and Rep. Llew Jones, R-Conrad, said the increases criticized in the budget represent legislative priorities and needs of Montanans, and the budget is balanced.
The most recent tally shows $224.8 million unspent at the end of the 2027 biennium.
After the debate, Jones said he believes that amount will increase as bills currently accounted for fail to pass, and as the governor potentially vetoes some spending.
The 2027 biennium budget costs 17% more than the 2025 biennium budget so far, and critics in the legislature have highlighted the figure as much too steep.
Jones, though, sponsor of House Bill 2 and chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, said those costs include as much as $200 million in property tax relief.
He said if giving Montanans their money back is wrong, “then we should be wrong every day.”
The increase also includes nearly $100 million more required in the state match by the federal government for Medicaid, another $100 million for education, and money for “backing the blue,” he said.
Once large items are accounted for, Jones said, the increase looks more like 4% each year, in line with inflation.
“Yes, the budget is bigger,” Jones said. “We’re returning money to taxpayers. We’re keeping criminals off the street. We’re protecting our elders and vulnerable neighbors, and we’re taking care of health care.”
But Rep. Jane Gillette, R-Three Forks, said the budget isn’t fully transparent with taxpayers, an “illusion” from the start.
“It was presented from the governor as a smoke-and-mirrors budget,” said Gillette, a member of the Freedom Caucus.
She said the governor tried to present some spending as outside of HB 2 in order for his proposal to appear more conservative than it was, but legislators didn’t sign onto the idea.
However, Gillette also said the Senate took a $50 million bite out of HB 2 for contract nurses, helping the most vulnerable patients including at the state hospital.
The Senate added $15 million back for hiring employees at the state hospital instead. But Gillette said the health department would spend all the money anyway.
Gillette said the agency has the authority to dip into other funds it controls, and it would simply scrape $35 million out of another bucket, such as for children or nursing homes.
“They’ll take money from next year’s general fund. It’s just putting it on the credit card,” said Gillette, chairperson of the subcommittee that reviews the health department budget.
Rep. John Fitzpatrick, R-Anaconda, though, asked the House to reject Gillette’s testimony.
He said the Department of Public Health and Human Services had been spending money profligately on traveling nurses, largely at the state hospital.
“The department of health … did absolutely nothing to hire state employees at the state hospital, and I mean absolutely nothing,” Fitzpatrick said.
He said Gillette’s subcommittee had included $75 million for traveling nurses. Yet state employees were more affordable than contract travelers, he said — a cost of $91,000 compared to $280,000.
Roughly six weeks ago, however, he said the governor told him, as did health department staff at a more recent committee hearing, that the agency had finally started hiring, and at a rate of one nurse a week.
If that was the case, he said, it didn’t need $75 million for traveling nurses, and the Senate rightly stripped out that money.
“It’s time to make the Department of Public Health and Human Services accountable to the people of Montana, to make a real effort at hiring state employees,” Fitzpatrick said.
“They’re claiming they can do it. Fine. Let’s hold their feet to the fire, and if they don’t get the job done, then we’ll have a real serious discussion about the supplemental (budget request) next time.”
But Rep. Jerry Schillinger, R-Circle, blamed the Senate for the results in HB 2, pointing the finger at the working majority in the Senate, the coalition of Democrats and nine Republicans.
He said the Senate’s Finance and Claims Committee didn’t scrutinize the budget for long, but it wasn’t fully in control, with bills being blasted out of its hands.
“The chaos that started on Day One continues to this day, and we see it on House Bill 2,” said Schillinger, a Freedom Caucus member.
Jones called the allegation the budget was “smoke and mirrors” the “new term of the hour,” and said it must be “the saddest magic show on earth” given the numbers on spreadsheets and results for taxpayers.
After the debate, Rep. David Bedey, R-Hamilton, said some of the accusations on the floor were about showmanship and political games, not crafting a budget that works for Montanans.
“It’s evident from the rhetoric we heard when House Bill 2 was on the floor that several members of the House are creating soundbites for the purpose of attacking their political enemies,” Bedey said.
He said some of the Republicans who spoke against the budget want to paint a negative picture for political purposes.
“The idea is to portray the budget as a failure,” Bedey said. “The budget is balanced. It meets the needs of the state and provides the government services that the citizens of Montana expect with respect to education, health care and criminal justice.”
HB 2 is scheduled for its last vote on Tuesday before it heads to the governor’s desk.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/230426-CapitolStockPhotos01-scaled-e1731707160413-1024x577.jpg,,,2025-04-29 13:19:37.712180

(Courtesy of CommonWealth Beacon)President Donald Trump raked in nearly $4.1 million for his 2025 inauguration from donors and businesses with Massachusetts addresses, just under 2% of the total $239 million raised for the parties tied to his swearing-in for a second term in January.
Trump’s inaugural committee reported the names and figures earlier this month in a filing with the Federal Election Commission (FEC), which showed the president beating the previous record he set: $107 million for his first inauguration. Presidential inaugurations feature the oath of office as well as official and unofficial balls or galas in Washington, D.C., offering a way for companies and individuals to ingratiate themselves with a new administration.
Large corporations made appearances on the list, including e-commerce giant Amazon and Facebook owner Meta, which each gave $1 million. The largest donation, coming in at $5 million, was from Pilgrim’s Pride, a poultry producer based in Colorado. Cryptocurrency interests also donated, with Ripple Labs donating $4.9 million.
The 21 Massachusetts donors and businesses, with donations totaling roughly $4.1 million, fell below their counterparts in other states, such as Pennsylvania ($8.6 million) and Michigan ($6.4 million). Both were swing states in 2024, while Massachusetts has remained a Democratic stronghold, with Ronald Reagan the last Republican to win the Bay State in 1984.
CommonWealth Beacon reviewed the Trump inauguration fundraising committee’s filing with the Federal Election Commission, which included donors and companies listing Massachusetts addresses. One of the largest donors in the state was a company tied to billionaire and car dealership magnate Ernie Boch Jr. The company, which is called Boston Port Service and shares an address with his nonprofit charity Music Drives Us, donated $1 million. Boch, who previously hosted a fundraiser for Trump in 2015, was unreachable for comment.
DraftKings, the Boston-based gambling company with a focus on sports betting, gave $502,000, while FanDuel, its New York-based rival, gave $482,000.
Another $500,000 came from GE Vernova, a Cambridge-based energy technology company working in the renewable power sector. The company, whose wind power division is grappling with a White House that has sought to put a stop to new wind turbine projects, spun off from the conglomerate General Electric in 2024. (CommonWealth Beacon reached out to DraftKings and GE Vernova for comment but did not hear back.)
Jessica Beeson Tocco, the CEO of A10 Associates, which bills itself as the country’s “largest woman-owned bipartisan lobbying firm,” personally donated $101,652 to the Trump inauguration committee and then an additional $50,000 through her Malden-based company. (The company also hosted a cocktail reception at the Waldorf Astoria the weekend before the inauguration, according to Politico.)
One of her clients, Quantum Computing Inc. CEO William McGann, also donated $101,652. He is retiring from the technology company in May and is listed as having an East Falmouth address on the FEC’s records.
Reached for comment, Tocco stressed that her firm’s donations go to top elected officials in both parties, with contributions flowing to prominent Massachusetts Democrats like US Sen. Ed Markey, Gov. Maura Healey, and Congresswoman Lori Trahan.
A potential Healey rival for the corner office in the State House, Michael Minogue, donated $250,000 to the Trump inauguration committee. Minogue, who now has his own consulting firm after serving as president and CEO of medical technology company Abiomed, has previously donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Republican National Committee and the state GOP. He also gave several thousand dollars to former Gov. Charlie Baker and Josh Kraft, who is looking to unseat Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, according to publicly available campaign finance records.
Others gave smaller amounts. Sriprakash Kothari, an accounting professor at MIT and a Lexington resident who regularly donates to the state GOP, gave $2,500 to the Trump inauguration committee. Kothari, who worked as the chief economist for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission during the first Trump administration, declined to comment about the donation.
Some of the donors, like the company tied to Boch, had to be tracked through corporate documents on file with the Massachusetts secretary of state’s office. For example, Randolph-based GGBF Inc. donated $50,000 to the Trump inauguration committee, according to the FEC filing.
Documents on file with the state show the company shares the same address and same president as NEI General Contracting, Josef Rettman. Rettman has mostly donated to Democrats at the state and local level, and a mix at the federal level, including U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Trump White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt’s 2022 congressional campaign in New Hampshire.
The list of donors to the inauguration committee did not include the names of some major donors who had previously contributed to the first Trump presidential campaign or the first inauguration in 2017. Jim Davis, the chairman of shoemaker New Balance, donated nearly $400,000 to support Trump’s 2016 campaign.
The Kraft Group, tied to New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, didn’t donate to the 2025 inauguration after donating $1 million for the 2017 inauguration. Ahead of the 2024 election, Kraft distanced himself from Trump, saying he was “very upset” by the insurrection attempt to keep Trump in office on January 6, 2021. Kraft has since reportedly helped a law firm, Paul Weiss, broker a peace deal with Trump, who has targeted lawyers through executive orders.
“I made a strong donation to his [2017] inauguration,” Kraft said during an appearance on a radio show last October. “I couldn’t believe it, it was like having someone who was a drunk fraternity brother become president of the United States.”

The state's perpetual ranking as among the deadliest in the nation for workers points to systemic disregard, advocates say.
The post In honoring fallen workers, advocates call for action in Wyoming appeared first on WyoFile .","CHEYENNE—A silver triangle rang out 45 times in the Capitol’s rotunda. Each ring commemorated a worker who went to work in Wyoming in 2023 and didn’t return home to their families because they were killed on the job.
About three dozen people — mostly from local unions — gathered for the Workers Memorial Day ceremony on a cool and wet Monday evening.
“Every person who goes to work deserves to come home,” said Marcie Kindred, executive director of the Wyoming AFL-CIO. “Every family deserves the peace of knowing their loved ones are protected. Every life lost is one too many.”
The Rev. Delaney Piper, pastor of Highlands Presbyterian Church, led the group in prayer.
“Oh God, we do not understand why deaths like this, that we remember, that we mourn today, occur,” Piper said. “More so, we do not understand why everyone — workers, business leaders and political leaders — don’t just join in taking decisive action to prevent future deaths and to protect workers.”

The annual event recognizes Workers Memorial Day, the anniversary of the 1970 Occupational Safety and Health Act. The measure, in response to the carnage of workplace fatalities, injuries and illnesses, is supposed to ensure safe work conditions. Though accidents do happen, Kindred said, far too many are entirely preventable and, collectively, they point to a systemic disregard for workers.
“Behind every workplace fatality lies a story [of a life] cut short too soon and a ripple of grief that continues long after the headlines fade,” Kindred said.
Kindred and other speakers noted that Wyoming’s 45 occupational fatalities in 2023 made it the deadliest state in the nation for workers that year — a distinction Wyoming has held far too many times. Marcia Shanor, executive director of the Wyoming Trial Lawyers Association and a longtime worker advocate, said the annual commitment to demand safer working conditions appears to ring hollow among state leaders.

Local trona miner and United Steelworkers Local 13214 President Marshal Cummings speaks to a small crowd about the importance of worker safety Monday during Workers Memorial Day at the Wyoming State Capitol in Cheyenne. Cummings told the crowd that he was motivated to fight for safe working conditions to ensure that his children would always have a father present. (Ivy Secrest/WyoFile)
“We have committed, every single year for the last 20 years, to do better,” Shanor said. “And here we are, 20 years later, decades later, with one of the highest workplace fatality rates since 2007. It feels hollow to have to say those words that I have said every single year as we have remembered the great people who keep our state working.”
United Steelworkers Local 13214 President Marshal Cummings, who works at the WE Soda trona mine near Green River, believes Wyoming’s perpetual worker fatality epidemic is the result of a disregard for workers enshrined in its “right-to-work” laws. Such laws ostensibly protect employees from being forced to join a union. But, in Cummings’ estimation, the laws are specifically intended to limit the power of unions, along with their persuasion to hold employers accountable for worker safety. 
“Let’s be very clear about this: right-to-work is a lie,” Cummings said. “It’s not about jobs. It’s not about freedom. It’s about weakening the very organizations — our unions — that keep us safe.”
In states with right-to-work laws, workers see lower wages, fewer health benefits and weaker retirement security, according to Cummings.
“Most importantly, workplaces [in right-to-work states] are more dangerous,” he said. “What is the right to liberty if you can’t speak up on dangerous conditions because you might be fired if you do? What’s the right to personal happiness if you’re trapped in a system where your work, your blood, your sweat, your tears, if your sacrifice is treated as disposable?”

Wyoming is the deadliest state in the nation for workers, again 



For now, the Wyoming AFL-CIO is focusing its legislative efforts not on the state’s right-to-work laws, but on the larger and more immediate goal of improving workplace safety, according to Kindred. The union group, the Wyoming Trial Lawyers Association and other worker advocates see an opportunity to reignite past statewide efforts that had nudged Wyoming toward safer workplaces — efforts that seemed to fizzle out after the COVID-19 pandemic.
“It shouldn’t be one time a year that we all get together and talk about why this is an important issue,” Shanor said. “We should be having those conversations at the workplace, upstairs [in the House and Senate chambers], the governor’s office, and we should have leadership by our elected officials in helping us actually make steps forward that stay in place.”

Senate Bill 394, “Prohibit Foreign Ownership of NC Land,” passed without discussion after the panel approved a technical amendment. The legislation now moves to the Senate Rules Committee.
The bill comes at the same time that tensions between the U.S. a several other nations have been on the rise as the result of the Trump administration’s economic tariffs and other foreign policy shifts.
Sens. Bob Brinson (R-Beaufort, Craven, Lenoir), Bobby Hanig (R-Bertie, Camden, Currituck, Dare, Gates, Hertford, Northampton, Pasquotank, Perquimans, Tyrrell), and Timothy Moffitt (R-Henderson, Polk, Rutherford) serve as the primary sponsors for SB 394.
The bill would prohibit the “adversarial” nations of China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia from making claims to land that is agricultural, situated within a 25-mile radius of a military installation, or underneath special use airspace as designated by the Federal Aviation Administration.
Lawmakers on the same committee reviewed SB 394 during a meeting on April 16, prior to taking a one-week recess. During that session, legislators discussed the bill but did not vote.
“This bill essentially acknowledges that food security is national security and it’s a state effort to protect our military bases,” Brinson said during that meeting.
Entities falling under the bill’s stipulations who own the land prior to the legislation becoming law, if it happens, would need to register with the secretary of state and attorney general.
Twelve states have already enacted similar measures, according to Brinson.
Sen. Sophia Chitlik (D-Durham) asked if the bill would apply to dual citizens and prohibit them from owning farmland in North Carolina.
Legislative staff responded that individuals holding U.S. citizenship, permanent residence, or other forms of lawful presence would not be subject to the measure.
Chitlik also asked if the bill would pose challenges to the Fair Housing Act, which makes it illegal to discriminate in the sale or rental of housing due to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, familial status, or disability.
Brinson said the legislation was modeled after language in Florida, where it did not run into issues.
“It doesn’t mention nationality, it mentions citizenship,” Brinson said. “There is a distinction and a difference.”

(Photo courtesy of USD)Nine South Dakota law school students have been selected as the first participants in a pilot program that could allow them to become lawyers without passing the state bar exam.
The Public Service Pathway Bar Admission Pilot Program is an outgrowth of a yearslong debate on the value of the bar exam as a measure of fitness for legal service in the state. For about a decade, bar exam critics in South Dakota have criticized the timed test as a barrier to the profession that can prevent otherwise competent lawyers from service based not on their ability, but on slower reading speeds or extra time spent fine-tuning their analysis.
Pilot program will allow new lawyers to swap public service for the bar exam

The pilot program creates an alternative route to bar licensure by combining legal education and practical experience. Law school students selected for the program must complete a minimum of two years of full-time public service employment, such as in the office of a state’s attorney or public defender, upon admission to practice law in the state.
The University of South Dakota Knudson School of Law, in partnership with the host public service entities, selected the nine participants from 13 applicants.
“This program reflects our commitment to shaping lawyers who are not only skilled and ethical but also dedicated to serving the public good,” said Knudson School of Law Dean Neil Fulton in a news release. “It provides an innovative, rigorous pathway to licensure that emphasizes real-world experience and professional responsibility.”
Participants have been placed to work with the Minnehaha County Public Defender’s Office in Sioux Falls, Brown County State’s Attorney’s Office in Aberdeen, Minnehaha County State’s Attorney’s Office in Sioux Falls, Pennington County State’s Attorney’s Office in Rapid City, and the Federal Public Defender’s Office in Sioux Falls. Attorneys with the host entities will supervise, mentor and assist each participant.
Program participants will be required to submit a portfolio of their work during the program. The Board of Bar Examiners will evaluate the work and perform a character and fitness review of each participant before making a recommendation regarding a participant’s admission to practice as an attorney in South Dakota.
The five-year pilot program is administered through the cooperation of the USD Knudson School of Law and the state Board of Bar Examiners. The program is open to students at the law school and limited to a maximum of 10 students that meet specific criteria in each law school class during the pilot.

(Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).A losing legal battle that stretched over nearly 10 years has potentially quadrupled the cost Missouri taxpayers must pay to a software firm fired in 2016 as it worked to modernize the state’s social services enrollment system.
In January, the Missouri Western District Court of Appeals upheld a $23 million jury award to EngagePoint, handed down in 2022 for work it performed but for which it was never paid. The judgment included 9% interest starting in May 2015 for one portion of the award, a little over $4 million, and starting in March 2016 for another claim for $19 million.
The Missouri Supreme Court at the beginning of April declined to hear another appeal and the Senate Appropriations Committee has, at the request of Gov. Mike Kehoe, included $92.7 million to pay off the judgment. Of that amount, $48.8 is from general revenue and $43.9 millions from federal funds.
“The state asked our client to do a whole lot of extra work, and a jury found it had agreed to pay our client for that extra work,” said attorney Chuck Hatfield, who represented EngagePoint and its successor claimant, HHS Technology Group.
EngagePoint, a Florida-based firm, was hired by the state in 2013 in response to a request for proposals for a vendor to implement the Missouri Human Services Eligibility, Enrollment and Case Management System, a comprehensive, fully-integrated system for Department of Social Services’ programs, like Medicaid.
EngagePoint was hired over competitors such as IBM, and alleged in its lawsuit that the state ignored the company’s advice and licensed a software directly from IBM and then later held EngagePoint accountable for flaws with the software, which was “unstable and not functionally ready.”
Problems with the Missouri Eligibility Determination and Enrollment System that EngagePoint was hired to implement continue to be an issue. The system was blamed for delays in enrolling newly eligible participants under expanded Medicaid. The state cited updates to the state’s Medicaid system to make eligibility determinations as the reason applications wouldn’t be processed for 60 days after the state was court-ordered to implement expanded Medicaid in 2021.
In May 2024, federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in a letter sent to the state that it was concerned the state is not doing enough to “achieve and sustain” compliance with federal rules on Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program.
Missouri was among the worst states in the nation for processing times, with 72% of applications taking more than 45 days to process in February 2024. The processing times have improved, and the latest report from the Department of Social Services shows the average processing time in March was 38 days.
HHS Technology acquired EngagePoint’s claims for the contract dispute lawsuit and was substituted as the plaintiff. It sued DSS in 2023, alleging the state violated Missouri’s Sunshine Law by refusing to turn over public records that it was denied in the litigation over the software work.
In September, Circuit Judge Jon Beetem determined that the department violated the Sunshine Law by wrongfully withholding public records based on the identity of requester and not the contents of the records. The department also took months to respond to the request without a reasonable justification, Beetem ruled.
Beetem ordered the state to pay a $5,000 fine for a knowing violation of the Sunshine Law and $115,200 in attorney fees and costs. An appeal is pending before the Western District Court of Appeals.
Whether the entire $92.7 million — four times the original judgment — will be paid out is uncertain.
A calculation of interest since the 2022 judgment shows that the $4 million portion of the award will be about $9.8 million on June 30, the final day of the current fiscal year, and the $19 million portion will have grown to $42.3 million.
The budget takes effect July 1 and the final cost will be determined by when the state makes the payment, with interest adding about $13,000 a day to the cost.
“The judgments got really big,” Hatfield said, “because there’s both pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, pursuant to Missouri law.”

,DC,2025-04-29 16:38:53+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Relief on auto tariffs coming, Treasury secretary says",Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/relief-auto-tariffs-coming-treasury-secretary-says,,"WASHINGTON — Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent signaled a reprieve on auto tariffs will come Tuesday ahead of the president’s stop in Michigan to mark his first 100 days in office.Bessent and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed President Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order Tuesday curtailing the import taxes for domestic car manufacturers, but offered few specifics. The president’s 25% levy on cars and auto parts went into effect at the beginning of April.“I’m not going to go into the details of the auto tariff relief, but I can tell you that it will go substantially toward reshoring American auto manufacturing,” Bessent said. “And again, the goal here is to bring back the high-quality industrial jobs to the U.S.”The press secretary and Bessent began the day defending Trump’s trade policy as part of a weeklong morning press conference series marking the 100-day milestone in Trump’s second administration.Investors and businesses have been on edge since Trump declared foreign trade a national emergency on April 2 and imposed what he billed as “reciprocal” tariffs on nearly every nation. Trump issued a 90-day pause on the steep levies — some reaching nearly 50% — after trillions of dollars disappeared from U.S. and world markets in reaction to the dramatic policy.However, Trump dug in his heels on goods from China, increasing tariffs to 145%. Nearly all other countries face universal 10% baseline levy.No deals yetNearly a month after the tariffs went into effect, Bessent told reporters the administration has not yet inked deals with any of the 17 trading partners, not counting China, currently in negotiations with the U.S. When pressed about a timeline for the deals, Bessent said Trump has created “strategic uncertainty” as a tool to get the best terms.“I think the aperture of uncertainty will be narrowing, and as we start moving toward announcing deals, then there will be certainty. But certainty is not necessarily a good thing in negotiating,” Bessent said.Bessent sidestepped questions about trade talks with China, saying he wouldn’t get “into the nitty-gritty of who’s talking to whom.” China has imposed 125% tariffs on U.S. goods and has denied any meaningful negotiations.“I think that, you know, over time, we will see that the Chinese tariffs are unsustainable for China,” Bessent said, adding that China sends more goods to the U.S. than Americans send to China.Americans' approval of Trump’s job performance, particularly on economic policy, is lagging, according to numerous recent surveys.In response to a report that Amazon will highlight spikes in prices due to tariffs, Leavitt said the e-commerce behemoth was committing a “hostile and political act.” Punchbowl News reported the story Tuesday citing “a person familiar with the plan.”Amazon denied the report hours later, according to NPR and other outlets.Tax cutsWhen asked about potential economic damage from business owners clamping down on hiring and growth, Bessent told reporters “tax cuts are coming.”The secretary said he and Trump met at the White House Monday with congressional Republicans, including House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana and Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota.Johnson and Thune have signaled different timelines — from Memorial Day to further into summer — for when Congress would finish a large budget reconciliation package, at the heart of which is Trump’s plan to extend his 2017 tax law.Bessent said Trump wants the tax bill to revive and expand full business expensing, meaning businesses could write off expenses for certain investments, like equipment.“The other thing that we are looking to add is full expensing for factories,” Bessent said. “So bring your factory back, you can fully expense the equipment and the building.”",,,,2025-04-29 13:19:37.712180

House Bill 859 is sponsored by Rep. Cody Honeycutt (R-Montgomery). It would prohibit the establishment of guaranteed income programs without express authorization of “general or local law” — something that would require approval from the General Assembly. It was referred to the House State and Local Government Committee without discussion.
Guaranteed income programs provide individuals or families with cash payments generally with no strings attached. The cash payments may be used for necessities such as food, childcare expenses, medicine and transportation.
The goal is to provide low-income families or individuals with a steady income to increase financial stability.
Supporters see such programs as a way to help lift families and individuals out of poverty and to address income inequality. Meanwhile, critics argue that such programs create a disincentive for work, are expensive and will not reduce dependency on welfare programs as some supporters claim.
Under HB 859, programs under which an individual is required to seek reemployment, perform work or attend training as a condition of a cash payment would be exempt from the law.
In North Carolina, the City of Durham launched a guaranteed income pilot program for formerly incarcerated individuals in March 2022 titled Excel. The pilot ended in August 2024.
Assistant Durham City Manager Karmisha Wallace told NC Newsline that the city council allocated $1 million this fiscal year to continue the program, which the city would manage. A nonprofit administered the pilot program.
Wallace said the city has neither determined the amount of the monthly stipend under the new program nor the number of participants. Under the pilot, 109 formerly incarcerated individuals received $600 a month for one year.
She said training for justice involved individuals is already available through other city-run programs in which they participate.
“We already have programming in place now that help justice involved individuals get IDs, get jobs, secure medical support, transportation and that sort of thing,” Wallace said.
Wallace said HB 859 could be problematic.
“I think it’s safe to say the city is concerned about any legislation that restricts our abilities to meet the needs of our constituents,” Wallace said.
According to the Durham County website, the county is launching a guaranteed income pilot program called DCo Thrives that will provide $750 per month for one year to 125 randomly selected low-income families. That program is funded by the American Rescue Plan Act and will be administered by Durham Children’s Initiative, according to the website. 
Guaranteed income programs gained steam during the pandemic. Large cities such as Los Angeles and Atlanta are among those that launched pilot programs.
Michael D. Tubbs, founder and chair or Mayors & Counties for a Guaranteed Income, said last summer in a letter defending a program in Harris County (home to the city of Houston) that was blocked by the Texas Supreme Court that there were more than 100 pilot programs nationwide in-process or having concluded with “great success.”
Tubbs is a former Stockton, California mayor who helped launch one of the country’s first guaranteed income programs in 2019.
The Harris County program is still on hold due to the legal challenge. Last week, the Texas Senate approved a bill to ban local governments from adopting such programs.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_2889-2048x1536-1-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-04-29 13:19:37.712180

(Photo: Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)Insurance companies handily gained an advantage Monday in the Louisiana Legislature’s debate over how to bring down the state’s exorbitant auto coverage rates. Lawmakers worked well into the evening to approve a long list of bills that target personal injury lawsuits, which they said  is the primary cause of high premiums.  
House Bill 34, sponsored by Rep. Brian Glorioso, R-Slidell, passed the House of Representatives in a 68-26 vote and now heads to the Senate for consideration. It would allow any party in a lawsuit that stems from an auto accident to introduce evidence related to medical expenses.  
Current law prevents juries from seeing what accident victims actually pay for medical treatment and only allows access to what a doctor billed. In many instances, however, medical providers don’t actually receive the full amounts that they bill. Sometimes, Glorioso said, lawyers work with doctors who will inflate their medical billings just to get an increased payout for the plaintiff. Also, health insurers often do not pay doctors the full amounts they bill.
Glorioso’s bill would limit a plaintiff’s recovery of medical expenses to “reasonable” amounts, which would be left for a judge or jury to decide. 
The vote on the bill fell mostly along party lines with two defections from each side. Democrats Pat Moore of Monroe and Steven Jackson of Shreveport voted in favor of the proposal. Republicans Jeremy LaCombe of Livonia, an attorney, and Joe Stagni of Kenner opposed it. 
During floor debate, several Democrats pointed to similar tort reform bills from years prior that failed to reduce Louisiana’s auto insurance rates, which remain among the highest in the country.  
Rep. Sylvia Taylor, D-LaPlace asked Glorioso whether he could say for certain that his bill would lower premiums — a question heard frequently from Democrats as Republicans have presented their insurance bills. Glorioso, who’s a lawyer, rejected the premise of the argument. 
“If that is the standard by which we’re going to pass insurance bills, we may as well go home,” Glorioso said, implying that such guarantees would be impossible to make. 
House Bill 435, by Rep. Peter Egan, R-Covington, passed in a 62-23 vote and drew some of the more colorful debate of the evening — even though it’s unlikely to have much of an impact on auto insurance rates. It puts a ceiling on the amount a person can be awarded in a lawsuit, capping general damages at $5 million even in the case of wrongful death.
When the bill came up for a hearing last week in the House Committee on Civil Law and Procedure, lawmakers pointed out that it won’t directly lower rates because $5 million is already the maximum payout on commercial auto policies in Louisiana. Insurance companies currently don’t pay any more than that regardless of how much a jury awards a plaintiff.
Nevertheless, Egan has said his bill would stem what he believes is a culture of litigiousness in Louisiana if people understand they can no longer receive huge jury awards. 
Rep. Edmond Jordan, D-Baton Rouge, an attorney, questioned how Republicans can claim to be “pro-life” if they would support a bill that effectively establishes a $5 million maximum value on a person’s life.
“This cap is the opposite of pro-life,” Jordan said. “If you were truly pro-life, you would not succumb and agree with the premise that we should be putting [value] caps on people’s lives.”
Rep. Raymond Crews, R-Bossier City, argued Louisiana residents are overwhelmingly complaining of excessive litigation and asking lawmakers to fix the tort system in an effort to lower rates. 
House Bill 439, by Rep. Troy Hebert, R-Lafayette, passed in a 57-30 vote with LaCombe and Stagni joining Democrats in opposition. The bill aims to limit contingency fees, the money a lawyer makes off a percentage of the lawsuit winnings, to 10% on the first $15,000 in damages. Settlements with insurers for most minor accidents fall under this ceiling. For any damages beyond $15,000, Hebert’s bill would not limit lawyer payments. 

House Bill 431, by Rep. Emily Chenevert, R-Baton Rouge, passed in a 66-26 vote along strict party lines. The bill would limit the ability for people to recover damages for injuries sustained in accidents for which they are mostly at fault.
Her bill would change Louisiana’s comparative fault statute, which assigns a percentage of blame to each party in an accident and allows for the recovery of damages in proportion with those percentages. 
Under current law, a person partly at fault in an accident would be liable for their share of the damages and can recover the remaining amount found to be the fault of the other party. Chenevert’s bill would change that to prohibit recovery of any amount by a party who’s 51% or more at fault. 
House Bill 450, by Rep. Michael Melerine, R-Shreveport, would end the Housley presumption, a standard of evidence explained in a 1991 Louisiana Supreme Court ruling that applies to auto accidents, medical malpractice and other injury lawsuits. In a nutshell, the Housley presumption says courts should assume a plaintiff’s injuries resulted from the accident in question if they were in good health beforehand.  
Lawmakers have tried repeatedly to revoke the presumption, only to see their attempts fail or vetoed. This year is expected to be different as Gov. Jeff Landry recently signaled support for the measure from Melerine, whose law firm handles insurance defense and other litigation. 
House Bill 436, by Rep. Gabe Firment, R-Pollock, passed in a 69-17 vote. It would prohibit “unauthorized aliens” — defined in the measure as individuals illegally in the United States under federal immigration law — from receiving general damages stemming from auto accidents. General damages include compensation for pain and suffering, but the proposal would still allow recovery for “special damages,” such as medical expenses and property damage.
Firment, an insurance adjuster, said the purpose of his bill is to help address the state’s auto insurance crisis while discouraging illegal immigration. 
House Bill 443, by Rep. Chance Henry, R-Crowley, passed in a 70-22 vote. It would require plaintiffs to notify defendants of an intent to file a lawsuit within 10 days of retaining a lawyer. 
Currently, plaintiffs’ lawyers can gather evidence and prepare for a lawsuit for almost two full years before a defendant is even aware a suit is coming. Henry, an insurance agency owner, said his bill would give a defendant the same amount of time to prepare for a claim as a plaintiff.
House Bill 291, sponsored by Rep. Jay Gallé, R-Mandeville, won the most bipartisan support of the insurance bills, passing the chamber in a 90-5 vote. It would extend the filing deadline, called a “prescriptive period,” for wrongful death lawsuits from one year to two, aligning Louisiana with the deadline in most other states. 
Proponents of the bill have argued that a shorter prescriptive period attracts more tenuous lawsuits by essentially forcing people to quickly file claims so as to not lose their litigation rights. The proposal also complements a similar measure lawmakers approved last year to extend the deadline for filing personal injury claims.   
A measure that did not target litigation, House Bill 496, also gathered bipartisan support in a 86-3 vote. It would give policyholders a pass protecting them from any rate increases tied to a lapse in auto coverage. The bill would prohibit insurers from penalizing policyholders for a single instance of nonpayment during a five-year period.

Submitted on behalf of Stride, Inc. and its online education subsidiary, K12 Virtual Schools, the complaint alleges Hyatt sought a $235,000-per-year salary as Stride’s Vice President for Academic Innovation, while the company had an active contract with the school district—and when he was not hired for the position, Hyatt sought to terminate that contract.
K12 provides online education for the district’s Destinations Career Academy of New Mexico.

This story was originally published by New Mexico In Depth.

“Superintendent Hyatt is apparently knowingly and willfully abusing his public position, at the expense of ~4,200 New Mexico students” who are enrolled in online schooling, the complaint alleged.
In an email to New Mexico In Depth, Monday, Hyatt refuted the allegations, saying the company, not he, behaved in “illegal” and “unethical” ways, because of inadequate student-teacher ratios for their online courses.
“We have recently found out the illegal [and] unethical practices of Stride and how they are profiting and increasing revenue by breaking the law in our online program,” Hyatt wrote. “We notified them of their wrongdoing and had previously notified them to not break the law when it comes to students teacher ratios.”
The ethics complaint letter alleges that Hyatt potentially violated the New Mexico Government Conduct Act (GCA) and state procurement code. “The GCA has specific prohibitions against a public officer or employee seeking employment with a contractor who has a contract with the public officer or employee’s employer,” according to the complaint. “The Procurement Code similarly prohibits an employee who is participating directly or indirectly in the procurement process to become, or to be, while such an employee, the employee of any person or business contracting with the governmental body by whom the employee is employed.”
The complaint was filed by attorney Laura E. Sanchez of the law firm Rodey, Dickason, Sloan, Akin & Robb, P.A., in Albuquerque.
The New Mexico State Ethics Commission declined to comment on the complaint or its investigation plans. On Monday, Deputy Director Amelia Bierle told New Mexico In Depth in an email that the Commission does not comment on alleged ethics violations before investigations are concluded.
Gallup-McKinley signed an Educational Products & Services Contract with K12 in June 2020. Hyatt was district superintendent.
According to the company’s complaint letter, Hyatt applied for the company’s VP position on December 11, 2024 and was initially interviewed on Jan. 21, 2025.
On Feb. 21, the company’s senior vice president of schools, Adam Hawf, spoke with Hyatt by phone to let him know he had not been hired.
“Mr. Hawf called Superintendent Hyatt, as opposed to issuing him a formal letter, due to the sensitivity of the relationship and fear that Superintendent Hyatt would adversely affect the District’s relationship with the Contractor,” the complaint letter states.
In his email to New Mexico In Depth, Monday, Hyatt confirmed, “I applied for a job there in 2024.”
Less than a month after the call with Hawf, at a routine monthly meeting with the company on March 10, Hyatt’s demeanor had become “completely different than it had been in past meetings,” according to the complaint letter. “[T]he meeting was hostile […] instead of amicable and collaborative.”
On April 1, Hyatt sent a breach of contract and termination letter to the company, citing several alleged contract breaches, including inadequate student-teacher ratios, teacher licensure, and problems with student achievement in Destinations Career Academy students. Three days later, Gallup-McKinley issued a request for proposals to find a new contractor.
The termination letter violated a 45-day “cure” period for contractual disputes, the company contends. The complaint further alleges that Hyatt directed the district to issue the new request for proposals for virtual education services while Stride’s contract was still in effect, potentially violating its exclusivity provision.
Hyatt knew previously about student-teacher ratio concerns, according to the complaint letter.
“Superintendent Hyatt’s conduct after he was denied employment … shows that he is potentially abusing his authority, and not acting in the public interest,” the ethics complaint states. “He was aware of the alleged student-teacher ratios and the licensure issues prior to submitting his application for employment with the Contractor. He also served as a positive reference for the Contractor with the New Mexico PED [Public Education Department] on February 6, 2025 and for Ohio as recently as February 25, 2025, despite knowledge of the concerns he later raised in the letter to the Contractor on April 1, 2025.”
The firm submitted 18 supporting documents with the ethics complaint, including emails and correspondence, the termination letter, and the request for proposals.
The company has tried to address Hyatt’s concerns within the 45-day “cure period” set out in the contract but has been hindered by Gallup-McKinley since receiving the termination letter, according to the complaint. Examples include the district delaying teacher criminal history fingerprint clearances and refusing to sign off on teachers’ license extensions.
“Out of desperation they are attempting to deflect the harm they have done […] and are trying to create a narrative that I by myself am trying to break a contract for personal reasons,” Hyatt wrote in his email to the news organization. “Nothing could be further from the truth.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/hyatt-1024x584.jpeg,,,2025-04-29 13:19:37.712180

The suit argues that two companies, Express Scripts Inc. and Prime Therapeutics LLC, made an unlawful agreement to suppress reimbursement rates to independent pharmacies. According to a statement from Nessel’s office, this allowed the companies to make excessive profits and contributed to the closure of pharmacies in Michigan and across the state. 
Pharmacy benefit managers act as intermediaries between insurance providers, drug manufacturers and pharmacies, negotiating discounts and rebates with manufacturers and reimbursing pharmacies for the prescriptions they fill on behalf of the insurance company.
In December 2019, Express Scripts and Prime Therapeutics allegedly entered into an agreement for Prime Therapeutics to adopt Express Scripts’ lower reimbursement rates in exchange for accessing Express Scripts’ buying power and pharmacy network while paying Express Scripts administrative fees. Pharmacies outside this network allegedly received less money for filling prescriptions to the degree that some pharmacies paid more to dispense medication than they were reimbursed. 
Nessel argues the two companies’ agreement contributed to the creation of pharmacy deserts in half of Detroit’s neighborhoods and numerous communities throughout northern Michigan. Her suit aims to terminate the agreement, among other remedies.
“Michigan residents should not have to drive 45 minutes, or sometimes even farther, to pick up the insulin, heart medication, or antibiotics they need,” Nessel said. “Yet the unlawful, anticompetitive agreement that the lawsuit alleges has handed these PBMs unprecedented control over which pharmacies receive medication, how quickly residents get their prescriptions, and how much they’re forced to pay — crippling small, independent pharmacies and restricting access to lifesaving medications in the process.” 
“With this lawsuit, we are putting an end to these harmful practices to ensure Michiganders have reliable, affordable access to the medications they depend on,” Nessel said.

She maynot be getting any help from the state’s Child Care Assistance Program — at least not for the foreseeable future. The Mississippi Department of Human Services has put a cost-cutting hold on which families could apply.
Without it, Coleman, who works as a housekeeper, continues to rely on her relatives and friends to watch her kids, a 2-year-old and a 12-year-old, instead. She doesn’t know if she’s been rejected, but she is in a grey area. She applied in March, the month before the hold took place.
Beginning April 1, MDHS began limiting who could apply for new applications, redetermination applications, and “add a child” applications for child care certificates. 
Families who do not fit one of six priority categories (on or getting off Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, are homeless, have foster children, are teen parents, are deployed military or families with special needs) cannot apply for new certificates or have their certificates renewed. There were 36,186 children with child care certificates in late March, a week before the hold began. About 10,800 did not fit any of the six priority categories. 
Coleman is concerned that the lack of child care puts an extra strain on relatives and older children, creates a greater safety risk for young children, and makes it harder for communities to thrive.

““Our kids need the help, we need the help, because if you take the help from the American people, how do you expect us to thrive as Americans? How do you expect us to thrive as a state?” she said.
MDHS is trying to reduce the number of children receiving certificates to fewer than 27,000 to fit what the department can afford since COVID-19 relief funding dried up, with a target program cost of less than $12 million a month, said Mark Jones, chief communications officer for MDHS.
“We cannot accurately estimate how long the hold will remain in place, but we will be monitoring the situation very closely and will lift the hold as soon as we can,” he said.
MDHS will notify parents 60 days before their annual redetermination deadline. Parents who want to be notified can enter their email address in the application portal.
The Child Care Payment Program provides assistance to working parents and guardians for child care. The parent or guardian still has to pay the difference between what the program provides and the actual cost of tuition. They may also have to make a co-payment every month. 
According to Jones, Mississippi has dedicated approximately $379.9 million from various COVID-19 relief funding programs to child care since 2020. Mississippi currently spends 85% of its funds from the Child Care Development Fund on child care certificates, which was about $127 million in fiscal year 2024 and more than the federal minimum they’re required to spend. 
Mississippi also transfers 30% of its annual state funds from the Temporary Assistance For Needy Families program to child care. In 2024, that amounted to $25.9 million.
Carol Burnett, executive director of the Mississippi Low Income Child Care Initiative, speaks about a policy change by the Mississippi Department of Human Services, that removed a child support requirement for the Child Care Payment Program, at a news conference Monday, May 15, 2023, in Jackson, Miss. (AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis)
Carol Burnett, executive director of the Mississippi Low Income Child Care Initiative, explained the financial impact for families: “The CCPP can reduce the cost of child care by as much as 80%. And so if a family is gonna have to pick up what the CCPP has offered, it’s gonna really increase the cost of child care for that family.”
MLICCI’s Employment Equity for Single Moms program helps single mothers in Mississippi access resources for child care and workforce development to help single moms find higher-paying work. 
A key part of the program is helping these mothers get on the Child Care Payment Program. MLICCI usually covers child care costs for its mothers while they wait to get assistance. Without the assistance, MLICCI can’t afford to pay for long-term child care.
“The biggest chunk of families on CCPP are low-income, single-mom-headed families who are working in jobs with low wages, and they’re not one of the six priorities,” said Burnett.
In addition to the financial impact on families, the hold on applications would disrupt education for children during a crucial period. Research has shown that children who attend quality early childhood education have better academic performance in elementary school.
“Without the CCPP vouchers, many families will not be able to afford child care, and so it’s likely that families’ child care arrangements will become unpredictable and piecemeal…and this uncertainty can cause children stress, which can hinder their development and growth,” explained Biz Harris, executive director of Mississippi Early Learning Alliance. 
Deloris Suel, who owns Prep Company Tutorial Schools in Jackson with her husband,said she thinks parents would be able to teach their children at home with the right training, but it would be a strain on top of their other responsibilities. 
“Child care today is not a babysitting service. There’s benchmarks and goals that we have to meet,” she said.
Prep Company Tutorial Schools serves 260 children, 61 of whom have child care certificates. Only two of their students fit among the six exception categories MDHS listed. 
Last week, a group of child care providers, parents and child care advocates held a press conference on the south steps of the Capitol, urging MDHS to lift the limits on new applications and redeterminations, communicate better with providers and families, and use the current and carry-over TANF funds to supplement the child care voucher program.
At the end of 2023, MDHS had over $156 million in unspent TANF funds, as other states do. Nationwide, states had unobligated TANF balances of nearly $8 billion in 2023. Spending this money on child care would be doable without legislative action, MLICCI said, and has already been done in other states. 
Burnett said she does not know why the state hasn’t used this method of funding. “I mean you would think that they would want to do that when they have the money rather than create this harm for so many families,” she said.
When asked why she thinks MDHS has been hesitant to use the available TANF funds, she said “I have two words: ‘Republican state.’ Because if we have other states joining hands to say, ‘Hey, we can pull this down from here.’ Why can’t Mississippi?”
When asked about using unspent TANF funds in this way, Jones responded, “MDHS is committed to following official federal guidance regarding conversion of TANF funds to CCPP. MDHS is resolved to utilize all available recurring revenue streams to support the CCPP and ensure the long-term viability of the program.”
Jones would not comment on why the department will not use left-over TANF funds.
Jones also stated, “MDHS has discussed the potential for a pause in CCPP certificates with the child care industry each month during the information sessions. The members of SECAC (State Early Childhood Advisory Council) were well aware of this potential pause as far back as 2023.”

Next time you’re around such politicians, especially if they are legislators or running for the Legislature, you should ask them a few questions.
Ask them why the Mississippi Legislature exempts itself from the open records and open meetings laws it levies on all other divisions of state government, and why legislative leaders have even fought in court to keep proceedings involving a majority of a legislative chamber secret from the public.
Ask them why you cannot get on your phone or computer and easily search for who funds their campaign and by how much. Then ask them why you could go to any surrounding state (and nearly all others across the country) and easily and quickly find such information.
Then, ask the same for why you cannot easily, or sometimes at all, see who buys them expensive dinners, trips or gifts to influence their voting, or why there aren’t any prohibitions or limits on this as there are in other states.
Ask their thoughts on “gift laws,” or prohibition or limits on campaign donors getting massive government contracts from the people to whom they donate.
Ask them if they believe all the folks who lobby lawmakers even bother to register as lobbyists or report what they do to influence them.
Ask them why Mississippi government, state to local, provides so few public records online, or why agencies charge so much when they do cough up records. 
Ask them why millions of dollars in out-of-state, secret-sourced “dark money” has been pouring into Mississippi elections in recent years, and what has been done to curb this.

Ask them to explain what Mississippi’s so-called “ethics laws” actually prohibit, what penalties they carry and what authority the so-called “Ethics Commission” has. Ask them how we compare here to other states, such as Alabama, where government ethics laws are actually enforced and their ethics agency has some authority.
READ MORE: Does Mississippi have any campaign finance rules?
For that matter, ask them who or what agency in Mississippi enforces campaign finance, ethics or lobbying laws.
Ask them why Mississippi’s attorney general recently decreed Mississippi’s campaign finance laws and limits to be so jacked up, convoluted and contradictory as to be unenforceable or un-prosecutable. Ask why the head of the state’s ethics agency has described Mississippi campaign finance laws as “a jigsaw puzzle that doesn’t fit.”

Ask them why, whenever even modest reforms such as campaign finance reporting requirements for politicians are proposed, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle act like their hair is on fire and line up to help kill it.
Ask them whether they believe Mississippi government is riddled with cronyism, nepotism or pay-to-play politics.

Then, finally, ask them whether they believe any of this might play a role in the historic and persistent government corruption that has often earned Mississippi the label of most corrupt state in the country.

Bannon IV,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/29/data-disease-and-disparity-connecticuts-public-health-emergency/,"When public health funding disappears, infectious disease surveillance weakens, vaccine coverage declines, mental health crises deepen, and health disparities expand.","Connecticut is facing a silent unraveling of its public health infrastructure.
In March, more than $155 million in federal public health aid was abruptly cut, destabilizing the foundation of care that thousands of Connecticut residents rely on directly, and an estimated 1.8 million benefit from indirectly through statewide immunization programs and disease surveillance efforts.
The loss includes $118.8 million for epidemiology and lab capacity, $29.2 million for immunization activities, and $4.5 million targeted toward addressing health disparities. These numbers represent vaccines that won’t be administered, outbreaks that may go untracked, and critical programs facing long-term disruption or permanent loss.
As someone involved in clinical research and public health advocacy, I’ve come to understand that health systems are only as strong as the infrastructure behind them—from frontline providers to behind-the-scenes public health programs. These funding losses are compounded by workforce disruptions. With the Centers for Disease Control eliminating entire grant oversight teams, Connecticut agencies report being unable to contact federal administrators, submit deliverables, or ensure compliance. 
Public health is not self-sustaining; it depends on coordinated systems. When those systems break down, programs stall. Public safety is compromised.
The ripple effects are already reaching vulnerable communities. The Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services (DMHAS) lost $6 million that supported harm reduction centers, maternal substance use screening, and overdose prevention. Connecticut’s opioid overdose death rate rose by over 50% between 2018 and 2023, according to the DPH Opioid Surveillance Dashboard. Pulling support from overdose reversal efforts, such as naloxone distribution, will only accelerate this trajectory.
Climate-driven public health risks are also becoming more urgent. The Office of Climate and Health had been developing localized strategies to mitigate extreme heat and worsening air quality—both of which disproportionately affect older adults, low-income communities, and individuals with cardiovascular conditions. Research from the EPA and NIH links prolonged exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and heatwaves with increased rates of heart attacks, strokes, and hospitalizations. These initiatives were supported by the CDC’s Building Resilience Against Climate Effects (BRACE) framework, a science-based strategy to help communities adapt to environmental threats. Those plans are now on hold, according to internal updates from the Connecticut BRACE program.  
Meanwhile, persistent health disparities continue to plague the state. A child born in northeast Hartford can expect to live 68.9 years on average. Just 50 miles away in Westport, life expectancy climbs to 89.1 years. These disparities are not the product of biology; they stem from unequal access to care, safe housing, clean air, and economic opportunity. These cuts risk deepening longstanding inequities and dismantling the very infrastructure designed to address them.
Workforce capacity has also been compromised. Connecticut has issued stop-work orders to 69 contractors and laid off over 50 long-term public health collaborators embedded in agencies like the Department of Public Health. These professionals provided vital services ranging from lab testing to emergency response coordination. Their expertise is not easily replaced.
But this isn’t just about federal decisions—it’s about how Connecticut chooses to respond. As of March 2025, the state’s budget reserve exceeded $4.1 billion and has recorded average annual surpluses of $1.8 billion over the past seven years. These circumstances demand serious consideration of a dedicated Health Infrastructure Stabilization Fund to protect the systems we rely on most. Strategic use of these reserves could provide a critical safeguard.
Programs with demonstrated success should be prioritized. Research from the Connecticut Health Foundation shows that every $1 invested in community-based public health programs returns $14 in reduced emergency visits, lower chronic disease costs, and improved workforce productivity.. Mobile harm reduction services, air quality monitoring, and neighborhood-based health equity partnerships all fit this evidence-based model.
The health of our state is a measurable, observable reality. Reductions in funding are historically associated with increased disease burden and preventable outcomes. When preventive systems disappear, we spend more on crisis care that could have been avoided. The data tells the story long before the headlines do. What matters now is whether we choose to act.
What can Connecticut citizens do? Start with advocacy. Contact state legislators and demand immediate action to replace lost federal funds and stabilize essential services. Support local public health efforts. Donate to health equity organizations. Amplify the science on social media and in your communities. This is not only a test of policy—but of principle. What we choose to fund today will shape the health of our communities tomorrow.
When public health funding disappears, infectious disease surveillance weakens, vaccine coverage declines, mental health crises deepen, and health disparities expand. The termination of these federal grants was abrupt —but our response doesn’t have to be. If Connecticut is serious about protecting its residents, especially those most at risk, then we must move beyond concern and act now.
Good governance requires listening to the data. The science is unambiguous. Economic modeling supports intervention. The ethical obligation is no less clear. Delay only deepens the damage.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-29 16:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Plan to heat state buildings with natural gas system riles advocates,John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/29/ct-state-buildings-natural-gas-heating/,The plan would upgrade a facility that supplies heating and cooling to an underground network of pipes connected to 15 buildings in Hartford.,"Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration plans to invest in a new gas heating system for state office buildings in downtown Hartford, but the decision has fueled backlash from state and local activists who say it will spew pollution into surrounding neighborhoods and undermine the governor’s own climate goals.
The administration’s plan would upgrade a facility that supplies heating and cooling to an underground network of pipes connected to 15 buildings in downtown Hartford known as the Capitol Area System.
The system — also called the “loop” — includes several government buildings including the Armory, the Supreme Court Building and the Legislative Office Building, as well as private ones like the Bushnell Theater. (The Capitol itself relies on a separate system to heat and cool the 146-year-old building.)
Hot air and water, as well as steam, is produced at the CAS plant several blocks west of the Capitol, which officials say is in desperate need of renovations — particularly after a 2021 explosion damaged the plant’s pump house and necessitated the installation of temporary boilers.
Environmental and climate activists seized upon the project, arguing that it offered the Lamont administration an opportunity to de-carbonize more than a dozen buildings at once through the installation of electric boilers or a geothermal heating and cooling system. 
But earlier this year the Department of Administrative Services announced that it was opting to move forward with a “hybrid” approach, utilizing both heat pumps and newer natural gas boilers to power the system. The upgrade is estimated to cost roughly $42 million and take several years to complete.
The decision infuriated advocates, who accused Lamont of breaking his pledge to reduce the use of fossil fuels to heat and cool state buildings.
“He’s going against his own word,” said Alycia Jenkins, a Sierra Club organizer from Hartford. “It falls in line with what we see happening across this country, people choosing fossil fuels, people choosing natural gas.”
Jenkins and other opponents of the state’s plans say they want a new study to examine the feasibility of turning the CAS into a geothermal system, which would harness ambient temperatures from deep underground that can provide heat in the winter and cooling during the summer.
Similar systems are being piloted nearby in Framingham, Mass., and — dependent on federal funding — at New Haven’s Union Station. 
Leigh Appleby, a spokesman for DAS, said the state has not entirely given up on potentially cleaner options for the future of the facility. In an email last week, he said that the next step in the process would be to hire an engineering consultant to study the hybrid approach, along with other “viable alternatives” that could reduce costs or carbon emissions.
“We recognize that the selected option of heat pumps and natural gas condensing boilers is not zero emissions, as many of the comments advocated,” Appleby said. “However, other factors, most notably the uncertainty surrounding the long-term location of the CAS facility due to the anticipated realignment of I-84, prevented the implementation of more costly and extensive zero-emission scenarios. During the design development process, we will seek additional opportunities to reduce emissions.” 
When asked about the project during an event commemorating Earth Day last week, Lamont said he was concerned about the cost of updating the facility along with the environmental impacts.
“We’re going to look at everything, and we’re also going to let the taxpayers know what the relative costs of everything are,” Lamont said. “I think affordability has got to be on the table right alongside what we’re celebrating here on Earth Day.”
According to a decarbonization study commissioned by DAS in 2023, the hybrid approach selected by the administration would produce about 197,668 fewer metric tons of carbon dioxide over the next three decades — the equivalent of driving nearly 50,000 cars for a year — compared to it’s current operations.
Still, the study found that utilizing a geothermal system or a combination of all-electric boilers and heat pumps could reduce emissions by an additional 80% or more.
The total cost to build the new system — including the $42 million in construction costs — and operate it for for the next three decades using the hybrid approach was roughly $164 million, according to the study. That was nearly half the cost of using all-electric boilers and about one-third less than the cost of geothermal.
Opponents, however, argue that the volatile price of natural gas as well as the future health care costs for people living in the vicinity of the plant could put the plant’s price tag much higher.
“The cost is not just the cost of rebuilding this plant, it’s maintaining this plant for 30 to 35 years, because that’s how long it’s going to be there, [releasing] all kinds of toxic pollutants into the air and creating all kinds of asthma and respiratory conditions,” said Cynthia Jennings, a former Hartford councilwoman who is involved with local efforts to oppose the state’s plans.
Jenkins, the Sierra Club organizer, pointed to data showing that Hartford has among the highest asthma rates of any city in the nation. While attending Trinity College, Jenkins said she lived in the Frog Hollow neighborhood abutting the CAS plant, and later developed bronchitis as an adult.
“We’re concerned about the air pollution, we’re concerned about asthma rates, and we’re also concerned about jobs,” Jenkins said.
The state’s study — conducted by Veolia, a French infrastructure management company — attempted to calculate the so-called “social” costs of carbon pollution, such as human health impacts, property damage from floods and storms, and changes in agricultural productivity. The study concluded that they did not outweigh the additional expenses of carbon-free options.
Asked for comment on the project this week, a spokesman for Hartford Mayor Arunan Arulampalam said it was a “state matter” and deferred further requests to the governor’s office. 
The CAS plant was originally constructed in 1988 as a cogeneration plant producing both electricity as well as steam that was used to heat and cool buildings connected to the loop. At the time, it was the second-largest source of air pollution in the city of Hartford, according to the Sierra Club. 
The previous owners of the plant, Capitol District Energy Center Cogeneration Associates Property Co., shuttered its gas-powered electric turbines in 2021, several months before the pump room explosion, and sold the facility to the state the next year for $7.3 million.
In the public notice of its decision to adopt the hybrid power plan, DAS said the decommissioning of the plant’s power-generation capabilities will reduced annual greenhouse gas emissions by more than two-thirds, and that it is no longer considered a major source of air pollution as defined by the federal Clean Air Act. The agency added that its review of the project determined it will not result in “significant environmental impacts,” and thus does not require a separate environmental impact study.
During a public comment period, officials at Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection submitted several recommendations regarding applicable environmental laws and regulations during construction, but the agency did not signal any overall objections to the project. A DEEP spokesman deferred to DAS for comment on the project. 
Appleby, the DAS spokesman, said work is expected to begin this summer to demolish and remove old, unused equipment from the site including wiring, generators, turbines, chilling equipment and a boiler. That work is intended to make space for the installation of new equipment.
Following the completion of the engineering study and design work, Appleby said construction will begin around December 2027 assuming funding for the project is in place. Work is expected to be completed sometime in 2029. 
Lamont’s budget proposal for the upcoming year called for an additional $16 million in capital expenses for the CAS project, bringing the total available funding through bonds to $35 million.

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderA Kennesaw State University faculty advisory panel wants to team up with other universities to fight what some call inappropriate political influence from the Trump administration and state leaders.
The university’s faculty Senate voted 30-7 Monday on a resolution to establish a mutual defense compact. Kennesaw students have expressed concerns over the university’s plans to shut down student resource centers that help members of minority groups, apparently as part of a national push against diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI.
The Trump administration has engaged in a public pressure campaign against elite college campuses over what the president views as left-wing indoctrination as well as student protests over Israel’s military campaign in Gaza. State lawmakers are also targeting DEI, including through a bill that would ban programs or activities that promote diversity, equity and inclusion at all grade levels. That bill stalled this year, but will still be active when next year’s session begins in January.
Matthew Boedy, president of the Georgia chapter of the American Association of University Professors, said the University System of Georgia is targeting programs associated with DEI.
“That includes any scholarship that is funded by any third party, and then also multicultural offices, and the decades-long African-American Male Initiative, which is a USG thing, every campus version of that is being shut down, and this is all supposed to happen by the end of the academic year or the end of the fiscal year, and they do say that faculty who may have been a part of that or working those things will be reassigned, but there’s no guarantee that staff would be reassigned. That has been the USG directive to all schools here in the last two weeks or so.”
According to the KSU faculty Senate’s resolution, faculty senates from institutions across the country have recommended joining such a compact, including Rutgers University, Indiana University, the University of Nebraska, Michigan State University, Yale and UMass Amhurst.
Member institutions would “commit meaningful support—financial, legal, organizational, and/or strategic—to a shared or distributed defense infrastructure designed to respond immediately and collectively to attacks by the governmental actors on any member institution,” according to the resolution.
The KSU faculty Senate is an advisory board to the university’s president, Kathy Schwaig, and would need her approval to actually join.
Boedy didn’t mince words on the likelihood of that happening.
“This is a symbolic move,” he said. “The faculty Senate is asking the university administration to participate in legal filings, amicus briefs, defending academic freedom, using state funds, their institutional funds, to do this. Whether or not these presidents will actually do this is not an open question – they’re not going to do this, at least in the USG. So I would say it’s a symbolic move, but it is also a very powerful, powerful symbolic move for the Senate to say, ‘You’re not doing this, and you need to do this.’”
Boedy said he expects other university faculties across the nation to take similar actions, though he’s not aware of any others in Georgia with concrete plans.
“To be honest with you, part of the debate was what are the consequences for signing on to this? Would there be political or state consequences for signing on to this?” he said. “That’s a real concern for many faculty, even though the vote at Kennesaw was overwhelming, that was a concern.”

The Ohio Supreme Court is keeping the ban on gender-affirming care for transgender youth as the case goes through litigation.
In March, the 10th District Court of Appeals partially blocked the state from enforcing House Bill 68, a ban on gender-affirming care for LGBTQ+ youth, allowing doctors to continue prescribing puberty blockers and hormone therapy.
Attorney General Dave Yost filed a motion with the high court to stay the law, or pause changes, until a full review by the justices. This was granted Tuesday.
H.B. 68 went into effect in 2024. The controversial legislation prevented LGBTQ+ minors from accessing care such as hormone blockers, hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and some mental health services.
“There is no way I’ll stop fighting to protect these unprotected children,” Yost said, in part, in a statement from the March ruling.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXThe law has been in court for months now, with the ACLU of Ohio arguing that it is unconstitutional and goes against parental rights and the right to bodily autonomy.
“It is a terrible shame that the Supreme Court of Ohio is permitting the state to evade compliance with the Ohio Constitution. Our clients have suffered tangible and irreparable harm during the eight months that H.B. 68 has been in place, including being denied essential health care in their home state,” Freda Levenson, ACLU legal director, said. “The Court of Appeals was correct that H.B. 68 violates at least two separate provisions of the Ohio Constitution. We will continue to fight this extreme ban as the case goes ahead before the Supreme Court of Ohio.”
The law also prohibits trans athletes from participating in middle, high school or college athletics on teams that align with their identity.
In July 2024, parents and doctors testified to prevent the state from enforcing the ban, citing that the ban would “deny basic human rights.”

“We have learned that all of the impacted students at UConn have now had their SEVIS (Student and Exchange Visitor Program) records restored by the federal government, meaning absent some other unexpected change, they should be able to resume their studies and work at UConn uninterrupted,” UConn officials said in a statement.
This comes after the federal government announced Friday it would move to restore the statuses of many international students who previously had their records eliminated in recent weeks.
But the update doesn’t mean the federal government will abandon attempts at revoking visas, according to a Georgia attorney representing four Connecticut students who are a part of a nationwide lawsuit in a federal district court in Georgia.
Their attorney, Charles Kuck, previously obtained a temporary restraining order against the government to restore his clients’ statuses before the government made their announcement last Friday. But Kuck emphasized the government is simply buying time to resume their efforts.
“What ICE said was that they were temporarily restoring, as of that date, the SEVIS access, leaving students with a large gap of unlawful status,” Kuck said. “And they also indicated they were drafting new rules so they could reinstate the revocation.”
Tricia McLaughlin, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary, did not reveal how many foreign students in Connecticut are affected by the federal government’s abrupt reversal on Friday. All the federal government did, she said, was to restore the records for certain foreign students.
“What we did is restore SEVIS access for people who had not had their visa revoked,” McLaughlin said.
UConn spokesperson Stephanie Reitz said in a statement the restoration of those records is distinct from restoring a previously revoked student visa.
“When a person’s SEVIS record is deleted, they are unable to prove their visa status for purposes of travel, work, etc., even if the visa has not been revoked,” Reitz said.
Kuck said he will file a class action lawsuit in response to what he said is an anticipated move by the federal government to impose harsher rules for foreign students.
According to Reitz, none of the students at UConn had their visas revoked by the federal government, although according to her, 300 international students nationwide, have. McLaughlin said the federal government has not reversed their decision on a single visa revocation.
Kuck said he is also awaiting a decision in Georgia on whether his clients can have their statuses restored for the duration of the lawsuit. A decision is expected this week.

DemasA federal judge in Detroit has ended litigation against one of the companies that consulted with the city of Flint when lead contamination led to a drinking water crisis 10 years ago. 
U.S. District Judge Judith Levy entered the final judgment Monday for the $53 million settlement reached in February in a lawsuit brought by the state of Michigan and approximately 26,000 individuals claiming Veolia North America, or VNA, contributed to the Flint Water Crisis by failing to properly identify corrosion control treatment issues.
It was alleged that the Boston-based company did not do enough to get Flint to treat its water so that it would be less corrosive inside the city’s lead pipes. That followed the 2014 switch from Lake Huron to the Flint River as the city’s water source, a decision made by emergency managers appointed by then-Gov. Rick Snyder as a cost-saving move. 
VNA claimed it had only been hired to do a one-week assessment on carcinogens, not specifically lead content, and that it has made recommendations to the city about corrosion control.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The $53 million agreed to in the settlement will be distributed among the plaintiffs who were directly impacted by the lead-tainted water, including a significant number of children.  
With the settlement, the state will also dismiss a separate lawsuit against VNA.
The company, in a statement, said the settlement was not an admission of guilt and argued that public officials were to blame for the crisis.
“VNA stands behind its good work in Flint. The only jury who had to consider the facts and hear the truth did not find any evidence to say otherwise” referencing a nearly six-month long trial in 2022, which ended in a mistrial.
“As the facts of the 2022 trial clearly demonstrate, the Flint water crisis was caused by government officials. It is a disgrace that nearly a decade plus since the crisis was set in motion, still no person who was actually responsible has been held accountable,” said VNA’s release. 
Snyder, a Republican who left office in 2019, and eight other high-level officials, were charged in January 2021 in connection with the water crisis.  However, the Michigan Supreme Court ruled in 2022 that a judge lacked the authority to issue the indictments, and all of the charges were later dismissed.  
However, the crisis did result in the largest civil settlement in Michigan history. 
Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel announced in March 2023 a settlement totaling about $626.25 million had been formally approved, with the state ordered to pay $600 million, the city of Flint $20 million, the McLaren Regional Medical Center $5 million and $1.25 million from Rowe Professional Services.
Nessel said the settlement with VNA had finally closed out a chapter for Flint residents. 
“While no amount of money can fully repair the damage caused to the Flint community, these funds will provide additional resources to those directly impacted, especially Flint children, by this preventable crisis,” Nessel said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/DSC08883-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-29 13:19:37.712180

Ball said a Finance and Administration Cabinet official sent similar open records requests after her office announced investigations into the Cabinet for Health and Family Services in recent months. 
“It is a shame that parties would seek to weaponize the Open Records Act, an important transparency tool, as a political weapon,” Ball said. “Because I believe in the importance of transparency, I have responded to the KDP’s requests in full, just as I did to the Finance Cabinet requests.  
“Kentucky should rest assured that these intimidation tactics will not work. I will continue to carry out the job that Kentuckians elected me to do.”
Under the Kentucky Open Records Act, members of the public may request records from public agencies within the state. 
Kentucky Democratic Party spokesperson Nat Turner said in a statement to the Kentucky Lantern that Ball “is trying to manufacture partisan drama, and what she is alleging is not true.” 
“The requests in question were not related to her audit; they were for records related to grievances, personal appeals, travel records and her use of taxpayer money to attend a religious leadership conference,” Turner said. “Transparency is important and Auditor Ball has a responsibility to be accountable to Kentuckians.”
Joy Markland, a spokesperson for Ball, shared copies of the requests made by the Democrats and responses of the auditor’s office. The records match the requests Turner described. In a search for the records, the auditor’s office found no records of grievances from staff members filed this year and provided records related to travel, personal appeals and contracts entered by the office. 
Amye Bensenhaver, a retired Kentucky assistant attorney general and co-founder and co-director of the Kentucky Open Government Coalition, said “all is fair in love and open records.” The state law is “intended to be almost blind to who is asking and why they’re asking,” with some limitations on requests made for commercial reasons, she added. 
Ball’s accusation against the state Democratic party is also “weaponizing the law,” Bensenhaver said. 
“Ultimately, you could be a thin-skinned public official who shows resistance or expresses outrage when your office is expected to produce records, but it tends to undermine your credibility when you’re seeking records from another public agency,” Bensenhaver said. 
Some political staffers look for information to use in campaign messaging through open record requests. Ahead of the 2023 governor’s race, the office of then Republican Attorney General Daniel Cameron ruled Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s administration violated the Kentucky Open Records Act when denying part of a request from the Republican Party of Kentucky. Cameron later became the Republican nominee and was defeated by Beshear that fall.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/fancyfarmfull_08-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-29 13:19:37.712180

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)The federal government has restored the student record of a doctoral candidate from India at South Dakota Mines in Rapid City, but the fight over her student visa continues. 
The record restoration from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement means Priya Saxena could collect her degree at graduation on May 10.
But the revocation of her student visa means she could still be subject to deportation before her visa was originally scheduled to expire in February 2027. If deported, she would also lose the opportunity to apply for an extension to remain in the country after graduation and do work related to her degree.
The news of her record restoration came by way of a motion filed by ICE attorneys in Saxena’s federal lawsuit against ICE and the federal Homeland Security secretary, former South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem. 
A dozen international students report visa cancellations in South Dakota

A little more than a week ago, U.S. District Judge Karen Schreier ordered the agency to restore Saxena’s student record.
The U.S. State Department issues and manages visas, but Immigration and Customs Enforcement maintains the student record system used by schools across the country to verify and manage international student eligibility. 
ICE terminated more than 1,000 international student records in that system in recent weeks, but reversed course over the weekend. The decision impacted cases across the country similar to Saxena’s.
In South Dakota, a dozen international student visas were impacted by the recent moves. Saxena’s name is the only one that’s appeared in the public sphere, thanks to her lawsuit.
The visa revocation for Saxena came after a “criminal records check,” according to documents filed in her lawsuit. Her only criminal conviction came in 2021, for the misdemeanor of failure to move over for flashing yellow lights.
In its filing Monday night in her case, ICE called Judge Schreier’s order to restore Saxena’s student record “moot,” because the agency had moved to restore terminated international student records across the U.S.
Saxena has asked for a preliminary injunction that would prevent deportation until the lawsuit is resolved. The federal government says a preliminary injunction is a bridge too far, arguing that district court judges don’t have the authority to interfere with visa status determinations. 
A hearing in the matter is set for May 13.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-29 15:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Trump orders list of ‘sanctuary cities’ to target for funding freeze,Ariana Figueroa | States Newsroom,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/29/trump-sanctuary-cities-funding-freeze/,Trump's executive orders threaten to revoke federal funding from cities that do not coordinate with federal immigration authorities.,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump on Monday evening signed executive orders targeting so-called sanctuary cities by threatening to revoke federal funding and providing legal services and national security assets to law enforcement.
The signings fell on the eve of Trump’s first 100 days of his second term, during which his administration has enacted an immigration crackdown that has led to clashes with the judiciary branch and cities that do not coordinate with federal immigration authorities, often referred to as “sanctuary cities.”
“Some State and local officials nevertheless continue to use their authority to violate, obstruct, and defy the enforcement of Federal immigration laws,” according to the executive order regarding sanctuary cities. “This is a lawless insurrection against the supremacy of Federal law and the Federal Government’s obligation to defend the territorial sovereignty of the United States.”
The order directs the Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security to publicly list local jurisdictions that limit cooperation with immigration officials, but do not stop immigration enforcement.
Jurisdictions on the list will then be reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget to “identify appropriate Federal funds to sanctuary jurisdictions, including grants and contracts, for suspension or termination, as appropriate.”
This is not the first time the Trump administration has targeted jurisdictions that don’t fully cooperate with federal immigration enforcement. 
The Justice Department recently filed a lawsuit against the city of Rochester, New York, over its immigration policies after local law enforcement did not assist federal immigration officials in an arrest. The Trump administration argued those ordinances in Rochester were impeding federal immigration enforcement.
The president also signed an executive order in January that threatened to withhold federal funding from states and local governments that refused to aid in federal immigration enforcement activities. A federal judge in San Francisco last week blocked the Trump administration from withholding federal funds from 16 so-called sanctuary cities.
Republicans have also scrutinized those policies, including during a six-hour hearing of the U.S. House Oversight and Government Reform Committee that included grilling mayors from Boston, Chicago and Denver, on their cities’ immigration policies. 
The executive order also aims to curb any federal benefits that may extend to people without permanent legal status.
That executive order directed DOJ and DHS to “take appropriate action to stop the enforcement of State and local laws” that allow for students without proper legal authorization to receive in-state tuition, which would include those with Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA.
Last week, administration officials cheered the FBI arrest of a Wisconsin judge who they say helped an immigrant in the country without legal authorization escape detention by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
The arrest followed the third appearance by ICE officers seeking to make arrests at the Milwaukee County Courthouse, a practice some experts believe hinders local law enforcement.
Law enforcement resources
A second executive order Trump signed Monday provides legal resources for law enforcement officials “who unjustly incur expenses and liabilities for actions taken during the performance of their official duties to enforce the law.”
The order also directs coordination among the departments of Justice, Defense and Homeland Security to “increase the provision of excess military and national security assets in local jurisdictions to assist State and local law enforcement.” 
Earlier Monday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the executive order relating to law enforcement will “strengthen and unleash America’s law enforcement to pursue criminals and protect innocent citizens.”

(Photo by Mathieu Lewis-Rolland/Getty Images)ISSAQUAH, Wash. — In the wake of recent natural disasters, state leaders across the country are finding that emergency support from the federal government is no longer a given.
Under President Donald Trump, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has denied federal assistance for tornadoes in Arkansas, flooding in West Virginia and a windstorm in Washington state. It also has refused North Carolina’s request for extended relief funding in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.
While it’s not uncommon for the feds to turn down some requests for disaster declarations, which unlock federal aid, state leaders say the Trump administration’s denials have taken them by surprise. White House officials are signaling a new approach to federal emergency response, even as Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem threaten to shut down FEMA altogether.
“The Federal Government focuses its support on truly catastrophic disasters—massive hurricanes, devastating earthquakes, or wide-scale attacks on the homeland,” Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the National Security Council, which advises the president on issues of national security, said in a statement to Stateline.
Hughes said state and local governments “often remain an impediment to their own community’s resilience.” He called on states to take on a more extensive role.
“States must have adequate emergency management staff, adoption and enforcement of modern building codes, responsible planning and strategic investment to reduce future risk, commonsense policies that prioritize preparedness over politics, disaster reserve funds to handle what should be routine emergencies, pre-negotiated mutual aid and contingency contracts that speed up recovery, and above all, an appetite to own the problem,” the statement said.
State emergency management leaders say the federal retreat from disaster response has upended a long-established system.
“This is very unusual,” said Karina Shagren, communications director with the Washington Military Department, which oversees the state’s emergency management division. “This is the first time in recent memory that we have hit all the indicators to get FEMA’s public assistance program and we’ve been denied.”
Michael Coen, who served as chief of staff at FEMA during the Obama and Biden administrations, said the president has “broad discretion” to approve or deny disaster requests, regardless of whether they meet specified conditions. If Trump intends to curtail federal support, Coen said, he should give states clear guidelines.
“They should have a dialogue with the states, so the states aren’t spinning their wheels making requests that are going to get denied,” Coen said.
He added that states need guidance if they’re expected to build emergency management programs to take on what the feds once handled. Not all states, Coen said, have the capacity to replicate those functions. And disasters are expected to increase in frequency and severity because of climate change.
“Having that capability in every single state instead of having one FEMA is not the best use of tax dollars to prepare for the worst day,” he said.
Historically, FEMA has coordinated the federal response during emergency situations. In the National Security Council statement, Hughes said Trump has promptly authorized “life-saving emergency support to states during and in the immediate aftermath of disasters.”
But the agency’s larger role has focused on recovery after disasters, assessing damage and distributing funding to help communities rebuild. Now, some communities are finding that support is no longer a sure thing.
Issaquah, Washington, was among the cities hit hard by the “bomb cyclone” that ripped through the state last November. Severe winds killed two people in the state, knocked out power for hundreds of thousands of residents and caused millions in damage, state officials said.
A city of about 40,000 residents in the Cascade foothills, Issaquah’s costs from the storm totaled $3.8 million — covering road repairs, removal of 800 tons of tree debris and overtime pay for first responders. Mayor Mary Lou Pauly said the city has seen four events since 2020 that qualified for federal disaster aid, with no previous denials. If Washington is unable to win its appeal with FEMA, she said, Issaquah will take a financial hit to its reserves, leaving it more vulnerable to future storms.
“We put a lot of investment in being resilient,” Pauly said. “When you get to a number like $3.8 million, that is too big of a number for us to be able to rebuild without assistance. Our residents pay federal taxes, and this is what they think they pay them for, this is what they expect their national government to do. They do not want me to set property taxes 100% higher.”
Pauly echoed Coen’s view that FEMA should give states a clear outline of the role it will play.
“What we all want to know is what are the rules of the game?” she said. “If the criteria has changed, then why aren’t we getting told about it?”
Washington state leaders said they were shocked when FEMA denied their request for $34 million to help repair roads, utilities and power systems. Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson said the state’s application met all of the “very clear criteria to qualify.” He has vowed to appeal the decision.
“We were really relying on that funding,” said Shagren, of the Washington Military Department. “If the appeal is denied, our local jurisdictions will have to prioritize which projects they can move forward with and which they don’t. They’re going to be impacted greatly. This wasn’t some small storm.”
Other states also have been surprised by FEMA denials. Arkansas suffered 14 tornadoes last month, triggering a request for a disaster declaration from Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders. But the feds told state leaders to handle it on their own.
“[I]t has been determined that the damage from this event was not of such severity and magnitude as to be beyond the capabilities of the state, affected local governments, and voluntary agencies,” the federal government’s denial read, according to Arkansas Times.
Sanders has appealed that decision, saying the disaster caused “widespread destruction” that requires federal help.
In West Virginia, state leaders asked for disaster aid to cover 14 counties that were struck by flooding in February. But FEMA denied individual assistance to seven of those counties. Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey said in a statement that he is looking at options to appeal, but praised the Trump administration for its “strong support” following the floods.
Democratic leaders in the state have called on Morrisey to demand more help from the feds, WOWK reported.
Meanwhile, FEMA has said it will no longer match 100% of North Carolina’s spending to recover from September’s Hurricane Helene. Democratic Gov. Josh Stein said the cost share was crucial to the state’s efforts to rebuild.
“The need in western North Carolina remains immense — people need debris removed, homes rebuilt, and roads restored,” Stein said in a statement this month, according to NC Newsline. “I am extremely disappointed and urge the President to reconsider FEMA’s bad decision, even for 90 days.”

“These cuts represent some of the best options of bad options,” said Kyle Murray, the Massachusetts program director at the Acadia Center about the new compliance plan for Mass Save, which reduces the budget for heat pump incentives and program to help residents use one vendor for energy efficiency upgrades. 
The post Utility companies target heat pump ince[...]","After state officials reduced Mass Save’s proposed budget by $500 million in February, the utility companies that run the energy efficiency program have proposed a new pared down compliance plan with the largest cuts coming to incentives for heat pumps and a program that provides a one-stop shop for residents looking to weatherize and invest in electrification upgrades.  Six utility companies, including Eversource and National Grid, run the Mass Save program with the guidance of the Energy Efficiency Advisory Council. The utility companies presented their compliance plan with cuts on Monday to the council.  The new plan cuts $220 million from heat pump rebates and a loan program that offers zero percent financing for qualifying energy-efficiency upgrades that include heat pump projects for residents. The plan also cuts $207 million from a “residential turnkey” program which is a streamlined solution that coordinates weatherization, barrier mitigation, and electrification upgrade projects through a single vendor that manages all steps of the process.  There are also smaller cuts of $43 million to the sales, technical assistance, and training budget, $12 million to the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center for economic development for green jobs, and $2 million to a program offering that translates program materials into different languages. Generally, the cuts come from programs targeted towards residents in market-rate housing and to a lesser degree moderate income housing. The Department of Public Utilities directed the utility companies not to cut funding from programs targeted towards lower-income residents.   “It has been a trying and challenging time going back and fundamentally revisiting a lot of what we planned over the last year and a half,” said Brian Greenfield, a supervisor of energy efficiency regulatory and planning at Eversource, who presented the plan to the council. “Faced with this order and dissecting what was in the plan and where we could make adjustments to comply with the required $500 million reduction to the residential budgets, the [utility companies] prioritized maintaining our program design and we are eager to get into and focus on implementing these plans over the course of the term.” The council voted to support the compliance plan. The utility companies will submit the revised compliance filing to the DPU for approval by April 30. Mass Save estimates it has provided $31 billion in total energy cost savings since it launched in 2013. The initial proposed budget projected that the program would save another $13.7 billion between 2025 and 2027. According to Greenfield, the cuts to the program will result in an 11 percent decrease in the total benefits in the next three years, bringing the total benefits down to $12.2 billion. “These cuts represent some of the best options of bad options,” said Kyle Murray, a member of the council and the Massachusetts program director at the Acadia Center, a non-profit research and advocacy organization dedicated to combating climate change.  The Mass Save program – which helps homes and businesses become more energy efficient and reduces greenhouse gas emissions – is funded through a surcharge on electricity and gas bills. After gas bills spiked across the state due to an unusually cold winter and the increase in the Mass Save surcharge, the DPU decreased the budget for the program from the proposed $5 million to $4.5 million. The DPU directed that the cut come from programming for the residential sector.  Environmentalist advocates including Murray called the move “short-sighted,” saying that the cut will result in increased costs for residents in the long run.  The energy efficiency program is key to the state’s decarbonization efforts. Massachusetts aims to convert 500,000 households to heat pumps by 2030, but even that target – which was set before Mass Save saw its budget pared back – would fall short of what the state needs to do to meet its climate goals of being carbon neutral by 2050.  The post Utility companies target heat pump incentives for cuts to pare back Mass Save budget appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Worcester_Housing_Triple_Three_Decker_Homes.png?fit=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-29 11:05:03.578804

The post M[...]","PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP raked in nearly $4.1 million for his 2025 inauguration from donors and businesses with Massachusetts addresses, just under two percent of the total $239 million raised for the parties tied to his swearing-in for a second term in January. Trump’s inaugural committee reported the names and figures earlier this month in a filing with the Federal Election Commission (FEC), which showed the president beating the previous record he set: $107 million for his first inauguration. Presidential inaugurations feature the oath of office as well as official and unofficial balls or galas in Washington, D.C., offering a way for companies and individuals to ingratiate themselves with a new administration. Large corporations made appearances on the list, including e-commerce giant Amazon and Facebook owner Meta, which each gave $1 million. The largest donation, coming in at $5 million, was from Pilgrim’s Pride, a poultry producer based in Colorado. Cryptocurrency interests also donated, with Ripple Labs donating $4.9 million. The 21 Massachusetts donors and businesses, with donations totaling roughly $4.1 million, fell below their counterparts in other states, such as Pennsylvania ($8.6 million) and Michigan ($6.4 million). Both were swing states in 2024, while Massachusetts has remained a Democratic stronghold, with Ronald Reagan the last Republican to win the Bay State in 1984. CommonWealth Beacon reviewed the Trump inauguration fundraising committee’s filing with the Federal Election Commission, which included donors and companies listing Massachusetts addresses. One of the largest donors in the state was a company tied to billionaire and car dealership magnate Ernie Boch Jr. The company, which is called Boston Port Service and shares an address with his nonprofit charity Music Drives Us, donated $1 million. Boch, who previously hosted a fundraiser for Trump in 2015, was unreachable for comment. DraftKings, the Boston-based gambling company with a focus on sports betting, gave $502,000, while FanDuel, its New York-based rival, gave $482,000. Another $500,000 came from GE Vernova, a Cambridge-based energy technology company working in the renewable power sector. The company, whose wind power division is grappling with a White House that has sought to put a stop to new wind turbine projects, spun off from the conglomerate General Electric in 2024. (CommonWealth Beacon reached out to DraftKings and GE Vernova for comment but did not hear back.) Jessica Beeson Tocco, the CEO of A10 Associates, which bills itself as the country’s “largest woman-owned bipartisan lobbying firm,” personally donated $101,652 to the Trump inauguration committee and then an additional $50,000 through her Malden-based company. (The company also hosted a cocktail reception at the Waldorf Astoria the weekend before the inauguration, according to Politico.) One of her clients, Quantum Computing Inc. CEO William McGann, also donated $101,652. He is retiring from the technology company in May and is listed as having an East Falmouth address on the FEC’s records.  Reached for comment, Tocco stressed that her firm’s donations go to top elected officials in both parties, with contributions flowing to prominent Massachusetts Democrats like US Sen. Ed Markey, Gov. Maura Healey, and Congresswoman Lori Trahan. A potential Healey rival for the corner office in the State House, Michael Minogue, donated $250,000 to the Trump inauguration committee. Minogue, who now has his own consulting firm after serving as president and CEO of medical technology company Abiomed, has previously donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Republican National Committee and the state GOP. He also gave several thousand dollars to former Gov. Charlie Baker and Josh Kraft, who is looking to unseat Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, according to publicly available campaign finance records. Others gave smaller amounts. Sriprakash Kothari, an accounting professor at MIT and a Lexington resident who regularly donates to the state GOP, gave $2,500 to the Trump inauguration committee. Kothari, who worked as the chief economist for the US Securities and Exchange Commission during the first Trump administration, declined to comment about the donation. Some of the donors, like the company tied to Boch, had to be tracked through corporate documents on file with the Massachusetts secretary of state’s office. For example, Randolph-based GGBF Inc. donated $50,000 to the Trump inauguration committee, according to the FEC filing. Documents on file with the state show the company shares the same address and same president as NEI General Contracting, Josef Rettman. Rettman has mostly donated to Democrats at the state and local level, and a mix at the federal level, including US Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Trump White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt’s 2022 congressional campaign in New Hampshire. The list of donors to the inauguration committee did not include the names of some major donors who had previously contributed to the first Trump presidential campaign or the first inauguration in 2017. Jim Davis, the chairman of shoemaker New Balance, donated nearly $400,000 to support Trump’s 2016 campaign. The Kraft Group, tied to New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, didn’t donate to the 2025 inauguration after donating $1 million for the 2017 inauguration. Ahead of the 2024 election, Kraft distanced himself from Trump, saying he was “very upset” by the insurrection attempt to keep Trump in office on January 6, 2021.

State lawmakers across the country are joining forces to pursue legislation for basic income programs to help reduce poverty. (John Moore/Getty Images)To California Democratic state Sen. David Cortese, the idea of gaining Republican support for a bill to provide cash to certain residents would have seemed impossible just a few years ago.
But his proposed legislation to offer $1,000 per month to homeless youth has so far received bipartisan support in the state Senate.
“It’s being embraced,” said Cortese. “This was not even considered possible five years ago.”
Cortese is among more than 20 Democratic lawmakers from 17 states launching Legislators for a Guaranteed Income on Tuesday to advocate for programs that provide direct, regular cash payments to lower-income residents to help alleviate poverty. They join a network of more than 245 mayors and county officials who have pursued dozens of basic income pilot projects across the country.
The lawmakers want to see states play a larger role in guaranteed income programs, which aim to help residents in need by handing out no-strings-attached cash.
Red states fight growing efforts to give ‘basic income’ cash to residents

The concept of basic income programs took off following a 2019 experiment in Stockton, California. There, 125 individuals received $500 per month for two years, which researchers found improved their financial stability and health.
Michael Tubbs, the former Democratic mayor of Stockton and current executive chairman of Mayors for a Guaranteed Income, said these kinds of efforts are more important now as economic uncertainty and high prices squeeze the most vulnerable people.
“The work around guaranteed income is moving from cities and counties to states,” he said. “We’re going to be organizing state officials across the country who see what we all see: that affordability is an issue, that the Trump tariffs and gross mismanagement of the economy has made the problem even worse.”
While the concept has gained traction across the country, Republican state lawmakers have pushed bills to ban basic income programs, arguing they disincentivize work.
Last year, then-state Sen. John Wiik sponsored successful legislation banning South Dakota localities from launching basic income programs. At the time, the Republican said he was worried about people growing dependent upon the government.
“So, if you get people addicted to just getting a check from the government, it’s going to be really hard to take that away,” he told Stateline.
Legislators for a Guaranteed Income says its 23 members have so far introduced 25 bills across 11 states.










The work around guaranteed income is moving from cities and counties to states.

Those include Cortese’s proposed legislation in California to create a new program to help homeless youth transition out of high school.
Eligible students would receive four monthly payments of $1,000 each beginning in May. That bill, expected to cost $40 million to $50 million, has passed through two state Senate committees.
Cortese previously advocated for a 2023 California program that was the nation’s first state-funded pilot of a basic income program targeting former foster youth. He pointed to research showing basic income programs supplement, rather than replace, the need for work. And he said growing these programs can eventually reduce costs for other social safety net programs.
“I’m so pleased to see the proliferation that we’ve seen so far,” he said. “I think that it will become ubiquitous as a way of doing things and that’s going to outlast me and my career.”
Child tax credits, long a liberal priority, find favor in Republican states

In Pennsylvania, Democratic state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta said he’s still exploring details on legislation for a basic income program there.
He said pilot projects across the country have proven that people pay rent, buy groceries and invest in small businesses when they have more financial freedom.
“So, this isn’t really some big experiment,” he said. “It is a proven way to reduce poverty, improve health care, boost our local economies and really get a real return on that investment.”
Kenyatta said so-called trickle-down policies that aim to boost business interests and high earners have failed many ordinary people.
“But basic income really flips that equation on its head,” he said. “It’s not about charity. It’s about power, and about giving people the power and the resources to breathe.”

(Cade Rothenberger for Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Fear that federal funding cuts will mean loved ones won’t receive nutritional food and safety checks through Meals on Wheels is driving an increase of calls to agencies across Kansas.
“It’s scary,” said Laurel Alkire, executive director of Senior Services Inc. of Wichita. “I’ve had a lot of families call me about their mom or dad. We’re trying to not overreact, but it’s very concerning.”
The fear is generated by potential federal funding cuts from multiple sources that could affect Meals on Wheels budgets nationwide, said Josh Protas, an advocate at the organization’s national office, Meals on Wheels America. 
“I think there’s a lot of confusion and a lot of anxiety that we’re hearing from across our network that is in response to multiple threats that are happening all at once,” he said.
Programs facing federal cuts include those funded by Health and Human Services, which has faced “massive” cuts of budget and personnel, Protas said. A leaked budget document signaled intentions to cut and split apart some programs that serve older adults. 
Also of concern is the ongoing budget reconciliation process, which among other things may include elimination of social services block grants and cuts to the Older Americans Act, he said. 
“Social Services Block Grants are a critical source of funding for many Meals on Wheels programs to help fill in the gaps where there are shortfalls in other funding sources,” Protas said. 
Proposed cuts to Medicaid also could harm Meals on Wheels budgets because those funds sometimes offer reimbursements, he said. 
Isys Schmitt, director of nutrition at the Northwest Kansas Area Agency on Aging, said her agency serves 18 counties at 28 sites in northwest Kansas. 
“I do hear the concerns from participants,” she said. “I think it’s more they hear these things on the news, and they automatically think it’s going to affect our program very badly.”
Her agency receives about 25% of its funding from federal sources, 25% from the state, and the rest in contributions, Schmitt said. 
Protas said Meals on Wheels programs are all funded through different mechanisms, so it’s difficult to tell how cuts might affect each program. Some get almost no federal funding, while others may receive 80% of funds from federal sources.
 
 Staying calm, planning ahead

Julie Govert Walter, executive director of the North Central-Flint Hills Area Agency on Aging Inc., is assessing potential cuts and trying to plan for how her agency might be affected, including the Meals on Wheels program it runs. 
“We’re right now telling people don’t panic,” she said. “We don’t want our elder Kansans to stress out over the uncertainty. At the same time, we want lawmakers in Washington to understand that the Older Americans Act programs are making significant differences in the lives of older Kansans and their caregivers and their families.”
About half of Walter’s agency budget is derived from the Older Americans Act, with about 34% of the allocation and related in-kind match donations supporting the meals program in 18 northeast Kansas counties.
Alkire said that Wichita’s Senior Services has other programs besides Meals on Wheels, including a senior employment program and four senior centers for active seniors 55 and older. 
“Meals on Wheels is our bread and butter,” she said. “We’ve got some reserves, but that wouldn’t last long.”
Walter said she believes the programs her organization runs are aligned with Trump administration policies because they’re frugal, cost-conscious and have significant volunteer support. In addition, Meals on Wheels helps seniors live independently, which often keeps them out of more costly nursing home facilities. 
Protas said the national organization is walking the line of not scaring seniors about funding cuts but making sure people are reaching out to make their voices heard.
“Many of these things that we’re worried about, there haven’t been final decisions made yet,” he said. “So we’re using this time to advocate and to just tell the story about Meals on Wheels. We’re advising our Meals on Wheels member programs to do some contingency planning so that in the event that there are delays or disruptions in funding, they’re not caught off guard. We’re not doing that in a way that instills panic, but we recognize that the threats are serious.”
 
 No budget numbers

Walter said planning right now is tough because of political uncertainties, but even more so because she doesn’t have information from the feds that she needs. Usually by this time of year, she knows what her budget is for the upcoming year. She doesn’t have those numbers yet to plan for fiscal year 2026, which will start in October. 
In mid-March, Congress funded the Older Americans Act and other programs through September 2025 with a continuing resolution. But no one knows what will happen next, Walter said. When she considers potential cuts of up to 30% of her agency’s funding, she’s not sure how to think about what actions to take. 
Options could include cutting the number of days they serve meals from five to two or three, but that would involve potential workforce cuts, she said. 
“It’s a puzzle,” she said. “We’re doing what we can to communicate with members of Congress about our situation, and I will say I think most members of the Kansas congressional delegation understand the importance of the OAA.”
 
 Little understanding of aging

Walter said one of the biggest challenges is communicating with people about the importance of Meals on Wheels and other programs for aging Kansans. 
“We all know what it’s like to be a kid, to be an adolescent, to be a young adult, and to be in middle age,” she said. “But honestly, most people don’t get what it’s like to really deal with challenges and the anxieties of being older, 75 and 80 plus, until we’re there. It’s so dependent on health and community and social relationships.”
“The stress and uncertainty is real, and it has real effects on people’s minds and hearts and spirits,” Walter said. “It’s hard to quantify, but you know it’s real. Drama is not good for older people.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/4-28-25-Meals-on-Wheels-Hays-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-29 10:03:43.297250

Missouri’s Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Task Force is comprised of state senators and representatives, and the task force chose professor Rachel Winograd to represent its recommendations before the House Health and Mental Health Committee.
Winograd researches addiction science and works to develop solutions to substance abuse at the University of Missouri-St. Louis.
Changes to the state’s drug supply inspired the task force’s recommendations. Winograd said even though opioid deaths are decreasing and deaths from stimulants have plateaued, new street drugs like Xylazine (a veterinary sedative commonly known as “tranq”) complicate efforts to combat substance abuse.
“Across my last two years of sitting with the substance abuse task force, I reviewed our recommendations, which were plentiful,” Winograd said. “I did my best to cluster them in five key domains.”
 Funding

Winograd said funding for substance abuse prevention needs to increase or at least stay at its current level.
Medicaid, she said, has been crucial in caring for people with addictions without tapping into state funds.
Most state funding for substance abuse treatment comes from sales tax on cannabis and tobacco, as well as settlement funds received from tobacco companies that compensate for smoking-related medical costs.
Rep. Becky Laubinger, R-Park Hills, pointed out how the state has some of the lowest tobacco sales taxes in the nation. The tax rate per one pack of cigarettes in Missouri is 17 cents.
The task force found that the biggest gaps in funding are basic needs like recovery housing.
 Transportation and housing

“I’ve been really humbled,” Winograd said, “by how little it matters if you provide really effective evidence-based treatment service if no one can get there.”
She described transportation as an issue of “equifinality,” or how different experiences can lead to similar outcomes. In rural areas, she said, treatment centers might be too far away. In urban areas, public transportation and infrastructure might be subpar.
Some current solutions to the issue are state-provided bus passes and funds for ride-booking services from care providers, but Winograd said she doubts these solutions are the most efficient way.
Housing is another basic need that effects how those struggling with substances get the help they need.
“What good is fabulous, gold-standard care if then I go back to living on the streets,” Winograd said. “The way we work as humans operating in society is that my first priority is going to be finding housing. Then I’ll deal with my sobriety.”
She recommended flexible strategies as a solution, such as outpatient treatment combined with sober living and recovery housing.
 Crisis care

Overdose response makes up a large part of crisis care for substance abuse. Winograd praised the state’s push for behavioral health crisis centers, which she compared to urgent care facilities. However, she also recommended that those centers be required to provide medical treatment for people struggling with opioid addiction.
Another task force proposal was ambulance transport to non-hospital settings, such as behavioral health centers.
“Especially after an opioid overdose or a stimulant overamping event, often the hospital is not necessarily the best place for somebody to go,” Winograd said. “They don’t get the right care, it’s not what they want, it’s not what they need. They kind of get spun and churned back out to the streets.”
Behavioral health care centers can provide more comfortable or personalized care for such cases, she said.
The task force also recommended helping people navigate recovery programs, legalizing needle exchanges and expanding drug-checking services.
 Legal programs

Overdoses are a “huge killer” of people who have been formerly incarcerated, Winograd said.
She recommended drug courts and diversion programs in communities to help in lowering incarceration rates. She also suggested increasing resources to treat people with addictions while they are incarcerated.
The task force also recommended judicial treatment courts, which offer care as an alternative to incarceration. Winograd said the task force wants to make sure use of life-saving tools isn’t discouraged.
“There’s a real culture in specific drug courts of success and motivation,” Winograd said. “I’m looking forward to learning more about drug courts and also making sure they are as evidence-based and effective as possible, specifically ensuring that they not only allow, but encourage and support people to stay on medications for addiction treatment.”
Other legal recommendations from the task force include evidence-based treatment for the incarcerated, expanding naloxone distribution and increased funding for public defenders.
 Youth prevention

The task force found that community support and infrastructure is crucial for youth prevention of substance abuse.
“All of these things are really about letting a child have a childhood and not be running in the streets unattended and getting into dangerous stuff,” Winograd said.
The task force supported funding for youth mentoring and community service liaisons, school-based supports and youth crisis centers.
After hearing testimony in the task force, Winograd agreed that current prevention programming is not very effective, and can even be harmful.
“There is a difference between any school assembly talking about ‘don’t do drugs’ and efforts that actually work,” she said.
Winograd said targeted messaging to an age-appropriate audience can help adolescents understand what is going on inside their mind so drugs don’t seem like the easiest option.

NEWARK — In an effort to boost foot traffic downtown during the typically slow summer months, the city of Newark will offer free parking on weekends starting June 16 and running through August 15.
Approved by city council Monday night, the initiative will make parking free on Saturdays and Sundays in all city-run lots and on-street spaces.
Officials hope the move will attract more residents and visitors to the downtown area and give local businesses a summer boost.

The summer promotion replaces a previous strategy that offered discounts throughout the week during the past two summers.
City officials said those discounts had little effect on increasing downtown traffic and believe free weekend parking will be more appealing to potential visitors.
The city expects to generate $40,000 more in revenue this summer compared to last, due to the return of regular weekday parking fees.

This isn’t Newark’s first experiment with this type of program.
A pilot program over the winter offered it on Sundays, Mondays, and Tuesdays. Officials said the shift to Saturdays and Sundays was made at the request of business owners and to simplify marketing efforts.

Missouri may become the first state with an income tax to exempt capital gains, but several states have considered tax cut proposals that would benefit the wealthy during this year’s legislative sessions. (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent)Missouri Republicans may take their tax-cutting efforts to new heights this year as lawmakers consider exempting profits from the sale of stocks, bonds and real estate from state income taxes.
Part of a broader push to eliminate the state income tax altogether, legislation making its way through the Capitol would provide an unprecedented benefit to the wealthy by excluding capital gains, the long-term earnings from the sale of assets. If approved, tax experts say, the legislation would mark the first time a state with an income tax has eliminated capital gains tax.
The Republican sponsors say the move would make the state more attractive for businesses and families.
“This bill is intended to energize Missouri’s economy,” Republican Speaker Pro Tem Chad Perkins said upon introducing the measure.
But state Democrats — and even some of their GOP colleagues — have criticized the measure as being overly favorable to the wealthy. Most states’ tax systems already put a higher tax burden on lower-income households. That trend only accelerated in this year’s legislative sessions, worrying advocates who want to see the rich pay a larger share.
“It is so egregious in just how grossly concentrated the benefits of the [Missouri] proposal would go to the richest people in the state and shift the state’s tax system to really privilege the owners of wealth over people who are earning a regular paycheck,” said David Cooper, an analyst at the left-leaning think tank Economic Policy Institute.
The institute advocates for progressive state taxes — those that put the proportionately largest tax burdens on the highest earners. While Cooper advises against eliminating state income taxes, he said the Missouri move would be more harmful than eliminating the income tax outright.
“If you’re wiping away the income tax altogether, there’s at least some tax benefit going to lower-earning folks who are still paying income taxes,” he said. “If you’re just eliminating capital gains income taxes, you are just giving away money to the wealthiest people in the state, period.”










It is so egregious in just how grossly concentrated the benefits of the proposal would go to the richest people in the state. 


– David Cooper, Economic Policy Institute analyst


Some Democratic-led states, including Maryland and Washington, have moved to increase taxes on the wealthy this year. But several states — including Kansas, Kentucky and Mississippi — have made more regressive tax changes.
Jared Walczak, vice president of state projects at the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation, noted that states still prioritize progressive spending through social service programs aiding the most vulnerable residents.
He said states compete against each other for business and residents in much more immediate ways than the federal government competes against other nations.
“So states are very focused on the competitive advantages associated with a pro-growth tax regime,” he said, “and that has led to less of an emphasis in many states on achieving progressivity through the tax code.”
‘Generational change’ to taxes
While several states have enacted high-profile tax cuts this year, the momentum is actually slowing, Walczak said.
With booming economies and an influx of federal cash in recent years, conservative and liberal states alike passed significant tax cuts. Of the 43 states that have some sort of income tax, 28 have made rate reductions since 2021, Walczak said.
“In many states, lawmakers simply accomplished much of what they had set out to do,” he said.
Economic uncertainty and the prospect of reduced federal aid also have made many lawmakers more cautious this legislative season, he said.
But lawmakers in several states — including Oklahoma, South Carolina and West Virginia — have continued their march to eliminate state income taxes.
“Taxing people’s wages is bad because it undermines liberty,” Oklahoma state Sen. Dusty Deevers, a Republican, said this month in support of a proposed income tax cut, the Oklahoma Voice reported. “It undermines people’s freedoms. If government controls income, then it controls your life.”
Cutting services or raising taxes: State lawmakers weigh how to fill big budget gaps

This session, Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear signed a bill cutting the state income tax rate from 4% to 3.5%. Republican lawmakers have been slashing rates for years with the ultimate aim of eliminating the income tax altogether, despite concerns that more reliance on sales tax would disproportionately burden the poor. To partially offset the income tax reduction, the legislature expanded sales taxes to more services in 2018.
And Republican lawmakers in Kansas overrode a veto from Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly to move away from the state’s graduated income tax toward a flat tax of 4% that will mostly benefit the highest earners.
Last month, Mississippi Republican Gov. Tate Reeves signed legislation granting another cut in the state income tax. Officials there aim to phase out the income tax altogether over the coming years with gradual rate reductions, which Reeves characterized as “a generational change” for the state.
The Mississippi law also reduces the sales tax on groceries and increases the gas tax. Though the governor is already celebrating the end of state income tax, the law provides for incremental reductions in the coming years only if the state hits certain revenue targets.
Republican state Rep. Trey Lamar, a legislative sponsor, said income taxes disincentivize work — a particular problem for the state with the nation’s lowest workforce participation rate.
“A tax on work is a tax on productivity,” he said.
The left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy says the law will make the state’s tax system more inequitable. Its analysis found that when fully implemented, the top 1% of households, who have average annual incomes of $1.4 million, will receive an average cut of $41,420, or roughly 3% of their annual income. But the bottom 20% of earners, who have average annual incomes of $13,400, would realize a tax cut of just $42 per year.
Lamar noted the legislation did not increase sales taxes across the board. With average sales tax burdens already lower than neighboring states like Alabama, he said the income tax elimination will only help Mississippi workers.
“We need more people working,” he said. “So if helping the working man is somehow seen as regressive, then I’d have to say I don’t fully understand that.”
Governor, Democrats split on regressive or progressive tax changes to close budget gap

Walczak, of the Tax Foundation, said the state can afford the initial rate reduction. But it’s unclear whether state revenues will hit the targets needed — and whether lawmakers will reassess the aim of eliminating income taxes.
As one of the nation’s poorest states, Mississippi is heavily reliant on federal funding and would be particularly vulnerable to an economic downturn.
“There’s not a guarantee that the state could afford that in the future, and Mississippi does not have a large budget to begin with, so that would be harder than in most other states if the economy slid,” he said. “It does require a willingness on lawmakers’ parts to be honest with themselves if the economy changes and decide whether a pause might be necessary.”
An uneven tax burden
Economic uncertainty and slowing revenues have put many states into budget holes this year, forcing lawmakers to consider spending cuts or tax increases.
To close budget gaps, some conservative and liberal states have considered new or higher taxes on marijuana, tobacco and soda.
But some liberal-led states are looking to taxes more focused on the wealthy. In Rhode Island, Democratic Gov. Daniel McKee has proposed a 10% tax on digital advertising revenue.
In Washington state, lawmakers approved raising capital gains taxes and business taxes to close a looming deficit, though it’s unclear whether Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson, who has voiced skepticism, will sign off on those measures.
Maryland lawmakers, facing a $3 billion deficit, recently approved $1.6 billion in new taxes and fees. That includes two new high-income tax brackets and a new 3% sales tax on information technology and data services.
Child tax credits, long a liberal priority, find favor in Republican states

Moves like those that ask more of the wealthy could make some state tax systems more progressive, said Aidan Davis, the state policy director at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. But most state tax proposals approved this year have primarily benefited the highest earners.
That’s particularly concerning because most state systems already favor the wealthy. In 41 states, the top 1% of earners pay a lower effective tax rate than any other group, according to an institute study.
In Missouri, the fate of the first-of-its-kind capital gains tax elimination remains up in the air.
Though versions of the proposal have passed both chambers, there are differences between the Senate and House legislation. That means the bill could go back to conference committee for further negotiation or go on to Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe, who has identified capital gains among his tax cut priorities this year.
Missouri’s Department of Revenue estimated the exemption could cost $111 million per year. But an Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy analysis of IRS data projects the change could cost $600 million or more.
If approved, the top 5% of Missouri households — those making more than $273,000 per year — will receive more than 80% of the benefit from capital gains exemption, Davis said.
“Doing so would let wealthy people collect tax-free passive income while you’re continuing to tax middle class workers and people with savings,” Davis said. “It’s just a really extreme proposal.”

State agencies confirmed 338 drug deaths in 2024, down from 527 in 2023 and 537 in 2022.
The dramatic decline, confirmed through toxicology data from the Division of Forensic Science, mirrors broader regional and national improvements, with neighboring states like New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Maryland also reporting significant drops in overdose fatalities.
“The drop in drug deaths in Delaware, the region, and in most states nationally is encouraging, but we need people to recognize the danger of the filler substances in street drugs,” said DHSS Division of Substance Abuse and Mental Health (DSAMH) Director Joanna Champney. “Fentanyl is still a concern, but now we’re also very concerned with substances like medetomidine and other substances not meant for human consumption that can make people extremely sick and can result in death.”
The decline is part of a larger national trend. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the U.S. saw a 26.5% drop in drug overdose deaths between November 2023 and November 2024.
Delaware’s drop outpaced this figure, as did neighboring states like Virginia (42%) and Washington, D.C. (33%).
Officials credit the improvement to a range of initiatives, including targeted naloxone distribution, expanded addiction treatment access, and widespread public health campaigns.
They also point to a shift in drug use methods, with less injection and more smoking, which can carry a reduced overdose risk.
The state continues to invest heavily in addiction response, with more than $50 million in federal grant funding supporting treatment and outreach.
The state’s Prescription Opioid Settlement Distribution Commission (POSDC) is preparing to award another $13 million in June for addiction-related initiatives.
“Every overdose is one too many, and we still have a long road ahead of us — but we are also seeing real progress,” said Attorney General Kathy Jennings.“This is a staggering reduction in the opioid epidemic’s death toll and a testament to the dedication of our community groups, public health agencies, first responders, and state leaders who have prioritized this work. I am tremendously proud of our work to hold Big Pharma accountable for the devastation that the opioid crisis has wrought in our state, and I am in awe of the on-the-ground work that has made this progress possible.”
Lieutenant Governor Kyle Evans Gay echoed the sentiment, calling the results “promising” while urging continued focus. “We must continue advancing prevention and recovery efforts so that one day we can say Delaware has overcome this crisis.”
Despite the gains, drug overdoses remain the leading cause of death for Americans aged 18 to 44, and Delaware officials stress that prevention, education, and treatment access will remain top priorities.
“Our job now is to double down and keep up the pressure. We have some of the best people and organizations in the country devoted to this fight, and we will not rest until overdose deaths are eradicated in Delaware,” Jennings said.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screen-Shot-2025-04-29-at-8.58.48-AM.png,,,2025-04-29 09:08:07.889083

Alaska is the first U.S. state to require that businesses post signs warning that alcohol consumption raises cancer risks. (Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Alaska bars and liquor stores will be required to post signs warning of alcohol’s link to cancer, under a bill that became law on Friday.
The new sign mandate, to go into effect on Aug. 1, makes Alaska the first U.S. state to require such health warnings.
The warnings about the alcohol-cancer relationship will be added to already mandated warnings about the dangers that pregnant women’s consumption can lead to birth defects.
The requirement is part of a measure, Senate Bill 15, that allows employees under 21 to serve alcohol at restaurants and breweries. Lawmakers last year passed a similar bill, with the same combined provisions, but House members gave their final approval just minutes after the midnight adjournment deadline. It was one of five bills that Dunleavy vetoed because of passage after that deadline.
Rep. Andrew Gray, D-Anchorage, was the leading proponent of the new signage. He sponsored a stand-alone measure, House Bill 37, that became combined with the alcohol-server measure; the same process was used last year, though passage of that bill was after the adjournment deadline.
This time, the combined bill on alcohol servers and cancer warnings was approved by lawmakers well before they adjourned. It won final passage with a unanimous vote in the Senate on April 4. Dunleavy allowed the measure to become law without his signature.
Alcohol consumption has been shown to increase risks of certain types of cancer, including breast and colon cancer.
Gray said the relationship has gained more attention in recent years, and he some gave credit to former U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy. In January, Murthy issued an advisory report describing how alcohol consumption, even at moderate levels, increases risks of at least seven types of cancer. “Alcohol consumption is the third leading preventable cause of cancer in the United States, after tobacco and obesity,” said the report. 
Murthy recommended that the label on packaging for alcoholic drinks be updated to include the cancer-risk link.
Currently, South Korea is the only nation that requires warning labels about alcohol consumption increasing cancer risks. A similar warning is set to go into effect in Ireland next year.
  The newly passed bill includes a provision, originally part of a stand-alone bill sponsored by Rep. Andrew Gray, D-Anchorage, that requires warnings to be posted about alcohol use’s link to cancer.

In California and across the country there’s a growing push to minimize the role police play when someone is in the throes of a mental health crisis. Too often, those incidents can result in the person being injured by police — and a federal court ruling has inspired fresh police concerns about their liability.
Sacramento County Sheriff Jim Cooper recently responded with a dramatic policy change. His deputies won’t be responding to those calls unless a crime is in progress or the person in crisis has already committed a crime or placed someone else in imminent danger.

Susanna, a mother frustrated when help didn’t come: “Who is going to assist my family in these situations, and not only my family, but other families like mine, whose child might be more aggressive or might actually kill them or hurt them very badly? Who is going to step in and stop that before it’s too late?”

Already, some other police agencies around the state are following his lead.

Orange County Sheriff Don Barnes, president of the California State Sheriffs Association: “We’re not in the profession of white coats coming out to take somebody to the hospital.”

CalMatters contributor Lee Romney explores what this means for family members of people with serious mental illness, and to firefighters and social workers who rely on police for backup.
Lee also examines the quieter decision by other police and sheriffs’ departments to step back after they arrive on the scene. When that happened to one desperate mother who needed to get her son to the hospital for urgent treatment, she resorted to hiring a bounty hunter to do it.
The good news: There are other promising approaches.
But, as Lee reports, there will always be a role for well-trained law enforcement officers: When someone in crisis has a weapon or is exceptionally volatile, for instance, and when those who meet the legal criteria for involuntary psychiatric care are unwilling — or unable due to psychosis or substance abuse — to consent to care.

Trump administration cancels money to help crime victims

Under President Donald Trump, the federal government has cancelled millions of dollars worth of grants to organizations that help victims of violent crimes get back on their feet — putting some of the most vulnerable Californians at risk, writes CalMatters’ Cayla Mihalovich.
Last week the U.S. Justice Department cut $811 million in grants that went toward victim services and violence prevention — including more than $80 million to California organizations.
A spokesperson for the justice department said that while the department will “always protect victims of crime and legitimate law enforcement initiatives,” it will “no longer spend millions on ‘listening sessions’ and ‘bridging socio-ecological contexts.’”
Criminal justice reform advocates argue that these services aren’t a luxury, but rather part of a holistic approach to public safety. The Asian Women’s Shelter, for example, lost its three-year $500,000 grant, which went towards connecting Arab survivors of domestic violence and human trafficking with legal and social services. 

Saara Ahmed, the shelter’s communications and community engagement specialist: “The irony is that the reasons given by the Justice Department is that they’re shifting funding toward law enforcement to combat violent crime and trafficking. But violent crime and trafficking affects survivors so there’s a lot of contradiction. It’s a matter of asking: Whose safety and security are they prioritizing?”

CA reckons with effects of lost salmon

Plummeting salmon populations have forced California to shut down its commercial salmon fishing season for a third year in a row. Though some experts say efforts like this offer a glimmer of hope for the species to rebound, residents who rely on salmon fishing are weighing the possibility that the species may never fully recover — and they must seek other opportunities to keep their livelihoods afloat.
As CalMatters’ Alastair Bland explains, before the mid-2000s, Chinook salmon harvests in some California coastal towns, including Bodega Bay, were abundant and lucrative. But a combination of diverting water from the Delta, the loss of river habitat and poor ocean conditions have driven the species to the brink of collapse over the last two decades.
As the fishing economy in Bodega Bay shrinks, businesses are doing their best to adjust: Local restaurants have dropped salmon from the menu — instead featuring farmed or imported clams, oysters and shrimp — while boats that once offered fishing are turning into cruises or whale-watching expeditions. 

Mike Long, who ran a Bodega Bay fishing charter company for eight years: “Bodega Bay back in the day when the salmon were running … was an absolute party, people were camping, having fun. From a fishing standpoint, Bodega Bay has become a ghost town.”

CalMatters columnist Dan Walters: In another example of the ongoing battle to either limit or expand civil wrongs, or torts, the state Legislature is considering a bill that would extend California’s False Claims Act to high-dollar tax disputes.
The California Privacy Protection Agency wants to narrow rules that would have protected Californians against automated decisions — despite it being crucial to limit how much access algorithms and artificial intelligence have to our personal information, writes Justin Kloczko, a tech and privacy advocate at Consumer Watchdog.

(Photo illustration by Scott Olson/Getty Images)The Trump administration this month scrapped a Biden-era proposal that would have required state Medicaid programs and allowed federal Medicare to pay for some GLP-1s for obesity treatment. Instead, state Medicaid programs will retain the choice of whether to cover the high-priced medications for their residents.
The drugs, which have historically been prescribed to diabetic patients, also help patients lose weight and have grown in popularity among doctors and patients. But they are generally too expensive for most people to afford without insurance.
While doctors and patient advocates say these drugs are critical to helping patients struggling with obesity and can save money in the long run by reducing comorbidities such as heart disease, others say the medications are just too expensive for most states to afford. More than a dozen state Medicaid programs have opted to cover GLP-1s for obesity treatment, and the proposed Biden rule would have asked all states to figure out how to pay for them. But now, advocates fear these drugs may continue to be out of reach for many.
“It’s unfortunate that they’re excluding a whole class of medications that seem to have a tremendous number of health benefits to patients,” Dr. Nicholas Pennings, chair of family medicine at Campbell University in Buies Creek, North Carolina, said in an interview.













I think that’s just part of the inherent bias towards the treatment of people with obesity.


– Dr. Nicholas Pennings, chair of family medicine at Campbell University





GLP-1s, which stand for glucagon-like peptide-1, are a class of drugs that balance blood sugar levels. They’ve long been prescribed to patients with Type 2 diabetes. But since the drugs also curb hunger signals, doctors may prescribe these drugs — including popular brands Wegovy and Ozempic — to help patients lose weight.
Medicaid is a joint federal-state funded program that mostly serves people with lower incomes under the age of 65 or who have a disability. The federal Medicare program focuses primarily on people above the age of 65, no matter their income.
How and whether to cover expensive treatments and drugs can be a significant deliberation for state Medicaid directors. In North Carolina, where 70% of people struggle with being overweight or obese, officials opted to begin covering the drugs for weight loss last year. That coverage has been a game changer, said Pennings, who continues to treat Medicaid patients.
“They are expensive, but there’s a lot of other medications that are expensive too. Why is it that obesity medications and diabetes medications are being selected out?” Pennings said. “I think that’s just part of the inherent bias towards the treatment of people with obesity, feeling like it’s cheating or not necessary.”
The list price for Wegovy is around $1,300 per month, and for Ozempic, around $1,000. Even so, the skyrocketing popularity of these drugs has prompted at least 14 state Medicaid departments to begin covering these drugs to treat obesity in the past decade.
In addition to North Carolina, those states include California, Delaware, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Virginia and Wisconsin.
An annual survey of Medicaid directors from health policy research group KFF recently found that half of the 47 responding states not already covering the drugs were considering doing so.
In January, the National Association of Medicaid Directors told the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services that state Medicaid departments had “significant concerns over the fiscal impacts” of the Biden proposal to require coverage of GLP-1s, and “strongly recommend that CMS maintain the current state option to cover or not cover anti-obesity medications.”
But others say covering the drugs will yield long-term savings.
John Cawley, a professor of economics and public policy at Cornell University who has studied the economic impacts of obesity, has found that obesity essentially doubles a person’s annual health care costs due to comorbidities such as heart disease, fatty liver disease and kidney disease.
He’s found that weight loss among those with extreme obesity, with a BMI of 40 or higher, can yield substantial reductions in medical care costs.
Cawley added that state Medicaid programs “have a lot of flexibility” in ensuring costs don’t get out of control, by, for example, covering a newly available generic version of GLP-1s, requiring prior authorization, and asking patients to try behavioral programs before getting a prescription.
North Carolina’s Medicaid department began covering GLP-1s for obesity in August. The state has been able to afford GLP-1 coverage by negotiating rebates, or discounts, with drug manufacturers, and by getting the federal government to cover some costs. Department leaders think lowering obesity will save the state money in the long run, said Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for North Carolina Medicaid.
He said that one of the benefits of Medicaid is that “we get to choose, as a state, where we want to make kind of those extra investments or not.” He added that covering the medications could be potentially financially feasible for other states.
“Each program is different and has its own pressures. It would be welcome to be able to come together with other states to be able to negotiate broader deals,” Ludlam said. “If North Carolina is able to get a good deal, I don’t know why other states wouldn’t be able to participate in that.”
In 2023, Connecticut enacted a law requiring Medicaid to cover obesity treatment services. The program began covering GLP-1s for weight loss, but costs were significant enough that the state told providers this year that it is now focusing on other obesity treatments instead.
Sean Scanlon, the Connecticut comptroller, said that not covering GLP-1s is “shortsighted, bad policy.” The state health plan, which takes care of teachers and other state employees, has been covering the drugs for weight loss since 2023. The plan controls costs by only prescribing GLP-1s after patients go through some online weight-loss counseling, said Scanlon.
“The most fiscally conservative thing we can do is give people tools that will save the taxpayers money in the long run,” he said in an interview. “And GLP-1 drugs are one of the best tools that we have to ensure that the taxpayers are not going to pay more money for the health care of hundreds of millions of people in the long run.”
It’s unclear whether the federal government will reverse course. In the past, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has recommended “three good meals a day” and behavioral changes rather than weight-loss medication.
But this month, Kennedy told CBS News he’s considering a regulatory framework to have Medicare and Medicaid cover these “extraordinary drugs” in the future, once their cost goes down.
“Ideally, over the long-term, we’d like to see those drugs available for people after they try other interventions,” Kennedy said.

And then I met up with a bunch of South Dakota journalists for a few days last week. And my faith was renewed plenty.
I have just returned from the 142nd convention of the South Dakota NewsMedia Association, and I am happy to report community journalism is alive and well in South Dakota.
The energy and passion demonstrated by the 100-plus South Dakota journalists who gathered in Aberdeen last week was authentic and contagious. It warmed my heart and made me proud. Proud to be in a profession that matters dearly these days.
South Dakota Searchlight wins 12 awards in annual contest

I attended my first newspaper convention in 1979 to pick up an award for a photograph of mine published in The Corsica Globe. I was hooked. I have been to many conventions since that time, having worked at SDNA since 1995. And I’ve enjoyed them all. However, I witnessed something truly special this year: journalists of all ages and backgrounds coming together to learn from one another and, just as importantly, to encourage, support and believe in one another. All things desperately needed in today’s often contentious civic arena where journalists work.
In attendance were individuals of all ages and backgrounds, from college students to publishers and editors who have been in the business for decades. Also, attendees who knew little about the profession until they took over the local newspaper because they couldn’t imagine their community without one.
During the opening lunch, I asked those who were first-time convention attendees to stand. Half of the room stood up. Young and old alike.
At that same lunch, we honored two journalists under the age of 30 for their exemplary work. Wren Murphy is a reporter at the Madison Daily Leader doing award-winning work that is making a difference for the community and audience served by that newspaper. Amelia Schafer covers the Indigenous affairs beat for the Rapid City Journal. Her six-month investigation and reporting about 38 unmarked graves at a former Indian boarding school resonated with readers and gained nationwide attention.
On Friday night, we inducted Debbie Hemmer into the South Dakota Newspaper Hall of Fame. Debbie worked at the Grant County Review in Milbank for more than four decades, eventually becoming co-owner. Her hard work and dedication over the years has helped the Review to continue its tradition as one of South Dakota’s best and largest community newspapers.
Also at the convention, we handed out more than 250 awards for excellence in community journalism. Awards for reporting and writing, commentary, photography, design, advertising and much more.










I have just returned from the 142nd convention of the South Dakota NewsMedia Association, and I am happy to report community journalism is alive and well in South Dakota.


The Dakota Scout won the 2024 SDNA Freedom of Information Award for its dogged reporting and legal challenges to obtain information about former Gov. Kristi Noem’s government credit card spending. The Aberdeen Insider is among South Dakota’s newest newspapers and won its first general excellence award – one of the highest awards we give. These are just two examples of the great work that South Dakota’s news media organizations are doing and what we celebrated during our time together in Aberdeen last week.
I firmly believe the statewide surveys we commission every few years to gauge what South Dakotans think about local newspapers and local news media organizations are spot-on.
Last year, the survey we commissioned found that more than 7 in 10 South Dakotans believe having a local newspaper or news media outlet to serve their community is very important, and more than 8 in 10 adults in our state read a newspaper every month.
Spending time last week with South Dakota journalists from across the state reaffirmed those survey results for me. These journalists are dedicated to their work and to the communities served by their newspapers and news organizations. They know better than anyone that the success and sustainability of local journalism is dependent on the support of readers, advertisers and others.
Their passion is inspiring. Their work matters. Because without journalism, democracy suffers.
Finally, here is my hot tip for the week. A 3-year-old colt named “Journalism” is the 3-1 favorite to win this Saturday’s Kentucky Derby.
Bet on journalism. Every time.

,California,2025-04-29 12:35:00+00:00,CalMatters,Bodega Bay isn’t what it used to be. How an ailing industry has transformed this fishing village,Alastair Bland,,,,,https://calmatters.org/environment/water/2025/04/salmon-crab-fishing-industry-bodega-bay/,"Collapsing salmon runs and restrictions on Dungeness crab have forced restaurants, charter boats and commercial fishers in California's coastal villages to adapt.","In summary
Collapsing salmon runs and restrictions on Dungeness crab have forced restaurants, charter boats and commercial fishers in California’s coastal villages to adapt.




From the living room window of their waterfront home, Carol and Tony Anello have watched the rise and fall of Bodega Bay. Traffic on Westshore Road flows past in waves, fishing boats pull into the docks and throngs of visitors line up at Spud Point Crab Co., their restaurant next door. Launched more than 20 years ago and known for its chowder and Dungeness crab rolls, the restaurant has helped make the Anellos beacons of the community. 
It has also served as a life raft as they left the commercial fishing business.   
“I had a premonition that the fishing industry was going down,” said Tony Anello, who fished commercially for salmon, crab and herring for 54 years before selling his boat Anabelle last year. “There are guys dropping out of this industry like flies, and I’m one of them.”
At Bodega Bay and other picturesque seaside villages along the California coast, the fishing economy is gradually sinking.
The latest blows came earlier this month: Commercial harvest of Chinook salmon was banned in California for the third consecutive year because of low populations, and the state’s Dungeness crab fishery has been severely restricted in an effort to protect humpback whales from entanglements. Sportfishing for salmon — a valuable industry and a beloved pastime — also was prohibited for two straight years, and will be severely cut back this year to what may amount to a single weekend in June in Northern California.  
Now coastal towns that once relied on freshly caught seafood are finding ways to adapt. In Bodega Bay, fishing has increasingly taken a backseat to tourism and the draw of souvenir shops and art galleries, saltwater taffy, waterfront dining, vacation rentals and a backdrop from Hitchcock’s “The Birds.” 
Tourism is “the lifeblood of this town now. It’s not fishing,” Tony Anello said. He nodded to the line of boats moored at the harbor — elaborate rigs that can cost the price of a Bay Area home. “All the boats are in. What are they fishing for? Niente. Nothing.”

When the salmon closure hit two years ago, sportfishing charter boat operator Ty Taube’s revenue stream was cut almost in half. To compensate, he has shifted much of his business from Bodega Bay to San Francisco Bay, where he now rents a second berth in Richmond and takes his clients fishing in the spring and summer for halibut and striped bass. 
“Bodega Bay now has very little to offer,” he said.

Mike Long, who ran a Bodega Bay fishing charter company on his boat Miss Vic for eight years, said Chinook salmon fishing used to drive a frenzy of local activity. 
“Bodega Bay, back in the day when the salmon were running … was an absolute party. People were camping, having fun,” he said. “From a fishing standpoint, Bodega Bay has become a ghost town.” 
Lucrative salmon harvests — sometimes exceeding a million fish in a season — and a robust population persisted through the mid-2000s, before the fish seemed to cross a tipping point, collapsing almost to extinction in 2009. Experts say the harvests were sustainable but that Delta water diversions, loss of river habitat and poor ocean conditions are driving the collapse of the past 20 years.
The Anellos fondly recall those banner days of their youth, and the fishery’s prime, rehashing stories of big days on the water and unloading the catch in port. 
“I remember saying, ‘My God, is there a bottom to this boat? The fish just kept coming up and coming up,” Carol Anello said.  
At nearby boat ramps, the traffic jams of the salmon season are a thing of the past, at least for now, though a trickle of skiffs still comes and goes, mostly targeting either crab or rockfish. Some anglers come to fish from shore.

Abalone, and the kelp forests they live in, also have almost vanished, the victims of overfishing and climate change. Banned in 2018, diving for abalone was a recreational attraction for decades that brought visitors and cash flow to remote North Coast communities.
A small fleet of party boat services, including Taube’s vessel Dragonfly, Pole Dancin’ and New Sea Angler, still keeps a presence in the harbor, but some don’t fish as much as they once did. Some are turning to cruises, whale-watching and ash-scattering voyages to replace lost fishing opportunities. 
Visitors to the town still expect seafood, and they still get it — but many menus feature products farmed or delivered from faraway waters, including clams, oysters and shrimp.
Local Dungeness crab has become more expensive — a boon to fishers — but it remains plentiful, even when the season ends, thanks to freezing and thawing on demand. Salmon has dropped off most local menus.

At Fishetarian Fish Market, co-owner Shane Lucas supports local boats but must lean on imported catch. This market-cafe at the south edge of town on a recent day was selling farmed New Zealand Chinook salmon under their display case, and it may shift later to wild salmon from the Pacific Northwest. Rockfish, though locally available, mostly comes from Oregon, simply because local hook-and-line commercial fishers don’t catch enough to meet his needs.
Oysters are a plentiful local product, with their crushed shells mashed into the asphalt and picnic grounds throughout town. But they are mostly farmed — not fished — in nearby Tomales Bay. Lingcod and halibut remain seasonal catches, along with albacore tuna and some bluefin, too.
Nothing, however, matches the value and cachet of Chinook salmon, also known as king salmon.
Last fall, restaurants countywide collaborated with Bodega Bay fishers and the county tourism board in a promotional push dubbed “Black Cod Week.” The idea was to promote the buttery, soft flesh of locally caught black cod, also known as sablefish, as a stand-in for salmon.  
“They were looking for an alternative fish that is highly sustainable, with lots of them out there,” said Patty Ginochio, owner of Ginochio’s Kitchen on the northeast shore of Bodega Bay, explaining that black cod is oily but delicious.
“We offered black cod tacos in lieu of the salmon tacos that we would normally have been offering,” she said. Ginochio, who has not served salmon since California’s season was shut down two years ago, also served smoked black cod. 
“No matter what you do, it’s not king salmon,” she said. 
Untangling whales and crabs 
At least for now, Dungeness crab remains a valuable fishery, though seasonal catches range wildly. 2022 saw one of the poorest statewide harvests in 40 years. 2023 was a huge year, 2024 less so and this year another bummer. 
“It’s been horrible,” said Bodega Bay commercial fisherman Dick Ogg on a recent morning as he prepared to offload and sell one of his last Dungeness crab hauls of the season at Spud Point Marina, across the road from the Anellos’ restaurant.

Ogg, who has fished out of Bodega Bay for 25 years, said profitability of crab fishing has declined, contributing to attrition in the statewide fleet. 
“The gear has gone from $50 a pot to $350 a pot, plus the rope is more expensive. The regulations are more stringent, and the time we get to fish has been condensed down to three months,” he said. “If you sit back and look at what’s happening, it’s getting to the point where you just can’t make a living.”
The West Coast’s Dungeness crab population is generally booming, and landings have soared since the early 2000s. 2024’s catch of 14 million pounds was worth $50 million, and 2023 saw the eighth largest catch — 21 million pounds — in the past 45 years. 
But new regulations have constrained the fishery, including trap limits and frequent season closures. This year, the Dungeness fishery opened late — in January — and state officials announced last week that they are shutting it down early, on May 1, in much of the state.

The complicating factor is whales — particularly humpbacks, which are protected under the federal Endangered Species Act and routinely become entangled in ropes that connect floating buoys to crab traps on the seafloor. These synthetic lines can slice deep into their skin and blubber and, when attached to heavy traps, exhaust and drown the giants. 
Entanglements have increased in the last decade following a change in feeding activity that has concentrated the animals closer to the California coast, especially from spring through summer.

Since about 2014, reported entanglements have averaged several dozen per year. Last year, 31 humpbacks were reported snagged in fishing gear off the West Coast. 
“We know that we’re only observing maybe 10%, maybe 20% of the entanglements,” said Catherine Kilduff, an attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity. 
About 84% of entangled humpbacks may die or suffer serious injury as a result, according to an estimate by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 
Shifting gears: Can an old industry learn new tricks?
Commercial crabbers are collaborating with environmental groups, including Oceana, to develop whale-safe crab gear that involves no unattended vertical ropes in the water. 
They have experimented with a system reliant on compressed buoys fixed to each trap and which inflate by remote control, lifting the cage to the surface with no rope. Another model relies on a buoy spool coiled with rope and fixed to the sunken trap, then released via remote control. When the spool surfaces, the fishers, standing by, retrieve it and their gear. 
The concept for each is brilliant, but the problem that manufacturers have struggled with is reliability. Ogg, who has tried some of these methods, said they fail too frequently to be trusted. While advocates have cited a 98% reliability figure, Ogg said it’s lower, likely less than 90%. 
Ogg plans to move ahead with a whale-safe system in which he drops a line of crab traps strung together on a single rope, then retrieves the array later by snagging it with a grappling hook dragged over the bottom.

Ogg thinks this alternative gear system could represent the future of crabbing, allowing fishers to bypass seasonal bans on conventional gear implemented when whales are near.
Retrieving gear via grapple hook takes at least twice as long per trap, Ogg said. “It’s a pain in the butt, it’s hard to do,” he said. 
But maybe worse, he said, is snagging a whale. “Nobody wants to interact with an animal other than the targeted species.” 
Boom and bust of salmon
For Taube, the glory days of the North Coast salmon fishery are just a few years gone. Taube launched his fishing charter service in 2019, cashing in on several good years. Sometimes, he said, fishing was hot enough just outside the Bodega Bay harbor that he was able to run two trips daily, each with about a half-dozen customers. 
“We would do a morning trip, and we’d do an afternoon trip … it was easy fishing,” said Taube, owner of Reel Obsession Sportfishing, which features a 34-foot boat named Dragonfly. 
Those were the days when salmon season traffic jammed up the bay’s boat ramps, when wait times could be an hour and early morning tempers sometimes flared. All morning, commercial trollers, private skiffs and charter boats like Dragonfly funneled out the mouth of the harbor, where they dispersed across the water. 
Often, the fish were barely a mile outside the Bodega Bay harbor mouth, with clouds of anchovies darkening the electronic screen of the dashboard “fish finder,” feeding whales surging in all directions and the salmon quick to strike a bait. 
“If we catch the quota quickly, then it could be done in a day or two. It’s not going to make a difference in the 100 (salmon sportfishing) trips or so that we used to run.” TY TAUBE, CAPTAIN OF THE CHARTER BOAT DRAGONFLY
This year, the tradition will resume — but perhaps for just one weekend. Recreational anglers have been allocated a sliver of a season for the first time since 2022. Fishing will begin June 7, and while multiple weekends are designated for fishing, there is a catch: a 7,000-fish quota. 
“If we catch the quota quickly, then it could be done in a day or two,” Taube said. “It’s not going to make a difference in the 100 trips or so that we used to run.” 
Along part of the Central Coast, a second fishing window, with a 7,500-fish quota, will open in September.
In the historical context, such numbers are almost nothing — what a single commercial boat might catch in a season. “Total averages (in the 1970s) would be about 80 fish a day,” Tony Anello said. 
Long left the fishing business when the salmon closure took effect two years ago. Now — like many other boat operators — he runs the Miss Vic to cash in on alternative guiding opportunities. 
“We do whale-watching trips now,” he said.

Graphs depicting past abundance show a towering wall of California Chinook through the 1980s and 90s. In the record year of 1988, ocean harvest in California — commercial and recreational combined — amounted to nearly 1.4 million salmon, the best year on record. Even after that huge harvest, more than 200,000 fish returned to the Sacramento River to spawn that fall and in 2002, more Chinook swam into the Central Valley than ever recorded before — about 900,000 adults.  
Salmon abundance plunged off a cliff in the late 2000s, and it has never recovered. Just 140,000 adults migrated up the Central Valley’s rivers last year, and that came after two years with essentially no harvest. 
Return of the salmon
A salmon rebound would change everything, and it’s something state officials are calling for. 
“We are hell-bent … pushing as hard as we can, because we hate the idea of a future California without salmon,” said Chuck Bonham, director of the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. 
Some positive signals, maybe suggesting a comeback, are emerging from the watersheds where salmon spawn — due, Bonham says, to the state’s restoration efforts as well as the record wet year in 2023. Wet winters increase river flows, which help juvenile salmon reach the ocean, and can be a precursor to salmon rebounds. Bonham is optimistic that next year will see a bump. Already, numbers of spawning endangered coho salmon in coastal watersheds jumped last winter to several times the recent historical average.   
In the Sacramento River, premature returning Chinook — two-year-old males known to biologists as “jacks” — returned in very large numbers last fall. That could reflect a swelling population in the ocean. 
A major victory was recently scored in the Klamath basin, where four dams were removed from 2023 to 2024. Already, Chinook are reported to be entering spawning habitat that was inaccessible for decades, and experts and local tribes anticipate a revival.  
“We are hell-bent … pushing as hard as we can, because we hate the idea of a future California without salmon.”CHUCK BONHAM, DIRECTOR OF  CALIFORNIA DEPT. OF FISH AND WILDLIFE 
Bonham said a state policy of “cutting the green tape” has allowed faster movement on projects to rebuild habitat features like wetlands and floodplains, mostly in the Central Valley. Another new state policy allowing project developers to pack multiple project permits into a single approval has helped the state make progress on salmon restoration work. 
“Just last year, we streamlined the approvals for 60 important projects related to salmon,” he said. “We don’t have a chance to dink around and take 20 more years.” We need “more good projects faster and cheaper,” he said. 
Fishery experts and advocates say the state is not doing enough to save salmon. Scott Artis, executive director of the Golden State Salmon Association, an industry group, said the state has failed to guarantee that Central Valley rivers contain adequate cold water for salmon. He said reservoirs are drained too early, which depletes the supply of cold water essential for successful spawning, and too much water is pumped to farms and cities to the south. 
“Dead salmon don’t use habitat,” Artis said. “So if we kill all the salmon because there is no water, are we really creating habitat and allowing them to use it?”
Relics of a thriving industry
At Bodega Bay, an old fishing pier, succumbing to saltwater and wind, is falling to pieces and is no longer accessible. 
The local ice machine, installed at the Spud Point Marina in the 1980s, is in disrepair, too.
“It’s long past its life expectancy,” said Noah Wagner, marina supervisor for the Sonoma County Regional Parks Department, which operates the facility. “We’re very concerned that we’re going to have a catastrophic failure that necessitates a complete replacement of that ice house during one of these really important seasons for the salmon or crab.”
Officials with the state and county visited last year, part of an ongoing quest for funding to modernize the ice house, which is the only one of its kind between San Francisco and Fort Bragg, Wagner said. “All the fishing boats and the processors … rely on this ice house, so it’s vitally important to the fleet,” he said.

While the community thrives on the bustling tourism economy, many residents and business owners are worried about the town’s fishers.
Waves of Compassion is a local nonprofit that, among other things, helps struggling commercial fishers in and around Bodega Bay with food, clothes, laundry money, dog food and other items that Ginochio, a cofounder, says many fishers increasingly cannot afford. 
Lucas, at Fishetarian, sees a gray future for the local fishing economy.  
“It’s sad because my grandfather was a commercial fisherman, but I don’t think there will be a commercial fisherman left here in 10 years,” he said. “They’re going to be all gone. To support a family in California as a commercial fisherman, you’ve got to be doing something else.”

Groups that support California crime victims and attempt to reduce gun violence lost millions of dollars in grants when the Trump administration pulled funding.


Dozens of California violence prevention and victim service programs, including ones to protect survivors of domestic violence and end sexual abuse in jails and prisons, are facing devastating cuts after the Trump administration abruptly pulled funding from them. 
“These programs literally save lives – not just for the victims, but for our entire communities,” said Tinisch Hollins, executive director of the nonprofit organization Californians for Safety and Justice. “When they go away, we lose a safety net.”
The U.S. Justice Department last week slashed grants that were initially valued at $811 million. In California alone, the department cut just over $80 million, the majority of which was for groups based in Los Angeles, Oakland and San Francisco, according to a U.S. Justice Department document obtained and published by Reuters. 
The organizations might have already spent some of the grant funding, which typically lasts for three years, and it’s unclear how much the administration clawed back. They have 30 days to appeal the decision. The U.S. Justice Department did not respond to repeated attempts to confirm the list of affected grant recipients in California. 
In a statement to CalMatters, Justice Department spokesman Gates McGavick said, “Under Attorney General (Pam) Bondi’s leadership, the Department of Justice is committed to ensuring its resources are spent on arresting criminals, getting drugs off the streets, and crucial litigation. We will always protect victims of crime and legitimate law enforcement initiatives, but we will no longer spend millions on ‘listening sessions’ and ‘bridging socio-ecological contexts.’”
California officials rejected the Trump administration’s characterization of the grants, and described the programs as critical.
“The Trump administration is recklessly disregarding the safety of the people it is sworn to serve,” said Attorney General Rob Bonta in a statement to CalMatters. “These resources are not optional luxuries, they are essential, and critical to ensuring the security and stability of our communities nationwide. My office will do everything in our power to stop the potentially deadly consequences of freezing federal funding.”
Representatives from three organizations that lost money told CalMatters they were committed to continuing their programs, and they stressed that they provide vital services to vulnerable people.
In Oakland, the nonprofit organization Youth ALIVE! lost its $2 million grant to support the nation’s first hospital-based violence intervention program. The organization’s staff appear at the hospital bedside of youth who have been violently injured in order to help them navigate their recovery and prevent retaliatory violence. 
Through ongoing support such as mental health and housing services, the organization maintains that it can break cycles of violence. Last year, it served 113 clients, only one of whom was injured again.
“It’s an essential part of the ecosystem, because you need to be in specific places to help quell violence and help people heal,” said Dr. Joseph Griffin, executive director of Youth ALIVE! “It’s about increasing the health of the community.”
When he learned that the organization had lost its funding, he said he was in disbelief. 
“It’s not an impact that we can absorb lightly,” he said. “Replacing $2 million is never easy.”

Elsewhere in Oakland, the organization Impact Justice lost $8.5 million in grant funding.
“This was a sledgehammer,” said Alex Busansky, its founder and president.
The organization was awarded a $4 million grant to expand opportunities for reentry housing for people returning home from prison. It also received three grants totaling $4.5 million to support its work in eliminating sexual abuse and sexual harm from confined facilities, such as prisons and jails. 
“To take that away puts the most vulnerable people in a much riskier and potentially harmful situation,” Busansky said. 
Asian Women’s Shelter, one of three domestic violence shelters in San Francisco, lost its $500,000 grant to support Arab survivors of domestic violence and human trafficking through connecting them with legal and social services. 
The competitive grant had only been awarded to five organizations last year, according to the Asian Women’s Shelter’s communications and community engagement specialist, Saara Ahmed. 
“The irony is that the reasons given by the Justice Department is that they’re shifting funding toward law enforcement to combat violent crime and trafficking. But violent crime and trafficking affects survivors so there’s a lot of contradiction,” Ahmed said. “It’s a matter of asking: Whose safety and security are they prioritizing?”
On April 25, over 600 local, state and national organizations, including the Asian Women’s Shelter, signed a letter to Attorney General Bondi expressing “deep concern” over the Justice Department’s federal funding decisions, including the canceled grants.
“This longstanding bipartisan commitment to supporting services and prevention efforts for victims of [domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, stalking and trafficking] remains strong; however, the Department’s recent actions have left these critical lifesaving programs uncertain about their ability to continue serving victims,” advocates wrote. 
The San Francisco District Attorney’s Office also lost a grant in the culling. “It is heartbreaking to see funds cut for such critical work,” said San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins, whose grant supported at-risk youth and young adults from underserved communities. 
“Public safety, at its core, is fewer victims of crime overall. And as a government, we cannot simply be reactionary,” she said. “We have to do the front end, proactive work so that people don’t feel the need to get involved in crime in the first place.”

Justin Kloczko
Justin Kloczko is a tech and privacy advocate at Consumer Watchdog.


Let’s say you work in the food service industry for a large company, whose scheduling software assigns shifts to workers. For you, which shifts you receive mean everything because much of your salary depends on tips. But in the eyes of the algorithm, you could be deprioritized and miss out on lucrative weekend shifts based on mysterious data. Without your knowledge, information such as when you take a break, how fast you turned over a table or where you live could work against you. 
Shouldn’t you have the right to know the logic behind the algorithm, and the right to opt out of its automated decision?
Californians were on track to have novel protections against automated decisions under rules drafted by California’s top privacy agency, the California Privacy Protection Agency. But this month, the privacy board proposed substantially narrower privacy regulations, including deleting specific protections — like the example above — surrounding criminal justice, education, essential goods like food, and employment matters if they were made by automated decisions. 
Some members even suggested deleting the automated decision-making language altogether. The five-member board also committed to deleting other rules aimed at giving people control of their personal information in the training of artificial intelligence and in targeted advertising. 
We are at a major crossroads in California’s battle over data privacy protections. After the establishment of the landmark California Consumer Privacy Act and its 2020 voter-enacted California Privacy Rights Act, forces within the privacy agency and Gov. Gavin Newsom, under pressure from powerful business interests, are pushing to scale back these seminal protections. A key hearing is scheduled for Thursday.
After the departure of the protection agency’s first leader, Ashkan Soltani, and the very questionable dismissal of privacy-facing board member Vinhcent Le, there has been a shift away from the pro-consumer mission statement of the small but influential agency. The new head of the agency is Tom Kemp, a tech entrepreneur. The real estate developer who spurred the state’s data privacy law is now among some of its biggest skeptics.
But wouldn’t you want to know if algorithms, not people, were deciding sensitive aspects of your life and at least have the option to stop it? Automated decisions dictate everything from how we get jobs to essential services or mortgages, for example, in rapid, nonchalant and unaccountable fashion. 
The privacy agency’s board members already recommended loosening opt outs for targeted advertising and training data that feeds artificial intelligence systems. Without opt-outs, companies can indefinitely train AI models on your personal data without consent, and because you said the word baby, the algorithm thinks you’re a parent and bombards you with parenting ads on every feed.
Californians complain about this stuff all the time.
The privacy agency doesn’t have to listen to the governor. Board members just have to read the voter-passed Proposition 24 and the privacy act statute, which directs them to draft regulations in the interest of privacy — not in favor of the interests of a few large tech companies. 
More importantly, the right to privacy is enshrined in the first article of the California Constitution. By letting algorithms and AI take the reins, we relieve ourselves of responsibility — a comfort that comes at the cost of our own control. 
We are supposed to be in a new era of privacy, and California is supposed to be leading that charge. Instead, we’re willingly moving to the back of the line. We’ve heard these industry threats for decades now — that regulations will be too costly — yet tech companies have only grown and remain rooted in our state after 20 years of dominance. 
We can’t afford to let their tactics scare us.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/042825-Data-Privacy-JF-AP-01-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-29 09:08:07.889083

Assembly Bill 215 would prohibit high school teenagers from working between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. before a school day. Teens aged 14 and 15 are already prohibited by federal law from working between 7 p.m. and 7 a.m., but the Nevada proposed law would put in place restrictions for 16-, 17- and 18-year olds who are enrolled in public or private school.
Emancipated teenagers, lifeguards, arcade workers, farm workers, and theatrical performers would be exempt from the hourly restrictions. Additional exemptions could be granted on a case-by-base basis.
The bill would also lower the maximum number of hours a child under 16 can work: from 48 to 40 hours per week.
“Every single day in my classes I have kids who are too tired to participate,” said Matt Nighswonger, a teacher at Shadow Ridge High School on the northern edge of the Las Vegas Valley. “When I wake them up and ask them why they’re so tired, they tell me they had to close, or had to work late last night. Many of them have to work until 1 or 2 in the morning.”
The business community, he said, is taking advantage of vulnerable teenagers.
“As a government teacher, I try to teach my students that the government is here to protect its citizens,” he added. “AB215 helps to protect our exploited high school workers.”
Karissa Murdoch was one of those teens. The Shadow Ridge senior began working at a local ice rink at 15. She started with a reasonable workload, then she asked for more hours because she wanted more money, then she was asked by her bosses to stay late after her official shift to do extra work.
That’s how she found herself regularly working until midnight Monday through Thursday. After the commute home, eating and showering, she was going to bed at 1 or 2 a.m. and sleeping a paltry few hours before school started up again at 7 a.m.
Her grades slipped. She says she went from being a student who “almost never turned in an assignment late” to a student who couldn’t stay awake in class and turned in everything late. Murdoch said she came to her senses on her own and now wants to advocate for her younger self.
“At 15, I was nowhere near mature enough to prioritize school over money,” she told Assembly members during the bill’s first hearing, which she traveled to Carson City for over spring break in March. “I wish the adults around me would have thought about more than just using me for business gain.”
Teagan Clark, another Shadow Ridge student, testified that working closing shift meant driving home late at night tired — a potentially dangerous scenario for anyone but especially an inexperienced driver. It also resulted in her skipping breakfast in order to get an extra few minutes of sleep, drinking too many caffeine-filled energy drinks, and feeling isolated socially.
Nighswonger said he surveyed working high school seniors at Shadow Ridge and found that 48% regularly work past 10 p.m. on school nights. Many of the students were worried they would lose their job if they shared their own stories, though a few hand-wrote letters for him to deliver to lawmakers.
“I work at a car wash and every night we close at 8 and I stay after hours to clean the vacuum trays and sewage out of the tunnel where the cars are washed,” read one. “It’s too much for a 17 year old kid, but I don’t want to lose my job.”

 
Equipo Academy Assistant Principal Erik Van Houten said a quarter of 16- and 17-year-olds at the East Las Vegas charter school have jobs, and 1 in 5 of them work over 40 hours a week.
“These students are ill equipped to advocate for themselves to leave work at reasonable hours,” he said. “Many are holding their very first job.”
AB215, he continued, would ”put guardrails in place to protect our kids and make clear that a high school education should be their number one priority.”
Nighswonger, Murdoch and other Shadow Ridge students pitched the proposed law to Democratic Assemblymember Daniele Monroe-Moreno and Republican Assemblymember Brian Hibbetts, whose districts cover the school’s enrollment area. Both signed on to sponsor a bill on the issue.
Independently, Democratic Assemblymember Cinthia Zermeño Moore was working on similar legislation inspired by concerns raised by Van Houten from Equipo, which is located in her district.The three Assembly members decided to combine their bills and work together.
Strong support, but some concerns raised
AB215 passed the Nevada State Assembly with unanimous bipartisan support earlier this month and is now making its way through the Senate. If passed, the bill will head to Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo’s desk for final approval.
Hibbetts acknowledged that some might see the inclusion of protections for 18-year-olds as a problem because it means they are being considered adults in some legal contexts and not adults in others. But he said there is precedent.
High school students are not allowed to sign off on their own school paperwork just because they turn 18 during their senior year, he said. They still need parental signatures.
“This is, in my vision, just going along with that same type of mentality,” he said. “I think this is something that we need to offer them. Just because you’re 18, it doesn’t mean your employer can make you work until 2 a.m. because you have to be at school at 7 a.m.”
Monroe-Moreno added that the inclusion of 18-year-olds was specifically asked for by Shadow Ridge students who said their managers target them for late shifts because they are 18.
Several lawmakers in the bill’s two hearings raised concerns about the impact the legislation might have on lower income families whose teens contribute to essential household bills.
Moore said she understands that reality, adding that her first job was at age 14 selling CDs at the Indoor Swap Meet in East Las Vegas. But she argued the state needs to support students with their education because, without it, “they may not be able to seek the opportunities they may have” that could lift them, and their families, upward.
Teresa Benitez-Thompson, a former state lawmaker, spoke in personal support of the bill, saying she wished such restrictions were in place two decades ago when she was a teenage hostess whose paychecks helped support her single mom, who worked as a waitress, and her sister, who was a teen mom at 15. She said she fell behind her junior year and had to do credit recovery to get back on track.
“A low-wage job for a teenager is not going to solve poverty,” she said. “Education is what breaks the cycle of poverty. Education is absolutely what has to be prioritized.”
Groups in support of AB218 included the Vegas Chamber, Nevada Resorts Association, NAACP, City of North Las Vegas, and ACLU.
No groups publicly opposed AB218 during its two bill hearings, but the Nevada Restaurant Association testified in neutral.
“We support efforts to balance student well being and academics with valuable work experience,” the group’s lobbyist, Peter Saba, said. “Many restaurants rely on student workers, and we encourage ongoing discussions to ensure these small businesses can adapt smoothly.”
Monroe-Moreno acknowledged that concessions were made to appease business groups. The bill originally sought to prohibit teens from working past 10 p.m. on school nights but the time was amended to 11 p.m.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2173891470-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-29 09:08:07.889083

Assembly Bill 241, sponsored by Democratic Assemblymember Sandra Jauregui, is designed to spark development of more multi-family housing, and require counties to speed up the process to rezone land currently designated commercial use into residential or mixed use. 
“Many commercial properties, particularly aging strip malls and vacant office buildings, are underutilized,” Jauregui said during the bill’s hearing in March. “Repurposing them for housing makes better use of existing infrastructure. Building homes closer to jobs, schools and public transit reduces commute times, lowers greenhouse gas emissions and decreases urban sprawl.”
The bill, which passed the Assembly on a party line vote earlier this month, is directed toward the state’s most populous counties, Clark and Washoe, and would give them until Oct. 1, 2026 to adopt an ordinance that allows for a more expedited rezoning process. 
Under the legislation, if a buyer purchases a commercial property and wants to build multi-family housing on it instead, they could seek swift approval rather than go through a lengthy rezoning process, Jauregui said. 
A recent analysis by the Regional Transportation Commission of Southern and the regional planning collaborative known as Southern Nevada Strong identified 78,285 acres as “vacant or underutilized land,” most of it — 85% — vacant.
The bill is scheduled to be heard Wednesday in the Senate Commerce and Labor Committee.
The legislation’s supporters included theNevada Conservation Leaguethe Nevada State Apartment Association. 
However, the Nevada Association of Counties along with Clark and Washoe County opposed the legislation.
“There are some commercial areas where multi-family or mixed-use (zoning) may not be appropriate,” said Ashley Kennedy, a lobbyist with Clark County, adding the county wants to retain “the ability at the local level to determine” when to quickly rezone without state legislation mandating it. 
Kennedy said that the county supports infill development and hasn’t denied any application for a multi-family project since 2022. 
She added that during that timeframe there were 39 applications for multi-family projects approved, and 21 of those applications were in commercially zoned areas.”
Cadence Matijevich, a lobbyist with Washoe County, warned the bill would produce “unintended consequences” and could “upset the balance of land use in our community” by requiring some commercial projects to be rezoned as residential. 
“Nevada cannot afford to let outdated zoning laws and people who oppose density continue to be the reason we are stalling housing production,” Jauregui said. 
Efforts to promote infill development come as state lawmakers, some members of Nevada’s Congressional delegation and Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo have pushed for stepped up sales of federal land development. 
Assembly Joint Resolution 10, also sponsored by Jauregui, would ask the federal government to pass the Southern Nevada Economic Development and Conservation Act, commonly referred to as the Clark County Lands Bill.
The bill passed the Assembly 36-6 April 17. Six Democrats Assemblymembers, Natha Anderson, Venicia Considine, Tanya Flanagan, Selena La Rue Hatch, Cinthia Moore, and Howard Watts, voted against the resolution.
Democratic Rep. Dina Titus recently took issue with state lawmakers voting for the resolution  and denounced the federal bill, saying nothing in the legislation mandates that any of the land must be dedicated to affordable housing. The bill would only make land available “to developers to build more homes that average Nevadans cannot afford,” Titus said. 
AB 241 isn’t the only bill that could lead to more infill development.
Senate Bill 28, legislation being brought by the City of Las Vegas, would create “tax increment areas” in which a portion of future property tax revenue would be used to pay interest on bonds used to finance  affordable housing development as well as public transit.
Much of the city’s development over the next 25 years “will consist of infill and redevelopment within existing neighborhoods, Seth Floyd, Director of Community Development for the City of Las Vegas, told the Senate Government Affairs Committee during a hearing on the bill in lawmakers during the bill’s hearing in March.” 
SB 28 passed the Senate 17-4 on April 17. Republican Sens. Carrie Ann Buck, Robin Titus, Ira Hansen and John Ellison voted against the bill.  
Funding supportive housing
Lawmakers are also considering allocating general fund dollars to aid housing development, including $250 million proposed by Lombardo.  
Any proposal seeking to allocate any funding could face serious setbacks after the Economic Forum meets Thursday, when it will set final budget limits that legislators and the governor must meet when they approve a budget for the upcoming biennium. 
Uncertainty and anxiety driven by Donald Trump’s trade war and the resulting fallout have prompted widespread projections of not only a slowing economy, with many observers projecting the chance of a recession has increased substantially in recent weeks.
Assembly Bill 366, sponsored by Democratic Assemblymember Daniele Monroe-Moreno, would appropriate $25 million from the state general fund to supportive housing initiatives throughout the state. The Nevada Housing Division would determine the projects eligible to receive those dollars.  
Permanent supportive housing projects are subsidized for populations with significantly low or no income, such as folks experiencing homelessness or at risk of homelessness, and comes with case management and wrap-around support services. 
Brooke Page, the Nevada director of the Corporation for Supportive Housing, said funding supportive housing for unhoused people is more cost effective than the alternative.
The organization conducted an analysis for Northern Nevada last year that found eight days in the emergency room, three months in jail, and one year in supportive housing with rental assistance and warp around services all cost the same. Page said. 
“It makes more sense to house people, ensure they have the services they need to improve their mental health, their physical health, and gain access to employment than it does to continue to allow people to cycle in and out of high-cost systems,” she said. 
Not only do developers struggle to find financing for supportive housing, funding for operational support and tenant services is also limited.
State lawmakers in 2023 allocated $30 million from the state’s general fund to permanent supportive housing projects. 
AB 366 seeks to strengthen the program.. 
During its first hearing in March, Monroe-Moreno said though the state “doesn’t have any money” allocating funds for permanent supportive housing was a priority Lombardo also identified during his budget proposal, she said.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)The Utah Public Service Commission approved a 4.7% increase in residential electricity rates on Friday, only about a quarter of the 18.1% that Rocky Mountain Power requested last August — and an even more substantial reduction than the original 30.5% increase proposal that appalled Utah leaders.
With the change, an average single-family residential customer using 700 kilowatt hours per month will see a monthly increase in their utility bill of $4.31 this year, about $10 less than Rocky Mountain Power proposed. 
Commissioners said in the order that the 18.1% ask was unprecedented both in the scope of issues it addressed and price. Ultimately, the decision to only approve a small portion of the rate proposal was attributed to the reasons Gov. Spencer Cox and legislative leaders had cited as they promised to do everything in their power to avoid such an increase — Utah ratepayers shouldn’t pay for other states’ costs.

“I think there’s two themes to this case,” Chris Parker, director of the Utah Division of Public Utilities, said on Monday. “They are that the commission wants to make sure that Utahns aren’t paying expenses that need to be borne by other states’ customers, and that Utahns should not be paying for imprudent actions by the utility.”
After wildfires plagued Oregon in 2020, PacifiCorp, Rocky Mountain Power’s parent company, saw an impact in its equity and also “paid $550 million in dividends to its parent company, Berkshire Hathaway, after it became aware of potential wildfire liability,” according to the order. 
“The current capital structure of the company is primarily a result of its own actions,” commissioners wrote. “It is unreasonable to expect RMP’s ratepayers in Utah to pay higher rates because of the wildfires in Oregon and the depletion of cash reserves by these dividend payments.” 
Rocky Mountain Power lowers its rate increase proposal to 18.1%, down from 30.5%

The commission also rejected making payments for insurance premiums “driven far beyond industry norms for Utah,” legal fees associated with the Oregon wildfire litigation, and other costs tied to “specific state climate action policies or specific state agreements driven by individual state circumstances (particularly in Washington and Oregon).”
The order, however, approved some smaller expenses for wildfire mitigation, and an increase in the low-income Lifeline assistance credit, an electricity bill discount program for low income Utahns — from $13.95 to $18 a month.
As of Monday afternoon, PacifiCorp was still reviewing the nearly 200-page order, David Eskelsen, a spokesperson for the company, said. 
“We are determining its implications and our next steps in meeting our responsibility to provide electric service to our customers,” Eskelsen said in a statement. 
It’s possible that the company could appeal the decision, triggering a revision process. The utility is also expected to present its case in May to recover some past costs through its Energy Balancing Account — a price adjustment that either credits or debits users for differences between power prices and the other market costs that are somewhat outside the control of the utility.
PacifiCorp has also taken legal action against other states it serves, like Wyoming, for their partial denial of rate increase.
The rate change took effect immediately once the commission’s order was issued.
A controversial rate increase 
Utah has for years flaunted its ranking at the top of states with the cheapest electricity. So, when Rocky Mountain Power proposed a two-digit increase in rates, it woke tensions with the state.
The company listed increased costs of fuel and wholesale power in addition to ongoing new electric transmission and generation projects for a substantial part of the 30.5% rate increase, as well as the escalation of wildfire risk insurance premiums.



Let us know what you think...


 


That triggered legislative proposals to change Rocky Mountain Power’s rate structure, a firm request to split PacifiCorp into two consortiums of blue or red states, and a strong social media post from Cox. 
“The proposal is completely unacceptable,” the governor wrote on an X post in June. “The audacity and lack of awareness with this request seriously calls into question management at RMP. I will do everything I can to make sure a rate increase of that magnitude never sees the light of day.”
Changes are coming to Rocky Mountain Power’s contracts with AI centers, but not its rate structure

Some of those bills, including one that would have made Rocky Mountain Power pay for everything that’s currently included in the Energy Balancing Account, didn’t materialize. But, there’s still a big focus on studying the utility’s books to determine what costs should and shouldn’t be in Utahns’ bills. 
Parker, from the Division of Public Utilities, said that a big item the commission denied last year in the company’s Energy Balancing Account case was tied to expenses covering the cost of greenhouse gas allowances the utility bought to comply with a Washington state law. 
And this time, the denials are mostly because of wildfire liability. While he sympathizes with the company’s challenges, he said it’s its duty to provide appropriate services at reasonable rates.
“And if that requires additional infusions of equity that ratepayers aren’t responsible for paying, then that’s what it requires. That’s their obligation,” Parker said. “The privilege of being a public utility is that you’re a monopoly, and the obligation of being a public utility is that you have to act in the public interest.”

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)Two bills that would change Alabama’s bail system are working their way through the Legislature in the waning days of the 2025 session.
The Senate Judiciary Committee hosted a public hearing Wednesday for HB 42, sponsored by Rep. Chris England, D-Tuscaloosa, which gives judges the authority to allow defendants to pay a portion of their total bond to be released from pretrial detention.
HB 410, sponsored by Rep. Shane Stringer, R-Citronelle, which was approved by the House Judiciary Committee, modifies the composition of the Alabama Professional Bail Bonding Board, expands the exemptions for the fees that bail bond companies must pay the court, increases penalties for bail jumping and adds more regulations for bail bond companies when they operate in another state.

A message was sent to Stringer Monday seeking comment.
HB 42 has passed the House and is awaiting a vote in the Senate Judiciary Committee. The House is scheduled to vote on HB 410 on Tuesday. England’s bill adds three words, “a part of” back into an  Alabama statute that were removed when the same Legislature enacted the Alabama Bail Reform Act of 1993.
The removal of the words meant judges in the state could not allow defendants to pay a percentage of their bond to get release from pretrial detention.
“What that translates into is a large amount of money that would normally go to the court system, instead of going to the court system, it goes to a bondsman,” England said to the committee Wednesday.
People can secure their release after an arrest if they pay a bail bond company. The premium, which is typically 10% of the total amount of the bond, is paid to the bail bond company, which then must ensure the individuals go to their court appearances.
The money that people pay when released on a percentage bond would be retained by the court and kept if defendants fail to appear for their court dates.
The Alabama Bail Bond Association has been a vocal opponent of the bill, speaking out against the legislation at a March public hearing and the House Judiciary Committee considered it then and eventually approved the bill a week later.
Victor Howard, vice president of the Alabama Bail Bond Association and bail bond company owner, said that enacting the legislation would reduce accountability for defendants to appear for their court dates.
Chris McNeil, the president of the Alabama Bail Bond Association, suggested Monday in an interview that the rates that people would not appear for court would increase. He also cited records from the Alabama Administrative Office of Courts saying that people who paid cash to be released from pretrial detention in 2022 and 2023 had a failure to appear (FTA) rate of 55%.
“The court just can’t function when you have a failure to appear rate of 55%,” McNeil said Monday. “The bonding companies were averaging about a 14%-15% failure to appear rate. And were able to trim that rate by returning defendants back to court.”
England told the committee that the numbers do not present a fair comparison to percentage bonds.
“The numbers are obviously going to be off because there are more people on smaller offenses with cash bonds versus somebody who is on a large bond with a bondsman,” England said to the committee on Wednesday. “Obviously, there is going to be a higher number of FTAs on smaller cases, traffic tickets, because they all count.”
Jerome Dees, policy director from the Southern Poverty Law Center, supported the legislation.
“The vast majority of times when there was an FTA that was ultimately secured, and the defendant showed up in court, it largely was due to law enforcement bringing that individual in and not the bail bond company,” he said to the committee on Wednesday. “That is not to say that it never happened, but the vast majority of time it was law enforcement bringing that particular individual in.”
McNeil said in an interview Monday he supports HB 410, Stringer’s bill.
“It expands the Alabama Professional Bail Bonding Board by adding a sheriff to the board, adding a layperson, so I think that is very important,” he said.
It also states that any fees that bail bond companies pay to the court that have not been deposited within 90 days and that have an expiration date “shall be deemed uncollected” and will no longer hold the bail bond company responsible for making the payment.
The bill also exempts bail bond companies from fees that the courts or district attorneys have not attempted to collect past one year from the original due date.
HB 410 also adds more conditions such that the bail bond company will not pay a fee, known as forfeiture, to the court when in cases that the defendant fails to appear in court.
McNeil said the bill would cancel that forfeiture payment if someone was not placed in the National Crime Information Center and failed to appear in court, or if the bail bond company brings back a defendant that the jail refuses to accept.
The bill also addresses instances when an individual travels out of state and enhances the penalty for bail jumping, going from a Class A misdemeanor to a Class D felony, punishable by up to 5 years in prison and a $7,500 fine.

Richard Wright wrote his memoir about growing up in Roxie, Miss., called “Black Boy.” Credit: Wikipedia
“Black Boy,” Richard Wright’s memoir about his upbringing in Roxie, Mississippi, became the top-selling book in the U.S. 
Wright described Roxie as “swarming with rats, cats, dogs, fortune tellers, cripples, blind men, whores, salesmen, rent collectors, and children.” 
In his home, he looked to his mother: “My mother’s suffering grew into a symbol in my mind, gathering to itself all the poverty, the ignorance, the helplessness; the painful, baffling, hunger-ridden days and hours; the restless moving, the futile seeking, the uncertainty, the fear, the dread; the meaningless pain and the endless suffering. Her life set the emotional tone of my life.” 
When he was alone, he wrote, “I would hurl words into this darkness and wait for an echo, and if an echo sounded, no matter how faintly, I would send other words to tell, to march, to fight, to create a sense of the hunger for life that gnaws in us all.” 
Reading became his refuge. 
“Whenever my environment had failed to support or nourish me, I had clutched at books,” he wrote. “Reading was like a drug, a dope. The novels created moods in which I lived for days.” 
In the end, he discovered that “if you possess enough courage to speak out what you are, you will find you are not alone.” He was the first Black author to see his work sold through the Book-of-a-Month Club. 
Wright’s novel, “Native Son,” told the story of Bigger Thomas, a 20-year-old Black man whose bleak life leads him to kill. Through the book, Wright sought to expose the racism he saw: “I was guided by but one criterion: to tell the truth as I saw it and felt it. I swore to myself that if I ever wrote another book, no one would weep over it; that it would be so hard and deep that they would have to face it without the consolation of tears.” 
The novel, which sold more than 250,000 copies in its first three weeks, was turned into a play on Broadway, directed by Orson Welles. He became friends with other writers, including Ralph Ellison in Harlem and Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus in Paris. His works played a role in changing white Americans’ views on race.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/06001214/April29-FeatImage-Richard_Wright.jpg,,,2025-04-29 09:08:07.889083

This story was originally reported by Jasmine Mithani of The 19th.  Meet Jasmine and read more of her reporting on gender, politics and policy.
President Donald Trump has taken aim at trans people during his first 100 days in office in his second term. He has sought to restrict access to accurate passports, erase the accomplishments of trans elders, remove transgender members from the military and purge the government of what he has termed “woke gender ideology.” But a new 19th News/SurveyMonkey poll shows that 49% of Americans think politicians should not be focusing on transgender issues at all.
It’s a rise from before the election, when 43% of Americans said they believed politicians should not focus on trans issues, versus protecting trans rights or restricting gender-affirming care. In 2023, the figure was 44%.
Democrats and Independents are less likely than they were in September to think politicians should be protecting transgender rights, and 42% of Democrats think politicians should not focus on trans issues — up from 33% last year.
More Republicans also think politicians shouldn’t focus on trans issues — 57% vs 53% last year — and the number who think lawmakers should concentrate on restricting transgender rights has fallen.
Overall, despite the Trump administration’s attempts to erase trans people from public life, the majority of Americans (59%) support the right of transgender adults to access gender-affirming care. However, fewer Americans, 43%, support the right of trans youth to seek such care. That doesn’t necessarily translate into a desire for bans. In fact, 55% opposed laws that would restrict gender-affirming care for minors, including 41% of Republicans and 57% of Independents.
Gender-affirming care for trans people is any health care designed to support and affirm their gender identity, and typically differs depending on age. For trans adults, care can include therapy, consultations with doctors, hormones or other medication, and surgery. For trans youth, gender-affirming care can include therapy, consultations with doctors, hormones or puberty blockers, other medication, and, rarely, surgery. The World Professional Association for Transgender Health does not recommend gender-affirming gential surgeries for anyone under 18.
The results are from a 19th News/SurveyMonkey poll conducted online from April 11-21, 2025, among 5,032 American adults. Results have a margin of error of 1.5 percentage points.
The majority of Americans are not confident that politicians are informed enough about gender-affirming care for transgender minors to make fair policy. But the number who say they are informed enough has risen from 24% last year to 31% this year.
Women continue to be more likely than men to support access to gender-affirming care for both adults (65% versus 52%) and youth (46% versus 38%). While this survey collected only binary gender data, a 19th News/SurveyMonkey poll from September showed widespread support for access among nonbinary and transgender Americans.
Movement in favor of transgender rights is notable given how central antri-trans rhetoric was to Trump’s campaign, which is now manifesting into federal policy impacting hundreds of thousands of lives.
Meanwhile, Democrats are split on whether to support their trans constituents. In the immediate aftermath of the election, some congressional Democrats loudly criticized their party for supporting trans people. And in the inaugural episode of his new podcast,  California Gov. Gavin Newsom signaled interest in restricting how trans women athletes can compete in sporting events.
But others, like Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, have vocally condemned Trump’s anti-trans policies and refused to back down.
This was notably seen a couple months into the Trump administration, when Senate Democrats did band together to block a bill which would have prevented transgender girls from playing on girls’ sports teams in federally-funded schools.

(Photo by Sean Rayford/Getty Images)The Democratic National Committee will transfer more than $1 million per month to its state and territorial parties over the next four years in an effort to build state-level infrastructure and operations, the DNC announced Thursday.
The agreement marks the DNC’s largest total investment in Democratic state parties to date and comes as Democrats try to rebound from significant losses in the 2024 election cycle.
Each state party is set to receive a minimum of $17,500 per month, a $5,000 increase from the current baseline, the DNC said in materials provided to States Newsroom ahead of the wider announcement.

Republican-controlled states will get an additional $5,000 a month, bringing their monthly total to $22,500. The GOP-controlled states will get that additional investment through the DNC’s Red State Fund.
The DNC’s definition for a GOP-controlled state is one that meets at least two of the three criteria: no Democratic governor or Democratic U.S. Senator; one-quarter or less of the congressional delegation is made up of Democrats; and Republicans hold supermajorities in both state legislative chambers.
As part of the agreement, the DNC said it will host six regional training “bootcamps” for state parties per two-year cycle and will also hire new staff to the Association of State Democratic Committees.
The DNC said the initiative also aims to help Democratic state parties with their infrastructure, staffing, data and tech operations as well as with organizing programs and preparation for future election cycles.
DNC Chair Ken Martin, the former Minnesota party chair who was elected to lead the national party in February, called the initiative “a historic political investment unlike anything Democrats have done in modern times” and said in a statement it is part of a long-term strategy.
“We’re putting our money where our mouth is to equip state parties with what they need to reach working families who deserve better, build long-term success all across the ballot, and gain electoral ground for years to come,” Martin said in the statement.
“Elections are won in states — and that’s exactly where we will be investing our resources,” said Martin.
Last week, Martin laid out the leadership board’s organizing principles, which centered on “organizing early, organizing always, organizing everywhere, and winning everywhere.”
“You’re going to continue to witness a level of aggressive investment and organizing from this DNC that’s unlike anything we’ve done before,” Martin wrote in that memo.
In a Thursday statement, Jane Kleeb, president of the Association of State Democratic Committees and chair of the Nebraska Democratic Party, said “state parties are the backbone of the Democratic Party, and through this investment, our state parties will receive the support they need to show voters that, no matter where they live, there is a strong Democratic Party in their corner, protecting their rights and economic opportunity against Republican attacks.”

20 years later

The strategy bears some resemblance to the 50-state strategy pioneered by former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, who led the DNC from 2005 to 2009 and appeared on a DNC press call Thursday.
“This is a really critical move that’s being made here,” Dean said. “We have not been anything but a Washington, D.C.-centric party since 2008, and the reason that the Democrats have had a tough time is because if you’re not out there doing the grassroots politics, you don’t win. Period.”
Critics during Dean’s tenure argued that spending in deep-red areas pulled resources away from winnable races in more moderate states and congressional districts.
Asked on the press call whether the push to spread money to more states could lead to a decline in financial support to swing states, Martin said, “No, not at all.”
“I mean, as I said, there’s no such thing as a perpetual blue state or a perpetual red state, and over the years, because there’s been a lack of investment in blue states, as an example, by other partners in the ecosystem, not necessarily the DNC, it’s meant we’ve seen actually our vote share in some of the bluest parts of the country actually starting to decrease,” he said.
“I believe you have to invest everywhere and organize everywhere if you want to win everywhere, and so, that’s what this will do.”

Under new federal guidelines and procedures (some of which were paused by a pair of court rulings last week, but only temporarily), schools, colleges and universities are being inspected for any DEI programs and policies. If the administration’s proposals stand, federal funding will be withheld to enforce the elimination of DEI.
DEI concepts promote sound educational policies and practices in public schools. Diversity requirements are protections, not guarantees. Equity ensures fair consideration for admission, scholarships and programs regardless of race or ethnicity. Inclusion means that students from all backgrounds have access to public education.
The Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibited segregation and discrimination in schools and colleges. It was not enacted to produce quotas, but to provide equal opportunities. DEI initiatives are used to enhance and preserve this legislation.
Backpedaling on these guarantees will bring us back to Brown v Board of Education and the Little Rock Nine. Most have grasped the notion that “separate but equal” is not acceptable, but bigotry and racism are still with us.
Our history should not be whitewashed or have past acts of prejudice diminished. Students hold no responsibility for the actions of their ancestors.
Analyzing historical and Constitutional cause and effect relationships creates knowledge, not guilt or remorse. It is not indoctrination to receive an unvarnished account of the progression of women’s and civil rights or learning that race is a social construct with no scientific merit.
It was illegal to educate slaves due to the fear of exposing fallacies of racial superiority. Despite the legal end of slavery and Constitutional guarantees (13th, 14th, and 15th amendments), Jim Crow laws and overt discrimination kept non-whites as second-class citizens, including limited access to education.
Students should know that white resentment triggered race riots across the country when Jack Johnson beat a white boxer (1910), destruction by white mobs of affluent black communities in Tulsa (1921) and Rosewood (1923) and bitterness from white players and fans as Black players were integrated into Major League baseball.
Effects of racism and bigotry have not been limited to Black Americans. Students should understand the systematic destruction of the Native American population and culture, and comprehend prejudice and hatred against those with Asian and Jewish backgrounds, and conflicts over religious beliefs.
Ironically, it is now illegal in some states (but not Nevada, fortunately), to teach some of the content in the three previous paragraphs. “Enola Gay” scrubbed from the picture of the plane that dropped the first atomic bomb on Japan. Really? Should the identity label “WASP” be back en vogue?
Viewpoint diversity on college and university campuses need not include opinionated nonsense; just rational, evidence-based discussions without invented facts lacking no causal relationships. Emotional expressions based on race/ethnicity or hollow concerns about gender lack academic worth.
Competence and merit cannot be determined when there is exclusion before consideration. DEI also includes accommodations for the disabled, pay equity, parental leave, having a job after the birth of a child, rejection of workplace harassment. Imagine public education without any DEI.
Is this assault on DEI warranted and will it improve student outcomes? The answer to both questions is no. So, what drives this backlash?
Described as lacking ethics and having inferior intellectual ability by his former cabinet members and government officials, the president’s push against DEI policies and practices should not be a surprise. He has exhibited life-long racist behavior and education has not always been kind to his followers.
From housing discrimination, calling for the death penalty for wrongly accused black teenagers, not wanting blacks to count money at his casinos, birther assertions against political opponents, claims of bias from a Mexican judge, Muslim bans, retweeting racist messages from white supremacists, stating white nationalists are “very fine people,” kneeling NFL players “shouldn’t be in the country,” and Haitian immigrants “all have aids,” suggesting that immigrants from Norway are superior to those from Africa and telling congresswomen of color they “should go back to the countries they came from.” This is only scratching the surface.
Reducing and eliminating DEI initiatives makes perfect sense politically. It protects a large part of his political base; undereducated white males who lack the talent and ambition to compete for positions in society. As the president declared after winning the Nevada Republican Presidential Caucus in 2016, “I love the poorly educated.”
President Lyndon B. Johnson once said, “If you can convince the lowest white man he’s better than the best colored man, he won’t notice you’re picking his pocket. Hell, give him somebody to look down on, and he’ll empty his pockets for you.” 
Johnson knew all too well the white grievance that seems to be driving part of our politics today. DEI backlash is just the latest version of what Johnson saw in the 1960’s.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Trump-and-mcmahon-in-oval-1024x710.jpg,,,2025-04-29 08:06:05.475916

So why did he take the New Jersey Monitor to the state Supreme Court over access to police records?,"Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop tells voters he wants to bring more transparency to Trenton. So why did he take the New Jersey Monitor to the state Supreme Court over access to police records? (Illustration by Alex Cochran for New Jersey Monitor/Fulop photo by Reena Rose Sibayan)When lawmakers proposed gutting the state’s public records access law last year, a surprising advocate for transparency came out against that push: Steve Fulop, the Democratic mayor of Jersey City and a 2025 candidate for governor.
I say surprising because when I covered Jersey City, the city and I often tussled over access to public records. Police reports, emails between city officials, architectural records, Fulop’s work schedule … name a public record and I probably got a “your request is denied” email from the Fulop administration about it.
But, hey, I welcome any and all transparency advocates, even bandwagon-jumpers.
So color me surprised that the Fulop administration and I will be facing off in court yet again, this time at the New Jersey Supreme Court on Tuesday as Jersey City argues that it simply must withhold records the New Jersey Monitor is seeking.
This time, the record is an internal affairs report we requested from the file of police Lt. Michael Timmins, who police say fired a gun at guests during an alcohol-fueled dispute at a party at his Sussex County home in 2019 (no one was injured). Timmins was initially charged with terroristic threats and possession of a weapon for unlawful purposes, a violation of the New Jersey Graves Act, which requires mandatory prison sentences for some gun crimes. But Timmins went through a pretrial diversionary program and was able to get details of his arrest expunged. Fancy that.
Police disciplinary records are not necessarily open for public inspection — but the state Supreme Court ruled three years ago that, under the state’s common law right of access, when the public’s interest in the records outweighs an officer’s confidentiality concerns, the records must be made public. I think when it comes to a cop who has a six-pack or more of beer and then fires a gun at civilians while off duty, the public’s interest in the department’s investigation of his conduct is more important than the cop’s privacy.
Another interesting fact about Timmins’ case: He was allowed to have his record expunged even though people charged with violating the New Jersey Graves Act are normally not given the option of pleading guilty to any non-Graves Act offenses. So Timmins gets a special deal and a slap on the wrist, and his expungement could give his bosses in Jersey City a chance to hide the details of his departmental discipline (Timmins was suspended for 19 days and lost another 71 days).
It’s not as if we don’t have evidence that Jersey City has already tried to hide the details of Timmins’ behavior. When the city published its annual list of officers who face discipline in 2021 but didn’t have to provide the officers’ names, it wrote about Timmins, “A member of this agency while off duty retrieved a firearm after consuming 6-8 beers. He negligently discharged a round from the firearm during a dispute.” When it later had to amend that report to include the officers’ names per a state directive, it amended it to, “Lt. Timmins negligently discharged a firearm while off duty and on his personal property.” Suddenly the city decided the public didn’t have to know Timmins had been drinking before firing his gun and that he fired it during a fight with someone.
The secrecy even extended to the lawsuit we filed about Timmins’ IA report — the city asked the trial court judge to seal all the records, so the filings in the case were, and remain, shielded from public view.
The city cannot be trusted to be honest about what happened with Timmins, so it’s up to us to find out, if the Supreme Court agrees.
Fulop campaign spokeswoman Emily Potoma disagreed with my argument that the case represents Fulop whistling a different tune on transparency than he does on the campaign trail.
“Both sides are seeking further clarity from the Supreme Court, as Jersey City prevailed at the trial court level, and that ruling was partially reversed by the Appellate Division. This is not an attempt to avoid accountability, it’s about ensuring that everyone is following the law,” Potoma said.
Except the city could have released these records back when we requested them in March 2022, before any expungement order had been issued and muddied the waters. Instead, it denied the request, moved to make all the legal briefings in our case secret, and, when it partially lost an appellate court ruling, asked the Supreme Court to weigh in. Hardly the actions of a transparency crusader.

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Rep. Daisy Berbeco: Protecting human rights means defending access to health care in Vermont.","This commentary is by Rep. Daisy Berbeco, D-Winooski, ranking member of the House Committee on Health Care and member of the House Discrimination Panel.In 2022, the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision overturned Roe v. Wade, dismantling nearly 50 years of legal precedent and stripping away a fundamental civil right. Vermont voters responded by passing Article 22 to enshrine the right to reproductive liberty in our state constitution and shortly after, passed our state’s landmark shield laws (Acts 14 and 15 in 2024) which also protect gender-affirming care. In Vermont, abortion and gender-affirming care remain safe, legal, and a personal decision made between a patient and their medical provider.Shield laws provide protection from tactics that are used to harass and harm those seeking and those providing gender-affirming or reproductive care. There are currently 23 states and the District of Columbia that have shield laws related to reproductive health care, and 17 states and the District of Columbia. have shield laws related to gender-affirming care. As national attacks on women and LGBTQ+ folks escalate, Vermont continues to stand on the right side of history with compassion, clarity, and strength. With the passage of S.28, we take the next critical step: tightening and strengthening our shield law protections to ensure they are clear, enforceable and resilient.Most importantly, S.28 protects privacy. It limits disclosure of health information that could be used to criminalize legally protected care, and it creates clear guardrails around what can be shared in public records and federal investigations. These provisions send a message to patients that they are not alone. They send a message to our care providers that we care for them, too.This legislation updates our shield laws to fill important technical gaps. It ensures that if a health care provider acts lawfully in another shield state, they are protected here in Vermont. For example, if it is legal to get an abortion in New York and a doctor provides that service there, as long as it is also legal in Vermont to do that, we will protect them when they are in Vermont under our shield law.S.28 also clarifies what constitutes unprofessional conduct, including deceptive advertising and service misrepresentation, and applies those standards across all professions. Health care delivery evolves, but we must maintain high-quality, accurate and equitable access to care. In a time when other states are actively criminalizing care, Vermont is doubling down on human rights. We are saying that your gender, your identity and your health care decisions should never make you a target. We are responding to a national narrative with a different story, one where dignity, autonomy and truth still matter.We are protecting the people who need them and the professionals who provide them. That is the kind of leadership Vermonters deserve — and that is why I support S.28. I urge the governor to sign it without delay.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Rep.

(Photo illustration by Scott Olson/Getty Images)The Trump administration this month scrapped a Biden-era proposal that would have required state Medicaid programs and allowed federal Medicare to pay for some GLP-1s for obesity treatments. Instead, state Medicaid programs will retain the choice of whether to cover the high-priced medications for their residents.
The drugs, which have historically been prescribed to diabetic patients, also help patients lose weight and have grown in popularity among doctors and patients. But they are generally too expensive for most people to afford without insurance.
While doctors and patient advocates say these drugs are critical to helping patients struggling with obesity and can save money in the long run by reducing comorbidities such as heart disease, others say the medications are just too expensive for most states to afford. More than a dozen state Medicaid programs have opted to cover GLP-1s for obesity treatment, and the proposed Biden rule would have asked all states to figure out how to pay for them. But now, advocates fear these drugs may continue to be out of reach for many.
“It’s unfortunate that they’re excluding a whole class of medications that seem to have a tremendous number of health benefits to patients,” Dr. Nicholas Pennings, chair of family medicine at Campbell University in Buies Creek, North Carolina, said in an interview.
GLP-1s, which stand for glucagon-like peptide-1, are a class of drugs that balance blood sugar levels. They’ve long been prescribed to patients with Type 2 diabetes. But since the drugs also curb hunger signals, doctors may prescribe these drugs — including popular brands Wegovy and Ozempic — to help patients lose weight.
Medicaid is a joint federal-state funded program that mostly serves people with lower incomes under the age of 65 or who have a disability. The federal Medicare program focuses primarily on people above the age of 65, no matter their income.
How and whether to cover expensive treatments and drugs can be a significant deliberation for state Medicaid directors. In North Carolina, where 70% of people struggle with being overweight or obese, officials opted to begin covering the drugs for weight loss last year. That coverage has been a game changer, said Pennings, who continues to treat Medicaid patients.










I think that’s just part of the inherent bias towards the treatment of people with obesity, feeling like it’s cheating or not necessary.


– Dr. Nicholas Pennings, chair of family medicine, Campbell University


“They are expensive, but there’s a lot of other medications that are expensive too. Why is it that obesity medications and diabetes medications are being selected out?” Pennings said. “I think that’s just part of the inherent bias towards the treatment of people with obesity, feeling like it’s cheating or not necessary.”
The list price for Wegovy is around $1,300 per month, and for Ozempic, around $1,000. Even so, the skyrocketing popularity of these drugs has prompted at least 14 state Medicaid departments to begin covering these drugs to treat obesity in the past decade.
In addition to North Carolina, those states include California, Delaware, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Virginia, and Wisconsin.
An annual survey of Medicaid directors from health policy research group KFF recently found that half of the 47 responding states not already covering the drugs were considering doing so.
‘Significant concerns’
In January, the National Association of Medicaid Directors told the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services that state Medicaid departments had “significant concerns over the fiscal impacts” of the Biden proposal to require coverage of GLP-1s, and “strongly recommend that CMS maintain the current state option to cover or not cover anti-obesity medications.”
But others say covering the drugs will yield long-term savings.
John Cawley, a professor of economics and public policy at Cornell University who has studied the economic impacts of obesity, has found that obesity essentially doubles a person’s annual health care costs due to comorbidities such as heart disease, fatty liver disease, and kidney disease.
He’s found that weight loss among those with extreme obesity, with a BMI of 40 or higher, can yield substantial reductions in medical care costs.
Cawley added that state Medicaid programs “have a lot of flexibility” in ensuring costs don’t get out of control, by, for example, covering a newly available generic version of GLP-1s, requiring prior authorization, and asking patients to try behavioral programs before getting a prescription.
North Carolina’s Medicaid department began covering GLP-1s for obesity in August. The state has been able to afford GLP-1 coverage by negotiating rebates, or discounts, with drug manufacturers, and by getting the federal government to cover some costs. Department leaders think lowering obesity will save the state money in the long run, said Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for North Carolina Medicaid.
He said that one of the benefits of Medicaid is that “we get to choose, as a state, where we want to make kind of those extra investments or not.” He added that covering the medications could be potentially financially feasible for other states.
“Each program is different and has its own pressures. It would be welcome to be able to come together with other states to be able to negotiate broader deals,” Ludlam said. “If North Carolina is able to get a good deal, I don’t know why other states wouldn’t be able to participate in that.”
‘Shortsighted, bad policy’
In 2023, Connecticut enacted a law requiring Medicaid to cover obesity treatment services. The program began covering GLP-1s for weight loss, but costs were significant enough that the state told providers this year that it is now focusing on other obesity treatments instead.
Sean Scanlon, the Connecticut comptroller, said that not covering GLP-1s is “shortsighted, bad policy.” The state health plan, which takes care of teachers and other state employees, has been covering the drugs for weight loss since 2023. The plan controls costs by only prescribing GLP-1s after patients go through some online weight-loss counseling, said Scanlon.
“The most fiscally conservative thing we can do is give people tools that will save the taxpayers money in the long run,” he said in an interview. “And GLP-1 drugs are one of the best tools that we have to ensure that the taxpayers are not going to pay more money for the health care of hundreds of millions of people in the long run.”
It’s unclear whether the federal government will reverse course. In the past, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has recommended “three good meals a day” and behavioral changes rather than weight-loss medication.
But this month, Kennedy told CBS News he’s considering a regulatory framework to have Medicare and Medicaid cover these “extraordinary drugs” in the future, once their cost goes down.
“Ideally, over the long-term, we’d like to see those drugs available for people after they try other interventions,” Kennedy said.

(Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)There’s a battle at the Minnesota Legislature this session to defend environmental standards from attacks by industry.  A bipartisan group of Minnesota legislators recently attempted to repeal the environmental rules that protect wild rice and prohibit mine waste from polluting water by rushing a bill through a committee that has nothing to do with the environment. 
Then again, on Earth Day, another attempt was made to repeal these rules. But what was so breathtakingly cynical, so beyond the pale, was that both times legislators tried to sneak these significant environmental rollbacks through by attaching them to a critical extension of unemployment insurance for laid off mine workers.
This episode epitomizes how low some will go to advance their agenda, as well as the choice facing our Legislature this session: either defend Minnesota from polluters, or join in the push to give them what they want. Minnesota legislators need to know that reducing state environmental standards — especially in this perilous national moment — is a red line that nobody should cross. 
The unprecedented blizzard of terrible ideas coming out of Washington, D.C. to accelerate mining, logging and industrial development by reducing federal environmental standards is almost certain to have significant consequences for our state. Just in the past few weeks, we’ve seen executive actions to exempt coal burning power plants from regulations; allow mining and logging in and next to the Boundary Waters Wilderness; eliminate clean water standards on PFAS forever chemicals; and slash the federal workforce that enforces U.S. environmental law. It adds up to a staggering giveaway to corporations and billionaires that will harm Minnesota’s clean air, clean water and public health.  
One of the strongest defenses we have against these reckless federal rollbacks is our suite of state environmental laws, often described by industry lobbyists as among “the strongest environmental standards” in the nation. 
When it suits them, they point to those standards as the reason we should locate polluting industries in MInnesota, because surely they will protect our environment, they argue. “Trust the process,” they say. 
But their brazen attacks on these standards — through legislative gimmicks with little to no public involvement — reveal their true aim: to advance industrial proposals, even if it means eliminating protections for clean water. 
The state mining pollution standards they now want to repeal have been litigated all the way to the Minnesota Supreme Court, which struck down the copper-sulfide PolyMet permit because of them. Millions of public dollars and thousands of hours have gone into creating and defending these critical rules that protect clean water. 
With Lake Superior and the Boundary Waters in the crosshairs of the Trump administration, this outrageous attempt to gut state environmental standards should shock everybody and compel all Minnesota legislators who claim to care about the environment to double down on that commitment. 
Mining standards are not the only place they need to hold the line. The same crowd gleefully gutting federal environmental laws across the board in D.C. are engaged in a similar project here in Minnesota, just a bit more quietly. 
Industrial interests are also attempting to weaken Minnesota’s landmark PFAS legislation and 100%clean energy law; repeal our successful solar garden program; and give environmental workarounds and lucrative tax breaks to the billionaire tech companies who want our water and energy for new data centers. 
The Minnesota Legislature has big decisions ahead that will have a direct impact on people’s health now and decades into the future. For the sake of our children and grandchildren, let’s encourage Minnesota lawmakers to do the right thing and prioritize clean water, clean air and climate justice over corporate pressure and short-term profits. 
Our response in the next month is critical. If Minnesota doesn’t stand up and defend our state environmental laws, we could lose the places and values that define our state.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Refinery.jpg,,,2025-04-29 07:05:01.429924

Some of the standards Arkansas meets are class sizes of 20 children or fewer, at least one teacher per every 10 students, specialized pre-K training for teachers and “comprehensive, aligned, supportive, culturally sensitive” early learning and development standards, according to the National Institute for Early Education Research (NIERR), housed at Rutgers University.
Arkansas falls short in its early childhood education degree requirements and annual staff professional development, the report noted. Arkansas does not require all early childhood educators to hold bachelor’s degrees, and the state requires a minimum of 15 hours of professional development per year while the report says at least 30 should be required.
Arkansas ranked 31st nationwide in state spending on early childhood education during the 2023-24 school year, and its spending per student decreased while its enrollment of 3- and 4-year-olds in pre-K remained steady, according to NIERR’s nationwide analysis of state preschool programs released Tuesday.
The state’s preschool program, Arkansas Better Chance (ABC), serves children ages 3 and 4 from families earning up to 200% of the federal poverty level. ABC enrolled 20,311 children during the last school year, accounting for 19% of 3-year-olds and 32% of 4-year-olds statewide, according to the NIERR report.
While ABC enrollment increased by 1,063 children compared to the previous school year, overall spending decreased by more than $43 million, and spending per student decreased by $2,564, with those figures adjusted for inflation, the report states.
Federal funds helped Arkansas childcare providers stay afloat, but staffing struggles continue

Arkansas spends $2,016 less per student and nearly $41 million less overall than what the report considers “adequate” for its early childhood education landscape. The report defines adequacy as enough money to “support minimum quality standards and provide K-12 pay parity for preschool teachers within their current operating structures.”
The starting annual salary for Arkansas’ K-12 teachers increased from $36,000 to $50,000 in 2023 due to the wide-ranging LEARNS Act. This pay disparity between educators who teach 5-year-olds as opposed to 4-year-olds makes it challenging to maintain a robust pre-K workforce, early childhood education administrators told the Advocate in November 2023.
Arkansas has not implemented any “statewide initiatives or minimum set pay” to bolster the early childhood education workforce, which not only affects the overall quality of the system but also forces some preschool educators to rely on public assistance to meet their needs, Nicole Carey, policy director for Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, said in an interview Monday.
State spending per child enrolled in pre-K was at its lowest in nearly two decades during the 2023-24 school year, according to the NIERR report. Spending spiked during the COVID-19 pandemic but has since dropped, and it saw little change and no upward trend during most of the 2010s. Meanwhile, Arkansas’ rates of child enrollment in pre-K have returned to their pre-pandemic levels after decreasing in the early 2020s, according to the data.
“It would be great if we could have additional state investment in the ABC program, either toward educator wages or other types of workforce support,” Carey said.
Arkansas Democratic lawmakers introduced a bill this year that would have created a tax credit for early childhood educators, and a Republican-sponsored bill would have created a similar policy for “a licensed childcare provider.” Neither bill advanced.

Eleven states met nine or 10 of the NIERR standards, and none of those 11 states were “low spenders” because “money does matter for quality,” Steve Barnett, NIERR’s senior director and a co-author of the report, said in a virtual press briefing Friday.
Overall, Arkansas ranked 8th nationwide in 3-year-olds enrolled in pre-K, while 15 states do not have pre-K programs for 3-year-olds at all, according to the report. Arkansas ranked 24th in enrollment of 4-year-olds.
Additionally, 5% of 4-year-olds and 7% of 3-year-olds in Arkansas were enrolled in the federally-funded Head Start program in 2023-24, while 15% of 4-year-olds and 4% of 3-year-olds were enrolled in special education, the report states.
Arkansas has 28 Head Start locations statewide. Federal employees who administer Head Start have faced recent layoffs, but changes on the federal level have not impacted the program in Arkansas, said Leslie Taylor, spokesperson for Head Start’s Arkansas grantee, the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences.
The state Department of Education oversees the Office of Early Childhood, which was under the jurisdiction of the Department of Human Services before the LEARNS Act went into effect in 2023. The law also required “local lead” organizations throughout the state to assess local and regional access to pre-K and what gaps or barriers should be addressed.

The lawsuit is based on a video published by Project Veritas which depicts a man entering a Planned Parenthood clinic in Kansas City asking for help accessing abortion for his fictional underage niece.
Missouri Abortion Fund, a nonprofit that helps financially support Missourians who can’t afford the cost of abortion, is not a party in the case, nor is the group mentioned or depicted in the Project Veritas video. 
Despite that, the organization received a subpoena on March 19 from Bailey’s office demanding it turn over any records involving minors seeking abortions, including any communications with Planned Parenthood Great Plains.
Jess Lambrecht, executive director of Missouri Abortion Fund, said while the organization believes minors should have full access to abortion, Missouri laws prevent it. Missouri Abortion Fund also does not currently pay for travel or lodging for anyone seeking financial support for an abortion, she said.

Elad Gross, an attorney representing Missouri Abortion Fund, called the subpoena “an abuse of government power” and a “fishing expedition.” Gross ran unsuccessfully against Bailey for  attorney general last November. 
Turning over the requested documents would “impose significant burden, expense, annoyance and oppression” on the nonprofit, which is run by two full time and one part-time staff members, as well as a board of volunteers, Gross wrote in court filings.
The organization estimated it would take more than 2,900 hours to sort through the 35,000 records needed to fulfill the request. This would “substantially interfere with the day-to-day operations of Missouri Abortion Fund and impose heavy financial costs on the organization,” Gross wrote in a request that the judge quash the subpoena.
Assistant Attorney General Caleb Rutledge in court records accused Missouri Abortion Fund of “an abuse of discretion” for failing to turn over the documents in the 2-week timeline the attorney general’s office set.
At a hearing Monday, Boone County Judge J. Hasbrouck Jacobs temporarily halted Bailey’s attempt to get the Missouri Abortion Fund records. The issue has been tabled until a later date.
Lambrecht said while the judge’s decision brought some short-term relief, she still fears a financial burden in the long-term that ultimately “harms and hinders” Missourians who seek help getting abortions paid for. 
“We know that the AG’s office will stop at nothing to make accessing abortion impossible, if not exponentially difficult,” Lambrecht said after the hearing.
Jacobs on Monday also denied Planned Parenthood’s second request that the lawsuit be dismissed. 
At the crux of the case is an accusation by Bailey’s office alleging Planned Parenthood Great Plains, which oversees clinics in Kansas City and Columbia, is transporting minors out of state for abortions. 
The lawsuit was filed based on an undercover video filmed by a man affiliated with a right-wing group pretending to be the uncle of a 13-year-old in need of an abortion whose parents couldn’t know. 
The videos do not involve, reference or depict Missouri Abortion Fund.
Bailey filed the initial lawsuit in February 2024.

At a hearing last June, Planned Parenthood also asked that the judge dismiss the case on the merits that the video was “fictitious.” The judge denied the initial request.
Last November, Missourians narrowly voted to codify the right to reproductive health care, including abortion, in the state constitution. A few months later, Planned Parenthood again requested the judge drop the case. 
The video surrounding the lawsuit remains “heavily disputed and completely hypothetical,” Planned Parenthood attorney Eleanor Spottswood said Monday. But in light of the abortion-rights amendment passing, she argued, the issue should be dropped.
“Everything the state alleges Great Plains did is now protected explicitly by the Constitution,” she said.
Lawyers with the attorney general’s office argued Monday that the issue was still relevant, in part, because Amendment 3 couldn’t be applied retroactively. 
The AG’s office also argued that the state doesn’t believe the abortion-rights amendment lifted the state’s parental consent laws for minors seeking abortions. 
Jacobs ultimately agreed. 
“My concern is over the parental rights issue,” he said.
In the video filmed at the Kansas City clinic, the man secretly taping the interaction for Project Veritas told the Planned Parenthood employees the fictional girl’s parents couldn’t know about the abortion. Staff then directed him to their affiliate clinics in Kansas where they said he could “bypass” parental consent. 
When the man asked how often girls go out of state for abortions, the Planned Parenthood employee said it happens “every day.”
A spokesperson for Planned Parenthood Great Plains said last year that they do not provide any form of transportation directly to any patients, regardless of age or where they live. They also described the video, taken without staff’s knowledge, as “heavily doctored and edited.”
Missouri law, written prior to the state’s trigger law banning abortions going into place and prior to the reproductive-rights amendment passing two years later, states: “No one shall intentionally cause aid or assist a minor to obtain an abortion.”
Missouri doesn’t have explicit laws requiring parental consent for minors getting abortions in other states, nor does it prohibit minors from going to other states to get abortions.
The issue of parental rights is expected to be litigated at a future date.

Depending on what route the federal budget takes to reduce spending on the program, it could cost the state up to $16.8 billion over 10 years, according to the report from the Department of Health Services (DHS).
Medicaid — jointly  funded by the federal and state governments — provides health care coverage for low-income Wisconsinites as well as long-term care for elderly people and people with disabilities.
GOP leaders in the U.S. House of Representatives are looking for ways to cut $880 billion from programs under the supervision of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The budget plan hasn’t taken formal shape. Because Medicaid is the single largest program in the committee’s budget portfolio, however, “substantial impacts to Medicaid and other health programs are unavoidable,” the report states.
In Wisconsin Medicaid covers about 1 million Wisconsin residents up to the age of 65 for primary health care through BadgerCare Plus. It also covers long-term care for people with disabilities and the elderly under a variety of different programs. Medicaid covers 20% of state residents and 40% of births, along with 38% of Wisconsin children and 60% of state residents in nursing homes.
  Bill Hanna, Wisconsin Medicaid director
“Medicaid is an important part of our health care infrastructure,” said Wisconsin Medicaid Director Bill Hanna at a DHS press conference Monday.
One possibility the report considers is a cap on federal coverage for each Medicaid patient.
Currently the federal share is 60% of the health care costs incurred by Wisconsin Medicaid recipients, with the state paying the remaining 40%. “This arrangement allows state budgets to cope with unforeseen circumstances, such as economic downturns or faster-than-expected medical cost growth,” the DHS report states.
The report states that a per-person ceiling on Medicaid costs, which Congress is reportedly considering, “would squeeze state budgets and put Wisconsin taxpayers on the hook if medical costs rise quickly, with cuts to benefits and cuts to provider payments.”
Hanna said that there remains “a lot of unknowns” in how Congress might structure a payment system with a ceiling. The report considers various scenarios under a cap, including low, medium and high increases in health care costs.
Over 10 years, Wisconsin could lose anywhere from $6.4 billion to $16.8 billion, DHS projects.
Other Congressional proposals include adding higher barriers to Medicaid coverage — primarily through a work requirement.
Work requirements have long been found to eliminate eligible people from Medicaid because of the additional burden to demonstrate that they are eligible.
“Adding an additional burden for this population will certainly result in fewer people making it through, even if they are working, just struggling with the paperwork pieces,” Hanna said.
According to the report, Wisconsin Medicaid enrolled about 191,000 childless adults per month in late 2024. Nearly half of them would be exempt from a work requirement.
“It is unknown how many people would lose coverage simply because it would be difficult to report their hours or wages,” the report states. It calculates that about 52,000 people “would be at the highest risk for losing eligibility.”
Reducing the Medicaid rolls through a work requirement, however, will carry other costs, the report argues.
“It’s not like these people disappear,” Hanna said.  “They still need care that now they just won’t have the insurance [to cover]. Meaning hospitals again will be picking up additional costs, which gets passed on to all health care consumers.”
A third approach Congress is said to be considering would reduce the federal government’s share of the cost to run Medicaid programs. That could cost Wisconsin up to $93 million, the report finds.
While congressional leaders have pointed to data on “improper payments” in Medicaid in defense of cuts and say they’re targeting “waste, fraud and abuse,” Hanna said members of Congress are  conflating two sharply different issues.
“Improper payments are not fraud, waste and abuse,” Hanna said. “Improper payments are often documentation errors that can be for any number of reasons.”
Wisconsin’s last Medicaid audit — required every three years — found an improper payment rate of 0.5%, which was due to clerical errors.
“In Wisconsin, you’re definitely not going to find significant savings” in the form of ineligible people getting covered, he said. “We have a very robust system in Wisconsin with very few errors.”
Facing substantial federal reductions, the state has four policy options, Hanna said: putting in more state funds to keep the program the same; restricting eligibility, so there are fewer Wisconsinites covered; cutting some services that Medicaid now pays for; or cutting what Medicaid pays to doctors, hospitals and other providers.
If the state pays more, then it will have to raise taxes or divert funds from other priorities. But each of the alternatives has other consequences, Hanna said.
Cutting provider rates “would have major impacts on our state’s health care system,” the DHS report states, with hospitals offsetting those by charging other payers more.
If fewer people are eligible for Medicaid, the rate of uninsured people in Wisconsin will increase, potentially driving up health care costs as well.
“Uninsured rates going up means more uncompensated care” for hospitals and other health care providers, Hanna said.
Reducing the services that Medicaid covers, however, would likely mean that people put off getting health care until an illness or condition gets worse, he said — “which ultimately means we end up spending more.”

(Mia Maldonado/Idaho Capital Sun)This story was first published by InvestigateWest on April 25, 2025.
Sheriff’s deputies in a western Idaho county will soon be able to stop and interrogate any person they believe to be in the country without authorization.
In February, Owyhee County Sheriff Larry Kendrick signed his county up for an Immigration and Customs Enforcement program that was discontinued in 2012 following multiple instances of racial profiling from participating law enforcement agencies. After taking office earlier this year, President Donald Trump reinstated the program, which President Barack Obama had halted.

Under the program, called the 287(g) task force model, local police officers are trained to work as ICE agents, acting as a “force multiplier” for ICE, according to its website. Designated officers will be able to stop and question people they believe to be in the country illegally and process them for federal immigration violations if they are also arrested on state charges.
Trump has encouraged widespread participation from law enforcement agencies across the country to help enforce his mass deportation efforts. Idaho Gov. Brad Little also issued an executive order in February that asked local law enforcement agencies to consider entering into the 287(g) programs with ICE. 
The Owyhee County Sheriff’s Office is the first agency in Idaho to have this kind of task force agreement with ICE. It went into effect Feb. 19, according to a copy of the agreement obtained by InvestigateWest. But Kendrick said his officers have not gone through training or begun participating yet in the program. Owyhee County has just 12 full-time and two part-time deputies. Kendrick said a sergeant and two deputies will likely make up the task force.
Under the program, ICE pays for any new technology needed, but all other expenses will be paid by the sheriff’s office. That includes salaries, benefits, overtime and local transportation. Previous law enforcement agencies have ended agreements due to the added costs. 
The 287(g) program refers to Section 287(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act passed by Congress in 1996. The section authorizes ICE to tap state and local law enforcement officers for some components of immigration enforcement. 
Kendrick said the county’s participation in the federal program is mostly meant to acknowledge support for Trump in Owyhee County.
“My constituents are all very conservative, and I’m conservative,” he said. “I support Trump. I support his policies. So I joined to get on board with this simply because that is what my constituents expect. That’s just supporting the Trump administration, which I do very, very much.” 
But the program’s history of abuses concerns many immigration attorneys and advocates.
“I think it is going to reduce trust in the police, reduce the reporting of crimes,” said Nikki Ramirez-Smith, a partner and immigration attorney at Ramirez-Smith Law in Nampa. 
“Nobody’s going to want to talk. Because if you witness a crime where normally you would come forward and testify, are you really going to go talk to ICE? That’s like being sent into the ICE building. I think the police need some distance from ICE if they want to do police work, which is their job, is to work with victims and perpetrators.” 
 Advocates worry about racial profiling, distrust of law enforcement

Kendrick said the agreement doesn’t mean deputies will target people for immigration enforcement who aren’t already under investigation for criminal activity. He said it will allow officers to add immigration charges to people who are arrested for drug trafficking. 
“The purpose isn’t to go out and look for illegals,” Kendrick said, referring to people who are in the country without authorization. “Here’s the thing, we have three dairies in our county, and the dairies were here even before me, and, yeah, there’s probably some illegals working there, but we’re not after them. We’re after the bad guys.”
Attorneys like Smith-Ramirez worry agreements like this alone damage the department’s relationship with the community. 
“The current political climate of fear has led, already, to a level of distrust of law enforcement,” Smith-Ramirez said. “The police departments rely on relationships to get people to talk, to get people to report crimes, to get people to trust them. And doing something like this is counterproductive.” 
A study from Texas A&M University found that law enforcement agencies who had not signed 287(g) task force agreements — but were geographically close to another agency — were likely to engage in the same racial profiling that the participating agencies engaged in. The study found the state highway patrol in North Carolina and South Carolina were more likely to stop Latino drivers than white drivers. 
Research like that concerns Smith-Ramirez who said Owyhee County has a significant number of Latino farmworkers who she worries could be caught up in the system.
“Owyhee County has a huge farming population, which means you’ve got a lot of immigrant workers who are terrified to go to work,” she said. “They’re scared to leave the house. Their kids are scared for their parents to go outside or do anything. I think it’s only going to get worse once they start doing this.”
In 2011, a federal government investigation found that under the task force model, deputies in Arizona’s Maricopa County racially profiled Latino residents for immigration enforcement and conducted unlawful searches, detentions and arrests of Latinos. A year later, federal authorities found that deputies in North Carolina’s Alamance County, who also operated as task force agents under the 287(g) agreement, were unfairly arresting Latinos and had set up checkpoints in Latino neighborhoods and pulled over Latino drivers for traffic violations 10 times more often than non-Latino drivers. Both agencies had the 287(g) agreements revoked.
“If this is happening, I would be hesitant to report a crime myself,” said Neal Dougherty, partner and immigration attorney at Smith-Ramirez Law. “I would be hesitant to advise my clients to report crimes to the Owyhee sheriff if I thought they were operating as ICE.” 
 Other Idaho counties cooperate with ICE

While Owyhee is the only Idaho county with an agreement to be trained as ICE agents, a different kind of agreement under the 287(g) program can allow local jurisdictions to hold ICE detainees in jails and to serve immigration-related warrants. 
Both kinds of agreements under the 287(g) program have grown dramatically under Trump. According to reporting from the Markup, 133 law enforcement agencies in 21 states had a form of the 287(g) agreement before the election. Earlier this month, 300 agencies in 38 states had them. 
In Idaho, three counties have the 287(g) agreements to hold ICE detainees or serve immigration warrants: Owyhee County, Power County and Gooding County. The Gooding and Power agreements have been in place since 2020. It is unclear if any other counties in Idaho will join the 287(g) program.
Even without formal agreements, some sheriffs in Idaho have defined their own process for immigration enforcement. In Kootenai County, as InvestigateWest previously reported, deputies shared the immigration statuses of people who they encountered who were not being investigated for any state crimes.  
Idaho State Police Lt. Col. Fritz Zweigart said during a media briefing that the state police have been looking into the task force model, but “right now, we’re working so well with our federal partners that we don’t necessarily need to sign into a written agreement.”
Immigration enforcement is the sole duty of the federal government, according to a U.S. Supreme Court ruling, and local police may assist under federal direction. Without a 287(g) agreement, it is illegal for local police to serve federal immigration warrants and to investigate people’s immigration statuses.
Gov. Little has encouraged more coordination with ICE under 287(g). 
“To the fullest extent of the law, all State agencies with law enforcement … authority must consider formal procedures and agreements to assist the federal government in the enforcement of immigration law, including agreements under Section 287(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act,” his executive order said.

The draft four-year plan for Western lands proposes developing natural resources for American prosperity.
The post Leaked federal roadmap for public land called ‘industry wish list’ appeared first on WyoFile .","As the Department of the Interior develops a plan to “restore American prosperity” by exploiting Western natural resources, a Wyoming attorney who has steeled rural communities against federal policies is atop the hierarchy that will marshal the effort.
Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum last month appointed Karen Budd-Falen as temporary deputy secretary and his senior advisor. As the department fleshes out a four-year strategic plan to use natural resources across 19.9 million acres of national parks and Bureau of Land Management property in Wyoming, Budd-Falen will be in the Interior’s second-highest position.
A draft of the four-year Interior plan leaked to Public Domain outlines department objectives for prosperity, security and recreation. Conservationists have decried elements they say would dismantle environmental safeguards, turn over federal property, promote energy development and favor rural communities over nationwide interests.
“It is irresponsible for a media outlet to publish a draft document.” Department of the Interior
The Interior Department last week blasted the leak and called its publication “irresponsible.”
“It is beyond unacceptable that an internal document in the draft/deliberative process is being shared with the media before a decision point has been made,” Interior’s press office wrote WyoFile on Thursday. “Not only is this unacceptable behavior, it is irresponsible for a media outlet to publish a draft document.
“We will take this leak of an internal, pre-decisional document very seriously and find out who is responsible,” the statement reads.
The draft plan, which the agency said is “not final nor ready for release,” sets four goals and several objectives to accomplish them. Interior’s drafted goals are to restore American prosperity, ensure national security through infrastructure and innovation, and allow sustainable enjoyment of natural resources. It would do all that through the fourth goal — collaboration with states, tribes and local governments.
American prosperity
The draft plan to restore American prosperity would use American energy to “lower… costs and increases affordability.” But it includes elements that worry conservationists who fear damage to Interior agencies including the National Park Service, BLM, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Bureau of Indian Affairs.
The plan would “deregulate” to increase “clean coal” production and oil and gas drilling. It would streamline the National Environmental Policy Act, a law designed to safeguard the environment. And it would reduce the cost of grazing, which critics say is already too low.

The draft would “release federal holdings” — divest Americans of their public property — to allow states and communities to reduce housing costs. Interior would support agriculture and increase revenues from logging, non-energy mining, and grazing. The draft treats natural resources as assets, viewing federal holdings for the economic value that can be derived from them.
The leaked document “reads like an industry wish list,” the Center for Western Priorities said in a statement. It includes “a thinly veiled reference to the seizure and sale of public lands,” according to the conservation group.
The draft treats the West’s natural resources “as nothing more than numbers on a balance sheet,” Western Priorities Executive Director Jennifer Rokala said in a statement. In the plan, those resources are “products to be sold off and exploited to help pay for tax cuts for Elon Musk and Trump’s fellow billionaires,” she said.
“It resembles a business plan from a desperate CEO, not a framework to steward public lands for the benefit of all Americans,” Rokala’s statement reads.

To her post, Budd-Falen brings years of experience fighting for ranchers and other public land users and developers. The federal government has been a frequent adversary, but so has Western Watersheds Project, another conservation group that focuses on public land grazing.
She represented a group of ranchers who sued Western Watersheds for trespassing when a field worker collected water to test for pollution caused by grazing. She advised rural counties to adopt land use plans they could leverage when contesting federal programs on public land in their areas. She also represented stock growers who sided against four Missouri hunters who corner crossed to hunt public land on Elk Mountain in Carbon County. She represented the Cliven Bundy family and others as they fought grazing reductions imposed after Las Vegas developers were permitted to occupy desert tortoise habitat. That family later became infamous for armed standoffs with federal officials over use of public land.
Conservation measures
The draft plan includes numerous other elements like supporting law enforcement, disseminating science and managing lands to reduce wildfire risk. It would reduce the federal infrastructure footprint and ensure public lands meet visitors’ needs. The draft envisions clean and adequate amounts of water.
Interior would restore historic names, some of which have been changed to recognize indigenous monikers or demote racist figures. The department would “right size” national monuments, according to the draft.

A goal to “enjoy our natural resources while ensuring they remain sound and sustainable,” includes a variety of conservation measures, according to the draft. Species and natural resources would be protected and ecosystems would be healthy and balanced, the draft said. Progress could be measured by the number of species taken off threatened and endangered lists, according to the draft.
Abandoned mines and wells would be cleaned up, the draft proposes. The department would support co-management of its properties with “local stakeholders and tribes,” the draft states.
Burgum appointed Budd-Falen “to facilitate the prompt and effective accession of the Trump administration’s leadership team,” his order states. She will serve until the Senate confirms high Interior Department personnel appointed by President Trump, but no longer than through May 31.
The timeline for public engagement is from May 16 to July 18, with publication, or final adoption, set for Oct. 1. The strategic plan is a “bold, outcome-driven roadmap for how we deliver impact to the American people,” the draft states.

Wyoming Congresswoman distorts deportation case and taunts detractors in Buffalo, columnist Kerry Drake opines. 
The post Truth is a casualty of Hageman’s town halls appeared first on WyoFile .","Safety was the reason Wyoming Congresswoman Harriet Hageman said she put the brakes on her town hall road show a month ago in favor of virtual events.

Opinion

But when she returned in person in Buffalo last Thursday, the truth was the only thing that seemed to be in danger. Hageman, an attorney, was called out by members of the audience for telling an outrageous whopper about a deportation case, then doubling down on her false claims.
The incident demonstrated there’s nothing Hageman won’t do to defend President Donald Trump in his war against the federal judiciary and the rule of law. It also showed the political peril we’re in, when truth is continually distorted by the MAGA movement Hageman embraces.
Because of new rules that limited who could attend, Buffalo’s Bomber Mountain Civic Center was a much friendlier environment than Hageman experienced March 19 in Laramie, when many in the crowd of about 500 booed, cursed and heckled her.
Two hundred people with reservations to the Buffalo town hall signed up through Hageman’s office, according to Cowboy State Daily. No one could directly ask a question live, but queries were handwritten and placed in a box. 
The most contentious moment came after Hageman pulled out a question about whether she would pressure the Trump administration to do what the U.S. Supreme Court said it must: return a wrongfully deported Maryland man to the U.S.
The high court unanimously ruled Abrego Garcia should get the hearing he was denied before federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers sent him to a notorious prison in El Salvador.
Many in the crowd erupted in protest when Hageman bluntly said no. They asked why there was no due process in Garcia’s case.
The administration initially admitted to a lower court that Garcia’s deportation was due to an “administrative error.” An immigration judge ruled in October 2019 that Garcia, who had entered the country illegally as a teen, had “a well-founded fear” of persecution by a gang in El Salvador that had been extorting his family for years. The judge granted Garcia protection from being deported.
“First of all, [Garcia] was given due process,” Hageman said, which was met by shouts of “no.” She continued: “He went in front of two different immigration judges [who] ruled that he was a member of [the gang] MS-13. That’s due process.” 
But she inaccurately stated what happened. Garcia was detained by police after they saw him and three other men allegedly “loitering” outside a Home Depot store. Because of his clothing, tattoos and a confidential informant’s claim he was a MS-13 member, Garcia was taken into custody in 2019 by ICE.
The judges Hageman referred to both denied Garcia bail, because of the gang allegations, which remain unproven. He’s never been charged with a crime, despite Trump’s sensational claims he’s a convicted human trafficker and wife-beater. After a third judge ordered that Garcia not be deported, ICE did not appeal and he returned to his wife, a U.S. citizen, and their three children.
Hageman jumped headfirst into the rabbit hole dug by Trump and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, who contend the Supreme Court didn’t order Garcia’s return.
“In fact, they reversed the district court and said [it] used the word ‘facilitate’ [his return],” Hageman argued. “I have never heard of a writ of facilitation, but oh well.”
In fact, the high court used the word when it unanimously found the lower court’s order “properly requires the Government to ‘facilitate’ Abrego Garcia’s release from custody in El Salvador and to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador.”
After trying to make her phony case that Garcia did receive due process, a  term the lawyer of course understands, Hageman’s next words were truly stunning.
“And as far as due process, I’m not sure what you are talking about or what you mean by due process,” she said, with a straight face. This wasn’t a case of legal amnesia, but an example of what earned Hageman such 
a hostile response in Laramie by taunting and dismissing her critics.
“Are you kidding me?” a woman yelled over the noise of the crowd.
Hageman stumbled. “Yes, no I’m not,” she said.
“You’re a lawyer!” the woman said.
“Yes, I am. Due process is notice and an opportunity to be heard, and he was given notice and an opportunity to be heard,” Hageman said.
No. After being given a temporary visa and work permit, Garcia spent five years in a construction apprenticeship program before being pulled over by ICE officers in Baltimore last month. He was told his immigration status had changed, and was then arrested and transferred to jails in three states before being flown with other deportees to CECOT prison in El Salvador. Like many inmates he was held in brutal conditions, never given a hearing, and believed he’d be held indefinitely.
Trump wants to keep it that way, and judging by Hageman’s responses in Buffalo, she’s perfectly OK with that. To her it’s justice.
But due process of law is much more than Hageman’s simplistic definition at her town hall. It’s a fundamental principle in the legal system that ensures fairness and justice. It serves as a safeguard against arbitrary denial of life, liberty or property by requiring adherence to established legal procedures. 
This concept is crucial for upholding individual rights and maintaining public confidence in the judicial process. Thanks in large part to Hageman and U.S. Sens. John Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis, who support Trump’s continued defiance of the federal judiciary, confidence in the legal process is very low in Wyoming these days.
More than 100 Wyoming jurists warned the delegation in a March 26 letter that Trump and his allies’ threats could erode the country’s rule of law.
These distinguished members of the Wyoming Bar — including a former governor and three ex-Wyoming Supreme Court justices — were insultingly called “biased, misguided” and “liberal” by Barrasso, Lummis and Hageman in a press release. The delegation said federal judges are the problem, not the president.
But as more news about Garcia’s shameful treatment comes out, it shines a bright light on Hageman’s cruel defense of Trump’s refusal to bring him home. The U.S. is paying El Salvador $6 million to keep more than 230 alleged gang members, including Garcia, who was recently transferred to a lower security prison because of his high profile.
It’s a nasty game Trump is playing in cahoots with El Salvador’s dictator, Nayib Bukele, over Garcia’s fate. Using a ridiculously narrow definition of “facilitate,” AG Bondi said, “We would facilitate [his release], meaning provide a plane.”
But Bukele vows to hold Garcia in prison forever, and Trump says he’s a terrorist who will never again set foot on American soil.  
On Friday, however, The Atlantic broke the story that U.S. officials were actively trying to bring Garcia home before their plans were blocked by Trump, who suddenly saw Garcia’s plight as a major political win in his fight with the courts over his deportation agenda.
The State Department puzzled over the sketchy evidence tying Garcia to a gang. Officials worried about his safety in prison where he could be targeted for attack. All of these concerns are valid.
Hageman didn’t need to throw Garcia, who has endured suffering for weeks and had his rights violated at Trump’s hands, under the bus. But it was red meat for her base, which can never get enough stories about how this president is supposedly leading the fight against crime.
But the truth matters, and so does the rule of law. How can we protect both when officials like Hageman turn a blind eye to justice?
Keep asking her hard questions at town halls and then vote her out of office.

Earlier this month, agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Drug Enforcement Agency and FBI appeared at the Milwaukee County Courthouse with an administrative warrant to arrest Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, a 30-year-old Mexican immigrant accused of misdemeanor battery, and scheduled for an appearance in Dugan’s courtroom. 
An administrative warrant is not signed by a judge and does not allow agents to enter private spaces to make an arrest like a judicial warrant would. While the agents sat in the hallway outside the courtroom, Dugan told Flores-Ruiz and his attorney to use a side door. The door exits into the same public hallway and one agent rode the same elevator down to the lobby as Flores-Ruiz and his lawyer. Agents let Flores-Ruiz leave the building and then arrested him on the street. 
Last week, FBI agents appeared at the courthouse again to arrest Dugan. She’s been charged with obstructing justice and harboring an individual, both felony counts. Soon after her arrest, and before she had made her initial appearance in front of a judge, President Donald Trump’s Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel were discussing the case on social media and television, accusing Dugan of being “deranged.” 
Bondi said on Fox News Friday that the charges were filed against Dugan to show the administration was willing to go after anyone, even judges, if they get in the way of their efforts to deport millions of people. Bondi said interfering with ICE agents “will not be tolerated.” 
“What has happened to our judiciary is beyond me,” Bondi said. “The [judges] are deranged is all I can think of. I think some of these judges think that they are beyond and above the law. They are not, and we are sending a very strong message today … if you are harboring a fugitive… we will come after you and we will prosecute you. We will find you.”
From the beginning, the case displayed many missteps in an effort to show force and draw attention, says Stephen Kravit, a former Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. 
“It looks like these prosecutors are completely co-opted in Trump World and aren’t really using very good judgment. You should just look at the facts and law, and there’s just no chance they’ll be able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Judge Dugan was corruptly intending to avoid a government subpoena, or that she was harboring a fugitive,” he says, calling the charges “crap.”
During the initial arrest of Flores-Ruiz, Kravit questions why DEA and FBI agents are appearing at the courthouse for immigration enforcement actions and why so many agents were needed to serve an administrative warrant. 
“It’s bad for justice on any level. They had six agents there, six to make an unarmed collar of a person who was accused of battery to his roommate,” Kravit says. “And they know he’s not armed. And there’s six of them. Two of them are DEA agents. Those are two agents not enforcing drug laws, which is what they’re charged to do. There’s no drugs involved here, OK? Two of them are FBI agents, who have 100 other different things to do. We probably only have six or seven DEA agents in the state.”
Kravit adds that the whole situation might have gone differently if ICE had gotten a warrant to arrest Flores-Ruiz from a judge rather than one “written by some guy in the office” and it’s going to be difficult for prosecutors to prove Dugan had a corrupt intent by sending Florez-Ruiz out the side door when she could have just been avoiding a “ruckus” outside her door while she’s trying to move on with the court schedule. 
He also takes offense with the way Dugan was “perp walked” out of the courthouse when she could have just been asked to turn herself in; questions why federal prosecutors didn’t bring the case to a grand jury first — which would have been the standard process — and why the country’s most powerful justice officials are discussing the case on cable news. 
“The arrest warrant for the judge is a travesty, but there’s so much reasonable doubt,” he says. “Was she corruptly trying to interrupt a government proceeding? Corruptly? Was somebody paying her money? No, or was she harboring a fugitive? That’s what she’s charged with. Did she harbor a fugitive on any set of facts that you can imagine? That’s what she’s charged with. These are serious felonies. They ruin the woman’s life and all so that Pam Bondi could make a press statement.”
Dugan’s arrest, and the attention her case has brought to ICE operating at county courthouses could have a chilling effect on Wisconsin’s justice system, Jeff Mandell, executive director of Law Forward, says. 
“I do think that there’s a chilling effect to having federal officials prowling a state courthouse to make arrests and absent real danger or exigent circumstances, it feels like that’s not a good thing,” Mandell says. “We want people in our communities to be willing and able to show up in court. We want those people to know that they can do so without feeling like they’re getting entrapped or something like that, and that’s in all of our interests.” 
For immigrants, undocumented or not, appearing in court for any reason now is a fraught decision, which could lead to witnesses to crimes not showing up to testify, Mandell says. 
“If you were just going about your day and something happened to you and this person was a witness, and you needed them to help sort things out in court and things like that, then you know, you didn’t choose your witnesses,” he says.” You didn’t decide who was going to be standing there when you were in an accident or some other misfortune befell you.” 
ICE’s focus on arresting people making court appearances puts those criminal defendants — who have not yet been convicted of a crime — in the position to decide between showing up to court and potentially being picked up by ICE or skipping their court date. Last week, the Wisconsin public defender’s office sent an email to private defense attorneys across the state advising them how to deal with clients asking about ICE operations in courthouses. 
“Explain to the client the consequences of not showing to court like you would to any client,” the email states. “Remember you cannot tell a client not to come but you can explain that ICE has been coming to courthouses and that it may no longer be a safe haven.” 
Mandell says the operations in courthouses and Dugan’s arrest are emblematic of the Trump administration’s worst impulses. 
“I think it reinforces what we’re seeing through day 98 of the administration, what we’re seeing in all kinds of ways in this administration, which is an impatience, a heedlessness, a recklessness, a disregard for norms,” he says. “That many of these folks seem to believe there’s one set of rules for them and a different set of rules for someone else.” 
“So they want respect paid to federal officials, but they are going to trample on state institutions and state officials,” he continues. “They want everyone to follow the law, but they are going to play fast and loose and cut corners, whether that’s using administrative warrants, whether that is avoiding grand juries to bring federal charges.” 
Mandell adds that when Trump was charged with felonies, he was given the privilege of turning himself in to be booked. 
“They want all of the trappings of tremendous respect for their offices, but they are not going to afford even a modicum of respect to others,” Mandell continues, “which we see handcuffing and perp walking Judge Dugan out of the courthouse without even the common courtesy of a phone call to ask if she might be willing to turn herself in, which, of course, is how the President himself insisted on all of his bookings being handled.”

Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, is collecting Idahoans’ opinions on affordable housing through a survey.
The survey is meant to inform Crapo about common issues to possibly consider legislation, the senator’s office announced in a news release in March. In 2014 and 2015, the senator’s veterans’ surveys led Crapo to introduce legislation that became law, his office said. 
“A lack of affordable housing is the number one issue Idahoans raise with my staff and me in meetings across the State,” Crapo said in a prepared statement.  “Idaho is far from alone in this nationwide challenge, but Idahoans can be a key part in piecing together the housing puzzle as I continue to work to find collaborative solutions to this issue. I invite any Idahoan to complete the survey and share as much detail as they are willing and able to provide.”
For two years in a row, Idahoans have listed workforce and affordable housing as their overall top budget priority for the Idaho Legislature, according to the annual Idaho Public Policy Survey by Boise State University. Almost a third of Idahoans, 32%, listed the issue as their top state legislative budget priority. Nearly half of Idahoans, 49%, reported feeling financially strained by housing costs, the survey found.
Crapo’s affordable housing survey, available online, is open through May 31.
The survey is intended to hear feedback from homeowners, renters, insurance brokers, bankers, realtors, government officials and general contractors, Crapo’s office said.

Robin Smith, shown with members of her legal team, testified for the prosecution Monday in a federal corruption trial. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)The prosecution’s chief witness in Tennessee’s political corruption case testified Monday the identities of former House Speaker Glen Casada and his ex-chief of staff had to be “masked” because of their connection to a racist and sexist texting scandal.
On the trial’s fifth day, former state Rep. Robin Smith of Hixson explained how she, Casada and Cade Cothren met at a Nashville bar in October 2019 to plan the formation of Phoenix Solutions, a shadowy company that printed and sent out constituent mailers for lawmakers without their knowledge of who ran it. Smith, who pleaded guilty to honest services fraud in 2022 and is cooperating with federal prosecutors in the kickback case against Casada and Cothren, described the state’s postage and printing program for lawmakers as “low-hanging fruit” because it would be an instant way to make money. House members receive $3,000 in state funds to send out surveys and informational mailers, both of which must receive approval from the Speaker’s office and the director of legislative administration.
Cothren formed Phoenix Solutions in early November 2019 through the New Mexico Secretary of State’s office and created a registered agent, a method that would enable them to “mask identities” of Casada and Cothren, just months after they resigned their posts because of the texting scandal that broke open in the spring of 2019.
Smith explained that politicians are “acutely aware and sensitive” about their associates and want to maintain the “halo effect.” Thus, they had to keep Casada’s and Cothren’s connections to Phoenix Solutions secret to do business with Tennessee lawmakers.

“It was understood that I would be the least suspicious of the three to approach lawmakers,” Smith said of the business arrangement. “I was the only one that didn’t have a radioactive halo around me.”
She added that Casada “did not understand the toxicity of the scandal.”
Smith said the arrangement called for her and Casada to receive a portion of the money lawmakers spent with Phoenix Solutions based on the number of clients they brought to the company. Ultimately, lawmakers spent about $52,000 with the company from the postage and printing accounts.
A former chairman of the Tennessee Republican Party, Smith played a role in Republicans taking the majority from Democrats and then winning a supermajority. Smith described herself as a “den mother” and said she came up with the name “Phoenix” from reading the Bible and Greek mythology and felt Casada and Cothren had gone through “public scrutiny” and, similarly to the mythical bird, would be rising “from the ashes.”
Smith testified after Nick Crawford, a lobbyist with Capitol & 5th Public Strategies who initially handled work done by Phoenix Solutions and its bogus agent, Matthew Phoenix, while he worked as a House Republican Caucus adviser for Chairman Jeremy Faison.
Crawford, the first person to receive a phony W-9 form signed by Matthew Phoenix, said he thought it might have been signed by a computer. He also said he was never able to speak with Matthew Phoenix by telephone or text message, only by email.
Smith pleads guilty to wire fraud connected to shadowy campaign vendor

Smith approached Crawford about directing business to Phoenix Solutions, and he recommended the company to Republican Rep. Jay Reedy of Erin and Republican Rep. Tim Rudd of Murfreesboro because he trusted Smith, who had been a key player in state politics for several years, Crawford said.
In an email, Smith said to Crawford and Cothren, “be introduced.”
Crawford, who was aware of the sexist and racist texting scandal, testified he wouldn’t have recommended Phoenix Solutions if he had known who was running it.
Smith was running a political consulting firm called River’s Edge Alliance when she won election to the House in 2018. After Casada left the speakership following a no-confidence vote by the Republican Caucus, he started Right Way Consulting.
Casada continued to serve in the House, and Smith had been named a committee chairman when the FBI raided them in January 2021. She resigned from the chairmanship, then decided to cooperate with federal authorities instead of misleading them.
Smith told the jury she repented to her pastor and family, then talked to federal agents, and added her goal is to “tell the truth” in hopes of receiving a “favorable sentence.”

In 2015, about 23% of local governments that responded to University of Michigan researchers’ Michigan Public Policy Survey, or MPPS, reported that their local law enforcement used body cameras. In the 2024 survey that recently was released, 77% of local governments reported local law enforcement agencies were utilizing body cameras.
Stark increases in dashboard cameras and public surveillance cameras between 2015 and 2024 were found in the MPPS too, as well as an increase in the usage of drones to 31% of jurisdictions, compared to 3% of the state’s jurisdictions in 2015.

MPPS-Spring-2024-Technology-Final 
Several local law enforcement agency heads have offered testimony to lawmakers considering additional funding for public safety in the state budget at the moment, explaining the demand for improved technology when it comes to law enforcement.
As public trust in law enforcement has been a large conversation in recent years, with Michigan no exception, demand for tools to preserve accountability is high, said Rep. Mike Harris (R-Waterford) earlier this month after the state house approved the additional funding for public safety. 
“If we’re going to hold our officers to a high standard and expect them to do professional policing, we have to be willing to invest,” said Harris, who served in law enforcement for more than 20 years in Michigan.
The police surveillance footage of 26-year-old Patrick Lyoya, an immigrant from the Congo being fatally shot by former Grand Rapids police officer Christopher Schurr in 2022 is circulating again this week as the trial for Schurr, who is charged with second-degree murder, begins. The footage caused public outcry for accountability for Lyoya’s death back in 2022, similar to the police killings of George Floyd in 2020 and Daunte Wright in 2021.
But while there have been clear increases in usage of surveillance by law enforcement and appetite for surveillance technology by the public, in terms of accountability, when it comes to usage of artificial intelligence technology in that sector, law enforcement and local government leaders have concerns.
About a third of leaders of local law enforcement agencies report that their departments have adopted or intend to adopt artificial intelligence or predictive technology, according to the 2024 MPPS.
Newer technology like automated license plate readers and facial recognition technology are not widely used, with 26% of agencies saying they use license plate readers and 10% reporting they use facial recognition. Only 3% of agencies said they used artificial intelligence or other predictive tools.
“AI is still in a bit of a Wild West phase,” Debra Horner, senior project manager on the survey said in a statement. “However, over a third of sheriffs and police chiefs saying they are currently using or soon to adopt predictive tools for policing and around half of prosecutors saying they at least somewhat trust AI or other automated applications for certain applications. That suggests it is a good time for the state of Michigan and individual local governments to consider developing formal regulations around transparent and responsible use of AI in law enforcement.”
The MPPS conveyed that there was interest from different levels of the criminal justice system in utilizing AI with 50% of elected county prosecutors who responded to the survey stating that at least somewhat trust AI applications that work to identify high-risk neighborhoods.
However, 66% of those county prosecutors said they were unsure if predictive policing tools made more or less accurate assessments than human-created assessments and 59% of the responding sheriffs felt the same way.
Alarm bells have also been rung by stakeholders, such as the Michigan Department of Civil Rights, or MDCR, who believe some automated technology has been programmed with racial biases across different fields, with some research reflecting that facial recognition technologies lead to disproportionate arrests of Black people.
“…all law enforcement agencies in the State of Michigan should review their current and future uses of Artificial Intelligence policing tools to determine their efficacy and tendencies to perpetuate, incorporate or facilitate bias and discrimination,” said a 2024 resolution by the MDCR.
Ferris State University Professor Greg E. Gogolin, who created the undergraduate Artificial Intelligence degree at the school, told the Michigan Advance that Michigan is not adequately creating a workforce prepared to best utilize AI or compete with other country’s expertise.
Many companies and industries want to jump on the “AI bandwagon” but few have taken into consideration that there isn’t significant investment into educating workers in this emerging technology, Gogolin said.
In the few higher education programs in Michigan that permit focuses in AI, Gogolin said many of those taking the courses are international students who will benefit industries in country’s abroad. However, he says if the state of Michigan wants law enforcement and other sectors to be versed in AI tools, it has to start with education and also an entire infrastructure to accommodate the technology.
Security on the data from the AI technology is another major concern point, Gogolin said. Michigan’s legislature is currently facing the task of legislating cyber crimes utilizing AI and the state currently doesn’t have a criminal justice system best equipped to handle the prosecution of such breaches so there is a lot of room for improvement to foster an environment prepared for AI.
Expecting law enforcement agencies to quickly be able to masterfully use AI would be similar to handing officers firearms without significant training, Gogolin said. 
“We’re not even training our own citizens, right? Expertise is growing much, much faster outside the United States,” Gogolin. “Something has to change very, very soon. Or we’re going to be so far beyond the ticking point that we’re never going to be able to catch up.”

(Photo courtesy of Richard Prodgers)The Alliance for the Wild Rockies and Yellowstone to Uintas Connection filed a federal lawsuit this month to stop a proposed pipeline corridor that would cut through six roadless areas in the Caribou-Targhee National Forest in Idaho.
The area is habitat for imperiled species like the greater sage grouse, grizzly bears, lynx, and wolverine, and the pipeline would result in a permanent 20-mile road across otherwise roadless public lands. The new permanent pipeline corridor could be used for additional pipelines in the future, and will undoubtedly increase illegal ATV use in the region.

The U.S. Forest Service authorized a special use permit in March to clear-cut a 50-foot wide, 18.2-mile-long corridor through six National Forest Inventoried Roadless Areas for construction of a private company’s pipeline from Montpelier, Idaho, to Afton, Wyoming. The decision allows a 50-foot right-of-way that will be clearcut during construction, and a permanent 20-foot right-of-way to maintain the pipeline.
In addition to the pipeline itself and the utility corridor, there will also be above-ground facilities such as valves and staging areas. But since the project violates a number of federal laws, the Alliance and Yellowstone to Uintas Connection have filed a lawsuit against the Forest Service to stop construction of the pipeline.
This pipeline would create a road through designated roadless areas, further fragments security habitat for deer and elk, and further degrades already impacted habitat for the threatened Canada lynx.
This is the second time the Alliance for the Wild Rockies and Yellowstone to Uintas have sued to stop this pipeline. We filed our first lawsuit in April of 2020, and two years later the Forest Service tucked its tail and ran, pulling its decision without even waiting for a final court order. But now it’s trying again, and the simple truth is that the pipeline corridor will actually be a permanent road through national forest lands despite the fact that these public lands have been classified and protected as federal Inventoried Roadless Areas.
That means motorized vehicles will be allowed to permanently use this corridor to maintain and inspect the pipeline. Which will cause permanent vegetation removal, increased sight-lines for poaching, increased noxious weed introductions, and abundant new opportunities for illegal motor vehicle use in these currently roadless areas.
The basis for our lawsuit is that the Forest Service failed to disclose and demonstrate compliance with its own Forest Plan requirements for sage grouse. The agency also failed to analyze the cumulative effects on sage grouse as required. In this case, the Forest Service also failed to demonstrate that the new pipeline corridor is in the public interest; is compatible and consistent with other forest resources; that there is no reasonable alternative or accommodation on national forest lands; that it is impractical to use existing right-of-ways; and that the rationale for approving the new pipeline corridor is not solely to lower costs for the energy company. This violates the Forest Plan, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Forest Service Manual, the National Forest Management Act, the Mineral Leasing Act, and the Administrative Procedures Act.
National forests were designated for the benefit of all Americans, not to maximize the profits of the oil and gas industry. Instead of needlessly destroying this rare habitat for endangered species on publicly-owned lands, the private company should use existing right-of-ways or private lands.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)GREAT FALLS, WYOMING — A federal jury in Great Falls unanimously found CoreCivic liable for failing to protect a former inmate who was “nearly beaten to death” at its Shelby prison and awarded the man $27.75 million, according to court records and an account from his lawyers.
CoreCivic, a private company that manages the Crossroads Correctional Center in Shelby, said Friday it will appeal the decision.
The victim, Nathaniel Lake, was convicted of a crime he maintained he did not commit, and he was transferred to CoreCivic’s prison in Shelby, according to a news release Friday from the law firm representing him, Heenan and Cook of Billings. The Montana Supreme Court later overturned that conviction.
“While there, Mr. Lake was assaulted by another inmate serving a double life sentence without parole for deliberate homicide who had previously assaulted 11 times,” the news release said.
The original complaint filed in Toole County District Court in December 2021 said CoreCivic had been named in multiple lawsuits around the country with allegations based on “inmate injuries and deaths inflicted by other inmates.”
The lawsuit said a 2016 U.S. Department of Justice audit found CoreCivic routinely had insufficient staffing.
It also said a 2021 presidential order prohibited the DOJ to renew contracts with private prison operators, including CoreCivic, “noting that such facilities do not provide safe living or working conditions” compared to publicly operated ones.
CoreCivic maintains it takes safety seriously. In January 2025, the Brennan Center for Justice said the Trump administration reversed the order against private prison contracts.
According to the news release, the assailant “buzzed” out of his own locked pod and into Lake’s locked pod in the 2018 attack.
“He then went to Mr. Lake’s cell and beat and choked him for over 3 1/2 minutes undetected by any jailers,” the news release said. “A jailer found Mr. Lake at lockdown count and he was life-flighted to a hospital in Great Falls.”
The complaint said the assailant moved quickly, “no CCC staff intervened in the attack on Lake,” and he was allowed to “freely roam the prison between units without staff intervention.”
Lake was in a coma for 33 days and spent four months in the ICU, the lawyers said. Lake is also represented by Bechtold Law in Missoula.
The complaint said Lake had a “significant history of mental health issues” and was designated as a sex offender at the time, which made him more vulnerable to an attack.
But it said Lake maintained his innocence of attempted sexual intercourse without consent, and the news release said the conviction didn’t stick.
After being released from the hospital, Lake returned to CoreCivic for six months, but was released when the Montana Supreme Court overturned his conviction.
The complaint said the Missoula County Attorney’s Office declined to refile charges, and Lake has no criminal record.

In a statement, lawyer John Heenan said the award delivers on the request of the team’s client. The lawyers said the jury found “deliberate indifference” on the part of CoreCivic.
“In the face of a company that flatly refused to accept any responsibility for its conduct, we told the jury that Mr. Lake didn’t want sympathy, he wanted justice,” Heenan said. “The jury resoundingly rejected CoreCivic’s excuses and delivered justice.”
Based in Tennessee, CoreCivic describes itself as one of the largest corrections operators in the country. In an email, spokesperson Ryan Gustin said CoreCivic will appeal the decision.
“We take the safety and well-being of every person in our care very seriously,” Gustin said. “We respectfully disagree with this decision, don’t believe it reflects the facts of the case, and will appeal it on several legal grounds.”
The complaint said the prisoner who assaulted Lake was criminally charged with two counts of aggravated assault, pleaded guilty to the first count, and was sentenced to 15 years at the Montana State Prison with no time suspended.
Lake suffered a traumatic brain injury under CoreCivic’s negligent supervision, which had severe and permanent consequences, the complaint said: “He will likely require care for the rest of his life.”

Tate Reeves vetoed eight bills that lawmakers sent to his desk during the 2025 legislative session. 
Legislators, during their next regular session, could override the vetoes if a two-thirds majority of lawmakers in each chamber votes to do so. Such a supermajority vote is hard to attain, and veto overrides are rare. Lawmakers have only overridden one of Reeves’ previous vetoes, and that was the first override of a veto since 2002.
The governor can also line-item veto appropriation bills, but lawmakers adjourned their session without adopting a budget to fund the state government. 
Here’s a list of bills that Reeves vetoed this year:
House Bill 569 
This legislation would have changed when medical facilities were required to apply for a “certificate of need” from the Mississippi State Department of Health before opening or adding new services. 
Reeves vetoed the bill because he argued it unlawfully attempted to circumvent an ongoing court case by granting a certificate to a single psychiatric hospital in Jackson.  
House Bill 924
The legislation would have granted the Legislature’s watchdog committee the authority to conduct a review of new state agency regulations and determine if those regulations conform to what the Legislature intended for the agency to do. 
Reeves vetoed the bill because he argued that it greatly expanded the power of a legislative committee and may have exceeded the constitutional authority of the legislative branch. 
House Bill 1085 
This bill would have removed a grant program for Main Street projects in the state from under the Mississippi Development Authority, an executive agency directly under Reeves’ control, to the Mississippi Department of Archives and History, an agency governed by an independent board.  
Reeves argued that the legislation was unconstitutional because it combined general legislation with an appropriation bill, which the Mississippi Constitution prohibits. The governor compared the legislation to a “duck-billed platypus that defies both logic and classification.” 
House Bill 1126 
The bill would have set a maximum local match requirement for counties and municipalities that receive Gulf Coast Restoration funds to fund projects. Currently, the Mississippi Development Authority sets rules and regulations for a local match. 
The legislation capped the local match at either 20% of the total cost or the value of one mill of taxable property in the area, whichever is less, but Reeves vetoed the measure because it mandated requirements instead of allowing an agency to set flexible rules. 
Senate Bill 2386 and Senate Bill 2867  
These two bills made technical amendments to the state’s Medicaid program, often referred to as the “Medicaid tech bill.” The main thrust of the two bills was to lock in place supplemental payment programs that have been a lifeline for hospitals. 
Reeves said in his veto message of Senate Bill 2867 that locking the supplemental payment program in place is in contradiction with another of the bill’s mandates, which would change the program to allow out-of-state hospitals that border Mississippi to participate in the supplemental payment program. 
“Complying with both requirements is a legal impossibility and places the Division, like Odysseus, between Scylla and Charybdis,” Reeves wrote. 
Reeves vetoed Senate Bill 2867 while the Legislature was still in session. Instead of overriding the veto, the Legislature passed Senate Bill 2386, a new Medicaid technology bill that addresses only some of Reeves’ concerns. The governor also vetoed that bill. 
Senate Bill 2573 
This bill would have created the Mississippi Department of Tourism, but Reeves vetoed the bill because legislative leaders failed to pass a budget during their regular session. The governor argued it would be irresponsible to create a new state agency without an accompanying budget. 
Senate Bill 2840  
This bill would have allocated money for various projects around the state.

She found that many people still have soggy carpets and wet basements after more than two months. Houses are filled with mold. Trash is piled up outside. Some residents say they haven’t seen anyone from the state or federal government in their small towns offering help.
And McDowell is one of the few counties that actually received federal funding for flood response. 
In late February, the federal government approved Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s request for federal  aid. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has so far approved nearly 3,500 applications for individual assistance, and more than $25 million has been awarded to residents in Logan, McDowell, Mercer, Mingo, Raleigh, Wayne and Wyoming counties.
Residents who receive that money can use it to cover the costs of temporary housing and home repairs. 
About 94% of West Virginia communities are considered “Special Flood Hazard Areas,” which means the more than 84,000 structures in those areas are at a high risk of flooding, according to a 2023 report by researchers at West Virginia University.
However, President Donald Trump has suggested that FEMA, which is the only agency currently that administers disaster relief funds, might “go away.”
Last week it was announced that Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency would cut 1,000 employees — or 20% of the workforce — from FEMA, just ahead of hurricane season.
On Wednesday, Morrisey announced that FEMA denied individual assistance grants to Boone, Cabell, Greenbrier, Kanawha, Lincoln, Monroe and Summers counties, and public assistance grants in Cabell and Kanawha counties for the February floods. 
“Despite today’s notification, I am grateful to the Trump Administration for their strong support for Southern West Virginia’s recovery following the February floods,” Morrisey said in a statement. 
We know you’re not a native West Virginian, governor, but please stand up for your adopted state.
Alex Brown from Stateline, one of West Virginia Watch’s sister newsrooms, reached out to the White House about states being denied FEMA funding, and received a statement that said the agency is focused on “truly catastrophic disasters,” and that states need to have a better “appetite to own the problem.”
West Virginia has no appetite, as shown during the legislative session.
On April 4, about three weeks after the devastating February floods, Del. Sean Hornbuckle, D-Cabell, proposed adding $50 million to the state budget for flood prevention. 
“We have the ability to do something earthly,” Hornbuckle said. “The power that we have — not just the divine power — but with a button and a pen that we all have to help out neighbors in the great state of West Virginia.”  
The amendment was rejected 75-19.
Remember the 2016 floods — the deadliest in the state’s history? Former Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin, a Democrat born in Logan County, declared a state of emergency for 44 of the state’s 55 counties.
Since November 2019, FEMA has given West Virginia more than $424 million in funding in response to the 2016 floods. More than $42 million was given to 4,949 individuals and families, and more than $172.8 million was given to local and state governments and some nonprofits. FEMA also provided more than $209.8 million to replace Herbert Hoover High, Richwood Middle, Richwood High, Summersville Middle and to relocate Clendenin Elementary.
Herbert Hoover High School was destroyed, and students were taught in portable classrooms until their new school was completed in fall 2023. Clendenin Elementary School didn’t reopen until fall 2024. Construction hasn’t started on the schools destroyed in Nicholas County. 
In response to that flood, the West Virginia Legislature created the State Resiliency Office. Its purpose is to “Minimize the loss of life and property, m​​aintain eco​nomic stability, and improve recovery time by coordinating with stakeholders to implement disaster resilient strategies.​​
The state Legislature created the West Virginia Disaster Recovery Trust Fund in 2023 with Senate Bill 677. The fund sits empty. No money was allocated to that fund during the 2024 legislative session. The FY 2026 budget, which Morrisey has signed, doesn’t include any money for the fund either. 
There were only three bills related to flooding during the session — House Bill 2858 and Senate Bill 502 were the same bill, meant to allow counties to regulate floodplains under National Flood Insurance Program guidelines. They both died. House Bill 3502, sponsored by Hornbuckle, would have allowed a one-time allocation of $100 million from the state revenue shortfall fund and $150 million from the state’s income tax revenue fund for the West Virginia Flood Resiliency Trust Fund. It died in the House Government Organization.
West Virginia needs FEMA, but with FEMA potentially out of the picture, it’s time the state whet its appetite and take a bite out of the problem. 
Morrisey has already said he plans to call a special session this summer to deal with the Public Employees Insurance Agency and education funding. Sounds like the perfect time and a good use of tax payer money to move some funding over to the West Virginia Disaster Recovery Trust Fund.

Angie Craig D-MN, speaks at a news conference on January 29, 2019 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Zach Gibson/Getty Images)Democratic U.S. Rep. Angie Craig, who has won a string of victories in the closely divided 2nd Congressional District, is running for U.S. Senate to replace Sen. Tina Smith, who recently announced her retirement.
Craig, who has represented the 2nd District since 2019, will battle Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan, in what is expected to be a grueling and expensive Democratic-Farmer-Labor primary. 
The contest will split the party along ideological lines. Flanagan has long been a champion of progressive causes while Craig has garnered attention for breaking from her party on issues like law enforcement and immigration. 
Craig’s press release announcing her campaign leans on popular issues like lowering the cost of prescription drugs; stopping corporate concentration; banning members of Congress from trading stocks; and addressing the nation’s mental health and addiction problems. 
“We all know Washington’s not listening to you — and that’s got to change,” said Craig, who’s been in Washington for six years. 
In a video announcement, Craig drives a Jeep adorned with rubber ducks and speaks to the viewer while standing in front of a tractor.
She frequently refers to her upbringing in a mobile home park, raised by a single mom. She went on to become successful in the medical device industry. 
Craig is Minnesota’s first openly lesbian member of Congress and is married and has four adult sons and three grandchildren. 
She was the victim of random violence in the elevator of her Washington, D.C. apartment building in 2023, fending off the attacker with her hot coffee before escaping. 
Her campaign release uses the phrase “fought like hell” twice, once referring to her family’s battle to adopt children, and again referring to her work on “behalf of family farmers.” 
Craig’s centrist politics have helped her win four consecutive elections in the purple 2nd District in the south metro, with her margin of victory expanding until she won a blowout in 2024 despite Republicans’ nationwide success at the ballot box. She’s a vocal proponent of law enforcement, has voted on Republican-led border security bills and is the top Democrat on the House Committee on Agriculture. 
In recent months, Craig seemed to be making moves to appeal to the DFL’s progressive base, perhaps in preparation for a statewide run. She invited Denise Specht, president of the state’ influential teachers union Education Minnesota, to be her guest at the State of the Union address. She joined with well-known progressive Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Washington, to form a new caucus, known as the Monopoly Busters Caucus. 
A spokeswoman for Flanagan sought to draw a contrast, though without naming Craig. 
“In Peggy you have a lifelong Minnesotan who has spent her entire career fighting for and delivering economic wins and stability for kids and families. And she’s building a formidable campaign powered by actual people, not corporations,” said campaign spokeswoman Alexandra Fetissoff.
Flanagan announced her bid for Senate in February. Last week, she released a list of endorsements from lawmakers in Craig’s district, including DFL state Sens. Lindsey Port and Erin Maye Quade, and Reps. Kristi Pursell, Jess Hanson and Mary Frances Clardy. She’s also won the endorsement of Attorney General Keith Ellison, former U.S. Sen. Al Franken and State Auditor Julie Blaha. 
Craig’s departure in the 2nd District is expected to set off a competitive race to replace her — on both sides. Potential candidates include 2024 GOP nominee Joe Teirab; 2020 and 2022 GOP nominee Tyler Kistner; DFL state Sens. Matt Klein and Erin Maye Quade; former state Sen. Matt Little; and Minneapolis businessman and internet impresario Mike Norton.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/minn.-craig.jpg,,,2025-04-29 06:00:33.008936

Glenn Youngkin's request that he drop out. (Photo courtesy of John Reid)Things aren’t always what they seem to be, especially in today’s online realm.
A “friend request” appeared in my Facebook notifications last week that I immediately recognized as phony. It purported to be from a real-life friend I’ve known for more than a quarter of a century. It used his real name and photo, but it had only 16 friends, not his more than 2,000 online friends, including me. So I reported the sham account to Facebook and texted my friend, who knew about it and had already alerted Facebook. The fake “friendvite” was one of many I reject and report every week.
In deepening Va. GOP crisis, Reid accuses Youngkin PAC of extortion. Is a legal battle ahead?

Having a large social media following is not unusual for people like my friend, who spent most of his career in the public eye during decades of distinguished service at top levels in state government. They’re also prime targets for digital impostors.
The very next day, another friend of mine — longtime Richmond morning radio talk show host and Republican lieutenant governor nominee John Reid — was the focus of lurid accusations stemming from posts on a dubious social media account.
A page on a platform known as Tumblr used a name that matches Reid’s usernames on other social media. The story was first reported Friday in The Richmonder by former Mercury reporter Graham Moomaw, who viewed the images before the Tumblr page was taken down. The story said the pornographic pictures of men were reposted, random photos that had appeared elsewhere. Reid was in none of them.
Reid is the first openly gay candidate for statewide office in Virginia history. I’ve known him for the better part of 30 years, and he’s never hidden his orientation from anyone. People who know him know that he’s eight years into a committed, monogamous relationship.
I am not privy to all the facts, but there’s more than enough reason to be highly skeptical of what has all the earmarks of a clumsy, hateful political takedown. It’s also clear that a quarter of the way through the 21st century, some people will do anything to keep a gay man from being part of the most diverse ticket in Virginia history alongside the first Black woman and Hispanic man elected to statewide office.
This was already a difficult year for Republicans. President Donald Trump has lost convincingly all three times he’s been on a Virginia ballot. The GOP is winless in every statewide election when he was either president or a candidate. His second administration’s chainsaw approach to severing federal employees and contractors who are a significant part of Virginia’s economy makes this year’s climb steeper.
The GOP caught a break by avoiding primaries for statewide office. Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, running for governor, and Attorney General Jason Miyares, running for reelection, secured their nominations weeks ago. On April 21, Reid became the default lieutenant governor nominee when longtime Fairfax County Board of Supervisors member Pat Herrity withdrew citing health concerns.  
That’s when the threats began, Reid said in a Monday interview with the Mercury.
“Then I got a call from a religious group in Henrico saying, ‘We’re warning you that your life is going to be ruined, so don’t run,’” he said. “Yesterday, they told my campaign guy that if I step aside, this will all go away.”
If that sounds to you like blackmail talk more befitting mob bosses than political operatives, you’re not alone.
“I think they — not everybody but some people — decided they don’t want a gay man on the ticket after the primary didn’t work out the way they expected. They thought that Pat would crush me in money and in northern Virginia votes,” Reid said.
Leading the chorus of Republicans pressuring Reid to retreat is Gov. Glenn Youngkin, whom Reid has unabashedly supported and who was often a guest on Reid’s dominant Richmond region morning radio talk show on WRVA.
I know from bitter personal experience the disastrous consequences of being insufficiently skeptical; of feeling time-pressured to believe a finding rather than awaiting a fuller accounting. Has Youngkin done the same thing?
Imagine you’re a well-known media personality who also has a significant portfolio of service to Republican causes and officeholders. You effectively live in a glass house. Now ask yourself: Would I, in such a situation, post X-rated pictures of strangers on a social media account under my own username? In what world is that sane? At a minimum, it should give you pause.
I wonder, governor, where was your indignance over the lewd behavior of another Republican who once bragged on a hot mic of taking grossly indecent liberties with women, including grabbing their genitalia? Or over unwanted sexual advances against writer E. Jean Carroll for which a New York jury held him civilly liable for battery and defamation. Or over his conviction on 34 felony counts by another New York jury on charges he paid adult film actress Stormy Daniels $130,000 shortly before the 2016 election to silence her claim that the two had sex years earlier.
Did you ask him to abandon his nomination for the presidency, an office he has now won twice? Did it occur to you or your political advisers that the questionable claim against Reid could plausibly be one of those innumerable spoofed accounts that get generated every day by overseas bot farms, soulless scammers and, in the instant case, possibly a few ethically bankrupt political schemers? How much investigation preceded your demand that Reid quit the race? Would you have similarly sandbagged your party’s nominee if that person had been heterosexual?
I have always respected Reid. I don’t agree with all of his politics, but there’s no Democrat with whom I share full concurrence, either. He has always been unflinchingly conservative. He’s never shied from asking tough questions or answering them from others, either as a political aide or as a broadcaster. Nothing he’s ever told me turned out to be a lie, and I can’t say that about many in the realm of politics.
I don’t know how all of this winds up, but history won’t be kind to those who orchestrated or advanced this Machiavellian ambush. As Reid told me, it’s not all Republicans. Many of them have recognized this underhanded play and rallied behind him, as the Washington Post reported from Reid’s campaigning in Virginia’s reddest congressional district over the weekend.
I also know Reid is defiant, hurt, angry and not backing down. He has engaged lawyers to look into what he flatly calls extortion, a felony. He might have a civil defamation claim, something that could compel interesting answers in sworn depositions.
Those who figured Reid would falter and meekly fade away figured wrong. Now they’re in a fistfight of their own making.

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)All of Virginia’s educational divisions, except two, have signed Title VI certifications pledging their commitment to treating all students equally regardless of their race, following a mandate by the state education department that builds on President Donald Trump administration’s campaign to demolish diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in federally-funded agencies. 
Two school divisions — in Loudoun and Fairfax, the state’s largest school district — submitted alternative documents that they say signify the same commitment, flouting the certification form created by the U.S. Department of Education. Norfolk signed a modified certification form.
Schools could lose federal funding and face further investigation if they don’t comply with the certification, federal leaders have said.

Loudoun County Superintendent Aaron Spence wrote a letter to the Virginia Department of Education explaining the division would not sign the certification because  it already has policies to ensure Title VI compliance, so “it is not clear what purpose the requested certification serves.” 
“We believe we have complied with the intent of the requested certification by providing the necessary assurances to the Department of Education—both at present and during our annual grant applications, as required by federal law,” Spence said in a statement. “The letter we submitted to the VDOE was intended to fulfill this purpose while also highlighting our concerns regarding the lack of clarity created by the certification document itself.”
Loudoun County schools also published a letter to parents stating that the division has already certified its compliance when applying for federal funding and claiming that the federal agency’s request is also “vague” and “overly broad.” 
Spence said the school division will await further guidance, since courts in New Hampshire and Maryland recently issued injunctions on the collection of information regarding diversity, equity and inclusion programs. 
Fairfax schools sent both a modified certification and assurance document and said in a statement to the Mercury that the school division’s policies continue to be “consistent with all applicable state and federal laws.”
Last week, Fairfax Superintendent Michelle Reid reinforced this by certifying the division’s compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to state education leaders.
“Here in FCPS, we believe our diversity is a strength and that each and every child deserves access to a world-class education,” Reid said in a statement to the Mercury. “The power and promise of public education come to life every day in our schools through the tireless dedication of our staff and the transformative moments of learning that our students experience.”
On April 3, the U.S. Department of Education required the Virginia Department of Education to certify each school division’s compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act and the responsibilities outlined in the Students for Fair Admissions vs. Harvard case — or risk losing federal funding assistance.
According to records obtained by the Mercury, VDOE’s deadline to submit a report with all of the certifications was extended to April 24.

The agreement stated that the U.S. DOE “will not initiate enforcement action, investigation or otherwise take action” based on any state or school division’s certification, lack of certification, or communication with the federal agency regarding the certification until after the April 24 deadline has passed.
Craig Trainor, acting assistant secretary for Civil Rights, said in an April 3 statement that federal financial assistance is a privilege, not a right. 
“When state education commissioners accept federal funds, they agree to abide by federal antidiscrimination requirements. Unfortunately, we have seen too many schools flout or outright violate these obligations, including by using DEI programs to discriminate against one group of Americans to favor another based on identity characteristics in clear violation of Title VI,” Trainor said.
The administration’s efforts are facing fierce pushback from the National Education Association as well as civil rights groups including the NAACP. On April 24, a federal judge in Maryland temporarily blocked enforcement of the federal education department’s certification directive, and the same day, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia granted an injunction to the same effect.

[…]","The North Carolina Legislative Building (Photo: Clayton Henkel) For average citizens whose knowledge of the lawmaking process stems mostly from snippets of TV coverage of Congress, a grade school field trip, or attendance at a city council or local school board meeting, witnessing the machinations of the North Carolina legislature up close and personal for the first time is often a surprising experience.
A congressional committee’s vetting of a single bill often takes more than one meeting of several hours each and features panels of expert witnesses reading pages of lengthy and painstakingly prepared testimony, often followed by lengthy questioning and speech-making from lawmakers and committee staff.
City council and school board gatherings may not be so grand or highfalutin, but they often run late into the night as constituents come forward to oppose or support a proposed ordinance or policy change.
In contrast, the process in Raleigh is almost always remarkably quick and informal.
Indeed, a typical General Assembly committee’s public consideration of a bill – even a proposal of some substance and controversy – often takes just a few minutes. A committee meeting might proceed as follows:
First, the members of a committee gather at an appointed one-hour time slot. The meeting often takes place in a small, crowded, sometimes windowless and spartan room that features a narrow horseshoe of tables for lawmakers to sit at arm-to-arm, and a few rows of general seating for the public and media members. Often, legislators trail in after the proceedings have commenced and depart early.
And for the next 50-or-so minutes, the committee chair leads the group of perhaps 10-20 members through the list of scheduled bills. One-by-one, bill sponsors troop to the front of the room, explain the bill in a couple of minutes – sometimes accurately, sometimes not so much — and ask for support. During busy times of the year – like the current silly season that’s underway right now – each meeting’s agenda could include as many as a dozen or more bills.
Sometimes, there are a few questions, comments or a bit of professional staff input, sometimes not. Often, the legislation — almost all of which is sponsored by Republicans since Democratic proposals seldom get a hearing in the GOP-dominated legislature – will be approved on a voice vote in just a minute or two.
Occasionally, a member of the public – a lobbyist, a government agency staffer, an average citizen – will ask to speak. Sometimes they will be granted permission – often with an air of impatience from the chair — and sometimes not. Normally, while they are speaking, a sergeant-at-arms staff person will hover close by, assuring that they do not exceed the time allotted to speakers – usually just two minutes, or sometimes one
Speakers who oppose bills favored by the chair tend to get a faster hook.
Sometimes, amendments or rewritten versions of bills known as “committee substitutes” will be hastily crafted and adopted on the fly. At other times, bills are quickly okayed with a vague proviso directing staff to incorporate “clarifying” amendments before the bill goes to the floor, or when it gets to another committee.
And that’s basically it.
That’s how important and frequently complex new state statutes – statutes that create new crimes, alter which toxic chemicals are and aren’t permissible to release, or amend what can and can’t be done in public schools – are vetted.
And right now, as lawmakers hurtle toward their self-imposed May 8 “crossover deadline” – the date by which many bills must be approved in one house in order to be eligible for consideration in the other one this year – the process is at what is arguably its chaotic worst. In the coming days, look for scores — perhaps hundreds — of bills to be summarily whisked through committee and House or Senate floor votes based on little more than a sponsor’s general description and the hope that the other house may figure out a way to pay more attention.
As the old saying goes, it’s a crazy way to run a railroad. Whether, however, there is a better and truly feasible way to run things is very much an open question.
A legislature that lacked artificial deadlines would presumably have more time to dissect legislation, hear from genuine experts, and better understand what it was voting on – as might a legislature that committed to listening to public testimony for more than 60 or 120 seconds at a time. Mandating detailed explanations from professional legislative staff for every bill considered and requiring a week’s public notice before a bill could be considered would help as well.
But, of course, remedies that promote transparency, hard questions and public input tend to take more time, drive up costs and, most importantly, diminish the power of the people running the show behind the scenes. So don’t hold your breath.
For now, the best chance for many important bills to receive something closer to the thorough vetting they deserve likely rests with the Gov. Josh Stein and, ultimately, the chance that Democrats on Jones Street will stick together long enough to make any vetoes he might issue stick. Stay tuned.

(Photo by Bill Pugliano/Getty Images)Ohio lawmakers appear to have a deal on a wide-ranging energy bill meant to increase power production in the state. They’re returning from a two-week recess with an amendment sanding off the differences between House and Senate proposals approved last month.
The Senate Energy Committee meets Tuesday to introduce the changes and likely put them to vote. Both chambers will be in session the following day and could presumably vote on final passage in back-to-back sessions.
The proposal offers tax breaks for companies investing in power plants and retools the ratemaking process for energy distribution companies. To further encourage new entrants, the measure reinforces barriers keeping the regulated monopolies running distribution out of the production market.
Where the tweaks land
From the outset, House and Senate lawmakers have worked along parallel tracks advancing similar, although not identical, versions of the same bill. Several core ideas have persisted throughout, like eliminating the coal plant rider from 2019’s HB 6.
Along the way, lawmakers proposed a few sideline initiatives. The House bill included a pilot for small cooperative power generation facilities; the Senate added in a program loaning schools money for renewable energy improvements. The Senate’s idea survived. The House’s didn’t.
For other provisions, the chambers offered different responses to the same question. The proposals incentivize investment with a tax break. Tangible personal property tax gets levied on the equipment used to generate electricity. The House proposed reducing the rate from about 25% to 7%. Senators meanwhile suggested eliminating it altogether for equipment brought online after 2025.
The amendment goes with the 7% mark and includes provisions to discourage companies from claiming the reduced rate after making modest changes or upgrades to existing facilities.
Another major element of the legislation has to do with the regulatory timeline. Critics argue Ohio’s ratemaking process takes longer than most other states, so lawmakers proposed a “shot clock” for those decisions. The House set the ceiling at 360 days, but the Senate’s 320-day deadline is the one carried forward in the amendment.
Cutting room floor
A last-minute change to what qualifies as a ‘major’ facility isn’t included in the amendment. House lawmakers lowered the cut-off for electric transmission lines to put more of them under the Ohio Power Siting Board’s authority. Critics argued those investments get very little oversight and offer a path for utilities to over-charge customers for the upgrades.
Ohio Consumers’ Counsel Maureen Willis is urging lawmakers to “reconsider” a different provision related to consumer refunds.
“When we say ‘reconsider’ we mean delete it,” her written testimony states.
If the state Supreme Court determines a charge was unlawful, the legislation allows consumer refunds for any of those charges collected after the court decision. Willis questioned the idea of barring refunds on charges determined to be illegal.
What’s more, she argued “it may have the unintended effect of interfering with consumer refunds in pending appeals where charges have been collected ’subject to refund.’”
One such case against Dayton-area AES Ohio is currently working through the appeals process. Because state regulators approved a $76 million charge — subject to refund, the Consumers’ Counsel case could return more than $300 to each customer. But if the amendment’s cut off is in place, those refunds would be in jeopardy.
“The current refund provisions risk perpetuating past injustices where consumers bore the cost of unlawful utility charges without remedy,” Willis wrote.

Within the commonwealth, however, wealth is common.
Though no fewer than 48 American racetracks have closed since 2000, Kentucky operators continue to invest hundreds of millions in their facilities and are reaping an outsized return, and not only on the first Saturday in May.
For instance:
Churchill Downs Inc. reported record net revenue ($2.7 billion) and net income ($427 million) for 2024.
Keeneland’s September Yearling Sale netted a record $427.9 million.
The 2006 races run in Kentucky in 2024 paid an average purse of $112,648, 20% higher than the second most lucrative state (Arkansas).
September’s seven-day all-grass meet at Kentucky Downs in Franklin paid out $490,789 per race, easily the highest total ever recorded at a North American track.
“Retreat to Kentucky if you want a future in racing,” California horseplayer Andy Asaro tweeted on April 15. “Things are moving fast.”

Beyond the Bluegrass, things are moving mostly in reverse. Jockey Club data shows the number of Thoroughbred races run in the United States has dropped by more than 50% since 1995, and the size of the national foal crop has been falling even faster, from 34,358 in 2007 to an estimated 16,675 last year. The Sonoma County Fair recently announced it will forego live racing for the first time since 1936 because of a shrinking supply of horses in Northern California. Last month, the Louisiana Supreme Court ruled the state’s historical horse racing machines unconstitutional, prompting Churchill Downs Inc. to project a 25% cut in purses at its Fair Grounds racetrack.
 Slots-lite a double-edged sword

Meanwhile, “decoupling” legislation that could free Florida gaming operators of the obligation to stage live racing as a condition of their licenses has been stalled, but may only represent a temporary reprieve from redevelopment of major tracks. The Stronach Group’s 1/ST Racing, which owns Gulfstream and Santa Anita, has threatened to sell both tracks while showing a pronounced inclination to divest rather than invest in its properties. Last year, the company closed Golden Gate Fields near San Francisco and cut a deal that turned over Baltimore’s Pimlico, the home of the Preakness Stakes, to the state of Maryland.
Against this gloomy backdrop, and in contrast to its own contentious closure of Arlington Park near Chicago, Churchill Downs Inc. continues to spend aggressively on its flagship track. Plans for new capital projects with a projected cost of $920 million were put on pause last Wednesday, ostensibly in response to the uncertainty surrounding tariffs and trade disputes,  but recent improvements to the paddock and the addition of Homestretch Club and Turn One Experience cost in excess of $300 million and speak to management’s long-term bullishness.
While these investments are largely attributable to the singular appeal of the Kentucky Derby, they also reflect the thoroughbred industry’s political influence in Frankfort and, in turn, the gushing revenue stream historical horse racing (HHR) terminals have unleashed.
Since their 2011 introduction at Kentucky Downs, the slot-like historical horse racing terminals have reinvigorated racing in the state. Programmed to pay out based on the results of races previously run, Kentucky’s HHR machines generated more than $9.6 billion in handle during the 2024 fiscal year, accounting for $99 in bets for every $1 wagered live at the state’s thoroughbred and standardbred tracks.
They contributed $55.5 million to Kentucky’s Thoroughbred Development Fund during that 12-month period, fueling the growth of purses that have more than doubled since 2017. Consequently, Eric Hamelback, CEO of the National Horsemen’s Benevolent and Protective Association, refers to HHR’s proliferation as racing’s “golden ticket.”

When HHR’s legality was challenged in 2018, Ellis Park General Manager Jeffery Inman said the loss of that revenue would “likely threaten the very survival of one of Kentucky’s iconic racing venues.” Though opposition was vocal, it was handily outvoted. Attorney Ryan Roark, in an article published in the Kentucky Law Journal, wrote that the legislature settled on a definition of pari-mutuel wagering “not shared by anyone outside Kentucky … to allow for the powerful horse industry to exclusively run their slot-like gaming systems.”
The result, says Churchill Downs CEO Bill Carstanjen, has been a “juggernaut.” According to the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission, gross HHR commissions for Churchill Downs’ two Derby City Gaming locations exceeded $224 million for the 2024 fiscal year, nearly 12 times the total commissions from on-track wagering at all of the state’s racetracks.
To the extent this disparity underscores the industry’s reliance on revenue sources that require no physical horses, it inevitably raises questions about racing’s sustainability and the best use of its real estate.

“Racing is on life support in Southern California, Florida, Delaware, Pennsylvania etc. and exists almost everywhere else only with the support of non-racing revenues from slots, casinos and state supplements,” Kenwood Racing founder H. Robb Levinsky wrote in a January letter to Thoroughbred Daily News. “Instead of embracing innovative ideas to make the sport more attractive to a new generation of racing fans and owners, the focus continues to be on protecting those non-racing revenues. An industry where 80-90% of purse money comes from slots instead of wagering on the core product is simply not viable in the long run.”
 Signs of progress in New York, Maryland

In the short run, at least, the growth of Kentucky’s purses has led to a higher quality of horses competing in the state, more interest among bettors and a breeding boom running contrary to national trends. As Ed DeRosa documented for Horse Racing Nation, Kentucky passed both California and Florida in total handle in 2024 after trailing both states annually since 2007.
“We’re the only jurisdiction (among the top four states) that has grown since 2020,” said Chauncey Morris, executive director of the Kentucky Thoroughbred Association. “The rest have contracted.”
And as cash incentives for Kentucky-breds have increased, so has the state’s share of registered foals. When HHR was introduced at Kentucky Downs in 2011, Kentucky produced 29.2% of the national foal crop. In 2023, the most recent year for which statistics are available, it was 42.2%.
  Damon Thayer (LRC Public Information)
“In states where racing has a good relationship with state legislators, racing is in good shape,” said consultant Damon Thayer, formerly the Kentucky Senate’s majority floor leader. “In states where they have not cultivated a long-term relationship with the legislature, horse racing is either in a declining state, a crisis state or a questionable state.”
In addition to Kentucky, there are pockets of progress. New York and Maryland have committed nearly a billion dollars to renovations at Belmont Park and Pimlico. Multiple industry executives cited developments in Wyoming, the nation’s last populous state, as a basis for bullishness. Yet their optimism is tempered by unsolved problems in larger locales, including the most populous state, California.
Without supplemental income from other forms of gambling, California’s racing and breeding businesses have been contracting for decades. Efforts to enhance purses through HHR remain at the discussion stage in view of Native American tribes’ virtual monopoly on the state’s casino gaming. Unless some accommodation can be reached, racing columnist Ray Paulick warns, “racing in California is history.”
“You can put 1,000 HHRs in at Santa Anita and it would change California racing overnight,” Thayer said. “They’d be wildly popular. You’d direct the money to purses and breeders reward programs and it would be a huge success. It seems like some sort of attempt should be made to cut a deal with the Indians and convince them that 1,000 HHRs at Santa Anita is not going to damage their land-based casinos. . .
“Like Cyndi Lauper used to say, money changes everything.”

Missouri may become the first state with an income tax to exempt capital gains, but several states have considered tax cut proposals that would benefit the wealthy during this year’s legislative sessions. (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent)Missouri Republicans may take their tax-cutting efforts to new heights this year as lawmakers consider exempting profits from the sale of stocks, bonds and real estate from state income taxes.
Part of a broader push to eliminate the state income tax altogether, legislation making its way through the Capitol would provide an unprecedented benefit to the wealthy by excluding capital gains, the long-term earnings from the sale of assets. If approved, tax experts say, the legislation would mark the first time a state with an income tax has eliminated capital gains tax.
The Republican sponsors say the move would make the state more attractive for businesses and families.
“This bill is intended to energize Missouri’s economy,” Republican Speaker Pro Tem Chad Perkins said upon introducing the measure.
But state Democrats — and even some of their GOP colleagues — have criticized the measure as being overly favorable to the wealthy. Most states’ tax systems already put a higher tax burden on lower-income households. That trend only accelerated in this year’s legislative sessions, worrying advocates who want to see the rich pay a larger share.
“It is so egregious in just how grossly concentrated the benefits of the [Missouri] proposal would go to the richest people in the state and shift the state’s tax system to really privilege the owners of wealth over people who are earning a regular paycheck,” said David Cooper, an analyst at the left-leaning think tank Economic Policy Institute.
The institute advocates for progressive state taxes — those that put the proportionately largest tax burdens on the highest earners. While Cooper advises against eliminating state income taxes, he said the Missouri move would be more harmful than eliminating the income tax outright.
“If you’re wiping away the income tax altogether, there’s at least some tax benefit going to lower-earning folks who are still paying income taxes,” he said. “If you’re just eliminating capital gains income taxes, you are just giving away money to the wealthiest people in the state, period.”











It is so egregious in just how grossly concentrated the benefits of the proposal would go to the richest people in the state.


– David Cooper, Economic Policy Institute analyst



Some Democratic-led states, including Maryland and Washington, have moved to increase taxes on the wealthy this year. But several states — including Kansas, Kentucky and Mississippi — have made more regressive tax changes.
Jared Walczak, vice president of state projects at the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation, noted that states still prioritize progressive spending through social service programs aiding the most vulnerable residents.
He said states compete against each other for business and residents in much more immediate ways than the federal government competes against other nations.
“So states are very focused on the competitive advantages associated with a pro-growth tax regime,” he said, “and that has led to less of an emphasis in many states on achieving progressivity through the tax code.”
‘Generational change’ to taxes
While several states have enacted high-profile tax cuts this year, the momentum is actually slowing, Walczak said.
With booming economies and an influx of federal cash in recent years, conservative and liberal states alike passed significant tax cuts. Of the 43 states that have some sort of income tax, 28 have made rate reductions since 2021, Walczak said.
“In many states, lawmakers simply accomplished much of what they had set out to do,” he said.
Economic uncertainty and the prospect of reduced federal aid also have made many lawmakers more cautious this legislative season, he said.
But lawmakers in several states — including Oklahoma, South Carolina and West Virginia — have continued their march to eliminate state income taxes.
“Taxing people’s wages is bad because it undermines liberty,” Oklahoma state Sen. Dusty Deevers, a Republican, said this month in support of a proposed income tax cut, the Oklahoma Voice reported. “It undermines people’s freedoms. If government controls income, then it controls your life.”
Cutting services or raising taxes: State lawmakers weigh how to fill big budget gaps

This session, Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear signed a bill cutting the state income tax rate from 4% to 3.5%. Republican lawmakers have been slashing rates for years with the ultimate aim of eliminating the income tax altogether, despite concerns that more reliance on sales tax would disproportionately burden the poor. To partially offset the income tax reduction, the legislature expanded sales taxes to more services in 2018.
And Republican lawmakers in Kansas overrode a veto from Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly to move away from the state’s graduated income tax toward a flat tax of 4% that will mostly benefit the highest earners.
Last month, Mississippi Republican Gov. Tate Reeves signed legislation granting another cut in the state income tax. Officials there aim to phase out the income tax altogether over the coming years with gradual rate reductions, which Reeves characterized as “a generational change” for the state.
The Mississippi law also reduces the sales tax on groceries and increases the gas tax. Though the governor is already celebrating the end of state income tax, the law provides for incremental reductions in the coming years only if the state hits certain revenue targets.
Republican state Rep. Trey Lamar, a legislative sponsor, said income taxes disincentivize work — a particular problem for the state with the nation’s lowest workforce participation rate.
“A tax on work is a tax on productivity,” he said.
The left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy says the law will make the state’s tax system more inequitable. Its analysis found that when fully implemented, the top 1% of households, who have average annual incomes of $1.4 million, will receive an average cut of $41,420, or roughly 3% of their annual income. But the bottom 20% of earners, who have average annual incomes of $13,400, would realize a tax cut of just $42 per year.
Lamar noted the legislation did not increase sales taxes across the board. With average sales tax burdens already lower than neighboring states like Alabama, he said the income tax elimination will only help Mississippi workers.
“We need more people working,” he said. “So if helping the working man is somehow seen as regressive, then I’d have to say I don’t fully understand that.”
Blue and red states slash taxes despite warnings of hard times ahead

Walczak, of the Tax Foundation, said the state can afford the initial rate reduction. But it’s unclear whether state revenues will hit the targets needed — and whether lawmakers will reassess the aim of eliminating income taxes.
As one of the nation’s poorest states, Mississippi is heavily reliant on federal funding and would be particularly vulnerable to an economic downturn.
“There’s not a guarantee that the state could afford that in the future, and Mississippi does not have a large budget to begin with, so that would be harder than in most other states if the economy slid,” he said. “It does require a willingness on lawmakers’ parts to be honest with themselves if the economy changes and decide whether a pause might be necessary.”
An uneven tax burden
Economic uncertainty and slowing revenues have put many states into budget holes this year, forcing lawmakers to consider spending cuts or tax increases.
To close budget gaps, some conservative and liberal states have considered new or higher taxes on marijuana, tobacco and soda.
But some liberal-led states are looking to taxes more focused on the wealthy. In Rhode Island, Democratic Gov. Daniel McKee has proposed a 10% tax on digital advertising revenue.
In Washington state, lawmakers approved raising capital gains taxes and business taxes to close a looming deficit, though it’s unclear whether Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson, who has voiced skepticism, will sign off on those measures.
Maryland lawmakers, facing a $3 billion deficit, recently approved $1.6 billion in new taxes and fees. That includes two new high-income tax brackets and a new 3% sales tax on information technology and data services.
Child tax credits, long a liberal priority, find favor in Republican states

Moves like those that ask more of the wealthy could make some state tax systems more progressive, said Aidan Davis, the state policy director at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. But most state tax proposals approved this year have primarily benefited the highest earners.
That’s particularly concerning because most state systems already favor the wealthy. In 41 states, the top 1% of earners pay a lower effective tax rate than any other group, according to an institute study.
In Missouri, the fate of the first-of-its-kind capital gains tax elimination remains up in the air.
Though versions of the proposal have passed both chambers, there are differences between the Senate and House legislation. That means the bill could go back to conference committee for further negotiation or go on to Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe, who has identified capital gains among his tax cut priorities this year.
Missouri’s Department of Revenue estimated the exemption could cost $111 million per year. But an Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy analysis of IRS data projects the change could cost $600 million or more.
If approved, the top 5% of Missouri households — those making more than $273,000 per year — will receive more than 80% of the benefit from capital gains exemption, Davis said.
“Doing so would let wealthy people collect tax-free passive income while you’re continuing to tax middle class workers and people with savings,” Davis said. “It’s just a really extreme proposal.”

As outside temperatures dropped to the low- to mid-teens Fahrenheit on Feb. 10, 2025, two children died of carbon monoxide toxicity in a family van parked in a Detroit casino parking garage.
We are political scientists who study urban and housing public policies, and in the months since this tragedy, we took a deep look at the trends in homelessness and housing policies that foreshadowed the events of that night.
 More kids are experiencing homelessness

One important trend is that the number of homeless children in the city reached a record high in 2024. This is true even though the overall numbers of people experiencing homelessness in the city is declining overall. 
According to the Point-in-Time count, 455 children were experiencing homelessness in Detroit on Jan. 31, 2024, up from 312 the year before. The count captures data for one night each year.
Most of these children were unhoused but considered sheltered because they had a place to sleep in an emergency shelter or transitional housing, or were able to temporarily stay with family or friends.
Nineteen of the kids were unsheltered – meaning they were sleeping in places not designed for human habitation, like cars, parks or abandoned buildings.
A different set of data comes from the Detroit Public Schools. The district looked at the entire 2022-2023 school year and found that roughly 1 in 19 students were unhoused at some point during that nine-month period — more than double the number in the 2019-2020 school year.

 A lack of temporary solutions

The lack of adequate funding and staffing in the city’s shelter system means unhoused people often struggle to access temporary shelter beds.
That includes kids. Even though the city prioritizes giving beds to the most vulnerable, the number of unsheltered children of school age has nearly tripled in three years, rising from an estimated 48 in the school year beginning in September 2019 to 142 in the school year beginning in September 2022. These figures align with the rise in unsheltered children recorded in the one-night Point-in-Time count, which increased from four in 2016 to 19 in 2024.
The end of COVID-era funding that prevented many evictions is likely to increase the need for shelter and put additional strain on Detroit’s response to the crisis.
 Gaps in a vital system

Children who experience housing insecurity are often caught in the middle of bureaucracy and failed regulation.
The mother of the children who died in February had reached out to the city in November 2024 when they were staying with a family member. The mother noted that she wanted to keep all five of her children together.
According to a report issued by the city, the Detroit Housing Authority did not follow up with her. Her situation was not considered an emergency at the time of contact since she was sheltered with family.
At the time of the call, the family was a Category 2: immediate risk of homelessness – in other words, not the highest priority under the emergency shelter grants guideline. If the city had deemed the situation an emergency, protocol would be to dispatch immediate support for the family.
The mother moved her family to the van after the request for help failed to provide a solution.
The Detroit mayor’s office admitted that the family fell through the cracks and promised to expand available shelter beds and require homeless outreach employees to visit any unhoused families that call for help.
“We have to make sure that we do everything possible to make sure that this doesn’t happen again,” Deputy Mayor Melia Howard told local media.
 More than 8 in 10 placed on wait list

According to records from the Coordinated Assessment Model Detroit, the system responsible for connecting individuals to shelters, 82% of calls do not result in immediate help but rather being placed on a shelter waitlist. Similar to instances across the country, the wait time is long.
Families in Detroit face an average wait of 130 days, while unaccompanied youth typically wait around 50 days.
The long wait for shelter has contributed to the rise in people living on the streets or in their vehicles. The number of unsheltered individuals — including both adults and children — doubled from 151 in 2015 to 305 in 2024. This trend of increasing unsheltered homelessness contrasts with the overall decline in the total number of homeless people in the city, which is down from a peak of 2,597 in 2015.

Children need safety and security to thrive.
Their access to stable housing depends on their parents and what the adults in their life are able to provide. As rents increase in the city, some children are left vulnerable.
 Stricter regulations

Over the past decade, Detroit, like many other U.S. cities, has experienced rising housing costs while wages fail to keep up, particularly for long-term residents.
Since 2021, the number of rentals in the city has increased by 51%.
Rents are also up. Since 2017, the average rent in Detroit has increased 55% for single-family homes and 43% for multifamily homes.
While inflation and increased maintenance costs contribute to this rise, stricter rental regulations like the heightened enforcement of housing codes, expanded tenant protections and higher compliance cost for landlords have played an important role.
Some landlords pass the expense of these regulations on to tenants, making housing less affordable. Others leave their properties vacant, pushing up prices by lessening the supply.
The current average fair market rent for a two-bedroom apartment in Detroit is $1,314 per month. For the typical household in the city, this basic shelter cost, not including utilities, makes up 41% of the household income.
For the lowest-income households, any unexpected expense can disrupt a delicate financial balance and lead to eviction and homelessness. Children in these situations often face major instability, moving between shelters – or, as in the case of the children who died in February, sleeping in cars.
This kind of displacement disrupts education, strains mental health and increases exposure to danger.
Detroit’s stricter housing regulations may have improved conditions for some renters, but a report by Outlier Media shows that only 8% of landlords are in compliance, leaving legacy residents in subpar rentals at higher prices.
And these new rules have victims who are too often ignored until tragedy strikes.

(Photo by Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star) The Legislature’s Transportation Committee is scheduled to hold a public hearing Tuesday afternoon for a swath of bills related to the Maine State Ferry Service, which has been wrestling with staff shortages, cancellations and other disruptions in recent years.
Last summer, leaders from six island communities wrote to Gov. Janet Mills asking her to help address the frequent ferry service cancellations, which were due in part to ongoing staffing challenges. The state ferry service connects six Midcoast island communities to the mainland. 
The Maine Department of Transportation also raised fares for the first time in five years last August. Though service reliability reportedly improved by the fall, the department was considering another fare hike this coming summer. 
While two of the proposals before the Legislature seek to expand the services to Matinicus Isle and Monhegan Island, there are multiple bills trying to address the operational issues that have plagued passengers in recent years. 
There are also proposals looking to address where ferries are docked each night, such as a bipartisan bill from House Minority Leader Billy Bob Faulkingham (R-Winter Harbor). LD 1231 would require the department to dock a ferry that carries vehicles overnight in Swan’s Island, Vinalhaven, North Haven and Islesboro for emergency medical, fire and law enforcement needs. 
The bill was introduced after the ferry service announced late last year that it was considering docking all of its ferries on the mainland overnight and instead providing emergency boats to serve the islands during that time. This potential shift from the decades-long practice of having boats spend the night at island ports to help islanders with medical emergencies reach hospitals raised concern among residents. 
The Hancock County Emergency Management Agency submitted written testimony in support of LD 1231, saying that having a ferry overnight on Swan’s Island has been “beneficial in innumerable instances over the many decades, aiding in all public safety operations to and for our at-risk, Hancock County offshore island communities of Swan’s Island and Frenchboro.”
Rep. Ann Matlack (D-St. George) will have a related bill before the committee that would allow a ferry to dock overnight at an island port or the mainland, while allowing the department to require a vessel to dock in a particular location for an emergency situation such as extreme weather. 
Increasing oversight and staff stipends
Several lawmakers are introducing proposals to increase oversight of ferry service operations, which are currently subject to an advisory board made up of one person from each of the islands served by the ferry service and three members representing the mainland communities. 
One bill, LD 1680 introduced by Rep. Holly Eaton (D-Deer Isle), would establish an independent committee that would be charged with ensuring accountability and transparency around key decisions for the ferry service. 
Similarly, Sen. Nicole Grohoski (D-Hancock) is introducing legislation that would require the ferry service to consult with the Maine State Ferry Advisory Board, which advises the Department of Transportation on matters related to the service, for budget matters, strategic planning and major operational decisions. LD 1731 would also require the ferry service to provide regular reports to the advisory board for review and feedback. 
As for the employee recruitment and retention issues that have plagued the ferry service, Rep. Michael Ray (D-Lincolnville) is proposing an annual stipend to all employees starting January 2026 equal to $5 per hour for the total hours worked in the previous year. LD 1268 also stipulates that the department can’t raise tolls to pay for the stipend. 
This comes after the department has already implemented other stipends and incentive programs providing up to $4,000 in bonus pay and increased overtime for ferry crews to combat the staff shortages. Workers have said they can make more money crewing ferries elsewhere, so there’s little incentive to stay and work in Maine.
Sen. Anne Beebe-Center (D-Knox) has a bill seeking to offer lifetime ferry passes for retired state ferry employees. LD 280 would provide two round trips per month for a passenger and a vehicle. 
The transportation committee is also scheduled to hear from Rep. Gary Friedmann (D-Bar Harbor) on his legislation (LD 1477) to provide an exemption from pilotage requirements for passenger ferry services between Bar Harbor, Maine, and Yarmouth, Nova Scotia.

(Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)New Hampshire spends more per public school student than all but five other states, according to a new report. At $22,252 spent per pupil on average in the 2023-2024 school year, it was surpassed by only New York, Vermont, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Connecticut. 
It’s a statistic that has been true for years, and one that Gov. Kelly Ayotte has frequently touted. 
“If you put together the total education funding from state and local and other sources, we’re in the top 10 in the nation in terms of funding public education,” she said during a Jan. 15 press conference, responding to a pair of lawsuits alleging the state does not spend enough. 
“… That’s the reality. Shouldn’t we look at the reality of the situation versus an artificial discussion on one piece of the funding?”
But the way New Hampshire raises that money sets it apart. Despite its high overall spending, the Granite State contributed the smallest proportion of state dollars and the largest proportion of local dollars per student of all 50 states in the same school year, the report, released by the National Education Association Tuesday, states. 
New Hampshire spent proportionally less state money per student than Missouri, Nebraska, South Dakota, Louisiana New York, Florida, Connecticut, Illinois, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, the next nine lowest-ranked states. 
The report confirms what residents of all political stripes have long known to be true: New Hampshire’s schools are driven by local property tax collections, not state spending. And it comes against the backdrop of an ongoing fight in the state budget process over how much public school students should receive each year for education — and who should pay for it. 
Democrats and progressives cite the low level of state support as evidence that the state is abandoning its financial responsibilities and downshifting costs to local taxpayers, and say the state should spend more. School districts and taxpayers have filed two separate lawsuits seeking to force the state to do so. 
But conservatives point to the state’s aging population and steadily declining enrollment to question why the school districts should receive more funding at all. And this year, House Republicans have pushed forward proposals to reduce the amount of state tax revenue that is sent to the Education Trust Fund and impose spending caps on school districts to require supermajorities to raise local spending.
Overall, New Hampshire schools spent 6.64% more per student at the start of the 2023-2024 school year than at the start of the 2022-2023 school year, the report shows. 
Each side has drawn different conclusions from the same reality. Those conclusions have inspired competing legislation.
House Republicans have proposed a slight increase in state spending to schools in the state budget. But they have also included a measure in the budget to reduce the amount of revenue that goes to the Education Trust Fund, from the $1.3 billion a year proposed by Ayotte to $937 million per year. That account, which funds public schools and other programs such as education freedom accounts, is currently running a surplus.
House Republicans have also added legislation into the budget that would limit school district budget increases to inflation, except in the case of a certain level of enrollment growth or a supermajority vote by residents at the district’s annual meeting. 
Democrats, meanwhile, have opposed that legislation and pushed for various bills to increase the amount the state would spend per pupil overall, add targeted funding to needier school districts, and require wealthier school districts to redistribute excess statewide property tax revenue to those with lower property values. 
The NEA report shows a number of other comparison points between New Hampshire and other states. 
Across the U.S., New Hampshire saw one of the highest year-to-year drops in enrollment from the start of the 2022-2023 school year to the start of the 2023-2024 school year: a 1.47% decline. In contrast, neighboring Maine experienced a 0.9 percent enrollment decline, Vermont saw enrollment stay steady, and Massachusetts measured a 0.1 percent increase. 
But New Hampshire has the second-lowest student-to-teacher ratio in the country, after Vermont, the report states. There are on average 10.5 students per teacher in New Hampshire schools; Wyoming, in contrast, was last with 12.6 students per teacher. 
In the 2022-2023 school year, there were 10.7 students per teacher. New Hampshire’s 2.19% drop in student-to-teacher ratio is one of the largest in the country. 
Public school teacher pay in the Granite State is nearly at the national median. New Hampshire teachers made an average of $67,170 per year in 2023-2024, which ranked 24th nationally, according to the report. That amount is up by 4.7% from the year before. 
And the report indicates a wide spread of how much per year states spend on public school students. New Hampshire’s $22,252 in the 2023-2024 school year was dwarfed by New York’s $31,514, but came in well ahead of 50th-ranked Utah, which spent $11,289 per student.
Since taking office, President Donald Trump has vowed to dismantle the Department of Education and send the federal grant money back to states in the form of block grants, which has led to mixed reactions in the Granite State. But in New Hampshire, federal spending makes up just 8.4% of per pupil spending, the 45th lowest proportion in the country.

North Carolinians are generally of two very different minds on the gun violence that plagues our society. While polls consistently show that most favor stronger laws to regulate firearms, a loud and determined minority opposes virtually any regulation.
Here, however, is at least one simple prevention step that all sides should be able to endorse: installing inside locks on the doors to college classrooms.
As NC State professor Walter Robinson explained in a recent NC Newsline op-ed, he and his faculty colleagues have repeatedly asked school leaders to install locks in all classrooms and lecture halls so that instructors and students can shelter in place in the event of a campus shooting.
Unfortunately, and amazingly, however, the requests have been rejected. The reason: cost.
And it’s hard to overstate just how absurd this is.
The bottom line: In a multi-billion dollar system, it’s ridiculous that university leaders didn’t long ago invest in such a simple and basic safety precaution. Further delay is inexcusable.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-29 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"How Trump’s coal policies will impact CT, a state with no coal power plants",Jan Ellen Spiegel,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/29/trump-coal-industry-policy-ct/,Many of the coal-fired power plants the Trump administration exempted from emissions reductions requirements are upwind from CT.,"There is one operating coal-fired power plant left in New England, a far cry from the widespread use of coal that began nearly a century-and-a-half ago. That plant — the Merrimack Power Station in Bow, N.H., just south of Concord — is slated to close in June 2028.
So it stands to reason that President Donald J. Trump’s recent series of executive orders, designed to make greater use of coal for electricity and fire up a rapidly dying industry in the U.S., would elicit a collective shrug from the region.
Not from Connecticut.
Connecticut, more than any state east of the Mississippi, has faced persistent poor air quality. It is caused in large part by emissions from power plants in the central part of the country — especially the more than 200 that are coal-fired, the most polluting form of energy generation.
Paul Farrell, director of planning and standards in the Air Division of Connecticut’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, DEEP, is certainly not shrugging.
Modeling from the Environmental Protection Agency, he said, has shown that on days Connecticut has its worst ozone pollution — the notorious smog and dirty air that occurs in the heat of summer — 90% to 95% of the air that flows into the state is already above the federal standard for pollution levels when it gets here.
“We get that long range transport from the Midwest and Western states and even Texas,” he said. “Then that combines with vehicular pollution coming up the I-95 corridor, and it all comes to a head right over New York City, that adds that pollution load into it. And then it just wafts into our state.”
Indeed, the just-released 2025 State of the Air report by the American Lung Association, ranks Southwestern Connecticut as having the 16th worst ozone pollution in the country. Four of Connecticut’s eight counties receive F grades for ozone, three receive D grades and one manages a C.
The state had 23 days last year with ozone levels above allowable federal standards. That’s the highest number recorded in recent years. Only the northern and eastern parts of the state meets 2008 ozone standards. No part of the state meets the tighter 2015 standards.

The Trump administration has given exemptions to about 70 coal plants to continue operating under the current emissions standards for at least another couple of years beyond 2027, when tighter emissions regulations put in place by the Biden administration are slated to take effect.  Among the plants that are exempt are many of the midwestern and mid-Atlantic plants directly upwind from Connecticut, as well as several plants that are the most polluting plants in the country. 
New Hampshire’s Merrimack is also on the list — a head-scratcher even to its owner, Granite Shore Power; they never requested an exemption because they already have one. With closure slated for 2028, the government didn’t require expensive pollution upgrades for that short time period.
“Without this [earlier] exemption, Merrimack Station would have been forced to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars for monitoring equipment for a plant that will be closing months later,” a spokesman for Granite Shore said in an email statement. 
The spokesman said there is no plan to delay Merrimack’s closing, which the Trump actions would also allow. Plans to transition the plant to a solar and storage operation remain on schedule, and the coal operation will continue to comply with emissions requirements.
In March, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin issued a series of 31 environmental regulations the administration wanted to revisit and/or rollback. Included among them was one that set stricter limits on mercury and air toxics standards, or MATS, for coal- and oil-fired power plants. The standards he targeted were finalized a year ago by the Biden administration and would have cut emissions of mercury, which is known to cause several human health problems, carbon dioxide — a key climate change contributor — nitrogen oxide, fine particulate matter and a number of metals.
“What I foresee is that this two-year extension is but a first step of a two-step process that Lee Zeldin is orchestrating with the result being that these plants don’t have to make a single more ton or pound of pollution reductions,” said Joseph Goffman, assistant administrator of the EPA Office of Air and Radiation during the Biden administration. He said Zeldin’s plan to “reconsider” the MATS rule “was his way of telegraphing very, very, very unsubtly that his intention was to have the reconsideration process result in the rules being repealed altogether.”
The extension of lifelines to coal is just one of the rule rollbacks and reconsiderations proposed by the Trump EPA that could have an impact on air quality in Connecticut.
Among the most concerning is reconsideration of the Good Neighbor Plan, which would have forced 23 states upwind from Connecticut to reduce interstate transport of air pollution from power plants and other polluting industries. It is currently under a stay the Supreme Court issued last June when the justices sent it back down to lower courts. The federal Clean Air Act itself, now more than 55 years old, contains a good neighbor provision to limit interstate transport of air pollutants.
Another would reconsider the standards for motor vehicle tailpipe emissions the Biden administration tightened for cars, light and heavy-duty trucks. That has DEEP’s Farrell even more concerned than the specter of prolonged coal plant emissions.
“Without a doubt, the biggest public health/air quality impact would come from EPA significantly rolling back the mobile source standards on cars and trucks,” he said. The transportation sector accounts for the bulk of Connecticut’s pollution and ozone problems — about 67%. That’s partly because the region has eliminated coal.
“To address transport, we need a serious federal partner,” Farrell said. “Without the federal government controlling federal sources that are beyond any state’s jurisdiction, we don’t have a hope for meeting our air quality standards for ozone.”
The Trump executive action also opens the door to new coal plants. But the notion that the region would use coal again — even as a backup or in one of the existing power plants that can use more than one fuel — isn’t getting much traction here.
“Absolutely not,” said Dan Dolan, president of the New England Power Generators Association. “No. And I can underline that and an exclamation point. No. The dual fuel facilities that do exist are now gas and oil.”
The only exception in the region is the Merrimack Plant and its sister plant – the Schiller Station in Portsmouth, N.H., which no longer operates and will be redeveloped as a battery energy storage system.
“I see no future for coal in New England once those facilities permanently retire in the next few years,” Dolan said.
New England began its large-scale pullback from coal in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The last of the plants save Merrimack — the Bridgeport Harbor Station along with Salem, Brayton Point and Mt. Tom stations in Massachusetts — closed more recently.
Coal broadly is on the decline. Its use in the U.S. for power generation has fallen by about 67% since 2007, according to data from the Energy Information Administration. Its use fell below gas 10 years ago and is now only about one-third of gas.
In the last couple of years coal usage has also fallen below nuclear power, with wind closing in and hydro and solar not far behind. Wind and solar combined overtook coal usage last year for the first time, according to the energy think tank, Ember.

The biggest reason for coal’s decline in the U.S. is widely ascribed to one factor — it’s been priced out by cheap natural gas brought on by the fracking revolution which started around 2005.
“This was not the U.S. government saying ‘shut down these coal plants,’” said Michael Oristaglio, an energy expert at Yale University who founded the Energy Studies Multidisciplinary program and more recently is with the Carbon Containment Lab at Yale. “This was utility, power company owners basically looking at it and saying, ‘does it make sense to build coal or even to use coal anymore? You can convert a coal plant to natural gas.’”
Multiple analyses show coal plants to be among the more expensive forms of power. They are also slower to start up than gas, making them less suitable than gas for emergency — so-called peaker — power. 
“I can see the ones that own these old plants … saying, ‘all right, we have a little more leeway to run them.’ But I don’t see anyone building new coal,” Oristaglio said.
The U.S. does have the largest coal reserves, but China continues to use and build the most coal power, some of it in other nations. Oristaglio also said China recently has been adding carbon capture and other filter equipment to its newer plants, something that may be less worthwhile on the much older plants in the U.S. Ironically, China also has more utility-scale solar than any other country.

But with the economic and environmental focus, the issue that often gets overlooked is the outsized health impacts of pollution from coal plants. Research presented in the publication Science determined the number of U.S. deaths from 1999 to 2020 attributable to particulate matter from coal represented a more-than two times greater mortality risk than exposure to the same fine particulates from all sources.
But there are many more pollutants in coal and the effect is cumulative, said Goffman, the former EPA official.
“What’s at stake for public health is the fact that cumulatively, and so simultaneously, people are exposed to multiple pollutants, whether they’re part of fine particles or mercury or other air toxics or ozone,” he said.
“What we’re driving towards is improved public health outcomes. So I think that often gets lost. I think in the air quality story — it’s really about public health,” said Emma Cimino, DEEP’s deputy commissioner of environmental quality.
While DEEP points out that air pollution in Connecticut is vastly diminished from what it was decades ago, with so many rule rollbacks under consideration, the concern is that the strains on health might become more noticeable.
“As you start to see those tools disappear or be pulled back or even threatened, I think it’s possible that the progress slows,” Cimino said. “Hopefully it doesn’t reverse, but certainly it puts the region on a much slower track to meeting our air quality standards.”
Farrell at DEEP agreed. “At the end of the day, really we want to just remind people that this is about public health,” he said. “It’s really an all-the-above sort of solution. We can’t pick just power plants. We can’t pick just cars. You can’t just pick industrials. Everyone needs to contribute to the solution.
“I think people may have taken the environment and public health a little bit for granted, and we really shouldn’t be in a position where we need to wait for rivers to catch on fire again before we wake up and say, ‘wait a minute – this has to stop.’”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AP676787172687-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-29 05:01:17.847767

A new GOP proposal lays the groundwork for digital tokens to become more mainstream.
With the stock market’s volatility, investment experts suggest diversifying your portfolio. Ohio politicians are trying to give more incentives for that, too.
“We are authorizing the use of cryptocurrency as just another way to keep up with the current practices that are generally accepted by the American public and by the people of the state of Ohio,” State Treasurer Robert Sprague said.
Sprague and Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose are trying to show the state is “an innovative leader,” eventually allowing Ohioans to use it to pay for state fees and services, like taxes.
The pair is proposing that state agencies be allowed to accept crypto, but it is not mandatory.
Although it could eventually get to taxes, it would start slower with just the secretary’s office, meaning business filings.
“My office is prepared to be the first in state government to begin accepting Bitcoin and to do so immediately,” LaRose said.
So, what exactly is cryptocurrency?
Crypto is a “peer-to-peer digital currency, and it’s outside of an independent central governing authority,” Case Western Reserve University Veale Institute for Entrepreneurship’s Michael Goldberg said.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXThe professor explained that the online “coins” are stored in a digital database known as a blockchain. Like stocks, they can be traded and sold. One Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, fluctuates and was worth more than $94,000 as of 6 p.m. on Friday.
“Oftentimes with Bitcoin, there are less fees associated with it,” he said.
Two other crypto proposals are being heard in the Ohio House, with one trying to make sure that fees stay low. Both sponsored by state Rep, Steve Demetriou, R-Bainbridge Twp., one bill would “protect” cryptocurrency from putting certain taxes on it. The other would allow the treasurer to invest in “high value digital assets” in the general or reserve fund.
But because crypto spikes and falls rapidly, Goldberg warned that payments could be hard to calculate.


Government accountability advocate Catherine Turcer, with Common Cause Ohio, said this isn’t safe for the state’s finances.
“It is electronic money, anything could happen to it,” Turcer said. “Whether it’s hacking, deflation — when you pay on April 15 your taxes, and it nosedives on the 16th — it’s just too volatile.”
The treasurer explained that their system would immediately change the currency format once submitted.
“Our mission here is to have a thoughtful, safe and secure process for accepting this cryptocurrency and converting it immediately into United States dollars for the state treasury to hold,” Sprague said.
In 2024, the FBI reported $9.3 billion in losses due to cryptocurrency cybercrime.
There will always be financial fraud, Goldberg said, but when it’s online, it’s much more difficult to get back.
“Crypto is still a bit of the wild, wild west; it’s basically completely deregulated,” he said. “If somebody gets defrauded, it may be a bit more challenging for them to recoup their assets.”
It’s too risky, Turcer continued.
“Money is worth the money we say it’s worth,” she said.
Bitcoin is based on the dollar’s price, Goldberg said.
Asked whether the putting Bitcoin forward would undermine the U.S. dollar, Sprague paused, then said no.
“Having a digital asset like Bitcoin really doesn’t have anything to do with necessarily the value of the dollar,” he answered. “The number of dollars is fixed. Just because you’re allowing a transaction to occur in Bitcoin and then converting it to dollars will do nothing in terms of the strength or the weakness of the United States dollar.”
Flashbacks
This isn’t the first time the treasurer’s office tried to make crypto work.
Back in 2018, then-Treasurer Josh Mandel decided that Ohioans could pay their taxes in crypto. Within a year, the program was suspended because Attorney General Dave Yost issued an opinion that Mandel didn’t follow correct protocol in setting up the system.
“We’ll have a real process to this,” Sprague said in the recent press conference. “We’ll have a transparent process.”
Turcer is also getting reminded of the early 2000s, she said.
“We had alternative investments,” she said, referencing Coingate. “We were investing in rare coins — and you know what? The state of Ohio got ripped off.”
Coingate was a scam in which the Ohio Bureau of Workers’ Compensation invested hundreds of millions in “rare coins.” The investments were run by people aligned with the Ohio GOP. This eventually led to millions of dollars being lost and Gov. Bob Taft being the first Ohio governor charged with a crime while in office.
Crypto isn’t random, Goldberg said, and it’s been around — and profitable — for years. According to Forbes, the global cryptocurrency market cap is more than $3 trillion.
“When Bitcoin came out, I think there were a lot of questions,” Goldberg said. “And it’s held up.”
Why now?
Both Sprague and LaRose were asked if they or members of their staff own assets in cryptocurrency or if they invest in cryptocurrency-related companies.
“I wish,” Sprague laughed, and denied owning or investing in crypto.
“I do,” LaRose said. “I’m somebody that has been curious about this technology and this form of currency for a long time.”
He referenced financial disclosure documents, which are filed in May, that he said would show his financial involvement in crypto.
“I think at this point I own like $10,000 worth of Bitcoin that I’ve been able to amass by putting a little bit of my paycheck aside each month,” he said.
OCJ/WEWS requested his previous disclosures. None showed any crypto investments explicitly. He had only started investing in 2024, his team said on Friday.
LaRose isn’t the only politician who owns crypto and promotes it. President Donald Trump released his own coin, which just got a boost in the market since he offered a private dinner with him to the coin’s largest investors.
“It is interesting that (LaRose is) proposing this — it both curries favor with the president and could actually make him richer,” Turcer said. “The more people participate in the Bitcoin system, the more the value raises.”
The secretary argued that this is just to move the state forward.
“Ohioans have accepted this as a real form of currency, a form of exchange that they want to use,” he said.
Ohio gubernatorial candidate Vivek Ramaswamy is also a big fan of the currency. Both LaRose and Sprague have been on the campaign trail with him.
The two were asked how the measure fits in with any interests they have in becoming Ramaswamy’s pick for lieutenant governor. Sprague said he hadn’t talked to Ramaswamy about it.
“This is something that we’re working on, together, through our respective offices, to modernize our offices and make it easier for the people of the state of Ohio… So this is something we’re doing internally,” Sprague said. “We’re not doing this on the campaign trail.”
LaRose was less enthused with the question.

“I’m not gonna dignify any speculation about who Mr. Ramaswamy may or may not pick as his running mate,” he said, also saying he hadn’t spoken to the candidate about his proposal. “The reason I’m supporting him is because I appreciate his intellect and his policy stances and if this is something that he’s a fan of as well, that doesn’t surprise me.”
The Board of Deposit, which includes Sprague, Yost and Auditor Keith Faber, will meet in the coming weeks to review the proposal.

(File photo by Amanda Gokee/New Hampshire Bulletin)When we read or hear a claim repeated over and over again, we are more likely to think it is true even when it is not true. It’s called the illusory truth effect, and it’s why repetition is a fundamental tool used, yes, in politics, but especially in consumer product advertising. And more and more it’s being used by corporations to highlight their sunny side whenever the corporation’s reputation as a good corporate citizen comes into question.
A case in point is Casella’s recent campaign to convince New Hampshire that when it comes to the environment, Casella is one of the “good guys.” The company has unleashed what amounts to a public relations blitz, emphasizing its commitment to environmental sustainability.
Just in the last week Casella offered up a “Special Advertising Section” in New Hampshire Magazine titled “Casella Comes Full Circle for its Anniversary,” suggesting that though it started in the trash business it is now in the sustainability business. That comes on top of a number of other recent actions by the company, including a national press release announcing its “2024 Sustainability Report”; a mailer to residents of New Hampshire’s North Country titled “Driving Sustainability in NH”; and a $1.5 million donation to the University of Vermont for which the University gave it naming rights to establish the “Casella Center for Circular Economy and Sustainability at UVM.”
All this smacks of “greenwashing,” a practice roughly defined as a company using corporate money and its public relations apparatus to mislead people into believing that it is more environmentally friendly than it actually is.
Casella’s management and its directors may very well be committed to sustainability as a concept, but it is a huge stretch for the company to promote itself as being in the sustainability business. Casella’s core business is trash collection and landfilling, essentially the antithesis of sustainability. According to Casella’s most recent filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission, only 20% of its revenues come from business activities (such as recycling) that are even remotely connected to sustainability.
And there is little to no indication that going forward Casella will focus on sustainability. It tells its investors that its growth will be fueled by acquisitions of trash collection service territories, necessitating the need for construction and/or expansion of new landfills across the Northeast.
Casella likes to talk about its origin story: It started in 1975 with one truck picking up trash in Rutland, Vermont. In 50 years it has grown to be a $7 billion corporation, with nearly $1.5 billion in annual revenue.
What the company does not like to talk about is all of the environmental problems it has created, and all of the enemies it has made along the way to becoming a $7 billion corporation.
Casella has trash operations all over the Northeast, but it is an especially big player in northern New England. In New Hampshire, it operates one of three major landfills — the NCES landfill in Bethlehem.
The NCES landfill has been beset by environmental problems. It was only recently discovered that holes in the landfill liner were created during the construction of the landfill some 30 years ago; the consequences for contamination of nearby water supplies and groundwater are as yet unknown. And it took Casella two full days to discover that the largest leachate spill in New England (150,000-plus gallons) occurred at NCES in 2021. Now four years later, the extent of soil and groundwater contamination from the accident is still under investigation.
These are not isolated incidents. New Hampshire’s Department of Environmental Services (DES) notified NCES that it had found hundreds of permit violations for leachate management during a recent two-year period. In contrast, DES found only a few handfuls of similar violations at other New Hampshire landfills, including Mount Carberry and Turnkey, which other than management competence are similar to NCES.
With that kind of record, it’s little wonder that Casella would want to use its public relations apparatus to bill itself as in the sustainability business. This is especially true given the fact that it has been trying for six years to bully our state to approve permits for it to build a new mega-landfill (the GSL project) in Dalton. It has even suggested that it would not invest in a newly planned recycling center in downstate New Hampshire unless it gets permits to build GSL.
It’s to our great good luck that we now have a governor who is standing up to that bullying, a redirected DES that is more focused on environmental protection, and an educated populace that is able to recognize greenwashing for what it is.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_7508-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-29 05:01:17.847767

One of the largest utility scandals in U.S. history has remained largely unknown outside Ohio — until now.







Last week, HBO released a documentary that covers the long, sordid saga, which led to the federal criminal convictions of a former speaker of the Ohio House of Representatives and a former head of the Ohio Republican Party.


“The Dark Money Game: Ohio Confidential” follows the story of how utility companies used roughly $60 million in bribes to public officials to secure more than $1.5 billion in ratepayer subsidies for aging, uneconomical coal and nuclear plants.


Canary Media contributing reporter Kathiann Kowalski has spent more than a decade covering the House Bill 6 saga and Ohio utilities’ other efforts to get ratepayer-funded bailouts. Dan Haugen, a senior editor at Canary Media, recently spoke with Kowalski about her reactions to the new film.


The following transcript has been edited slightly for length and clarity.
Haugen: So, you watched this new HBO documentary ​“Ohio Confidential” the other day. What about it is still on your mind today? 


Kowalski: I was struck by the focus they used of how dark money and gerrymandering undermined voters’ will in the wake of a 2010 Supreme Court case that opened the door for unlimited corporate spending on political campaigns, subject to few conditions.


Haugen: Was there any factual information that wasn’t previously reported by you or others?


Kowalski: A lot of it was very familiar, given the fact that I had read through most of the exhibits, read Neil Clark’s book, gone to part of the trial, and been following this for years. There was an interesting scene where they were able to get footage of the FBI observing a private detective that former Ohio GOP Chair Matt Borges and company had apparently retained to follow Tyler Fehrman, who was a witness in the federal criminal case.


Haugen: Did the film change your understanding of the HB 6 story in any way? 













Kowalski: They did a decent job connecting some dots. I had not thought through how former Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder’s actions also enabled a far-right coalition in the Legislature to push through an anti-abortion law in 2019. It gave me a broader perspective on the anti-democracy angle of the public corruption, but my understanding of the basic story did not change.


Haugen: Where did the abortion legislation appear on the timeline?


Kowalski: The way that the filmmaker presents it is that once Householder helped these people get the anti-abortion legislation passed, he then had people who felt they owed him something. I looked at the timing, and Gov. Mike DeWine signed the anti-abortion legislation the day before House Bill 6 was introduced.


Haugen: One of the biggest unknowns still today is what, if any, role the governor’s office had in all this. You and others have reported on a December 2018 dinner with FirstEnergy executives, DeWine, and Jon Husted, just weeks before the latter two took office as governor and lieutenant governor. Neither has been charged nor accused of any wrongdoing. Does the film shed any new light on their connections?


Kowalski: The filmmakers include an allegation of $5 million going from FirstEnergy to help elect DeWine. And they note a disclaimer from DeWine’s office that it was all within the confines of what was allowed under the law. That’s basically about all they did. It was not a deep dive into the governor’s actions or Husted, who was recently appointed to fill Vice President JD Vance’s U.S. Senate seat. I think maybe they wanted to keep their story tightly focused on the legislature and what has been proven in the first federal criminal case. That also avoids having to include more disclaimers about how nothing’s been proven against others, everybody denies wrongdoing, etc., etc.



Haugen: So is this something you would recommend that your readers watch? 


Kowalski: Yes. It’s compelling storytelling. It does a good job of explaining things in plain terms. There’s a limited cast of characters, and you can follow the story. If House Bill 6 is new to you, it’s definitely worth watching. And it’s certainly important now as we’re looking at not only the continued use of dark money in politics through either nonprofits or limited liability corporations, but also, with technology, likely more ways to cover up potential bribes. So, yes, people should be aware of this.

(Getty Images)When residents of Wichita’s 29th and Grove neighborhood were told their groundwater was contaminated by carcinogens, it wasn’t just an environmental disaster — it was a breach of trust. It shook the foundation that communities are built on: the right to live safely, the right to breathe freely, the right to know the truth.
After tireless advocacy, $3.5 million has been secured to fund health screenings for those affected. It is a needed and important step. But we must be honest: Screenings alone are not justice.
If we are serious about restoring what has been broken, we have to look deeper. We have to ask hard questions:

How will these funds be distributed?
Who will be prioritized?
Will the process be transparent?
Will the people most harmed lead the solutions?

We’ve seen how mishandled recovery funds deepen harm. The national opioid settlements taught us that when money is moved without community voices, it’s often spent inefficiently, unevenly, and inequitably.
Those closest to the crisis must be closest to the power.
That’s why the response to 29th and Grove must be guided by clear, community-centered best practices:

Center the people most harmed. Focus all abatement efforts around their needs, leadership, and healing.
Prioritize free culturally responsive, and evidence-informed care rooted in best practices.
Establish an independent advisory board made up of affected residents.
Require public reporting of all grant distributions and health outcomes.
Invest in long-term monitoring, not one-time fixes.
Minimize administrative waste so that the majority of dollars reach people directly.

The urgency we face right now cannot be overstated. Every day that passes without real action is another day families in our community live with fear, uncertainty, and preventable harm.
That’s why we didn’t wait. Members of the Safe Streets Wichita Coalition, mutual aid groups, and other local community-based groups came together and moved. While officials debated and delayed, we organized free air purifier workshops — providing real tools to our elders, children, teachers, and neighbors in northeast Wichita to help reduce exposure and create healthier indoor spaces.
It wasn’t a perfect solution — but it was something people could use immediately. It was action rooted in evidence, in harm reduction, and in community care. It was the difference between waiting for permission and answering the call ourselves.
Just like during the overdose crisis and early days of the epidemic, our coalition didn’t stand by.
We organized.
We responded.
We showed up.
Because when lives are at risk, community care cannot wait — and neither will we.
This spirit — the willingness to step up when institutions fall short — has to shape the road ahead. Right now, we have a rare chance to show what real community repair looks like: honest, responsive, and deeply rooted in justice.
If we truly believe that health is a human right, then these dollars cannot be treated like charity. They are just a small down payment on a much larger moral debt — a debt that’s long overdue. The residents of 29th and Grove deserve nothing less.

(Photo by Morgan Trau, WEWS.)Just as Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) was never really about improving government efficiency – quite the opposite, in fact – the 5,000-plus page biennial budget rewrite the Ohio House slapped together and sent to the Ohio Senate was never really about improving the common good of everyday Ohioans.
It was about advancing the hard-right priorities of powerful politicians who answer to big money – not constituents in gerrymandered voting districts.   
Yet even for the supremely arrogant kingpin of state government, Ohio House Speaker Matt Huffman, the budget bill passed out of the General Assembly’s lower chamber on April 9 was beyond the pale in cruelty and cunning.
It is the Ohio version of Project 2025 with all the unsparing, exacting hallmarks of the Trumpian blueprint, recklessly destroying federal institutions and agencies that, however imperfectly, protect, serve and promote the welfare of we, the people.
But that’s the MAGA nihilistic way and Ohio Republicans are doing their part in tearing down what made Ohio great. Huffman, the Lima Republican who runs the state under the one party rule he rigged with unconstitutional redistricting, is in the catbird seat calling the shots. The speaker (and former Ohio Senate president) lords over the GOP supermajority in the Ohio House while his political protégé, Ohio Senate President Rob McColley, accommodates the boss.
Huffman, who once said the quiet part out loud about GOP gerrymandering (“We can kind of do what we want”), now has a straight runway to enact his blueprint on Ohioans whether they like it or not. I suspect his budget proposal will survive, largely intact, with the House caucus he controls and the one he led with an iron fist for four years in the Senate.
Local public schools, public libraries, clean drinking initiatives, lead poisoning prevention, pediatric cancer funding, home visits for new mothers, food assistance programs and health care coverage for the poor are all on the chopping block in Huffman’s House Bill 96.
What wasn’t on his slash-and-burn budget list were government handouts (taxpayer-funded vouchers) to upper-income private school families. But doling out unlimited government subsidies to the affluent, whose darlings are already attending and affording elite high schools and religious institutions, is Huffman’s thing.
He is on a crusade to shower hundreds of millions of public education dollars on unaccountable private and predominantly religious schools – despite clear prohibitions against such a diversion of public money in the Ohio Constitution.
“No religious or other sect, or sects, shall ever have any exclusive right to, or control of, any part of the school funds of this state,” the state constitution reads.
But Huffman has defied the state constitution before with impunity (on gerrymandering) and did so again by ramrodding his universal voucher bonanza through the legislature for everyone, regardless of income. Never mind that the giant state giveaway – to offset private school costs for the well-off – blew a $1 billion dollar hole in the general revenue budget its first year.
Never mind that public schools in the state, forever cash-strapped and dependent on tapped out property owners, labored under an unequal, inadequate school funding formula (ruled unconstitutional by the Ohio Supreme Court) for 26 years before a bipartisan coalition agreed to a phased-in funding solution over six years. The final two-year phase was expected to be fully funded in the current biennial budget negotiations.
Not under Huffman. Not in a state where the Republican lock on power is absolute and the Statehouse heavyweight has free, unchecked rein to flout the law and grossly defund the public schools that educate the vast majority of Ohio students (approximately 1.6 million) while greatly expanding appropriations for private school tuitions, homeschooling expenses and even unchartered, nonpublic schools with deeply held religious beliefs that are virtually unregulated by the state!
Funding for the “thorough and efficient system of common schools” state government is constitutionally obligated to secure – and that would have been secured under the Fair School Funding Plan from 2021 – shrank by over $400 million. House Republicans added insult to injury by robbing fiscally prudent school districts of surplus revenue for future planning to give uneven, one-time property tax relief in some districts and not others. They also ensured that property tax owners will face more school levies from local districts forced to deplete that surplus operating revenue. Sound policymaking (or genuine property tax relief) this is not.
But it is a gut punch to public schools, just as a $100 million reduction in funding to Ohio’s public libraries is, or cutting over $22 million from the Help Me Grow program is for in-home visits to newborn babies to mitigate the state’s infant mortality problem. But Matt Huffman’s Ohio-centric Project 2025 is also a kick in the teeth to democratic self-governance.
Last budget go-around Republican lawmakers stripped the Ohio Board of Education of most of its power and gave it to the governor. This two-year budget proposes cutting all 11 elected members of the board and shrinking the gubernatorial appointments from nine to five. This is Matt Huffman removing voters entirely from state education policy as he engineers total opaque privatization of Ohio schools.
How is silencing the electorate improving the common good?

(Getty Images)Nebraska stands at a critical juncture, with our economic future increasingly at stake. Recent criticism by State Auditor Mike Foley regarding the fiscal impact of business tax incentives is another troubling example in an alarming trend of attacks undermining economic development.
The Greater Omaha Chamber believes strongly that strategic economic development programs, including robust business tax incentives, are not merely beneficial. They are essential.
Foley’s report casts doubt on the value of these incentives. It overlooked the careful and transparent consideration these programs have received.
Nebraska’s Legislature and the Nebraska Economic Forecasting Advisory Board consistently factor these incentives into revenue projections, thoroughly assessing both costs and returns.
Paying for performance
These are well-established “pay-for-performance” incentives. Nebraska taxpayers incur no cost unless recipient businesses fulfill predetermined benchmarks including job creation and major capital investment.
We currently over-perform in economic development wins with a very limited number of tools for this purpose. Thus, far from being fiscal liabilities, incentives tie to proven economic outcomes and benefits for our state.
Unfortunately, the auditor’s critique fuels a narrative that disregards the competitive nature of today’s economic landscape. Nebraska now ranks 40th nationally in incentives awarded, according to Site Selection Group. This position places us well behind more aggressive neighboring states with targeted incentive programs. If we continue down this path, we risk falling further behind, jeopardizing not only potential economic opportunities but also the stability of existing businesses that drive our state’s economy.
Economic development matters
Economic development is not an abstract luxury. It is the engine that powers every aspect of our quality of life in Nebraska, from job creation and infrastructure to education and property tax relief.
Yet a disturbing climate at the State Capitol increasingly dismisses the importance of these development tools, labeling them as optional or expendable. This short-sighted view poses threats as companies weighing Nebraska for investment and expansion consider how supportive and stable the business environment is.
Every day, the Greater Omaha Chamber and economic development organizations across Nebraska witness firsthand how economic incentives attract new businesses, encourage local expansions and create thousands of jobs for Nebraskans.
These jobs provide economic security and stability for families, generate substantial new tax revenues and create vibrant communities capable of supporting quality public services and education.
Fighting brain drain
It is these opportunities that serve as plug in our brain drain challenge.
Let us be clear: Transparent oversight and accountability for public funds are indispensable. No one disputes the importance of regularly assessing the effectiveness of economic programs.
However, we strongly oppose political attacks that distort the record and ignore the essential role these incentives have played in Nebraska’s growth.
Nebraska’s elected officials, business leaders and communities must rally around our proven economic development programs. We must recommit to a vision of strategic, forward-looking growth, ensuring Nebraska can effectively compete and thrive.
Now is the time to bolster — not undermine — our state’s competitiveness through strategic incentives that foster sustained economic growth. Our businesses and all Nebraskans deserve nothing less.

More than 3 million people with Medicare could be eligible for the difficult-to-find and expensive weight-loss drug under new guidance which can cover the medication for patients who are obese or those who have a history of heart disease and are at risk of a heart attack or stroke.  (Photo Illustration by Scott Olson/Getty Images)The Trump administration this month scrapped a Biden-era proposal that would have required state Medicaid programs and allowed federal Medicare to pay for some GLP-1s for obesity treatment. Instead, state Medicaid programs will retain the choice of whether to cover the high-priced medications for their residents.
The drugs, which have historically been prescribed to diabetic patients, also help patients lose weight and have grown in popularity among doctors and patients. But they are generally too expensive for most people to afford without insurance.
While doctors and patient advocates say these drugs are critical to helping patients struggling with obesity and can save money in the long run by reducing comorbidities such as heart disease, others say the medications are just too expensive for most states to afford. More than a dozen state Medicaid programs have opted to cover GLP-1s for obesity treatment, and the proposed Biden rule would have asked all states to figure out how to pay for them. But now, advocates fear these drugs may continue to be out of reach for many.
“It’s unfortunate that they’re excluding a whole class of medications that seem to have a tremendous number of health benefits to patients,” Dr. Nicholas Pennings, chair of family medicine at Campbell University in Buies Creek, North Carolina, said in an interview.














I think that’s just part of the inherent bias towards the treatment of people with obesity.

GLP-1s, which stand for glucagon-like peptide-1, are a class of drugs that balance blood sugar levels. They’ve long been prescribed to patients with Type 2 diabetes. But since the drugs also curb hunger signals, doctors may prescribe these drugs — including popular brands Wegovy and Ozempic — to help patients lose weight.
Medicaid is a joint federal-state funded program that mostly serves people with lower incomes under the age of 65 or who have a disability. The federal Medicare program focuses primarily on people above the age of 65, no matter their income.
How and whether to cover expensive treatments and drugs can be a significant deliberation for state Medicaid directors. In North Carolina, where 70% of people struggle with being overweight or obese, officials opted to begin covering the drugs for weight loss last year. That coverage has been a game changer, said Pennings, who continues to treat Medicaid patients.
“They are expensive, but there’s a lot of other medications that are expensive too. Why is it that obesity medications and diabetes medications are being selected out?” Pennings said. “I think that’s just part of the inherent bias towards the treatment of people with obesity, feeling like it’s cheating or not necessary.”
The list price for Wegovy is around $1,300 per month, and for Ozempic, around $1,000. Even so, the skyrocketing popularity of these drugs has prompted at least 14 state Medicaid departments to begin covering these drugs to treat obesity in the past decade.
In addition to North Carolina, those states include California, Delaware, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Virginia and Wisconsin.
An annual survey of Medicaid directors from health policy research group KFF recently found that half of the 47 responding states not already covering the drugs were considering doing so.
In January, the National Association of Medicaid Directors told the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services that state Medicaid departments had “significant concerns over the fiscal impacts” of the Biden proposal to require coverage of GLP-1s, and “strongly recommend that CMS maintain the current state option to cover or not cover anti-obesity medications.”
But others say covering the drugs will yield long-term savings.
John Cawley, a professor of economics and public policy at Cornell University who has studied the economic impacts of obesity, has found that obesity essentially doubles a person’s annual health care costs due to comorbidities such as heart disease, fatty liver disease and kidney disease.
He’s found that weight loss among those with extreme obesity, with a BMI of 40 or higher, can yield substantial reductions in medical care costs.
Cawley added that state Medicaid programs “have a lot of flexibility” in ensuring costs don’t get out of control, by, for example, covering a newly available generic version of GLP-1s, requiring prior authorization, and asking patients to try behavioral programs before getting a prescription.
North Carolina’s Medicaid department began covering GLP-1s for obesity in August. The state has been able to afford GLP-1 coverage by negotiating rebates, or discounts, with drug manufacturers, and by getting the federal government to cover some costs. Department leaders think lowering obesity will save the state money in the long run, said Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for North Carolina Medicaid.
He said that one of the benefits of Medicaid is that “we get to choose, as a state, where we want to make kind of those extra investments or not.” He added that covering the medications could be potentially financially feasible for other states.
“Each program is different and has its own pressures. It would be welcome to be able to come together with other states to be able to negotiate broader deals,” Ludlam said. “If North Carolina is able to get a good deal, I don’t know why other states wouldn’t be able to participate in that.”
In 2023, Connecticut enacted a law requiring Medicaid to cover obesity treatment services. The program began covering GLP-1s for weight loss, but costs were significant enough that the state told providers this year that it is now focusing on other obesity treatments instead.
Sean Scanlon, the Connecticut comptroller, said that not covering GLP-1s is “shortsighted, bad policy.” The state health plan, which takes care of teachers and other state employees, has been covering the drugs for weight loss since 2023. The plan controls costs by only prescribing GLP-1s after patients go through some online weight-loss counseling, said Scanlon.
“The most fiscally conservative thing we can do is give people tools that will save the taxpayers money in the long run,” he said in an interview. “And GLP-1 drugs are one of the best tools that we have to ensure that the taxpayers are not going to pay more money for the health care of hundreds of millions of people in the long run.”
It’s unclear whether the federal government will reverse course. In the past, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has recommended “three good meals a day” and behavioral changes rather than weight-loss medication.
But this month, Kennedy told CBS News he’s considering a regulatory framework to have Medicare and Medicaid cover these “extraordinary drugs” in the future, once their cost goes down.
“Ideally, over the long-term, we’d like to see those drugs available for people after they try other interventions,” Kennedy said.

Anthony Brown (D), left, with then-Attorney General Brian Frosh (D) at a 2018 event in Annapolis, after Brown was elected to succeed Frosh, who stepped down. (File photo by Bruce DePuyt/Maryland Matters)Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown (D) didn’t wait until President Donald Trump (R) was inaugurated on Jan. 20 to start preparing a defense against likely actions by the incoming administration.
When it became clear last year that Trump would secure a second term, Brown said he and his team immediately began researching executive orders and policies the administration pushed in his first term, from 2017 to 2021.
Now, as Trump approaches 100 days in office, Brown has led or joined more than two dozen lawsuits filed by Democratic attorneys general across the country challenging the rapid-fire policy pronouncements of the new administration.
Brown’s office created a tab on its website called “Federal Actions Response,” which provides Marylanders resources and other information on immigration, human rights, LGBTQ and federal employment for those impacted by Trump administration actions.
“I made a commitment that I would bring or join only those actions where I believe Marylanders are harmed or impacted in a way that’s important and meaningful to them,” Brown said in an interview Friday. “So, we’re going to protect the interest the Marylanders talk about every day around their kitchen table.”
Sen. Chris West (R-Baltimore County) said Friday he had not reviewed any of the current suits against the administration, but he’s certain of one thing.
“There’s no question that this attorney general and the prior attorney general are politically in tune with the mission of the national Democratic Party,” West said. “They’re going to file lawsuits against Republican presidents and not … against Democratic presidents, unless absolutely forced to. Ultimately, the taxpayers are paying for all these lawsuits, for the legal resources needed to bring these lawsuits.”
HHS workers show up at Maryland offices Tuesday to find they were fired overnight

Brown said the complaints filed have nothing to do with politics.
“I would challenge anyone to point to an action that I have either joined or brought where I cannot connect that action to what it means for Marylanders in their day-to-day lives,” he said.
“These are not political statements,” Brown said. “These are challenges to practical issues and problems that are being created by the Trump administration.”
Lawsuits include one filed Friday, with 18 other states in a federal court in Massachusetts, challenging the administration’s threat to withhold funding from school systems that do not comply with its ban on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs. The suit said that action would “unlawfully imperil more than $13.8 billion that are spent to educate our youth” that includes children in high-poverty communities and those with special needs.
Brown was the lead attorney on a suit that challenged the firing of thousands of probationary federal workers. A U.S. District judge in Greenbelt on April 1 issued a preliminary injunction in the case, ordering 20 agencies, including the departments of Agriculture, Labor, and Transportation, to give workers their jobs back while the case was tried.
He was also co-lead on a brief supporting a challenge to Trump’s executive orders on transgender rights. One declared that the federal government will recognize only two sexes, male and female, and another ordered institutions that receive federal funding to stop gender-affirming care for transgender people.
But Brown doesn’t take all the credit for setting a roadmap to challenge the Trump administration. He gives some credit to his predecessor, Brian Frosh (D), who served as att0rney general in Trump’s last term.
In 2017, the General Assembly passed a resolution authorizing the attorney general to “take specified actions regarding civil and criminal suits” against federal actions that negatively affect Marylanders. That effort was hampered by the fact that any legal action would have to be reviewed by Gov. Larry Hogan (R), who did not allocate the $1 million for legal work the resolution called for, Frosh said.
“I’m envious of Attorney General Brown who gets resources and support from Gov. [Wes] Moore,” Frosh said in an interview Friday.
“I had to cobble together resources to play each case, and we got pro bono assistance from law firms. We had people in the office working overtime, volunteering to work on cases that weren’t in their normal portfolio,” he said. “We worked hard.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Still, Frosh said his office either led or joined in about 95 suits against the administration during Trump’s first four years in office, well below the blistering pace set by Brown and the other attorneys general in the first few months of Trump’s second term.
Frosh defends the lawsuits, saying the attorney general “goes after bad actors every day of the week. This was just a bad actor [Trump] at the very highest level of government, no different from somebody who’s cheating, stealing or abusing people in Maryland. It’s just from a much higher perch.”
‘Challenging environment’
Frosh said he and other attorneys general notched some important wins against the Trump administration, defending the Affordable Care Act, challenging the delay to an Obama-era rule that let student borrowers get loan forgiveness if a predatory school engaged in deceptive conduct, and blocking the separation of immigrant families at the southern border.
But Frosh said he’s most proud of the emoluments lawsuit filed in 2017 by him and former D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine (D). The suit said Trump illegally profited off his presidency by accepting payments from foreign and domestic officials who stayed at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., and patronized other Trump family businesses.
In the face of appeals from Trump and the Justice Department, the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the suit could move forward. By the time it reached the Supreme Court, it was declared moot because Trump was out of office. But Frosh notes that, “We didn’t lose that case. We won it. Then the Supreme Court said, ‘OK, well, it doesn’t matter anymore because he’s not president.’”
He remains concerned about what might happen with current Supreme Court and it 6-3 conservative majority of conservative justices. He pointed to the court’s decision last year that U.S. presidents have full criminal immunity for their official “core constitutional” acts, but not for unofficial acts.
Maryland Equitable Justice Collaborative returns to reiterate its points

“If you look at the Constitution, the word immunity does not appear in Article 2, which is the article about the president,” he said. “No Supreme Court has ever suggested a president had blanket immunity for official acts. It’s Trump’s dream come true.”
But still, Frosh hopes the Supreme Court will assess the rule of law when it comes to Trump.
“I’m hoping that even this Supreme Court will have the guts to stand up. It’s a much more challenging environment than it was eight years ago,” said Frosh, who now consults with Bloomberg Philanthropies on climate issues and the Maryland Bar Association on criminal justice issues.
‘Our day job’
Both Brown and Frosh stress that, despite the attention they garner, the suits against the Trump administration are not the main focus of the office. The attorney general is the state’s top prosecutor, but he also helps direct and act as a legal adviser for various state agencies, boards and offices.
Under Brown’s leadership since January 2023, and thanks to a Democratic-majority General Assembly, the office has received new responsibilities or expanded authority to include:

Statutory authority to enforce federal and state civil rights laws, but also bring class action lawsuits in working in conjunction with the Maryland Commission on Civil Rights;
Expand authority of the Independent Investigations Division to prosecute police-involved deaths and near fatal injuries;
Establishment of the “Environmental and Natural Resources Crimes Unit,” previously called Environmental Crimes Unit, which can now investigate and prosecute those who break state criminal environmental and natural resources laws; and
Creation of nohomeforhate,md.gov, the Civil Rights Division’s portal to track hate crime and identify trends.

Besides making history as the state’s first Black attorney general, Brown partnered in October 2023 with Public Defender Natasha Dartigue to co-chair the Maryland Equitable Justice Collaborative (MEJC). The group released a report last month with 18 recommendations to eliminate racial discrimination in the criminal justice system.
“We’ve got a new president and a new administration in Washington which challenged us. We’ve got to step up our game, but we still have our day job,” Brown said.
“I tell my team, ‘You’ve got to maintain your work life balance. You’ve got to take care of yourself, your personal well-being, your family,'” he said. “I’m proud of my team that’s getting the job done.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Anthony-Brown-Brian-Frosh-192018-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-29 03:59:39.653858

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)While D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser was saying, “Welcome home,” Monday to the Washington Commanders, Maryland officials were already saying their farewells and looking forward to what’s next for the team’s current home in Landover.
Few seemed surprised by the move, which has been discussed for several years. That discussion picked up when the team was bought two years ago by a new ownership group that said it was looking to replace the isolated and outdated Northwest Stadium.
The team talked to officials in Maryland, the District and Virginia about a move. Despite putting together what Gov. Wes Moore (D) called “a very competitive offer” to keep the team at its current site, most were like House Majority Whip Jazz Lewis (D-Prince George’s), a lifelong fan, who said he understands the historical connection some fans have to the team being in D.C.
“We’ve known that since the new ownership got control of the team, they were interested in exploring going back to D.C.,” said Lewis, whose district includes the stadium site. “We’ve also known that a lot of the fan base use that as their ancestral home.
“We’re going to start preparing to move forward,” he said.
The team played in Washington from 1937 to 1996, with last 35 years at Robert F. Kennedy Stadium. It has a lease at Northwest Stadium through 2027, but is not expected leave until 2030, when a new D.C. stadium is ready.
Even as the state worked to keep the team in Landover, it has been “responsibly preparing for the possibility of the Washington Commanders choosing to return to Washington,” Moore said in a statement released by his office Monday.
Nearly $4 billion deal reached to bring Washington Commanders back to D.C.

In December, team owner Josh Harris signed a memorandum of understanding with Moore and Prince George’s Acting County Executive Tara H. Jackson that said team would begin demolition of the Landover stadium within 90 days of playing its first game at a new stadium. After demolition, the agreement calls on the team to work with state and county agencies to transform the site into “a vibrant mixed-use development,” to include residential, retail “and other allowable uses.”
Moore said the goal is to ensure the area “will not create blight in the community” and not be “another RFK Stadium,” which has sunk into disrepair and become a blight on the neighborhood since hosting its last event in 2017.
“What’s important going forward is that the Landover community receives the investment that it deserves,” he said. “Currently we have a nearly 200-acre property that gets used eight times a year for a few hours, and I have said from my earliest days as governor that the people of the area deserve better.”
The state has already work to improve the area, approving a $400 million investment in 2022 for redevelopment of areas around the county’s four Metrorail Blue Line stations, which include the Morgan Boulevard Station, walking distance from the stadium.
Federal, state and county officials held a groundbreaking ceremony April 9 for a new Civic Plaza near the Wayne K. Curry Administration Building, down the street from Largo Town Center Metrorail station. That project, scheduled for completion in December, calls for an enclosed dog park, a playground and an area for community events.
It represents one of five planned and the first ever with investment from the Maryland Stadium Authority.
The money, approved in 2022 by the General Assembly, did not require any of the funds to be used for a new stadium, but as a boost to revitalize those communities inside the Beltway instead.
Longtime fans such as Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.) were around when the team moved from RFK Stadium to Prince George’s in 1997, when the stadium was named for then-team owner Jack Kent Cooke — who also labeled the area “Raljon” for his sons, Ralph and John.

It became FedEx Field when Daniel Snyder bought the team in 1999 and kept that name until Harris and his partners two years ago for about $6 billion. The stadium was called Commanders Field for a few months in 2024, before the team secured a deal to call the site Northwest Stadium named after Northwest Federal Credit Union.
In addition to Commanders games, the stadium has hosted international soccer matches, concerts for performers including U2, Taylor Swift and the Beyoncé Renaissance World Tour, and last year’s 125th Army-Navy college football game.
Alsobrooks, who helped secure state funding and private investment toward the Blue Line corridor as county executive in 2022, pushed to improve the Landover community whether or not the team remained in Maryland.
“I know this area will continue to transform before our eyes with housing, retail and so much more,” she said in a texted statement Monday. “Our continued investment will revitalize our Landover community and energize our entire state.”
Belinda Queen, president of the Coalition of Central Prince George’s County Community Organizations that includes Landover, said there’s one business residents aren’t interested in: data centers.
“Virginia has data centers. Virginia is bigger and has more land,” she said. “I get it. Data centers bring some source of income, and we do need some source of income, but they need to be in places where there’s plenty of land and not close to where people live. Put them where warehouses are.”
As for the team going back to D.C., she said, “Can’t cry over spilled milk. That whole big [stadium site] can be an indoor shopping mall, or a big place where people can live, work and play. It’s time to move the county forward.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/04/Northwest-Stadium-4-28-2025-1024x617.jpg,,,2025-04-29 03:59:39.653858
,California,2025-04-29 07:01:00+00:00,CalMatters,One faction scores win in Capitol’s perpetual ‘tort wars’ while another battleground looms,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/04/tort-wars-capitol-politics-law/,"In the latest installment of the Capitol's ""tort wars,"" a new proposal that would've enabled higher payouts for tax disputes was killed. Meanwhile, larger lawsuit payouts are affecting Los Angeles coffers, creating politically unusual positions.","One of the state Capitol’s perpetual conflicts, dubbed “tort wars,” pits personal injury attorneys and their allies, such as labor unions, against business groups and their insurers over laws governing which activities can be subjected to damage-seeking lawsuits.
Over the years, as one side seeks to expand the universe of civil wrongs (torts) that can be brought to court and the other seeks to freeze or even shrink such opportunities, titanic political clashes have erupted either in the Capitol or the ballot arena.
One highlight — or lowlight — of the never-ending duel occurred in 1987 when private negotiations over a tobacco war truce moved from the Capitol to Frank Fat’s restaurant, a Sacramento political hangout. Then-state Assembly Speaker Willie Brown hopped from table to table. The result was the infamous “napkin deal” that gave something to each faction and suspended hostilities for a few years.
Overall, tort wars have been something of a standoff as each side claimed occasional victories and suffered occasional losses. But they continue because the potential stakes are many billions of dollars. Well-heeled participants will spend millions on lobbying fees, campaign contributions to legislators and ballot measure battles to prevail.
Three years ago, the warring factions were headed for a very expensive showdown with dueling ballot measures. The pro-litigation side had qualified a measure for the 2022 ballot that would, if passed, have virtually repealed a 1975 law limiting pain and suffering damages in medical malpractice suits to $250,000.

Data & Trackers 
Special interests poured more than half a billion into California lobbying last year 

by Jeremia Kimelman 





In response, the Civil Justice Association of California, an umbrella organization of business and insurance interests, proposed a countermeasure that would have limited lawyers’ shares of personal injury damages to 20%.
The standoff resulted in a quickly enacted compromise that preserved the cap on malpractice damages but gradually raises it. The two ballot measures were shelved.
Legislative sessions usually see at least one effort by one or both of the factions to change tort law. This year’s example is Senate Bill 799, carried by Sen. Ben Allen, an El Segundo Democrat, and backed by trial lawyers, labor unions, local governments and Attorney General Rob Bonta. SB 799 would extend California’s False Claims Act to high-dollar tax disputes, thus allowing lawyers to go after taxpayers deemed to be scofflaws and collect fees if they win.
Its introduction sparked an intense effort by business and insurance groups, via the Civil Justice Association of California and the California Taxpayers Association, to strangle the measure.
The bill easily cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee but opponents prevailed in a showdown hearing in the Senate Revenue and Taxation Committee last week, with just two of the committee’s five members (both Democrats) voting for it. Two other Democrats refused to vote, which had the same practical effect as voting “no.”

The civil justice and taxpayers groups hailed their win, declaring, “SB 799 would have unleashed shakedown lawsuits against business owners and outsourced the state’s responsibility for tax enforcement to the plaintiffs’ bar.”
There was an ironic coincidence on the issue. As SB 799 was being rejected, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass was visiting Sacramento to plead for state help in dealing with her city’s huge budget deficit, citing a huge increase in payouts from liability lawsuits as a major factor.
“Liability settlements have tripled from backed up lawsuits during the pandemic in uncapped damages,” Bass said.
City Attorney Hydee Feldstein Soto accompanied Bass to seek a limit on damages from suits against cities. “We’re trying to bring California more into the mainstream and make sure that we don’t pay taxpayer dollars out unnecessarily or in disproportionate amounts,” Feldstein Soto said.
Their position is a little odd, given that the League of California Cities had supported SB 799.

Every day in Maryland, nurses, doctors and health care staff show up with skill, compassion and commitment to keep us well. But there’s a growing concern within the walls of our hospitals, clinics, emergency departments and urgent care centers, nursing homes and assisted living facilities: an increase in workplace violence directed at those providing care.
These incidents don’t define our health care system, which remains a safe and healing space for patients, but they do represent a critical challenge we must address to protect the workforce behind it.
At the Maryland Patient Safety Center, we’ve launched our “Care Flows Both Ways” campaign to show the need for more respectful interactions in health care facilities. Our organization and the health care workers we seek to assist are grateful to the Maryland General Assembly for their support of and commitment to this effort.

At the heart of our campaign is a simple but powerful truth: Care must flow both ways. Our health care professionals dedicate their lives to caring for others; they deserve care, compassion and protection in return.
When we support the well-being of our health care workforce, we reinforce the entire system of care that touches every Marylander’s life. Respecting and safeguarding those who care for us ensures they can continue to do what they do best — deliver exceptional care to patients and families across the state.
Most people will never witness the kinds of stressors and confrontations that health care workers may face during high-pressure moments, but their impact is real. Addressing this issue is not about sounding an alarm; It’s about strengthening the foundation of our health care system. There are benefits to every patient at the hospital when violence against health care workers is prevented.
Our campaign website, ItTakesPatients.org, provides tools and resources for patients and families, plus hospitals, physician offices, urgent care and other settings of care. Through the website, as well as on billboards and buses, TV and digital ads, Marylanders can hear and see directly from health care workers who have been impacted by workplace violence in medical settings.
Their stories are real, raw and emotional.
It’s not easy to talk, or hear, about any workplace violence, but what Marylanders will also hear is their love for their work and their gratitude for the opportunity to help others.
To the health care professionals who show up every day with courage and compassion: We see you, we thank you and we are working to ensure your safety is a priority.
To the public and our elected leaders: This is an opportunity to stand with the people who care for us — to build a stronger, safer health care system that supports the well-being of both patients and providers. Together, we can ensure that Maryland leads the way in protecting our health care workforce while maintaining the trust and care our communities count on.
Since the Maryland Patient Safety Center was created by the Maryland General Assembly in 2002, we have worked for a future where health care is safe and equitable for every patient, family member and health care worker, across the care continuum. The Care Flows Both Ways campaign continues and expands that commitment to our state’s health care family.
Our aim is to keep healing the central part of the workplace for our health care heroes. We invite everyone to join us as we learn how to make “Care Flow Both Ways.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-52212092-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-29 03:00:18.825887

As Kemp signed House Bill 268, he was backed by Winder Republican Rep. Holt Persinger, the bill’s sponsor, and other members of the Barrow County community, which includes Apalachee High School. Apalachee High saw Georgia’s deadliest school shooting last year, in which two teachers and two students were killed and another nine were injured.
The bill was crafted as a response to the shooting and contains a number of provisions intended to decrease the likelihood of a similar attack. It requires schools to implement a panic button system that would allow employees to instantly contact authorities in case of an emergency. Apalachee began using a panic button system just a week before the shooting, and some have credited the devices with allowing law enforcement to react quickly enough to prevent more people from being killed.
The bill also requires schools to share data when a student transfers within five school days. The accused teenage shooter at Apalachee had allegedly been interviewed by the FBI in connection with shooting threats at another district more than a year before the attack, but those allegations did not follow him to Barrow County.
The most controversial element of the bill was stripped out before it passed the Legislature. Originally, it would have created a statewide database of students who might pose a threat to school safety. Opponents cited privacy concerns, saying that a student who made an idle threat against a classmate or another immature but harmless mistake could have their future opportunities threatened.

Education bills signed by Gov. Kemp Monday
Senate Bill 1 – Prohibits student athletes from playing on teams designated for the other gender and requires restrooms, locker rooms and sleeping areas to be single-gender at sporting events.
House Bill 81 – Establishes an interstate compact for school psychologists to make it easier for professionals from other states to work in Georgia.
House Bill 307 – Consolidates existing statutory requirements for dyslexia screening to reach students earlier.
House Bill 235 – Allows education workers to receive a leave of absence to donate organs or bone marrow.
Senate Bill 82 – Encourages local school boards to approve charter school petitions.
Senate Bill 123 – Mandates the creation of review teams for school systems with high rates of chronic absenteeism.
House Bill 268 – Requires schools to have up-to-date mapping and panic buttons, requires school records for transfer students to be transferred within five days, requires districts to provide anonymous safety reporting programs, creates new safety positions and new offenses for making threats against a school.

The panic button portion of the safety bill was originally titled Ricky and Alyssa’s Law after Richard Aspinwall, a teacher and coach who died in the Apalachee shooting and Alyssa Alhadeff, who was killed in the 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.
Members of both families were on hand for the signing.
Aspinwall’s father-in-law Kevin Zinke said the ceremony was bittersweet.
“We’re happy that the governor decided to sign it, but this whole thing has been a rollercoaster ride,” he said. “You’re just happy about something like this, but none of us should be here right now. None of us should be here for this. This could have all been prevented.”
Alyssa’s parents, Lori and Ilan Alhadeff, have been traveling the country advocating for panic button mandates. Georgia is the eighth state to pass such a law. Ilan Alhadeff called the buttons his daughter’s legacy.
“She was inherently very protective of everyone around her. She always brought the crowds and was always defensive of everyone in her circle, and this is so nice to see and so vitally important to see that we’re able to save lives. In the Apalachee shooting, it saved lives. A panic alert went off, and if it was not for that, more children and staff could have been killed that day. So this is just a clear example of how it saved lives. If it was there in 2018, our daughter would be here with us today.”
Coach Aspinwall’s father, who is also named Richard Aspinwall, said he’s glad for the provisions that passed, but he said he hopes to see the database portion become law as well.
“We’re going to keep working on that. You can’t expect somebody to be blindsided with a problem,” he said.
Senate Bill 1 was one of the most controversial bills of this year’s session, which ended early this month.
Also known as the Riley Gaines Act after a college swimmer who lost a tournament at Georgia Tech to a transgender swimmer, the bill bans transgender athletes from playing on team sports designated for their gender identity at all grade levels, including college. It also requires separate restroom, locker room and sleeping facilities for men and women at athletic events and sets up a way to legally challenge schools that violate the law.
Supporters say the measure will ensure women and girls can find safety and fair play on the field.
“This common sense legislation is about what is fair and safe for our children,” Kemp said. “Girls should not have to share a playing field, a restroom or locker room with boys. I know I learned a lot of valuable lessons about life on the football field and the baseball diamond growing up, and it’s not right to ask kids today to forgo those lessons when facing someone biologically stronger and faster than them.”
Opponents call the bill and other legislation taking away rights from transgender people attempts to score political points by going after a vulnerable group.
The Georgia High School Association and NCAA already ban transgender athletes from playing in women’s sports, and President Donald Trump signed an executive order earlier this year banning transgender participation in women’s sports.
Bentley Hudgins, state director with the Human Rights Campaign, said GOP legislators shot down Democratic efforts to boost girls’ sports, including Senate Bill 41, which aimed to equalize funding, access and equipment between girls’ and boys’ school sports.
“Instead of addressing the real problems young women and girls face on the playing field, they chose to bully trans kids and put all girls in harm’s way,” they said. “Their absurd attacks on kids are tired and don’t help anyone. While Republicans play political games and bully transgender children, they cannot and will not steal our joy.”

(Photo by Ronen Tivony/NurPhoto via Getty Images)After years of legal wrangling, former Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes is free of any state ethics violation charges.
The Executive Branch Ethics Commission, which brought charges against her in 2021, has decided not to try to appeal to the Kentucky Supreme Court last month’s unanimous decision by the Kentucky Court of Appeals to uphold a lower court order that cleared Grimes of any wrongdoing.
With no appeal to the state’s highest court from the commission within 30 days, the appellate court finalized its decision on April 21.
“There are no legal charges any more against her, and there never should have been any,” her attorney, Jon Salomon of Louisville, said Monday night.
The end of the legal case could opens the door for a possible run for another political office. The Democrat is seen by some Kentucky political observers as a possible candidate for the U.S. Senate in 2026 or Central Kentucky’s 6th Congressional District next year.
Grimes is a Lexington lawyer who was secretary of state from 2011 to 2019 and was an unsuccessful candidate for the U.S. Senate in 2014 against Republican Mitch McConnell. She is the daughter of the former state Democratic Party Chair Jerry Lundergan of Lexington. The Lundergan family is close to former President Bill Clinton and his wife, former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
Grimes did not return phone calls seeking comments about her legal victory and political future.
Susan Clary, executive director of the ethics commission, had no comment Monday night when asked why the commission did not ask the Kentucky Supreme Court to review the Court of Appeals’ decision.
The commission had been investigating Grimes for several years.
In November 2021, the commission fined Grimes $10,000 for two ethical violations pertaining to handling of voter data.
As secretary of state, Grimes was the state’s chief elections officer. In her position, she had access to data from the state voter registration system in the State Board of Elections.
The commission had alleged that Grimes violated the ethics code by sharing voter information without requiring a request under the Open Records Act or other “established process of government.”
Grimes responded that all the voter data at issue was information in the public domain and that she had full legal authority and discretion as secretary of state to access and share such information. She claimed no statute or regulation was violated by the sharing of such public information. She claimed the commission’s charges were barred by the five-year statute of limitations and that the record did not support a finding of any violations of the state executive branch’s code of ethics.
The commission argued that it was not bound by any statute of limitations and claimed that a limitation could hamper its work on other cases.
The only allegations pursued by the Ethics Commission were that Grimes allegedly acted unethically in accessing public information in the voter registration system by downloading voter information onto a thumb drive when she was a candidate for reelection.
The commission also looked at whether Grimes improperly shared information on new voter registrations for certain Kentucky House of Representative districts in response to a request made informally through the office of the House speaker without requiring a formal open records request or charging a fee.
Grimes fought the charges in Franklin Circuit Court and Judge Phillip Shepherd ruled in her favor.
Then the three-member appellate court said last month that the Executive Branch Ethics Commission missed its statutory deadline to charge Grimes with improperly ordering the downloading and distribution of voter registration data from her public office while she was Kentucky’s secretary of state.
“The Franklin Circuit Court reversed the commission’s decision, finding it was arbitrary, not supported by substantial evidence and time barred. Due to the statute of limitations alone, we affirm,” said the appellate court decision. The three appellate judges were Susanne M. Cetrulo, James H. Lambert and Jeff S. Taylor.
Salomon, Grimes’ attorney, noted that the final order contained a “To Be Published” provision, meaning that the case sets precedent in law.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/gettyimages-824504630-594x594-1.jpg,,,2025-04-29 01:01:26.451939

FRANKFORT, Ky. – A big reason why Congressman Andy Barr swamped former Attorney General Daniel Cameron in the first phase of fundraising as each seeks the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate is that Barr got a windfall of contributions from traditional political action committees —particularly from bank PACs.
The numbers can be found on Line 11(c) of the reports Barr and Cameron filed recently with the Federal Election Commission detailing their contributions between Jan. 1 and March 31.
That line on the Andy Barr for Senate report shows $733,000 in contributions from PACs.
The same line on the Cameron for Senate report shows $1,000.
Barr’s PAC windfall represents 40 percent of the $1,853,000 in total receipts he reported for the three-month period. Cameron reported total receipts of $508,000 for the period.
Barr’s lead in fundraising is actually much larger because — in addition to the money raised in the first quarter — he rolled over a balance of about $3.7 million from his House campaign committee to the new committee for the Senate. Barr’s Senate campaign reported having more than $5.3 million on hand at this start of this month while Cameron’s report shows it had $455,000 on hand on April 1.
Barr and Cameron are seeking the Republican Party nomination to succeed Sen. Mitch McConnell who announced in February that he would not seek reelection in 2026. Others may join the race. The Lexington Herald-Leader reported last week that some Republican insiders are saying Scott Jennings, a political consultant best known as a pro-Donald Trump commentator on CNN, is considering getting in the race. And others might get in, including wealthy Lexington businessman Nate Morris.
Barr may need more campaign money than Cameron, who released a poll earlier this month showing he enjoyed a strong lead over Barr — a lead political experts attributed to his higher statewide name recognition that resulted from his 2019 election as attorney general, his four years serving as attorney general, and his 2023 campaign for governor which he lost to incumbent Democrat Andy Beshear.

Barr has won seven consecutive elections as U.S. representative but his name is not well known outside central Kentucky’s 6th Congressional District.
Barr’s strong support from traditional PACs is the result of his years in the House, particularly now as a member of the majority party while holding important committee assignments.
Stephen Voss, an associate professor of political science at the University of Kentucky who specializes in Kentucky politics, said most experienced members of Congress, regardless of political affiliation, can expect a steady flow of donations from traditional PACs. “Andy Barr has been influential in the banking and finance sector for years now, and PACs tend to reward longterm relationships,” Voss said.
Traditional PACs — organizations representing corporations, associations, labor unions and other groups  —are limited by law to giving no more than $5,000 per election. The limit is effectively $10,000 because a PAC can give $5,000 designated to a candidate’s primary election, and $5,000 designated to the general election.
Barr is a senior member of the House Financial Services Committee and chairs its Financial Institutions and Monetary Policy Subcommittee. He also serves on the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
The website of OpenSecrets, a non-profit organization that tracks and analyzes political contributions, shows that in the past four years Barr’s campaign committee has gotten the largest share of its contributions from the “securities and investment” sector of the economy and the second largest share from “commercial banks.”
PACs of many corporations and associations within those sectors also gave generously to Barr in the first three months of this year. Kentucky Lantern’s review of Barr’s recent report shows that 17 PACs of banks or financial services associations gave the maximum $10,000 during the period.
Those are the PACs of: American Bankers Assn.; American Financial Services Assn.; Ally Financial Inc.; Barclays Group US Inc.; Fifth Third Bancorp; Financial Services Institute; Goldman Sachs Group Inc.; Investment Company Institute; JPMorgan Chase & Co.; Managed Funds Assn.; Nomura Holding America Inc.; PNC Financial Services Group; Securities Industry and Financial Markets Assn.; Truist Financial Corp.; UBS Americas Inc.; U.S. Bancorp; and United Wholesale Mortgage.
Many other PACs of banks and financial institutions gave smaller amounts. But Barr got lots of contributions from PACs outside the banking sector during the period.

Here are the other PACs listed as donating $10,000 to Barr during the first quarter:

American Institute of CPAs
American Property Casualty Insurance Assn.
Beam Suntory Inc.
Council of Insurance Agents and Brokers
Deloitte
Elevance Health Inc.
Independent Insurance Agents and Brokers of America Inc.
KPMG Partners/Principals and Employees
Marathon Petroleum Employees
National Apartment Assn.
National Beer Wholesalers
PriceWaterhouseCoopers
Sazerac Company Inc.

Many other PACs gave smaller amounts. Barr’s Congressional office referred questions from Kentucky Lantern to his Senate campaign committee, which did not return an email and a phone message. Cameron’s FEC report lists only one PAC contribution: $1,000 from an obscure political group called Red State PAC, of Nashville.
Guthrie got more PAC money than Barr
Kentucky’s 2nd District Congressman Brett Guthrie, a Republican from Bowling Green who apparently has no current aspirations for higher office, reported getting hundreds of PAC contributions to his campaign committee in the first quarter of 2025 totaling $826,500.

The $826,500 represented 72% of all contributions during the period to Guthrie, who last December was named chairman of the powerful House Committee on Energy and Commerce.
Guthrie first won election to the U.S. House in a close election in 2008. Since then he has never seriously been threatened. Last November he won reelection with 73.1% of the vote.
And over time his campaign fund has become less of committee to raise and spend money for his reelection expenses and more of a clearing house that collects contributions from traditional PACs and gives most of it to the Republican National Congressional Committee.
FEC records show that in the 2023-24 campaign cycle it took in $2.4 million from traditional PACs – 74 percent of its total contributions. FEC records also show that in the same period it gave $3.1 million to the NRCC – 64 percent of its total spending.
McConnell Money Machine winding down
U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell’s well-oiled fundraising machine is beginning to shut down. Kentucky’s senior senator announced on Feb. 20 he would not seek reelection. And his campaign committee reported to the FEC last week that it stopped online fundraising and will refund contributions designated for the 2026 general election as required by law.
After those refunds the McConnell for Senate Committee is expected to still have a balance of well over $7 million.
The law prevents retiring senators and representatives from keeping that money or paying for personal expenses. But McConnell has other options, primarily donating the money to political committees or to charities.
McConnell Senate Committee launched in the early 1980s an underdog’s effort to unseat an incumbent Democrat and went on – FEC records show – to raise more than $150 million  that financed seven winning elections to the U.S. Senate.

The committee was the heart and the origin of McConnell’s fundraising machine which – once McConnell secured his seat in the U.S. Senate – also took on the role of raising hundreds of millions of additional dollars (through the National Republican Senatorial Committee and the super PAC Senate Leadership Fund) with the goal of gaining and retaining Republican control of the U.S. Senate.
McConnell likes “The Price of Power”
Among the relatively few spending items listed in McConnell for Senate’s recent report is $4,467.37 it paid on Feb. 26 to the publishing house Simon & Schuster, of New York, for books.
Last fall Simon & Schuster published “The Price of Power, How Mitch McConnell Mastered the Senate, Changed America and Lost His Party” by veteran journalist Michael Tackett. (The book was favorably reviewed in Kentucky Lantern by Kentucky journalist Al Cross.)Kentucky Lantern confirmed the payment was for copies of “The Price of Power.”
The $4,467.37 payment would buy about 130 copies of the book at its list price.
‘Tis The Season

	
It’s that time of year when political committees of politicians include big payments to Churchill Downs.
Hal Rogers for Congress reported three payments to Churchill in February and March totaling $95,979. His report says the payments were for ‘facility rental.”
Friends of Andy Barr, a Barr committee that collects contributions for several Barr committees, reported paying $60,450 to Churchill. It also says the purpose of the disbursement was for “facility rental.”

Rand Paul for Senate paid $40,026 in February to Churchill for “event tickets.”
No special trips for Sen. Paul, but …
Kentucky Lantern has reported that Sen. Paul’s campaign committee spent $50,000 last summer for a fundraising trip to Scandinavia’s finest hotels and restaurants, and it spent $44,240 for a fundraising stay at Pendry Park City, a luxury ski resort in Utah.
Paul’s campaign fund reported no travel expenses as large or unusual as those during the first three months of this year. However, it did include a couple additional expenses apparently related to last winter’s ski trip: $1,656 paid to Snowbound Transportation, of Park City, and $2,000 to Diego Zapata, a private chef and caterer from Salt Lake City.
The Paul campaign also reported paying $2,879 in March to The Breakers, a resort in Palm Beach, Florida. That was apparently to attend the annual National Republican Senatorial Committee’s winter meeting – a trip Paul takes at his campaign’s expense each year.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-29 04:01:31+00:00,CT Mirror,CT’s psychedelic reform is not cannabis justice,Josiah Schlee,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/29/cts-psychedelic-reform-is-not-cannabis-justice/,"If Connecticut lawmakers want to claim moral leadership on drug reform, then they need to take meaningful action on cannabis — action that centers people, not profit.","Connecticut lawmakers recently advanced a bill to decriminalize small amounts of psilocybin, the psychoactive compound found in “magic mushrooms.” The bill, HB 7065, was celebrated by some as a forward-thinking, therapeutic step toward a more humane drug policy.
And yet, I find myself asking: Why psilocybin? Why now? Why is this bill moving forward while cannabis justice — long overdue and already legally enacted in spirit — continues to stall?
The answer, I believe, lies in a pattern that’s becoming increasingly familiar in Connecticut politics: bold-sounding reform that doesn’t challenge power, doesn’t upset profit structures, and doesn’t truly redistribute opportunity. It’s a recurring script. Progress is welcomed when it’s symbolic and easy. But when it starts to disrupt bureaucratic control or corporate cannabis monopolies, the door quietly closes.
To be clear, I support decriminalization of psilocybin. I support any effort that removes criminal penalties from nonviolent personal use of plant or fungi-based substances. What I don’t support is pretending that psilocybin reform is a substitute for the real, hard work of cannabis justice — particularly when nonviolent cannabis offenders remain incarcerated in our state, medical cannabis patients continue to be overlooked, and communities devastated by prohibition are still being told to wait.
Let’s talk about what’s been buried.
HB 5429 was a modest but important bill designed to protect medical cannabis patients and caregivers. It proposed expanding home cultivation rights, capping excessive lab testing fees, and reinforcing anti-discrimination protections — especially in housing and employment. These are not radical changes; they’re updates needed to preserve a medical program that has been neglected since the adult-use market came online.
Even more critical was HB 6377, a wide-reaching justice and equity proposal. It would have ended ongoing investigations and prosecutions for nonviolent cannabis offenses, automatically expunged criminal records, and created a framework for reviewing — and potentially vacating — sentences for those still behind bars. It also required that 50% of new cannabis licenses go to individuals with past convictions or from communities disproportionately targeted by enforcement. The bill aimed to turn promises of equity into actual policy.
Neither bill received a vote.
Meanwhile, HB 7065 sailed through the Judiciary Committee. And while it may be framed as “decriminalization,” it still allows police to seize and destroy psilocybin and penalize possession with fines up to $500. Cultivation remains fully criminalized. No provision exists for safe access, safe supply, or therapeutic integration. The law creates a new source of revenue through civil enforcement — essentially replacing incarceration with profitable punishment. That’s not restorative justice. It’s a branding exercise.
So why psilocybin and not cannabis? Why did a Schedule I psychedelic advance while more practical  and  familiar  reforms  were ignored?
One reason is simple: there’s less money at stake. Psilocybin doesn’t have a billion-dollar industry behind it — yet. There are no multistate operators competing for licenses, no state departments seeking to regulate therapeutic mushroom clinics, no entrenched financial interests to protect.
Supporting psilocybin costs nothing politically. Cannabis, on the other hand, is already a market — a market controlled by a few and heavily regulated by the Department of Consumer Protection (DCP), which has shown a preference for centralized control over community  empowerment.
Releasing prisoners, expunging records, and opening up the license structure threatens that model. Reforming cannabis policy in Connecticut means redistributing power, not just changing the optics. That kind of reform is much harder to pass — not because it lacks merit, but because it disrupts comfort.
Then there’s perception. Psychedelics have undergone a cultural rebrand. They’re now associated with therapy, trauma healing, mental wellness, and micro-dosing executives in Silicon Valley.
Cannabis still carries political baggage — linked in the public imagination to over-policing, incarceration, and street-level drug enforcement. Lawmakers would rather ride the new wave of psychedelic hype than untangle the mess they helped create around cannabis.
I don’t write this as someone looking to tear down progress. I write this as someone who has supported reform for years — who has watched Connecticut legalize cannabis without ever truly legalizing the people who used it first. I write this as someone who sees the same communities left out of licensing, left out of policy writing, left out of profit, and left behind in prison. That’s not legalization. That’s selective permission.
If we want to be honest about drug policy reform, we have to be honest about who benefits. We have to ask why symbolic legislation moves forward while substantive justice is delayed. We have to be willing to acknowledge when the appearance of progress is being used to cover for a lack of courage.
It’s no longer enough to decriminalize one substance while maintaining punishment for others. It’s no longer acceptable to protect corporations over caregivers or state regulators over patients. If Connecticut lawmakers want to claim moral leadership on drug reform, then they need to take meaningful action on cannabis — action that centers people, not profit.
HB 7065 may be a step. But it is not the step we most urgently need.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-29 04:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,The cost of college and the weight of dreams,Kwasi Osei-Amankwah,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/29/the-cost-of-college-and-the-weight-of-dreams/,Thousands of students must work their way through college because their families don't have the means to support them.,"When I was in my freshman year at UConn, my mother – who had immigrated to the U.S. from Ghana and worked as a nurse for more than 35 years – became very ill. I was doing so well at school, but as soon as I got that call in early November, the financial burden of attending college as an out-of-state student loomed very large.
Just a year before, in 2020, in the wake of the murder of George Floyd, we all saw a renewed movement advocating for racial justice and equality. I was still in high school, and the event served as a catalyst for my passion for journalism.


I found myself inspired and motivated to express my emotions and thoughts on what could be better, especially as an African American navigating life in a town that was predominantly non-Black. I was determined to study journalism and capture stories that matter, and this ambition quickly became my dream. The price to attend UConn before financial aid and waivable fees is $62,323. My mother and brother stood firmly by my side, encouraging me to chase my dreams and make our family proud. 
But now that my mother was sick, just a month or so into my college career, the narrative had switched. It became a matter of me needing to take care of myself in order to help my family manage in her absence.

Kwasi Osei-Amankwah
Throughout my four years at the university, I’ve worked at multiple jobs to support myself, with my highest-paying positions being at Sally’s Apizza and Haven Hot Chicken. And while I will forever remain thankful to these jobs for taking me in during my time of need, earning about $20 an hour was not even close to enough. My mother’s ongoing illness meant I had to shoulder the burden of my tuition on my own while also supporting my family at home in their time of need, paying for food and managing utilities at 18 years old.
In college, students are encouraged to fully immerse themselves in their studies while at the same time participating in a bunch of extracurricular activities and internships in order to build networks, gain invaluable experience and improve their craft of choice. Yet for those like me, managing a rigorous academic schedule while working nearly full time – especially in an industry that doesn’t have anything to do with my future ambitions – achieving this balance can feel nearly impossible.
Allison Wall, a dear friend and fellow student studying natural resources and the environment at UConn, echoed my struggles. “I have loans that cover a significant portion of my tuition, but I also have car payments, rent, repaying those loans,” she said. “There are days when I barely eat.”
Ageu Dos Santos, another UConn student, often has to work late and can’t get up for classes in the morning. “I have to hope and pray that these customers don’t come in. Otherwise, I have to stay in late and not be able to get up for class; I don’t get paid enough to worry about this.”
Thousands of students share stories like ours, and for the most part, their voices are entirely unheard. These are individuals whose families cannot help them with their education costs due to financial constraints. And no matter what the reason, it can’t be fair to put this strain on a young person straight out of high school. Students should be able to achieve their dreams no matter where they decide to end up going to school.
While the university provides some resources, such as food pantries and clothing initiatives, the outreach to help students find these programs is insufficient. I often found myself scouring UConn’s barrage of Daily Digest emails for any hope of assistance, whether financial or emotional. And when I reached out to the financial aid office for additional support, I was met with so much disappointment. They informed me that I had exhausted my options and could not receive further help. The only option I was given was to take out a private loan. I hadn’t done that during my time at UConn until this year, when I had no choice.
As I prepare to graduate this semester, I take so much pride in the journey I’ve been on. I carry with me the lessons of resilience, as well as acquiring some of the journalism skills I needed. I daily remember the struggles I overcame to get to this point. Yet, I cannot shake the feeling that financing an education should never be this arduous. I can’t help but worry that because of the situation I’ve been in, I won’t find a job easily at all, not because of skills I haven’t acquired but because of the lack of true experience I have.
I want to be someone in this world. My passion and drive make me this way, and while no one can predict these circumstances, the reality of potentially repaying student loans for the entirety of my life feels overwhelming. No one should have to face such daunting challenges.
College costs money for a reason. This isn’t an article about making college free. As a student, I covered many issues similar to this one for class assignments. I always got led to the same statement:
“The things students enjoy cost money.”
I understand that a lot of the things cost money. But I don’t have the time to enjoy said things. There should be something more that universities across the country could do for students like me, who were just dealt a bad hand and couldn’t do anything about it.
The solution of loan forgiveness has been really big in helping students after college, but this is a process that should be expanded upon, not taken away as the Trump administration is threatening – giving students more access to the education they need.
Because of my journey, I’ve missed out on internships and valuable experience that would’ve helped me advance in life. This feeling of hopelessness after all the sacrifices people have made goes to show all the deeper issues in this country. How a student, who’s a person of color, can’t make it during this stage of life because of the lack of connections, the lack of time, and because my parents weren’t born here. I work tirelessly each day to make something of myself because of the promises I made to my mother. The feeling that I’m not getting that fair chance, the feeling of failure, scares me.
My mom is slowly doing better physically, but mentally I worry if she’ll ever be the same. She’s 60 years old now, and many years of working as a single mother have taken their toll. My father told me that they’re planning to retire back to Ghana after reuniting with my mother following her illness. They have completed their attempt at that “American Dream” so many immigrants around the world chase for generations.
I’ve battled and fought through an experience. I will never let something like this hinder me. My mission has always been to make things easier for people like me — first-generation students, people who struggle to pay for college, people of color, anyone that feels like they’re not getting the love they need.
My last shift, I worked 13 hours. During that time, I had a guest visit my job who was touring UConn with their daughter from Long Island. Strangers. When they told me how proud they were that I was graduating, it sparked the brightest smile within me. I hope to make people feel that sense of pride in my writing, perfect my craft, and make my family proud. I need to make all the hard work worth it.

Sessions III, sitting in federal court in Burlington, had issued a ruling earlier this month for Öztürk, who is Turkish and was in the United States on a student visa, to be transferred back to a Vermont facility by May 1 ahead of a later bail hearing.However, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York, in response to an emergency filing by the federal government, issued an order late Monday calling for a stay of Sessions’ transfer order. The court set a hearing for Tuesday, May 6 before a three-judge panel of the appeals court to consider the matter.“The purpose of this administrative stay is to give the court sufficient opportunity to consider the merits of the emergency motion for a stay pending appeal and should not be construed in any way as a ruling on the merits of that motion,” the order issued Monday evening stated.Öztürk, a doctoral student in child and human development, was taken into custody on a street near her apartment in Somerville, Massachusetts, by masked officers in plainclothes in late March. She eventually was taken to Vermont and held overnight at a St. Albans immigration facility before being flown the next morning out of Patrick Leahy Burlington International Airport to Louisiana, where she’s been detained since.Her attorneys have argued for her release, contending that she appears to have been wrongly targeted by federal immigration officers in violation of her free speech rights.

(Courtesy of University of Nebraska Medical Center)OMAHA — The Greater Omaha Chamber has joined forces with more than 50 business organizations and chambers of commerce nationally to advocate for the rescue of research funding in the federal budget.
The local chamber announced, in a media release, its participation in the relaunch of the Business for Federal Research Funding Coalition. Nearly 30 states are represented so far.
“Federal research funding is one of the best investments we can make in America’s future,” said Heath Mello, president and CEO of the Greater Omaha Chamber. “It drives groundbreaking innovation, fuels job creation, strengthens our national competitiveness and directly impacts the Omaha region.”

Formed in 2017, the national coalition went dormant during the Biden Administration, a chamber official said, because funding levels for federal research were sufficient.
Now the nonpartisan coalition of business organizations “from red, blue and purple states” will once again engage members of Congress and the Trump Administration to reinforce the stance that research funding “strengthens our nation’s economy and competitiveness.”
The Omaha-area chamber represents nearly 3,000 member businesses. Representatives said the University of Nebraska system last year received more than $113 million, and Omaha-based Creighton University received nearly $8.3 million in National Institute of Health grants.
Investments in research have led to major breakthroughs in innovation, new technologies, life-saving medical treatments and millions of jobs, the chamber release said. 
The BFRF said that nationally, $36.9 billion in NIF grants awarded to researchers in 2024 supported 407,782 jobs and generated $94.5 in economic activity.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Alaska’s public schools might get more money, after all. 
Nine days after Gov. Mike Dunleavy vetoed a significant increase to the state’s K-12 public school funding formula, the Alaska Senate has approved a compromise education bill that includes a smaller increase.
The bill includes some — but not all — of the policy changes that Dunleavy said were necessary to prevent another veto.
House Bill 57, originally drafted to restrict public school students’ cellphone use, was amended by the Senate before being approved on a bipartisan, 19-1 vote, and must return to the House for a concurrence vote. 
That vote could have taken place on Monday, but lawmakers found a technical error with the bill, meaning that the Senate must revote on a new text before the House can act. 
The new Senate vote and the House’s concurrence are expected on Wednesday.
When that happens, it will be the third time in two years that the Alaska Legislature has attempted to increase the state’s per-student funding formula.
While the first two attempts were defeated by the governor and Republicans who voted to sustain his vetoes, this third attempt appears to have stronger support among legislative Republicans.
On Monday, five members of the six-person Senate Republican minority hailed the bill, and three said they were prepared to override the governor. Two others said they might do so as well.
“We believe that we have struck the most reasonable compromise we’re going to find this year to get something true that’s going to work,” said Senate Minority Leader Mike Shower, R-Wasilla.

Included in the bill is a $700 per student increase to the base student allocation, the foundation of the state’s public school funding formula. 
For years, legislators have tried to adjust the formula to keep up with inflation. If the formula were to be adjusted for inflation since 2011, it would have to rise by $1,808 per student. In recent years, districts have had to slash programs and staff, and public school advocates have cited the lack of BSA increases as a cause. During the same period, public-school enrollment has fallen. 
Last year, lawmakers included a one-time funding bonus for public schools in the state budget. That was equivalent to a $680 increase to the BSA. The new funding is only a small year-over-year bump — from $174 million to $183 million, given 2024 class sizes — but it’s particularly important, said Sen. Löki Tobin, D-Anchorage, because it’s part of the foundation formula, which means schools can count on that figure when they write their budgets.
“When it’s inside the BSA, not only can they plan long-term … but it also forces this accountability metric,” she said, explaining that districts will be required to account for their spending differently than if they were receiving a one-time bonus.
The bill also includes more money for pupil transportation programs — school bus services, generally — and it designates the proceeds of a proposed corporate tax update for a program intended to improve younger students’ reading skills.
That section of the bill states that schools would be eligible for at least $450 for each student who passes specific skill thresholds. 
  Sen. Shelley Hughes, R-Palmer, speaks in the Alaska Senate on Monday, April 28, 2025. (Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)
That provision, plus stronger prohibitions on student cellphones, were important to Sen. Shelley Hughes, R-Palmer, and caused her to vote for the bill. She had voted against the bill that was vetoed by Dunleavy.
“I don’t want children to miss out on … primarily the cellphone ban. I think that will be a game changer with middle and high schoolers. You will see academic improvements as a result of that one policy. The reading incentives, that will also be a game changer. And for those reasons, I don’t want to hold back,” she said.
Conversely, Sen. Robert Myers, R-North Pole, was the only “no” vote on the bill and said that while he and Hughes have similar views, he thinks the designated funding mechanism is unreliable and may be unconstitutional.
The House-passed version of HB 57 only required school districts to set a policy for student cellphone use. The Senate-passed version says that if a district doesn’t have a policy, students are banned from using them in school.
Other changes:

People who want to propose new charter schools can do so at any time of year;
Local school boards must decide charter school applications more quickly, and if an application is rejected, the state school board must act more quickly to decide whether to overrule local officials;
A school board decision to create a charter school can be terminated only for specific reasons; 
School districts must set targets for class sizes. The target for prekindergarten through grade 6 cannot exceed 23 students per class, and the target for 7th through 12th grades cannot exceed 30 students per class.

Asked on Monday whether the governor was willing to allow the revised bill to become law, Tobin said she wasn’t sure. She also said she wasn’t sure whether there would be enough votes to override a prospective veto.
“I’ve been working my ass off, so I’m hopeful,” she said.

In the state with the fourth-largest proven reserves of oil and gas in the U.S., there is a looming energy shortage.
Above the Arctic Circle, oil producers on Alaska’s North Slope send an average of 465,000 barrels of crude oil south each day for shipping to refineries and users around the country and the world.
But in Southcentral Alaska – Anchorage and the surrounding region, home to 63% of the state’s population – utility companies are warning they may not have enough natural gas from current sources to keep the power and heat on without interruption.
As a professor at the University of Alaska Anchorage who studies the economics of natural resources, I can see this apparent contradiction has a straightforward cause but no simple solution.

Declining oil production
The North Slope region once produced nearly 2 million barrels of oil per day at its peak in the 1980s. Every barrel is transported via the 800-mile Trans-Alaska Pipeline System to the port of Valdez, where it is loaded onto tanker ships.
The state government collects significant taxes and royalties on oil production. For decades, oil revenue allowed the state to fund all government spending without imposing broad-based income, sales or property taxes. At the height of the oil boom, there was so much money that Alaska established a wealth fund, now valued at over US$80 billion, and began distributing dividends to every resident.
But the Trans-Alaska Pipeline is designed to carry oil, not natural gas. A state law prevents producers from burning off excess gas, or flaring, as happens in many fields. With nowhere to send it, gas extracted from Alaska’s oil fields is reinjected into the ground to boost well pressure and push more oil out.
Significant natural gas potential
Alaska’s gas reserves are significant. State estimates suggest the North Slope has about 35 trillion cubic feet of proven reserves. That’s almost as much natural gas as the U.S. as a whole produced in 2023.
But that is just the beginning: The North Slope also has the potential for another 200 trillion cubic feet that remains undiscovered. And improving technologies and techniques may be able to extract another 590 trillion cubic feet, according to the Alaska Gasline Development Corp., a company owned by the state of Alaska that is trying develop a project to extract and sell the state’s natural gas.
As oil production declines and prices remain uncertain, selling gas could provide a different stream of revenue for the state, potentially providing billions of dollars.
The 800-mile problem
For decades, there have been numerous proposals to develop Alaska’s gas. State agencies and the petroleum industry have collectively spent hundreds of millions of dollars on this effort.
The concept that’s closest to reality is Alaska Gasline Development Corp.’s proposal to build a plant on the North Slope to remove gas impurities, a liquefaction plant near Anchorage that could export 20 million tons of liquefied gas each year – around a trillion cubic feet – and an 807-mile pipeline to connect the two.
The cost is expected to be significant: The corporation’s own estimate is that it would cost $44 billion. But that number was developed before the construction sector saw significant inflation in 2022. An engineering study due for release in late 2025 will provide a more updated figure. Alaskans remember that the Trans-Alaska Pipeline ended up costing 25% more than projected.
Since his first day in office, President Donald Trump has touted this pipeline as part of efforts to expand the nation’s production of fossil fuels. He told a joint session of Congress it was a near-ready project, with Japan and South Korea ready to invest “trillions of dollars each.” In February 2025, he stood alongside Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba to announce a “joint venture” to develop the pipeline project, but no specific details have been announced.
2 expensive options
There is a growing need to address Alaska’s domestic energy shortfall.
Southcentral Alaska relies on natural gas for more than 70% of its electric and heating needs. But the gas reserves closest to Anchorage, in the Cook Inlet, which have provided energy to the area since the 1960s, are dwindling, and prices are rising. In 2005, wholesale gas prices were $3.75 per 1,000 cubic feet of natural gas. By 2024, the price had more than doubled, to $8.75. By contrast, the rest of the U.S. has seen natural gas prices cut in half over that period, thanks in part to horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, also known as fracking.
In 2022, Hilcorp, the company responsible for roughly 85% of the Cook Inlet gas production, reported that by 2027 it might not be able to supply enough gas for utilities that serve the region.
Solutions other than the pipeline are also slow and expensive. Local utilities estimate that improving energy efficiency and developing renewable power could reduce gas demand by around 10% over the next several years and by as much as 15% after a decade. But retrofitting the area’s aging and energy-inefficient homes will not be fast or cheap.
More than just economics
What remains for Alaska are two main options: get gas from the North Slope to Anchorage, or import liquefied gas from the global market.
Building the pipeline could both meet the needs of Alaska’s people and bring in money from global sales – though how much revenue depends on how global gas markets change over time and how competitive Alaska gas prices would be relative to other suppliers.
Any delays from financial, legal, technical or environmental challenges would balloon costs. But if it succeeded, Anchorage-area customers could see prices drop as low as $2.23 per 1,000 cubic feet – a 75% drop from current prices and 40% lower than in 2005. The savings could significantly bolster the region’s economy.
Importing is a costly option. A study commissioned by the Alaska Legislature found that imported gas would cost $13.72 per 1,000 cubic feet. That’s 60% more than current prices and especially burdensome for Alaska families and businesses, which already pay far higher energy bills than typical American customers.
Beyond the economic questions, there’s something symbolic at stake: the state’s identity. Could a state synonymous with energy production become an energy importer? Many Alaskans see the prospect as an embarrassing paradox – akin to Hawaii importing pineapples or New Mexico importing green chiles.
Independence and globalization
Alaska is not alone in grappling with the tension between energy self-sufficiency and economic efficiency.
Across the U.S., states rich in resources have wrestled with the question of whether to prioritize local production or integrate into global markets. Texas produces more oil than any other state, yet it continues to import crude oil due to mismatches between its production and refining capacity.
Shaped by globalization, few regions can truly isolate themselves from market forces. Energy production and consumption are increasingly interconnected, meaning pursuit of local self-sufficiency comes at a steep economic cost. That’s the question facing Alaska: whether to invest in domestic infrastructure to maintain energy independence, or embrace the flexibility – and potentially lower cost – of global markets.

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)LINCOLN — A legislative proposal to crack down on “synthetic” consumable hemp or other THC products advanced Monday over some opponents’ preference for regulations and not a “de facto ban.”
Legislative Bill 316, from State Sen. Kathleen Kauth of the Millard area, would redefine most “hemp” products to mean “marijuana,” putting them legally in line with existing enforcement and penalties. It advances a key priority of Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers to restrict products that exceed 0.3% tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) concentrations, the compound most commonly associated with getting a person high.
“These compounds are masquerading as hemp but are in fact dangerous synthetic chemicals that have never been tested for consumption in humans,” Kauth said during debate.
  State Sen. Kathleen Kauth of the Millard area, left, talks with State Sen. Teresa Ibach of Sumner. Jan. 8, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
‘We need to do something’
The bill advanced 33-13, though at least two supporters — State Sens. Tom Brandt of Plymouth and Ben Hansen of Blair — said the bill would need to be amended to maintain their support and overcome the 33-vote threshold for a filibuster. Three more centrist Democratic lawmakers declined to take a position on the bill: State Sens. Eliot Bostar of Lincoln, Jason Prokop of Lincoln and Dan Quick of Grand Island.
Multiple opponents said they preferred the regulatory regime proposed in LB 16 by State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha, the lead opponent to Kauth’s bill. Cavanaugh’s bill would need to hitch a ride on a different bill, or “co-opt” LB 316. Cavanaugh filed more than a dozen amendments to LB 316 to try.
“I’m opposed to hijacking other people’s bills, but I put it on here because I think people in this body will agree that we need to do something,” Cavanaugh said.
  State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha speaks with reporters after the core legislative proposal seeking to help implement medical cannabis stalls in committee. April 17, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Cavanaugh described the goal of attacking only “synthetic” products as a “red herring,” “misnomer” and “misdirection” that would cost more than $1.6 million, at least, in state tax revenue at a time the state faces a major projected budget deficit.
However, he said his bill could generate $7.7 million with an improved regulatory system.
‘Health and safety’
State Sen. Jared Storm of David City, who selected LB 316 as his 2025 priority bill, said he repeatedly asked during a public hearing on Kauth’s bill what ingredients are in delta-8 products — a form of THC that is legal in the state under 2018 federal and 2019 state laws. He also asked where the items come from or who is manufacturing them, but “nobody could ever tell me.”
Hilgers was one of 43 lawmakers in 2019 who voted to enact the Nebraska Hemp Farming Act.
Storm said “effective regulation of this industry is impossible” and that the products are “garbage” attached to a little bit of cannabidiol (CBD) to vape, smoke or eat.
  State Sen. Jared Storm of David City, center. March 26, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Storm said he would never jeopardize “the health or safety of our citizens of this state, especially children and young adults, for revenue.” State Sen. Brad von Gillern of the Elkhorn area, chair of the Revenue Committee, agreed.
LB 316 would prohibit raw hemp above 0.3% THC of any concentration and for processed hemp the lesser of 0.3% THC on a total weight basis or 10 milligrams per package, effective Jan. 1. The mature stalks of Cannabis sativa and its fiber, oil, cake and any other naturally derived products would not be considered hemp, leaving a narrow legal path for fibers and textiles.
If the bill passed, it would include a “consumer safe harbor period” through the end of 2025 to give consumers time to discard any “illegal hemp” newly defined under LB 316. Legal products would face an additional 10% wholesale tax.
‘Felons of all the grannies’
Cavanaugh and State Sens. George Dungan of Lincoln and Danielle Conrad of Lincoln, all lawyers, said the bill creates a “gray zone” where it’s unclear what would be legal and what would be a misdemeanor or infraction for possession or a more serious felony crime.
They said it could result in a “de facto ban” as a result.
  State Sen. Wendy DeBoer of Omaha. Jan. 23, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
State Sen. Wendy DeBoer of Omaha, a former lawyer and vice chair of the Judiciary Committee that advanced LB 316 in a 5-3 vote, said LB 316 is part of a “felony factory” where products for lotions, creams or dog chew could lead to felony charges, or in the case of gummy-eating “grannies” who she said might have such products “in the back of their medicine cabinet.”
DeBoer said a cousin recently sent her a recipe from “Taste of Home” magazine for slow cooker cannabutter as a joke as LB 316 was set to be debated.
“We’re going to make felons of all the grannies that subscribe to ‘Taste of Home’ magazine,” DeBoer said.
Brandt said it was “ridiculous” that people could face felony criminal possession charges. While he voted for the bill to move forward, he said that if the possession language was not amended, though he could not say to what extent it would need to be changed, he would not support it again.
Under state law, marijuana possession of more than 1 ounce but less than 1 pound is a Class III misdemeanor, while greater amounts are a Class IV felony. Smaller amounts can be up to a Class IIIA misdemeanor with up to a $500 fine or jailing for up to seven days for repeated infractions. 
  State Sen. Tom Brandt of Plymouth. Aug. 13, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Brandt said he wanted to target “active ingredients” and protect Nebraskans who might have old CBD products at home that were legally purchased.
“This is hemp. This is not marijuana, guys,” Brandt said.
‘Whack-a-mole’ with regulations
State Sen. Carolyn Bosn of Lincoln, chair of the Judiciary Committee and a former prosecutor, disagreed with DeBoer and said it was a “clarification” rather than a new penalty.
“You’re playing whack-a-mole with trying to regulate this drug,” Bosn said, saying she opposed any effort to change Kauth’s LB 316 toward Cavanaugh’s LB 16.
Bosn also read information from the AG’s Office that of an estimated 300 THC stores in Nebraska, visitors to each of the ones the AG’s Office purchased from have found at least one unlawful product. The office has filed at least 15 lawsuits, some settled, in that ongoing push.
  State Sen. Carolyn Bosn of Lincoln. April 8, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Cavanaugh said that was why regulations were needed and why “reputable” shop owners wanted new guardrails. His LB 16, in part, would prohibit sales near schools and require testing.
Dungan repeatedly referred to LB 316 as a prohibition-era law, similar to opposition to whiskey or bourbon, that didn’t prevent sales but instead created a “black market.”
“We all know history is a good predictor of the future,” Dungan said.
Medical purposes
Multiple opponents also tried to describe a link between CBD or hemp and medical cannabis legislation. Storm and others supporting LB 316 have sought to limit permissible medical cannabis forms to manufactured products like tinctures, oils or creams, while outlawing sales of cannabis flowers or buds. Dungan said that was hypocritical.
Kauth, Storm and others said LB 316 had nothing to do with medical cannabis and that even more liberal-leaning states have cracked down on THC, hemp and delta-8.

Hansen, whose LB 677 would help implement voter-approved medical cannabis, said he is working on an amendment to LB 316 to protect medical cannabis products. He said he isn’t swayed one way or another on the bill. But he said that for his support, he wanted to explicitly protect the products.
However, getting Hansen’s amendment over the finish line could be tricky around Cavanaugh’s more than a dozen amendments, and multiple motions to kill the bill if his amendments fail. 
Kauth has filed two placeholder amendments that could offer a path for changes requested by Brandt and Hansen.
State Sen. Margo Juarez of Omaha read a letter from a Nebraskan who reached out that CBD and hemp products targeted under LB 316 gave the person’s grandfather a new life, around sleeping pills or other medications, expressing fear that the alternatives could be threatened.
“These aren’t people looking to get high,” Juarez read from the letter. “These are people looking for relief, for dignity and a better quality of life.”

(Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)Some 112 Wisconsin workers died on the job in 2023, the AFL-CIO reported Monday as labor unions marked Workers Memorial Day to highlight workplace dangers.
“When a union is there at the workplace, injuries go down and lives are saved,” said Kevin Gundlach, president of the South Central Federation of Labor, representing union workers in Dane County and surrounding counties.
Workers Memorial Day serves both to remember those who have lost their lives at work as well as “fighting for the living” to have a safe workplace, Gundlach told the Wisconsin Examiner. The date, April 28, coincides with the anniversary of the date that the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act took effect 54 years ago.
The AFL-CIO’s analysis draws on 2023 job fatality, injury and illness data along with workplace safety regulation enforcement data for the 12 months ending Sept. 30, 2024.

Of the 112 Wisconsin worker deaths in 2023, 15 were from assaults and other violent acts, 37 from transportation incidents, 17 from falls, 19 from exposures to harmful substances or environments, and 23 from “contact with objects or equipment,” according to the AFL-CIO.

“Every worker in Wisconsin has the right to a safe job,” said Wisconsin AFL-CIO President Stephanie Bloomingdale. “We need collective bargaining rights and strong unions for all to best ensure that safety concerns are adequately and timely addressed in the workplace.”
Union groups around Wisconsin held events, including in Madison, Milwaukee, Eau Claire, La Crosse and Wausau.
At the Madison event, people working in health care, construction, education and as state game wardens came out. There was also testimony on behalf of immigrant workers in the construction industry.
“Many of these workers are exploited and don’t have a union,” Gundlach said. Recent attacks on migrants have made some “fearful to speak up for workplace conditions.”
The event also called attention to workplace violence as a danger, and the need for employers to address workplace safety issues.
In its report, the AFL-CIO criticized the administration of President Donald Trump, which marks its first 100 days this week, for “totally decimating the fabric of what makes government protections work for people through attacks on job safety, public health, union rights and the independence of federal agencies.”

“What I struggle with most is that this is somehow an act of efficiency,” one stakeholder told WyoFile, adding that $40 is returned for every federal dollar invested in service in Wyoming. 
The post DOGE cuts to Americorps ‘a devastating blow to the state of Wyoming’ appeared first on WyoFile .","Following the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency’s order Friday to cancel nearly $400 million in AmeriCorps grants, organizations across Wyoming are preparing for cuts to a wide range of services including alternative education programs, agricultural extension offices, the state’s conservation corps and one community health clinic. 
As the federal agency for national service and volunteerism, AmeriCorps provides funding for organizations that offer community services. In Wyoming, those grants are administered by ServeWyoming, which also acts as a statewide hub for volunteers. 
With Friday’s announcement, however, the Trump administration is now expected to claw back dollars already appropriated by congress. 
More precisely, Wyoming stands to lose roughly $2.4 million in annual grants and scholarships, ServeWyoming Vice Chair Andrea Harrington told WyoFile. That figure doesn’t include matching state grants and individual donations that will also be lost in the process, Harrington said, nor does it reflect the impact it will have across the state. 
“Terminating funding, and thus annihilating these programs, is a devastating blow to the state of Wyoming,” Harrington wrote in a letter to Gov. Mark Gordon and the state’s federal delegation. 
Last year alone, Harrington wrote, Wyoming AmeriCorps members tutored and mentored more than 2,700 children, provided 75,000 hours of service, recruited and deployed more than 3,000 volunteers, served 200 military families and leveraged more than $1.9 million in outside funding from businesses, foundations and other sources in Wyoming. 
“Needs will go unmet in this state due to this decision,” Harrington wrote. 
The move to cut AmeriCorps grants comes amid a push by the Trump administration to shrink the size of the federal government. Wyoming’s delegation has largely backed the undertaking with its highest-ranking member, Sen. John Barrasso, previously lauding it for “addressing reckless and wasteful Washington spending.” 
Others, like Harrington, don’t see the latest round of cuts as a cost savings measure.  
“What I struggle with most is that this is somehow an act of efficiency,” Harrington told WyoFile, adding that $40 is returned for every federal dollar invested in service in Wyoming. 
“How is it efficient to cut these programs?” Harrington said. 
Neither Sens. Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis nor Rep. Harriet Hageman responded to WyoFile’s request for comment. 
“We are still getting information on the implications and the impacts of this announcement,” Michael Pearlman, Gordon’s communication director, told WyoFile in a statement. “Therefore, the governor is going to refrain from commenting at this time.”
Wyoming-based organizations that rely on AmeriCorps funding include: Agricultural Extension Offices, Phorge, SAE International, Teton Science Schools, The Science Zone, Wildflower Learning Community, Wyoming Conservation Corps, Brain Injury Advocates, The Iris Club House, Rooted in Wyoming, The Nicolaysen Art Museum, Lander Free Medical Clinic, Casper Green House Project and GrowWyo/Slow Food Sheridan. 
Up in the air
If the cuts stick, the impacts on programming will vary from a reduction in services to complete elimination, Harrington said. 
For the Wyoming Conservation Corps, the loss of funding for its AmeriCorps programming could be an unrecoverable blow to the 19-year-old organization.
“We hope not,” said John Koprowski, dean of the University of Wyoming’s Haub School of Environment and Natural Resources, which oversees the corps. “All we know right now is that we’ve been asked to pause.”
The “pause” for the Wyoming Conservation Corps means that the statewide AmeriCorps program will not be hiring a new program director. Koprowski had assumed that duty in an interim capacity to cover for an opening unrelated to DOGE. The same goes for all the other open positions and corps members — none are being filled for now. That includes six crew leaders who would have been overseeing five or six AmeriCorps members apiece, he said.
“So you’re looking at dozens of people who are impacted,” Koprowski said.
The impacts of the pause and likely cancellation of grants — the Washington Post reports it’s a “final agency action” that’s “not administratively appealable” — will extend to the organizations, federal agencies and businesses that worked with the Wyoming Conservation Corps.
“They’re fixing fences, trails, clearing debris from forests, reducing fire risk, all those kinds of good things,” Koprowski said.
Inspired by the work, oftentimes service members have gone on to build their careers and lives in the Equality State, he said. “They often become professionals here in the state,” Koprowski said. “Wyoming grows on them, and they become Wyomingites.” (Disclosure: WyoFile Reporter Mike Koshmrl who contributed to this story served as a City of Lakes Americorps volunteer in Minnesota in 2008.)
That applies to Harrington, who described her time of service with the Wyoming Conservation Corps as setting “the trajectory of my life” in her letter to the governor and the federal delegation. 
“My time of service not only made it possible for me to further my education and work experience in the state, but it also planted the seed that grew into my desire to put roots in this state, to work in this state, and to raise my family here,” wrote Harrington, who now works as an attorney. 
Federal funding for the Wyoming Conservation Corps was administered by ServeWyoming. WyoFile was unable to reach ServeWyoming’s executive director on Monday afternoon.
“It’s funding that’s been awarded already,” Koprowski said. “We’ve been told, ‘No, you should pause and you can’t move forward.’ What this means for us long-term, one can only guess.”

In Jackson Hole, the historic Teton Science Schools is in a similar situation. Since 2009, the place-based education organization has housed AmeriCorps members to help with teaching and to assist with an array of projects in the community.
“We became one of the statewide hubs for AmeriCorps, and part of that is because we have a great program,” Teton Science Schools Executive Director Wayne Turner told WyoFile. “This year we have 19 community partners in the valley.”
On Monday, ServeWyoming informed Teton Science Schools that its grant was “terminated” and that they should “pause the program,” Turner said. “Which we are doing.” 
Teton Science Schools has deployed three cohorts of AmeriCorps members, each about 15 people, annually. Historically, many of those service members have gone on to build careers in outdoor education. Some stick around Teton County and climb the ranks at Teton Science Schools.
“This is the beginning of their career,” Turner said. “Since we’ve been doing this in 2009, there’s been over 500 AmeriCorps volunteers who have come through Teton Science Schools.”

Other organizations across the state often depend on AmeriCorps VISTA members, who serve full time for one year and help with things like fundraising, grant writing, research and volunteer recruitment. This work, Harrington said, fills a costly void for organizations. 
VISTA members currently serving in Wyoming were told their positions have been terminated, effectively immediately, Harrington said.  
“It’s a slap in the face to people who’d decided to dedicate a year of life to serving and bettering their communities,” she said. “Now they’re being hung out to dry.” 
Still, Harrington said she’s cautiously optimistic Wyoming’s delegation will come through, particularly Barrasso who she said has shown repeated support for such programs. 
Plus, she said the Administrative Procedure Act allows for a seven-day objection period, and Harrington said she expects a challenge to be filed. 
“They’re not following the rules,” she said.

(Photos courtesy of the Doña Ana County Detention Center)Federal authorities arrested a former New Mexico magistrate judge and his wife on April 24 on criminal charges of evidence tampering related to the prosecution of an alleged gang member from Venezuela.
The U.S. Department of Justice on Friday announced it had charged former Doña Ana County Magistrate Jose Luis “Joel” Cano with one count of evidence tampering and his wife Nancy Cano with one count of conspiracy to tamper with evidence.
Prosecutors allege that Jose Cano told Homeland Security Investigations agents that he had destroyed a cell phone belonging to Cristhian Ortega-Lopez, a Venezuelan national prosecutors allege has ties to the Tren de Aragua gang.
HSI in February searched the Canos’ home and arrested Ortega-Lopez for illegal possession of guns and ammunition, according to the DOJ’s news release. The DOJ said agents seized three of Ortega-Lopez’s cell phones, but he told them about a fourth one, which prompted another search wherein Cano allegedly admitted to destroying it with a hammer.
“Judges are responsible for upholding our country’s laws. It is beyond egregious for a former judge and his wife to engage in evidence tampering on behalf of a suspected Tren de Aragua gang member accused of illegally possessing firearms,” U.S. Attorney Ryan Ellison for the District of New Mexico said in a statement. “The U.S. Attorney’s Office is committed to dismantling this foreign terrorist organization by disrupting its criminal operations in New Mexico. That starts by prosecuting those who support gang members — including judges.”
The DOJ announced the charges against the Canos in the same news release in which they announced the arrest of a Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Hannah C. Dugan for allegedly allowing a Mexican immigrant charged with domestic violence to temporarily avoid arrest by federal agents.
“The allegations against Judge Dugan and Judge Cano are serious: no one, least of all a judge, should obstruct law enforcement operations,” U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a statement. “Doing so imperils the safety of our law enforcement officers and undermines the rule of law. The Department of Justice will continue to follow the facts — no one is above the law.”
In the New Mexico case, immigration authorities arrested Ortega-Lopez in December 2023 in Texas for unlawfully entering the U.S., and released him in April 2024 because of overcrowding at the detention center where he was being held, according to court records.
An anonymous source in January tipped off the Homeland Security Investigations office in Las Cruces that Ortega-Lopez and two others were living in an apartment behind the Canos’ home, an HSI special agent wrote in an application for a search warrant.
The Judicial Standards Commission on March 5 petitioned the Supreme Court to suspend Cano for allegedly committing misconduct by allowing three members of the gang to live on his property in Las Cruces and to have access to firearms.
In a response, Jose Cano wrote to the Supreme Court justices that Ortega-Lopez told Nancy Cano that the trio “all had their legal papers to remain in the U.S. pending their Asylum Court hearings, which were already scheduled,” and that he had verified their court dates.
Jose Cano resigned as a magistrate judge on March 21, according to court records. The New Mexico Supreme Court on April 22 barred Cano from holding any judicial office or exercising any judicial authority. 
Both Canos are scheduled for preliminary and detention hearings Tuesday morning in federal court in Las Cruces.

UW-Madison Engineering Hall. (Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)University of Wisconsin international students’ visa terminations are being reversed by the Trump administration after many judges across the country blocked the actions, including in Wisconsin.
Dozens of UW students were part of a group of thousands of international students in the U.S. who had their visas abruptly cancelled without notice from the federal government and without a chance to challenge the decision. 
According to a Politico report Friday, the Trump administration said in federal court it was reversing course and reinstating visas for many international students and alumni. A Justice Department attorney said, according to the report, that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is “developing a policy that will provide a framework for SEVIS record terminations, and that the records for students “will remain active or shall be reactivated if not currently active, and ICE will not modify the record solely based on the [National Crime Information Center] finding that resulted in the recent SEVIS record termination.” The attorney also emphasized that ICE still has the authority to terminate a SEVIS record for other reasons.
The American Immigration Law Association estimates there were about 4,700 affected students across the country. 
UW-Madison said in a statement Monday that each of the 27 cancellations for its international students and alumni were reversed as of late afternoon Saturday, and that affected students and alumni will be able to continue their studies or post-graduation training at UW-Madison as a result.
Chancellor Jennifer Mnookin said in the statement that she was “relieved and grateful” for the development. 
“This situation was deeply troubling, upended lives and created both fear and harm,” Mnookin said. “I want to personally thank the many members of our community, along with local, state and federal officials, who worked to assist our students.”
Reported reversals started Thursday and continued through the weekend, according to UW-Madison, and similar to the cancellations, there was no explanation for the records being restored.
The institution said that it has notified the students of the most recent change to their records and that International Student Services and International Faculty and Staff Services are continuing to provide information, resources and support.
“We are pleased to see that all of our affected students and alumni have had their SEVIS records returned to active status, as it has been a difficult period for all involved,” UW- Madison International Division Dean Frances Vavrus said in a statement. “We will continue to follow this evolving situation closely throughout the summer and upcoming academic year.”
Universities of Wisconsin spokesperson Mark Pitsch said in an email that there have been “a number of reversals at our universities” and that the situation remains “fluid.”
Reversals come after judges in cases across at least 23 states had issued emergency orders temporarily blocking the government’s action including in Wisconsin.
In one case, Krish Lal Isserdasani, a 21-year-old computer engineering senior from India, had his SEVIS record terminated less than a month before he was scheduled to graduate from UW-Madison. His case had noted that Isserdasani and his family have spent about $240,000 on his education at UW-Madison and he could lose $17,500 on the current semester’s tuition and would be responsible for four months of rent despite not being able to stay in the country. Isserdasani had also reported a significant psychological impact, including “difficulty in sleeping and fear that he will be placed in immediate detention and deportation.” U.S. District Judge William Conley had temporarily blocked his visa cancellation. 
In another case last week, Conley said that the government had wrongly cancelled Yue “Alison” Yang, a UW-Madison student from China, and granted her protection from deportation. 
Despite the step back by the Trump administration, the ACLU of Wisconsin is calling for injunctive relief from federal courts. The ACLU of Wisconsin filed an amicus curiae brief in two cases challenging the revocations, including Isserdasani’s case and a case recently brought by three anonymous international UW-Madison students, saying the issue isn’t “moot.”
Tim Muth, senior staff attorney with the ACLU of Wisconsin, said that “resorting to the courts is continuing to be an important check on actions that this administration is taking without regard to the human consequences on persons like the student in this case.”
In an amicus curiae brief, Muth wrote that the reversal offers “little protection” for plaintiffs and urged the Court to issue a ruling that “declaring such terminations, without due process and without compliance with applicable law and regulation, to be illegal.”
“It is clear that the recent pivot by the federal government should not moot these 100+ cases pending around the country since they are clearly able to be reversed immediately after dismissal of suits challenging them, and the present likelihood of irreparable injury to the Plaintiffs remains a going concern,” Muth wrote in the amicus curiae.
Muth told the Wisconsin Examiner that the reversals are a sign of the Trump administration’s “losing record” in these cases, but said it’s difficult to trust the Trump administration on immigration matters. 
“It’s not as if the Department of Homeland Security issued a press release or a formal statement announcing a change in policy,” Muth said. “What we had were a couple of attorneys in a couple of different cases saying the government is reactivating student status in SEVIS… Nothing official… has come out from the government. No statement of ‘Oh, we made a mistake on these 4,700 students, and we’re going to correct it. We’re so sorry.’” 
Muth said that during a hearing Monday in Isserdasani’s case Conley asked the government’s lawyer if she was authorized to say that a termination of Isserdasani SEVIS status wouldn’t happen again under the “new policy that supposedly they are developing.” 
“The government’s lawyer was unable to say that it wouldn’t happen again,” Muth said. “That is why the ACLU and… lawyers for international students around the country are saying there continues to be the need for courts to step in until there’s some legally binding correction made by the government.”
Muth said the law is “pretty clear” about when international students can lose their status. Those cases include when someone is no longer a full time student, when someone is engaging in employment that isn’t authorized by the law, lying to ICE or committing a crime of violence. He said things like traffic citations or an arrest for a charge that has been dismissed (as in the case of Isserdasani) are not authorized reasons for terminating somebody’s F1 visa status. 
“It is not something that can just be done unilaterally because the government has decided it wants to have fewer international students,” Muth said. 
The brief notes that students were provided with “vague boilerplate reasons” for their visa termination. In Isserdasani’s case, he received an email that said he was “otherwise failing to maintain status” and that he was “identified in criminal records check and/or has had their VISA revoked.” It states that the reasoning does not satisfy due process requirements because it doesn’t describe a student’s circumstances and students are not provided with the opportunity to defend themselves. 
In the brief, Muth also notes the recent case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Maryland resident who was erroneously deported to El Salvador by the Trump administration, saying that the visa cancellations for international students are part of a larger pattern of the Trump administration ignoring the due process rights — which includes being entitled to notice and the opportunity to be heard — of noncitizens. 
“The due process protections of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution are protections, not just for U.S. citizens, but they are protections for everyone residing in this country — that right not to be arbitrarily arrested, detained, kicked out of the country,” Muth said. 
Muth said he didn’t know what new policy the Trump administration could be developing.
“If they’re talking about coming up with a policy that would allow them to terminate SEVIS records in that situation, I think they would be violating the existing law set up by Congress,” Muth said. “People are entitled to what they didn’t get here, which is, if you’re going to terminate my status, tell me why, and give me a chance to object if what you are doing is contrary to law or contrary to what the facts are.”

(Photo by Getty Images)The Iowa Senate passed a bill setting new standards for pharmacy benefit managers that lawmakers said will help keep rural pharmacies in business and lower the cost of prescription drugs.
Senate File 383, passed 36-14, is the legislation passed through the committee process earlier this year limiting certain PBM business practices. Pharmacy benefit managers are companies that serve as the negotiator between drug manufacturers, pharmacies and health insurance companies for setting prescription drug costs.
The legislation would set new regulations for PBMs, including requiring pharmacies to be reimbursed for the national or state average acquisition cost of a drug — a higher reimbursement rate than many pharmacies are currently receiving, according to several workers and owners of current rural pharmacies.
Many components of the bill deal with PBM practices to pressure or force consumers to use certain pharmacies to fill a prescription. The bill specifically prohibits PBM strategies like setting different cost-sharing rates or implementing financial advantages or penalties for the use of certain pharmacies to fill a prescription. It also restricts other methods of PBMs limiting the use of certain pharmacies if that provider has agreed to participate in a person’s health benefit plan.

Earlier in the legislative session, pharmacists and supporters told lawmakers the bill would help Iowa pharmacies stay in business, linking the closure of many locally owned, rural pharmacies in recent years to PBM practices that favor mail-order prescription refills and certain pharmacy chains.
The bill was amended by the Senate Monday to define “retail pharmacies” and “pharmacy chains.” The Senate amendment also makes some changes to the language about how rebates received by a PBM on drugs are returned to a health benefit plan to reduce insurance premiums.
The bill’s floor manager Sen. Mike Klimesh, R-Spillville, said the legislation was important to him because of his own experience having medicine for his father, which could only be filled by a mail-order pharmacy, get lost in the mail. He said ensuring rural pharmacies in Iowa stay in business is necessary to help keep Iowans healthy, saying local pharmacies can help address problems and adjust to the medical needs of people in their community in real time.
“We need to have a conversation about what rural health care looks like in Iowa,” Klimesh said. “And one of those main talking points about rural health care in Iowa is not only just a clinic you go to to get your check up, or the hospital you see, but the next step in that in that phase — which is the pharmacy, the pharmacy to fill your prescription.”
Many local pharmacies have closed in recent years, which Klimesh said was largely due to unfair business practices by PBMs. More than 150 Iowa pharmacies have closed in the past 10 years, and 31 closed in 2024, according to the Iowa Pharmacy Association. Klimesh said if the Legislature does not pass a bill regulating and PBM practices and improving transparency, “we are setting (Iowans) up for having no access to a pharmacy.”
“I lost four alone in my district, and once they close, they’re not going to reopen,” Klimesh said. “So this bill is a great step in the right direction to provide transparency.”
Sen. Sarah Trone Garriott, D-West Des Moines, said she supported a measure to restrict PBM business practices, but said Senate Republicans’ amended legislation would lead to consumer cost increases. She introduced an amendment that would require negotiated drug manufacture rebates exclusively go to reducing health care plan premiums. Her proposal also would require pharmacies with five or less organizations and pharmacies that are the only entity able to fill a prescription in their community receive a $10.68 dispensing fee for every prescription they fill.
Trone Garriott said she believed Klimesh’s amended bill would lead to significantly increased health insurance costs for Iowans, while her amendment would ensure Iowans do not lose access to health coverage because of efforts to regulate PBMs.
“(The amendment) does increase prices on consumers, it does increase prices on Iowa,” Trone Garriott said. “The amendment that I am presenting today has a much smaller increase. When we compare $160 increase to $6 increase, that’s a pretty big difference when it comes to folks who are working so hard to make ends meet. We have to take seriously that the PBMs have promised they’re going to pass the cost along to the consumers, and we want to shield the people of Iowa from increased costs, while protecting our small town and rural pharmacies.”
Klimesh called Trone Garriott’s amendment “PBM reform light.” He said the issues she brought up with rebates were already addressed in his amendment, stating a transparency provision in the bill “forces all rebates to flow back to the plan payer,” and said the Democratic senator’s amendment did not address issues with spread price manipulation, where PBMs charge payers like Medicaid more than a pharmacy is paid for a medication.
Trone Garriott’s amendment failed, while Klimesh’s amendment was adopted. The amended legislation heads to the House for further consideration. The House passed a companion version of the legislation through the committee process in March, but has not yet had floor debate on the measure.

Should the “governor’s mansion” be converted into a roller rink? What about a dorm for legislators with children?
Those were a couple of ideas legislators brought up in the Senate on Monday before the body voted 23-27 against Senate Joint Resolution 45, which called for a study to determine a use for the vacant executive residence.
Historically, the governors of Montana have resided in the “governor’s mansion,” a 12,000 square foot home at 2 N. Carson St. that’s part of the Capitol Complex.
But Gov. Greg Gianforte has his own residence in Helena, the official executive residence has been vacant for at least three years, and it’s in disrepair, according to reports to legislative committees.
In 2019 and 2021, the Montana Legislature appropriated a total $2.3 million for upgrades, but bids for upgrades came in higher, as much as $3.6 million instead, according to state officials.
In the meantime, resolution sponsor Sen. Mary Ann Dunwell, D-Helena, said maintenance is costing taxpayers $100,000 a year, and it’s time for a plan.
Legislators have said interest in the property is high, at least among the citizens of Helena and some history lovers.
“We have, as you recall, $2.3 million sitting in an account that’s not being used to renovate, in some way, this building,” Dunwell said.
In a separate bill that didn’t pass earlier this session, Dunwell had suggested the residence be used as a rental for legislative staff, with priority for those with disabilities.
At the time, at least one member of the Senate State Administration Committee suggested a study might be in order instead.
On the floor Monday, Sen. Greg Hertz, R-Polson, said it’s clear the building just needs to be torn down, and he shared one idea to save maintenance money.
“I’ll do the maintenance for $50,000 a year,” Hertz said.
Sen. Jacinda Morigeau, D-Arlee, reminded the Senate of another related plan.
In January 2024, the Governor’s Office said Gov. Greg Gianforte and Susan Gianforte bought the historic Hauser Mansion in Helena, and they plan to donate it to the state “following my service.”
But Morigeau said legislators can help the governor decide what to do with the Carson Street mansion, and she encouraged senators to vote yes on the study.
“I want to see it turned into – I don’t know – a roller rink?” Morigeau said.
Sen. Daniel Zolnikov, R-Billings, said he thought a dorm for legislators would be great, and he’d call dibs on a room.
Although the Senate opposed the study, Sen. Wendy McKamey, R-Great Falls, said the Capitol Complex Advisory Council already meets about the area, the group includes legislators, and the question doesn’t require an entire study.
“It’s not like the legislature does not have a voice in this. We do,” McKamey said.
However, in committee earlier this month, McKamey also noted the history contained in the house.
She mentioned some “two dozen hand needle-pointed chairs,” which she said need to be preserved. Dunwell said she had been advised the chairs were in storage.
In the hearing about the resolution, the Senate State Administration Committee heard the cost of getting the residence in shape — between $3.2 million and $3.6 million.
Director Misty Ann Giles had offered a piece of advice for anyone walking around in the unoccupied “governor’s mansion” owned by the state.
“If you do go over there, please don’t take off your shoes,” said Giles, head of the Department of Administration.
The carpet is from the 1950s, the plumbing is shot, the kitchen is “barely functional,” it needs $180,000 worth of asbestos abatement, and the committee learned more about the general “disarray” at the hearing.
In response, Sen. Bob Phalen, R-Lindsay, had a question of his own to state officials.
“So how much would you take for it?” Phalen asked.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Montana-Gov-Mansion-postcard-1024x632.jpg,,,2025-04-28 21:01:04.682043

This voting location is one of the most popular in the county. (Laurel Demkovich/Washington State Standard)Seattle voters will be asked in August if they want to continue paying for the city’s democracy voucher program — a first-of-its-kind public campaign-financing system that gives voters money to donate to political candidates.
Seattle voters created the program in 2015, along with a 10-year property tax levy to fund it. The voucher program aims to make election financing more diverse and equitable by giving voters four $25 coupons they can give to city of Seattle candidates during elections.
Ten years after it was created, city officials say the program has been a success. On Monday, the Seattle City Council voted unanimously to send a property tax levy renewal to the August ballot that would fund the program for another decade.
If passed, the levy would cost the median homeowner about $13 a year and raise about $45 million over 10 years. The figure is about $15 million higher than the expiring levy to account for inflation and increased candidate participation in the program.
City Council members praised the program across the board, with several saying they’d seen the positive impact firsthand during their own runs for office.
“For me, this specifically meant that I didn’t need to take campaign donations that I felt might have implicit strings attached,” said Councilmember Dan Strauss. “This allowed me to be more independent, and it meant that I actively chose to knock on everyday Seattleites’ doors rather than spending time on the phone, calling political donors.”
Many Councilmembers said the program is especially important in light of threats to democracy at the national level and the growing influence of wealth in politics.
“Our democracy is at risk,” said Councilmember Alexis Mercedes Rinck. “We must take every step here in Seattle to protect it, because in a healthy democracy, billionaires can’t buy elections.”
Most democracy vouchers go unused. A study by researchers at Stony Brook and Georgetown University found that participation among the voting-age population declined from 7.59% in the 2021 election to 4.72% in 2023.
City Council member Cathy Moore noted that there remains a need to educate people about the program, particularly in communities where English is not the primary language.
Candidates in the races for Seattle mayor, city attorney and three Council seats are eligible for democracy vouchers this year.

(Photo by Jared Strong/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa farmers had just over two days suitable for field work last week due to rainy conditions, but the percentages of corn and soybean acres planted remain ahead of average rates, according to the state’s crop progress and condition report.
State Climatologist Justin Glisan said Iowa had “an unseasonably wet reporting period” with the average precipitation for the week above 2 inches and more than 5 inches in some areas of the state. 
The precipitation raised soil moisture conditions, making topsoil conditions 86% adequate or wetter. Subsoil conditions rated 67% adequate moisture.

Thirty-four percent of Iowa’s corn acres and 25% of soybean acres are in the ground, which is up from 18% and 11% respectively from last week. Northwest Iowa has the highest percentages of crops in the group. 
Temperatures for the reporting period of April 21 through April 27 averaged in the mid 50s, which is 2.2 degrees Fahrenheit higher than normal.

Iowa oat farmers are almost finished seeding as more than 80% of oat acres have been planted, though only 41% of anticipated oat acres have emerged, which is three days behind the year prior.
Pastures in Iowa rated 91% fair or better and according to the report, some cow calf pairs across the state were put on pasture.  
Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said the upcoming warm temperatures and potential break in rain events should “give farmers a window to get in the field.” The secretary also noted the Monday night forecast, which shows a potential for severe weather in the state. 
“This is a good reminder to Iowans to be vigilant, have safety plans in place and be ready to take shelter if needed,” Naig said in a statement.

March 3, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — State lawmakers scheduled three eastern Nebraska public forums this weekend to allow the public to weigh in on medical cannabis and proposed state legislation.
State Sens. John Cavanaugh of Omaha, Rick Holdcroft of Bellevue and Ben Hansen of Blair plan to host the series this Saturday in La Vista, Sunday in Omaha and Monday in Lincoln. Attendants will be able to hear updates on the status of medical cannabis legislation, namely Hansen’s Legislative Bill 677, and “share their thoughts.”
The schedule is as follows:

Saturday, May 3, from 1-3 p.m. at the Carpenters Union Hall in La Vista (10761 Virginia Plaza, La Vista).
Sunday, May 4, from 1-3 p.m., at the University of Nebraska at Omaha Thompson Alumni Center (8800 Dodge St., Omaha).
Monday, May 5, from 5-7 p.m., at Southeast Community College (8800 O St., Lincoln).

The hosts plan to accommodate everyone who wishes to speak during the two-hour events.

In November, about 71% of Nebraskans legalized medical cannabis with a physician’s recommendation, and 67% of Nebraskans voted for a regulatory scheme.
“Since the legislature has failed to act at this point, I want to give the citizens an opportunity to have their voices heard by their elected representatives,” Cavanaugh told the Nebraska Examiner.
General Affairs Committee
Hansen’s LB 677 seeks to help the ballot measures build better guardrails, with help from supporters who put the measures on the ballot.
His bill would delay full implementation of the regulatory law to give the new Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission time to craft regulations that, without funding, officials have said is near impossible to get done by the voter-set July 1 deadline or begin licensing by Oct. 1.
LB 677 has stalled in the Legislature’s General Affairs Committee that Holdcroft chairs. Cavanaugh is the vice chair.
Holdcroft, who has said he would support a narrowed LB 677, said he is looking for “back and forth” at the public forums, such as whether to allow smoking or how many dispensaries should be permitted.
At an April 17 meeting of committee members, the committee considered a narrower committee amendment that sought to create a list of qualifying conditions, restrict who can recommend medical cannabis, exclude smoking as permissible for medical cannabis and prohibit sales of natural cannabis flower or bud.
None of the eight committee members tried to attach the amendment to LB 677. Advancing the bill as-is failed along ideological lines, 3-5.

Five days later, Hansen filed an amendment to add post-traumatic stress disorder as a qualifying condition and allow sales of flower and bud, the latter of which is a line in the sand for Hansen. Hansen also filed what is known as a “pull motion” that would advance LB 677, with at least 25 votes in the full 49-member legislative body and start the three-round debate.
The latest Hansen amendment would not allow smoking.
Holdcroft and Hansen continue to discuss whether a path forward in the committee exists. Speaker John Arch of La Vista, who sets the daily legislative agenda, declined to say if he would schedule the pull motion as those discussions continue.
‘Uphold the voice of the people’
Crista Eggers, executive director of Nebraskans for Medical Marijuana, said her team is “very appreciative” of lawmakers’ efforts to give voters a chance to voice their feelings on the issue.
“While we find it disheartening that Nebraskans are being asked to ‘clarify their vote,’ we hope this final effort makes it clear: Nebraskans support medical cannabis. They knew what they were voting for,” Eggers said. “They now are demanding lawmakers to uphold the voice of the people.”
LB 677 faces a tight timeline and fiscal situation in the waning days of the 2025 legislative session. Debate on the state’s budget bills — with a major hole to still fill — is set to begin May 6. The final budget must pass by May 15.
Lawmakers are set to adjourn for the year on June 9.
Also co-hosting the public forums are State Sens. Ashlei Spivey of Omaha, John Fredrickson of Omaha, Jane Raybould of Lincoln, Victor Rountree of Bellevue, Margo Juarez of Omaha, Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha, Megan Hunt of Omaha, Myron Dorn of Adams, Merv Riepe of Ralston, Wendy DeBoer of Omaha, Tom Brandt of Plymouth, George Dungan of Lincoln and Danielle Conrad of Lincoln.

 | ScreenshotWith Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan opting against seeking a fourth term in pursuit of the governor’s seat, Detroit is in need of a new mayor. On Saturday  seven hopeful candidates met at Riverside Marina to introduce themselves and make their case for why they were the best qualified to lead the city. 
Former nonprofit CEO Saunteel Jenkins, attorney Todd Perkins, former police Chief James Craig, businessmen Joel Haashiim, City Councilmember Fred Durhal III, entrepreneur Jonathan Barlow and City Council President Mary Sheffield each took time to flex their qualifications while taking questions on how they would work to support the city’s residents and address its most pressing issues, alongside their plans to maintain vital programs when the state’s American Rescue Plan Act funding expires at the end of 2026. 
Triumph Church Pastor Rev. Solomon Kinloch, Jr. and two-time mayoral candidate Danetta Simpson have also filed to run in the Aug. 5 mayoral primary, though the two were not present at Saturday’s forum.
During the forum candidates were asked to name the city’s biggest problem and what they would do to address it, with candidates pointing to economic opportunity, housing, public safety and empowering residents through education and opportunities within Detroit neighborhoods as the issues at the top of their mind. 
Several candidates also called attention to the need for affordable childcare, following a question on how they would uplift women of color within the city.
“When we talk about some of the issues that our women face, particularly here in the city of Detroit, I will tell you, as a father who drops his son off at daycare, childcare is too expensive,” Durhal said. 
“Paying $2,000 a month to have childcare for your children is crazy. And so imagine if you are a single parent, mother or father, and you have to go to work, you have to take your child to daycare. You have to rush there. You gotta get there before six o’clock and they charge you a premium if you don’t. This is reality,” Durhal said. 
The candidates were also asked how they’d maintain programs, services and jobs created using more than $800 million in COVID-19 relief funds which are set to run out at the end of 2026.

Jenkins said the next mayor will need to dig into the numbers to make sure the city has enough revenues, alongside working with the state and the federal government — “whether they like it or not.”
Perkins called for a full scale audit of the city, as did Craig and Haashim. 
However, Perkins said he wasn’t afraid to take Lansing or the White House to court to ensure the city receives any funding it is due. 
“Whether it be the United States America versus or Perkins Law Group versus, I’ve been on one side of that ‘v’, and I’m not afraid of confrontation because out of confrontation and discord, we get understanding,” Perkins said.
Craig said he would leverage his ties to the White House, with Craig previously drawing praise from President Donald Trump for his leadership amid Black Lives Matter protests in Summer of 2020.
The city later agreed to a $1 million settlement after protestors filed federal lawsuits arguing the Detroit Police Department used unconstitutional and excessive force and prevented the protestors from exercising their First Amendment rights. 
“This is about the city of Detroit. It has nothing to do with the person sitting in the White House or James Craig. It has everything to do with the city of Detroit,” Craig said. 
Amid talk of forensic audits of the city’s budget, Durhal encouraged his fellow candidates to watch him chair the city’s Budget, Finance and Audit Standing Committee, where they will review audits from the auditor general. 
The council has already begun taking steps to convert jobs added through federal funding into permanent positions, Durhal said, but the next mayor will also need to be brave enough to tell people that they must remain fiscally prudent.
Sheffield noted that under her leadership the city had passed 12 balanced budgets, and that she would work with private and philanthropic support to see how the city could continue some of its grant programs.
“Our day one intention is to join a coalition with our local hospitals — because there’s a correlation between health and housing — to create a pot of money that can continue funding home repair grants here in the city of Detroit,” Sheffield said. 
She also said the city needed to diversify its revenues including working with  the federal government and bipartisan leadership in Lansing. 
Barlow touted his business connections and relationships with political leaders like Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.) and Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens.
“No one behind me can tell you where they sit at on the yachts down in Mar a Lago or down in Miami. I’m the only one who’s taking a yacht from this marina all the way down to Miami. That’s because we play at a different level when we don’t get involved in petty popularity politics at the local level,” Barlow said, later arguing the city could better assess its assets.
Detroit residents will vote in the nonpartisan primary election on Aug. 5, and the candidates with the two highest vote totals will face off once more in the Nov. 4 general election.

Office of Equal Opportunity officially eliminated 
Morrisey approved Senate Bill 837, sponsored by Sen. Patricia Rucker, R-Jefferson, that will formally eliminate the state’s Office of Equal Opportunity by repealing its mandate in state code. The office was tasked with complying with federal disability rights and investigated discrimination and harassment claims from public employees.
While vetting the bills, members of the House of Delegates learned that the OEO seemed to already be gone without lawmakers’ required approval. The office doesn’t have any employees or a website. 
Lawmakers opted to keep the office’s director position within the Division of Personnel, though the position is currently vacant. Rucker said the bill was an effort to streamline state government since the OEO’s work was already being done by the Division of Personnel. 
Morrisey also signed another measure sponsored by Rucker that will terminate the “Employee Suggestion Award Board” by terminating five sections of code, including a program that provides cash or honorary awards to state employees whose adopted suggestions result in substantial savings or improvement in state operations.
“We heard that this is not really helping the state. We were very hopeful when this got passed years ago that employees would be able to give us ideas that would really significantly find waste and we could reduce cost to the state. But that is not what has happened,” Rucker said during bill debate March 20 in the Senate. “Unfortunately, It has been years since there’s been a single suggestion.”
Rucker said they encouraged state agencies to still accept suggestions from employees regarding cost savings. 
New law rolls back teen work permit requirement  
The governor signed Senate Bill 427 that will roll back work permit requirements for 14- and 15-year olds in West Virginia. The bill is sponsored by Sen. Rupie Phillips, R-Logan. 
Current state law requires 14- and 15-year-olds who want to work to get a permit from their school superintendent; the new law, which goes into effect in July, no longer requires that permit. 
Employers seeking to hire the teenagers will still be required to obtain an age certificate verifying the child’s age from the state Division of Labor and the written consent of the child’s parent or guardian. 
The age certificate would include the child’s age, name and date of birth, as well as information about the job they’re seeking, among other things.
Controversial DEI bill not yet signed 
The governor still hasn’t signed off on a number of high-profile Republican-backed measures from this year’s legislative session, including a bill tightening the state’s already-strict ban on gender-affirming care for minors and a measure requiring school employees to alert parents when a child requests to be referred to by a different name or pronouns that are different from the student’s biological sex.
While Morrisey issued an executive order eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion programs in state government, he hasn’t yet signed a bill that would codify that order. The measure is facing a potential legal challenge after the Senate’s Democratic members said the bill was not legally passed on the final night of session because of a “series of procedural irregularities.”

Greg Gianforte signs House Bill 337 into law, giving Montanans a $756 million income tax cut over the next four years. (Micah Drew/Daily Montanan)Surrounded by three dozen Republican lawmakers on the steps of the Montana capitol, Gov. Greg Gianforte on Monday signed into law a bill cutting income taxes — the third reduction over the five years of his administration. 
House Bill 337, sponsored by House Speaker Brandon Ler, R-Savage, lowers Montana’s top tax rate by .5% over two years, expands the eligibility threshold for filers to pay the state’s lower tax rate, and doubles the Earned Income Tax Credit. 
“Once again this legislative session, we’re putting money back in Montanan’s pockets through permanent, long term tax reductions, and we couldn’t have done it without the legislators that are here with me today,” Gianforte said before affixing his signature to the new law. 
Calling it the “largest tax cut in Montana’s history,” Gianforte said decreasing the top tax rate was a step closer to his goal of having a single, flat rate in the state, which he said will make the state more friendly to businesses and individuals. 
“We still have the highest income tax rate in the region and one of the highest in the nation. It’s a drag on our economy, a wet blanket on job creation and a burden on Montana families,” Gianforte said. 
While the governor focused most of his remarks on the reduction of the top tax rate from 5.9% to 5.4% over the next biennium, Ler remarked that the bill’s “real power comes from how we’ve restructured the entire system.”
The threshold where Montana filers move between the state’s two income brackets is substantially raised under the new law — essentially tripling the income individuals and joint filers can earn before paying a higher rate. The law also doubles the state’s earned income credit, which targets the state’s lowest earners. 
“This is reform that reaches everyone,” Ler said. “We didn’t get here overnight. This bill is a result of careful policy work and a clear vision that is a shared belief that Montanans deserve a tax code that works for them, not against them.”

The three changes made to the state’s tax structure will reduce the revenue flowing to the state’s general fund by roughly $756 million by fiscal year 2029, according to a fiscal analysis of the legislation, which was a major sticking point for detractors. 
Sen. Dave Fern, D-Whitefish, said the bill was “well meaning, but it’s just too expensive,” during debate on the Senate floor. Fern brought his own income tax bill aimed at lower and middle class earners that carried a lower fiscal note but didn’t make it through the House.
The bill passed both chambers with all Democrats in opposition on their initial votes, and just two Democrats voting for the bill overall. 
“Government does not exist to give tax cuts to people who do not need them. Government exists to fund schools, fix roads, and provide public safety. Democrats do not support robbing people of essential services to pay for tax cuts for people who absolutely do not need them,” House Appropriations Committee Vice Chairperson Rep. Mary Caferro, D-Helena, said in a press release. “The public is not crying out for more tax cuts for people at the top.”
Gianforte proposed an even larger tax break in his budget last November, which would have cut the top tax rate by a full percentage point without adjusting the lower rate threshold. The new law emerged as a compromise between the governor’s plan and one championed by the conservative wing of the senate. 
“I’ve heard loud and clear from Montanans in every corner of our state, income tax relief is a top priority, and I’m incredibly proud of each person up here for helping deliver that needed relief,” Gianforte said.

Senate File 175, approved 33-16, would require human growth and development classes for Iowa students in grades 5-12 include ultrasound video and computer-generated rendering or animations depicting “the humanity of the unborn child by showing prenatal human development, starting at fertilization.”
 This measure was modeled after laws in other states and similar bills brought up in previous sessions that referenced the “Meet Baby Olivia” video created by anti-abortion group Live Action, though the 2025 legislation does not mention the video by name.
The bill was amended by the House April 17 to ban materials on fetal development from being shown in classrooms if the entity that created it performs or “promotes” abortions, or if it contracts, affiliates, or makes referrals to organizations that perform or promote abortions.
Democrat in both chambers said this amendment would lead to inaccurate and biased material being shown in Iowa classrooms, as most of the medical organizations that work on issues related to pregnancy and fetal development perform or provide referrals for abortions when medically necessary. The measure only refers to “abortion” at large, and does not exclude entities that only perform medically necessary abortions, such as in cases when the pregnancy puts the life of the mother at risk.
The Mayo Clinic, a Minnesota-based health care provider, was brought up as an organization that would be excluded from school material under the bill despite being a leading professional source on fetal development.
Sen. Zach Wahls, D-Coralville, also argued that material from the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics would be excluded, as the UI hospital system performs abortions to save the life of the pregnant person. Wahls also said material developed by other UI entities like the proposed “center for intellectual freedom” would also be excluded, as it is “affiliated” with UIHC.
“I think it’s very clear that by being an affiliate of an entity that performs abortions — and that is something that happens at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics — research, human-based, age-appropriate curriculum that was being developed at the University of Iowa, is no longer going to be acceptable in Iowa classrooms,” Wahls said. “That is just very peculiar.”
Sen. Jeff Taylor, R-Sioux Center, said he preferred the Senate version and felt the House amendment was “probably unnecessary given the parameters of the original bill” — arguing that entities performing abortions would already be excluded from creating school materials under the original legislation, as the material is required to depict “the humanity of the unborn child.”
“Entities that perform or promote abortions are liable to be biased against the humanity and inherent value of human life before birth, which is one of the central components of this bill,” Taylor said. “That is not to say that everything they produce is false, but in order to be unbiased, it doesn’t make sense to use prenatal development information from abortion advocates.”
He said opponents were ignoring the language in the bill requiring the information shown in school classrooms be medically accurate and research-based. However, he said this material could show a “biased” view if they perform abortions or support access to abortions, pointing to guidance from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists to use the term “embryo” instead of “baby” or “unborn child” when discussing early stages of gestation.
“Embryo is an accurate scientific term to refer to a specific point in the human development process, but it is important to not leave out that this is a stage of human development,” Taylor said. “Using material from abortion advocates may provide a tainted view of human life before birth, and that is unfair to young learning minds. Embryos, fetuses, babies, adolescents and adults are all human, and that fact should not be hidden — that every life, no matter how small, contains humanity and dignity from the very start.”

,DC,2025-04-28 23:34:06+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump orders list of ‘sanctuary cities’ to target for funding freeze,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-orders-list-sanctuary-cities-target-funding-freeze,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump on Monday evening signed executive orders targeting so-called sanctuary cities by threatening to revoke federal funding and providing legal services and national security assets to law enforcement.The signings fell on the eve of Trump’s first 100 days of his second term, during which his administration has enacted an immigration crackdown that has led to clashes with the judiciary branch and cities that do not coordinate with federal immigration authorities, often referred to as “sanctuary cities.""“Some State and local officials nevertheless continue to use their authority to violate, obstruct, and defy the enforcement of Federal immigration laws,” according to the executive order regarding sanctuary cities. “This is a lawless insurrection against the supremacy of Federal law and the Federal Government's obligation to defend the territorial sovereignty of the United States.”The order directs the Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security to publicly list local jurisdictions that limit cooperation with immigration officials, but do not stop immigration enforcement.Jurisdictions on the list will then be reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget to “identify appropriate Federal funds to sanctuary jurisdictions, including grants and contracts, for suspension or termination, as appropriate.”This is not the first time the Trump administration has targeted jurisdictions that don’t fully cooperate with federal immigration enforcement. The Justice Department recently filed a lawsuit against the city of Rochester, New York, over its immigration policies after local law enforcement did not assist federal immigration officials in an arrest. The Trump administration argued those ordinances in Rochester were impeding federal immigration enforcement.The president also signed an executive order in January that threatened to withhold federal funding from states and local governments that refused to aid in federal immigration enforcement activities. A federal judge in San Francisco last week blocked the Trump administration from withholding federal funds from 16 so-called sanctuary cities.Republicans have also scrutinized those policies, including during a six-hour hearing of the U.S. House Oversight and Government Reform Committee that included grilling mayors from Boston, Chicago and Denver, on their cities’ immigration policies. The executive order also aims to curb any federal benefits that may extend to people without permanent legal status.That executive order directed DOJ and DHS to “take appropriate action to stop the enforcement of State and local laws” that allow for students without proper legal authorization to receive in-state tuition, which would include those with Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA.Last week, administration officials cheered the FBI arrest of a Wisconsin judge who they say helped an immigrant in the country without legal authorization escape detention by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.The arrest followed the third appearance by ICE officers seeking to make arrests at the Milwaukee County Courthouse, a practice some experts believe hinders local law enforcement.Law enforcement resourcesA second executive order Trump signed Monday provides legal resources for law enforcement officials “who unjustly incur expenses and liabilities for actions taken during the performance of their official duties to enforce the law.”The order also directs coordination among the departments of Justice, Defense and Homeland Security to “increase the provision of excess military and national security assets in local jurisdictions to assist State and local law enforcement.” Earlier Monday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the executive order relating to law enforcement will “strengthen and unleash America’s law enforcement to pursue criminals and protect innocent citizens.”",,,,2025-04-28 20:06:06.666158

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — A retired teacher is the governor’s choice to fill a long-vacant seat on the Oklahoma State Board of Education.
Gov. Kevin Stitt announced Monday he chose Becky Carson for the board position representing Congressional District 5 to a term expiring April 2, 2027. The seat has been empty for almost two years since former board member Trent Smith resigned.
Carson, of Edmond, was a special education teacher for 30 years, serving students in third through fifth grade with mild disabilities.
She also has owned multiple businesses, according to the governor’s announcement.
“I am honored to serve on the state Board of Education,” Carson said in a statement. “Throughout my career, I’ve always believed that every child deserves a chance to reach their full potential. I am committed, dependable and ready to help ensure every Oklahoma student has the opportunity to succeed.”
Her appointment to the board hinges on whether the state Senate confirms her.

She would be the third former educator among the sitting members, following state Superintendent Ryan Walters, who taught history at McAlester and Millwood high schools, and Mike Tinney, who taught history in the small Oklahoma town of Chattanooga before becoming an attorney.
“Her commitment to doing what’s best for students and her proven leadership will make her an outstanding addition to the state Board of Education,” Stitt said.
The governor tried to appoint former Trump administration official Alex Gray to the role last year, but Gray’s home senator responsible for carrying his nomination, Sen. Carri Hicks, D-Oklahoma City, declined to do so, calling him unqualified for the position. Without her support, his nomination never came up for a Senate confirmation vote and therefore failed.
It wasn’t immediately clear which of four possible senators would have to carry Carson’s nomination. Sen. Adam Pugh, R-Edmond; Sen. Kristen Thompson, R-Edmond; Sen. Kelly Hines, R-Edmond, and Sen. Grant Green, R-Wellston, each have Edmond addresses within their districts.
Pugh said the Senate Education Committee, which he leads, and the full Senate have until the end of this year’s legislative session to consider Carson’s confirmation.
“We’ll meet with her privately so the committee has time to get to know her and ask some questions,” Pugh said.

Three other recent appointees to the board — Tinney, Chris Van Denhende and Ryan Deatherage — have taken office but also are waiting for Senate confirmation.
The senators representing Tinney and Deatherage’s home districts — Sen. Lisa Standridge, R-Norman, and Sen. Darcy Jech, R-Kingfisher, respectively — did not immediately return requests for comment on whether they intend to support the appointees’ confirmations.
Sen. Regina Goodwin, D-Tulsa, is the home senator for Van Denhende. She said her concerns with newly proposed academic standards for social studies have weighed heavily on her decision.
Van Denhende voted in favor of the social studies standards, but he later said he was unaware of controversial last-minute changes made to the final draft before he took the vote. Tinney and Deatherage also said they had no idea of the changes, which included language stating there were “discrepancies” in 2020 election results.
Van Denhende said during Thursday’s board meeting that if he knew then what he knows now, he would have voted against the standards. He told The Oklahoman he wants the Legislature to send the standards back to the board for another review.
“The process is not a good process,” Van Denhende said during Thursday’s meeting.
House and Senate Democrats filed resolutions on March 31 to reject the social studies standards and return them to the board. The Senate GOP caucus is now deliberating a similar resolution.
Goodwin said she and Van Denhende agree on the issue.
“We are in agreement that there was a failure in the standards process and the matter should be returned to the board,” Goodwin said. “Based on (his) recommendation that the matter be returned to the board, I would support his nomination.”

(LDEQ)The top financial officer for the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality has left the agency, marking the latest in a string of high-level departures under Secretary Aurelia Giacometto.
Theresa Delafosse, the lead administrator at LDEQ’s Financial Services Division, has transferred out of the agency after nine years on the job. The State Civil Service Commission confirmed her transfer but did not yet have any details about her new assignment. 
Delafosse could not be reached for comment Monday. 
A licensed attorney and certified public accountant, Delafosse was the highest ranking fiscal employee at LDEQ and the lone remaining executive in the agency’s Office of Management and Finance. 
Former Undersecretary Christian Griffiths was in charge of that office until he transferred from the agency in September after just a few months on the job. 
Delafosse previously worked at the state Department of Revenue and the Louisiana Legislative Auditor’s Office. Her departure comes about a month after Legislative Auditor Mike Waguespack published the results of a workplace culture survey that indicated pervasive low morale under Giacometto’s leadership with some employees reporting feeling pressured to violate the law or department policy.

Her exit also comes roughly two weeks after the abrupt resignation of long-time LDEQ ombudsman Roger Ward, who disseminated a scathing seven-page letter detailing what he called “the increasingly erratic and alarmingly vicious behavior” of Giacometto. Ward said he wrote the letter in lieu of providing an exit interview, a long-established LDEQ practice Giacometto ended recently. 
Ward’s missive reinforces a similar departing letter former LDEQ Undersecretary Chandra Pidgeon wrote in March 2024 after a few short weeks of being hired. Pigeon similarly complained about Giacometto’s “harassment of longtime employees” and other actions.
“I have worked for 23 years for the state of Louisiana, and I have never encountered a leader so destructive, calculating, and callous,” she wrote.
LDEQ’s communications division did not respond to a request for comment for this report Monday afternoon.
LDEQ executives and key employees that have left the agency under Giacometto’s tenure include, among others:

Chandra Pigeon, undersecretary
Stacey Holley, chief of staff
Justin Crossie, chief of staff
Meagan Molter, communications director
Christian Griffiths, undersecretary
Jordan Deshotels, undersecretary
Jared Champagne, training and development program manager

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch )The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency granted an emergency waiver permitting the nationwide sale of a fuel blend with higher amounts of ethanol through the summer months, which fuel and farm leaders say will help farmers, fuel producers and drivers at the pumps.
Midwestern states, including Iowa and South Dakota, already had waivers in place to allow for summer sales of fuel blended with 15% ethanol, also known as E15. EPA’s decision Monday waives the agency’s summer restrictions on the fuel for the rest of the country and follows guidance from the president’s executive order from January, declaring a national energy emergency.
The press release from EPA said the move will “provide families with relief” by providing more options at the pump with lower prices per gallon.
U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-South Dakota, said Monday on social media that the decision “supports our producers, gives consumers more options at the pump, and bolsters our energy security.” Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota, also praised the move on social media, calling it “a positive step for South Dakota farmers and consumers.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig applauded the decision and said Iowa drivers saved more than $38 million by choosing E15 over E10, a lower blend of ethanol fuel, in 2024.
“Today’s E15 announcement by the Trump Administration is a win for consumers across the U.S. and farmers here in Iowa,” Naig said in a statement. “This decision is a big step toward making our country more energy dominant, independent, and secure.”
Iowa Sens. Joni Ernst and Chuck Grassley both applauded the measure, noting it was an example of “promises made, promises kept” by the president and would be a “big” boost for corn farmers.
“It’s clear (President Trump) is making our farmers, producers, and all of rural America a priority, and I look forward to working alongside him to secure permanent, nationwide access to this cleaner, cheaper choice at the pump,” Ernst said in a statement.
According to National Corn Growers Association, year-round E15 sales throughout the country would lead to an increased demand of more than 2 billion bushels of corn annually, which is why the group has pushed for increased ethanol demand.
Brent Johnson, president of Iowa Farm Bureau Federation, applauded the EPA decision, but noted EPA has consistently issued similar waivers, and urged for a permanent change to the rule.
“Clearly, there is strong consumer demand for a lower-cost fuel option at the pump, and Iowa farmers stand by readily able to meet the growing demand for biofuels,” Johnson said in a statement.
Naig similarly noted the need for a permanent regulation allowing the sale of the fuel. He, along with Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird and industry groups have all sent letters to congressional leaders urging the passage of such a law.
“We are tired of waiting,” Monte Shaw, executive director of Iowa Renewable Fuels Association said in a statement. “Consumers and retailers are tired of waiting. E15 could provide a market for 5 to 7 billion gallons of additional ethanol demand at a time when American farmers and rural communities are hurting.”
The EPA waiver is in place from May 1 through May 20, as the Clean Air Act only allows a 20-day waiver, but considering trends from the past several summers, industry leaders expect the waiver will be extended through the other summer months.

Melissa Schmidt, a Republican from Eldridge (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications).Missouri lawmakers are playing tax cut tennis, and on Monday the state House served its latest offering when it narrowed the differences with the state Senate in a bill that helps wealthy taxpayers and some who are at the bottom of the income scale.
The proposal is the smallest, in terms of revenue reductions, of several bills intended to cut taxes this year. It exempts long-term capital gains — profits on investments or property held for more than a year — from state income tax.
It also boosts the income limits and credit amounts for the refundable tax credit known as the circuit breaker, which helps defer the cost of property taxes for low-income seniors and people with disabilities.
Those provisions mirror the language in a bill that has already passed the Senate but has not received a final House vote. One key difference is that the Senate-passed version would adjust the circuit breaker credit amounts for inflation starting in 2027, while the bill approved Monday does not.
It also does not include the sales tax exemption for diapers and feminine hygiene products included in the Senate-passed bill.
House Speaker Pro Tem Chad Perkins, a Republican from Bowling Green, said the latest plan was intended to send the Senate something it could accept.
“We feel like the Senate will be able to pass our language on this as is,” Perkins said.
The bill began as a proposal to allow the Department of Revenue to forgive interest and penalties when it has to prorate tax credits because claims exceed the annual allowance. For the past three years, people claiming Missouri’s food pantry tax credit found they didn’t get the full value when the state Department of Revenue reviewed their returns.
The bill passed by a 92-58 vote, with 11 Republicans voting against it along with all Democrats. The bill needs only a final Senate vote to send it to Gov. Mike Kehoe.
During debate, Democrats warned that big tax cuts now are a mistake because of uncertainty, both in future support from federal funding and the possibility of an economic recession due to tariff and other policy shifts under President Donald Trump.
“Wait for another year. Let’s see what happens with the U.S. economy before we cut another tax,” said state Rep. Steve Butz, a Democrat fromSt. Louis. “We need to go slow, because you can’t reverse this decision.”
The tax limitations in the Missouri Constitution would require a statewide vote if, in a year or two, lawmakers decided they had cut taxes too much.
The fiscal note for the bill, which gives the official estimate of whether it will increase or decrease state revenue, states that exempting capital gains would reduce revenue from the individual income tax by about $110 million annually, with another $180 million reduction with the corporate cut kicks in.
Outside observers question that estimate, with the left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy estimating that the revenue reduction could be $600 million or more.
Since 2014, when lawmakers enacted a tax cut over the veto of then-Democratic Gov. Jay Nixon, Missouri’s top income tax rate has fallen from 6% to 4.7%. Two future tax cuts, to a 4.5% rate, are already in state law and will take effect if general revenue growth hits targets.
The changes in the circuit breaker credit would reduce state revenue by about $75 million annually. 
People 65 and older and those with a qualifying disability are eligible for a credit against property taxes on their residence. Since 2008 the maximum credit for homeowners has been $1,100, while for people who rent their home the maximum credit is $750.
The legislation would increase the credit for homeowners to $1,550 and for renters to $1,055.
The proposal would also increase the maximum income for claiming the credit from $27,500 for single taxpayers who rent to $38,200 and for single taxpayers who own their home from $30,000 to $42,200. For married couples, the limit would be $41,000 for renters and $48,000 for homeowners.
Most of the debate Monday focused on whether the circuit breaker changes were enough to balance the benefits being provided to wealthy taxpayers.
“This is an amendment that our senior citizens need for us to do, as it truly helps those in the lowest income brackets,” said state Rep. Mark Matthiesen, a Republican from O’Fallon. “Also those with disabilities need our help.”
Democrats said the circuit breaker changes were designed to mask the problems that would be created by additional large income tax cuts.
“It’s the arsonist,” said Rep. Mark Boyko, a Democrat from Kirkwood, “telling us that they’ll give us 10 seconds to go rescue the grandfather clock.”

(Capital-Star/Peter Hall)An out-of-state group that sued the commonwealth for records it claimed would show “non-U.S. citizens have been registering and voting in Pennsylvania for decades” lost an appeal in federal court.
The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the Virginia-based Public Integrity Law Foundation has no standing to sue the Pennsylvania Department of State for voter registration records under a federal law intended to increase participation in elections.
“While a statute may authorize private suits to compel compliance with the law, private citizens are not deputized as private attorneys general empowered to enforce any and all violations of a statute without regard to their personal stake in the matter,” Circuit Judge Marjorie O. Rendell wrote in an opinion for the court.
A spokesperson said the Department of State is pleased with the decision. A PILF spokesperson said it is considering the court’s opinion and “will be moving forward from there.”
PILF sued the department in 2017 after then-Philadelphia Election Commissioner Al Schmidt said a glitch in Pennsylvania’s electronic driver’s licensing system could allow noncitizens to register to vote, citing 168 such instances in the city. Schmidt is now secretary of the commonwealth.
The Department of State confirmed that it was working to fix the problem but was not aware of the issue before Schmidt alerted them, the Associated Press reported at the time.
The lawsuit claimed the department was required to provide records under the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA), commonly known as the Motor Voter Law that, among other voting access provisions, required states to provide an opportunity to register to vote when applying for a driver’s license and other state services. 
A U.S. District Court judge ultimately ruled partly in favor of PILF and ordered the Department of State to pay attorney fees and costs to the organization. Both PILF and the department of state appealed.
The 3rd Circuit decision noted while the act provides for public inspection of records concerning programs to ensure the accuracy of voter rolls and remedial right to sue, a recent U.S. Supreme Court case raised the bar for a plaintiff in such a suit to show they have actually been harmed.
In support of its claim of injury and standing to sue under the NVRA, PILF argued that without the records, it could not analyze the department’s activities to maintain voter lists and was unable to carry out its mission of promoting what it calls election integrity and compliance with state and federal election laws.
The organization also claimed the denial hampered its production and dissemination of educational materials and that it had expended considerable time and money seeking the records. 
The 3rd Circuit said there is not a sufficient connection between the consequences PILF identified and Congress’ goals in enacting the NVRA. As an out-of-state public interest law firm that failed to show evidence of concrete harm caused by the secretary of the commonwealth’s refusal to provide the records it requested, PILF has no standing to sue, Rendell wrote.  
“PILF does not represent any Pennsylvania citizens who have been affected by the Secretary’s purported violation of the NVRA,” Rendell’s opinion says. “It has no direct ties to Pennsylvania voters and has not alleged how access to the records it seeks would ‘directly lead to action’ or that its ‘direct participation in the electoral process [has been] hindered.’”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DSC_7425-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-04-28 20:06:06.666158

The United Utah Party and the Utah Forward Party held an unprecedented combined convention on Saturday at Salt Lake Community College in Taylorsville, where both parties voted nearly unanimously to approve a memorandum of understanding to formally merge under the umbrella of the national Forward Party.
An ‘unprecedented’ merger of 2 centrist parties: United Utah Party looks to join Forward Party

It’s the first time two political parties have ever joined together in the state of Utah. Party officials said they’re coordinating with the state’s top election officials in the lieutenant governor’s office to facilitate the merger, for which no legal process exists in state law. 
Still, the parties are charting their own path for the merger, for which the now-approved memorandum of understanding lays out a process that will take place over the next several months. 
The new party’s name, the MOU stipulates, “shall be the ‘Utah Forward Party,’ the ‘United Forward Party’ or such other name selected and approved by the National Forward Party.” 
On Saturday, both parties voted independently to approve the merger before combining in a joint session, where leaders gave speeches applauding the merger as a momentum-building move for Utah’s moderate and centrist movement.

Speakers included newly-elected Chair Michelle Quist — who last year ran as United Utah’s candidate for attorney general — and Sen. Dan Thatcher, a former Republican from West Valley, who recently announced he’d left the GOP to join the Utah Forward Party. 
“There are real problems that Utahns are facing, but our leaders aren’t listening because they’re too busy trying to win their partisan blood sport,” Quist said. “The two-party system has not served us well. … We cannot see beyond the us-versus-them mentality. So it’s time to move beyond that psyche and look to do what’s best for Utahns.” 
Former New Jersey governor and EPA administrator Christine Todd Whitman — who co-founded and co-chairs the national Forward Party alongside businessman and onetime presidential candidate Andrew Yang — also spoke Saturday, encouraging Utahns to break the stranglehold of the two-party system, which she said is more focused on winning than representing Americans. 
“I honestly believe that we are within a hair of losing our democracy,” Whitman said. “There is, to me, an unconscionable lack of respect for the rule of law, the lack of respect for the Constitution. … It’s not about solving problems, it’s about staying in power.”

She pointed to states like Utah, where most districts are largely controlled by “one party,” the GOP, resulting in elections where “voters don’t have a choice. There’s one candidate, and that’s it. And that has never served the public.” 
“When all an incumbent has to do is worry about their base in the primaries, they don’t care about the rest of the people. To heck with it, and they don’t represent the rest of the people when they get in,” Whitman said.

Yang also issued a prepared statement in a news release issued by party leaders, pointing to Gallup polling that shows roughly 60% of Americans agree that the U.S. needs a third major party because the Republican and Democratic parties “do such a poor job” of representing Americans. 
“It’s no wonder why,” Yang said. “The existing parties have failed to address the biggest issues facing voters. People want job security and to plan for their retirement; they want their kids to be safe, they want to live in a nation of laws that protect them, they don’t want to be told they need to hate their neighbors if they disagree with them on some policy position. They want their representatives to pay attention to their lives and listen to their needs.”
Instead, Yang said, “the legacy parties are focused on maintaining power and the ‘us versus them’ fight that keeps their fundraising totals high.”
Yang said Utah is at the “forefront” of the Forward Party’s effort to build a “50-state movement.” So far, the Forward Party or an affiliate party is recognized in 13 states, Whitman said, compared to just five states two months ago. Plus, she said the party has 50 elected officeholders who have affiliated in some way with the Forward Party. Their goal, she said, is to be “on the ballot in all states” by the next presidential election, in 2028. 
“We are growing,” she said. “We’re growing fast. We’re growing big.”
Thatcher, when he took the podium, told the crowd of roughly 250 that came to Saturday’s convention that, “you’re not crazy.”

“You’re not imagining it. Things are really, really bad right now,” said the former Republican senator — who in recent years became no stranger to bucking the GOP party line before he unaffiliated last month. “The absolute contempt coming from the (Utah) Legislature this year just completely blew my mind.” 
Thatcher said for years he had been “concerned about the direction” the Republican party was heading, “but I always believed that the GOP would come back to its founding principles.” 
However, when lawmakers tried to amend the Utah Constitution to weaken voters’ ballot initiative powers and give the Legislature the ultimate and final say on all types of ballot initiatives with Amendment D — a ballot question the courts ultimately voided because its language written by GOP legislative leaders was misleading — Thatcher said that “completely made it clear that it’s not going to happen.”

“Because I believe the GOP has ceased to uphold the rule of law, because they are no longer grounded to the Constitution, and because they’re not even following their own platform, which was why I joined them in the first place, they are no longer entitled to my support,” Thatcher said. 
Instead, he said the Forward Party better “respects my principles of rights, of reason, and of respect.” 
“The Forward Party is different from anything I’ve ever seen before,” Thatcher said. “It is why I feel so at home in this place that feels clean. I feel safe in this room. I feel respected in this room. I feel like I can disagree with someone and not have any name-calling or our tables flipping.”
More than anything, Thatcher said he joined the Forward Party because he wants “to fight for people, for decency, for representation.” 
“It is so freeing to stop saying ‘we’ as I talk about the completely crazy things that the (Republican) party is doing to people,” he said. “But moreover, it feels so good to say ‘we’ as I talk about the crazy things the Forward Party is doing for people.

Senate File 288 would require state universities and community colleges to allow pregnant students or new mothers to take leave without penalty, reschedule tests and assignments and utilize other accommodations.
The Iowa House sent the bill back to the Senate last week with amendments to specify qualifying students as “biologically female” and removing set timeframes for certain accommodations.

Despite his opinion that the House “watered down” the bill by changing the language and removing the 12-month timeframe for accommodations, Sen. Jeff Taylor, R-Sioux Center, said he’d still like to see it passed.
The legislation would require universities to publicize their policies and accommodations for pregnant students and those who recently gave birth, Taylor said, ensuring instructors cannot decide for themselves whether to work with these students and provide support.
“For that reason, I think there continues to be merit to this bill,” Taylor said.
The Senate concurred with the House legislation and passed it with a unanimous vote.

(Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — All three University of Nebraska-Lincoln students whose visas were revoked over the past two weeks have had them restored after the Trump administration backed off its initial efforts to cancel some visas held by international students.
UNL officials confirmed that the third student’s visa was restored Monday, following the restoration of the other two last week. 
Earlier this month, UNL announced that three international students had their visas revoked by the U.S. State Department. UNL has 1,654 international students, according to a university census.
The Justice Department announced the national reversal in federal court last week. The change came after the Trump administration began revoking visas and launching deportation proceedings against a number of students who had participated in demonstrations against Israel during campus protests last year over the war in Gaza, or who had faced criminal charges while a visiting student, including driving under the influence. 
It is unclear why the UNL students’ visas were revoked. The university hasn’t said.
A Justice Department lawyer, Joseph F. Carilli, said immigration officials have begun developing a new system for reviewing and terminating visas for international students. Until the process is complete, Carilli said, agencies would not make additional changes or pursue additional revocations, according to The New York Times.

File photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerA 43-year-old Barre woman was charged Monday with involuntary manslaughter in the shooting death of a 45-year-old Barre man last week. The Vermont State Police arrested Donna Robinson last week for allegedly shooting Franklin Driscoll at a home on 879 N. Main Street in Barre on Thursday around 5:25 p.m., the state police said in a press release. Robinson pleaded not guilty to the charges against her and is being held without bail at the Chittenden County Correctional Facility. Driscoll was admitted to Central Vermont Medical Center with a gunshot wound to the abdomen and died early Friday morning, the release said. The state police said the death appeared to be an “isolated event” between people who knew each other, so it did not pose a threat to the general Barre community. Initial witness interviews indicated that Robinson was taking the gun from Driscoll during an altercation with a different person when it went off accidentally, according to the state police affidavit. Robinson was arraigned in Washington County Superior Court Monday afternoon for involuntary manslaughter, along with charges of five counts of reckless endangerment, one count of simple assault and two counts of possession of a firearm while having a felony conviction. Robinson was convicted for selling heroin in 2017 and for a stolen-property-related crime in 2012. She appeared at the hearing virtually from the women’s prison in South Burlington.Justice Michael Harris denied the state’s request to also charge Robinson with burglary. At the arraignment, he said there was no evidence that Robinson had not received permission to be on the property, where at least six other people were apparently present at the time of the incident. Harris, defense attorney Michael Shane and prosecutor Talon Wendel discussed the nature of the evidence for each charge, which was primarily witness testimony from people at the house during the time of the shooting. Shane said the case was “thin” and that Robinson had every intention of fighting it, noting that key charges appeared to rely on the statement of a single witness. Wendel argued that the evidence was bolstered by statements from several other witnesses, who provided corroborating testimony although they had not personally seen the actual shooting. Harris said, “I think there’s going to be a lot more the state’s going to have to show as to how it occurred,” but that the evidence was “enough” at this point to justify having Robinson held without bail. He also cited the seriousness of the manslaughter offense, which could lead to a life sentence. Harris and the attorneys plan to schedule a weight-of-evidence hearing within the week. Read the story on VTDigger here:  Woman charged with manslaughter in shooting death of 45-year-old Barre man.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/washington-court-1-20230807.jpg?fit=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-28 19:05:41.025639

On Monday, Democratic Reps. Corey Paris of Stamford, Eleni Kavros DeGraw of Avon, Gary Turco of Newington and Manny Sanchez of New Britain, held a press conference at the Legislative Office Building in Hartford, where they denounced the Trump administration’s plans and called for more state funding to help beleaguered borrowers.
“The fact that the federal government has made this decision is going to harm families across the nation and especially in Connecticut,” Kavros DeGraw said.
The Office of Federal Student Aid plans to resume collecting defaulted loans on May 5, ending a five-year pause that began during the COVID-19 pandemic and was extended several times since. Tax refunds and other federal benefits could be withheld from borrowers as soon as next month, and some could see their wages garnished by up to 15%. 
The lawmakers at Monday’s event said that could put people already facing financial hardship in an even more difficult situation, and they said the state needs to increase assistance to students seeking higher education. 
“It is time for us to wake up and realize that the time is now,” Turco said. “We are looking to continue our current student loan reimbursement program. We also want to look for more funding from the budget to provide relief,” he said.
In an emailed statement, Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, warned that more state support for student borrowers could mean breaking the state’s fiscal guardrails. “That means they want to raise your state taxes,” he said.
“Ever notice how we never see CT Democrats hold daily news conferences on cutting state government waste and actually lowering our cost of living?’ Harding added.
Federal officials say the move to collect defaulted student loans is intended to protect taxpayers and fix a system they say was confusing for borrowers. 
“American taxpayers will no longer be forced to serve as collateral for irresponsible student loan policies,” Secretary of Education Linda McMahon said in a statement released by her office last week. “The Biden Administration misled borrowers: the executive branch does not have the constitutional authority to wipe debt away, nor do the loan balances simply disappear.” 
Students and teachers at Monday’s press conference expressed concern about the personal financial implications the policy could have. 
Christina Barmon, a sociology professor at Central Connecticut State University, said, “It is difficult to console students when I can’t afford to pay either. I am still paying off debts. Students are expected to pick up the slack.”
Syafira Azzahra, a senior at Central, shared her concerns about paying off loans once she graduates. “It is impossible for us to live within our means and simultaneously worry about our debt,” she said.
Last Wednesday, President Donald J. Trump issued a related executive order directing reforms to the higher education accreditation system. The order says accrediting bodies that grant student loans and Pell Grants are biased because of their focus on diversity, equity and inclusion. The order called for establishing new accreditors that are solely merit-based and don’t factor race or gender into decisions.
Democratic leaders of the Connecticut Senate issued a joint statement last Thursday on the order expressing their disapproval. “Through attacking accreditors, Donald Trump continues his witch hunt to quell educational freedom in favor of advancing his own political agenda,” Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney, Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff and Sen. Derek Slap said in the statement.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AP25113784490343-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-28 19:05:41.025639

The murder trial against Seth Brunell ended in a surprise plea deal after a sheriff’s deputy had an unsanctioned conversation with the defendant. It was not the first mistake in the case.

Brunell is accused of killing Fern Feather in 2022. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerIn April 2022, the stabbing death of Hinesburg transgender woman Fern Feather shocked and saddened the state of Vermont. In the days after the killing, as the investigation progressed, it emerged that Feather had had an altercation with another man a year prior — a man who, Vermont State Police said, was the son of then-suspect Seth Brunell.That connection could have added key context to the murder case. But, in fact, the man had no relation to Brunell, and state police retracted the claim a day later. The misstep was just one of several mistakes that occurred during one of Vermont’s highest-profile murder cases in the past few years. Earlier this month, after a particularly grave error, that case culminated with a surprise plea deal and a sheriff’s deputy on administrative leave. Brunell pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter and will serve a decade of probation with no additional prison time — a far lighter sentence than a murder conviction would entail.  “It’s devastating. I can say that,” said Aliena Gerhard, the Lamoille County state’s attorney. “I was pretty angry.”Even before it reached a trial, the case was a tangled one. Last fall, the case became embroiled in a controversy over evidence, after it emerged in late September that prosecutors had failed to turn over a 3D rendering of the crime scene to Brunell’s defense attorney. The state had mistakenly given the defense a model from a separate case, an error that Gerhard apologized for. Jessica Burke, Brunell’s attorney, asked the court to throw out the case based on that mistake. Presiding Judge Mary Morrissey, however, allowed the trial to go forward, with a postponement to allow the defense to prepare. Still, she wrote, “the court neither minimizes nor excuses the failure of the State” to turn over the 3D model. Morrissey levied a stronger penalty against prosecutors over the handling of another piece of evidence: a 20-page letter, allegedly written by Brunell while he was in prison in 2023. That letter allegedly laid out a plan to have sex with his defense attorney, then accuse her of sexual assault, with the goal of getting his case dismissed, according to court filings. In a court filing at the time, Assistant Attorney General Sophie Stratton sought to admit the letter as evidence in the case. Stratton wrote that prosecutors had only recently learned about the document, even though Vermont State Police had been aware of it for months.But Morrissey ruled that the state had violated time limits for introducing evidence and that the letter could not be admitted. She wrote that “the late disclosure prevented Defendant from conducting depositions, gathering information on the chain of custody, or litigating whether this evidence was properly obtained.” Defense attorney Jessica Burke said last fall that the case was the most disorganized she had ever experienced. Gerhard, the Lamoille County state’s attorney, declined to comment on that letter. Burke declined to comment last week. READ MORE





 


Seth Brunell reaches plea deal in death of Fern Feather with no additional prison time

‘Beyond belief’ The trial finally began in mid-April, three years after the killing of Feather. In her opening statement, Burke, Brunell’s attorney, laid out the defense’s argument that Brunell had acted in self-defense. The case, she argued, was botched from the start. Law enforcement charged Brunell with murder even before they completed processing all the evidence, Burke said. She argued that law enforcement had failed to thoroughly collect evidence, and that officers had allowed Feather’s dogs to roam freely around the crime scene for roughly an hour after the killing, potentially contaminating the scene. But the jury never got a chance to make a decision on those arguments. On May 15, the second full day of the trial, the attorneys learned that Brunell had an unauthorized conversation with a Lamoille County Sheriff’s deputy one day earlier while being driven from the courtroom to Southern State Correctional Facility after jury selection.In testimony, it emerged that Vermont State Police Detective Sergeant Isaac Merriam had asked the sheriff’s department to use a body camera to create a recording during the drive.  “I wanted to make sure that that transport was recorded in case Mr. Brunell made statements about this case,” Merriam told the court. Lamoille County Sheriff’s Department Detective Kevin Lehoe testified that he had passed along Merriam’s request to Sheriff’s Deputy Christopher Turner, who had been assigned to the transport.Although he instructed Turner to record the trip on his body camera, Lehoe said, he had not told him to ask specific questions about the case. The recording was just intended to capture any “excited utterance” that Brunell might make, Lehoe told the court.  Had Lehoe explicitly warned Turner against asking questions? Burke, the defense attorney, asked.“I didn’t at the time, no, and I didn’t expect that I would have to,” Lehoe replied.  But, according to a transcript reviewed by VTDigger, at least one law enforcement officer in the car during the transport did, in fact, ask Brunell questions. Two sheriff’s deputies, Turner and a Rutland County deputy whose identity was not clear, were assigned to the transport. Although the transcript of the conversation is not exact, the document clearly shows that Brunell was questioned about Feather’s car, the knife used in the killing and his relationship with his attorney.Jared Carter, a constitutional law professor with Vermont Law and Graduate School, said that questioning a defendant outside of the presence of their lawyer is a clear violation of the constitutional right to an attorney.“Once a person has been read their Miranda rights, they have the right to an attorney,” Carter said. “And certainly, once that happens, law enforcement is not allowed to continue to question a suspect or a defendant or somebody who’s been arrested.”For the questioning to happen on the eve of a trial is “quite frankly, beyond belief,” he said.Turner, the sheriff’s deputy who conducted the transport of Brunell, was placed on administrative leave while an outside law enforcement agency conducts an investigation, Lamoille County Sheriff Roger Marcoux said earlier this month. READ MORE

‘Gross negligence’On the second night of the trial, Burke filed a motion for a mistrial. In court the next morning, describing the transcript from the body camera, both Burke and Gerhard described the incident as “egregious.”By the end of the next day, with the specter of a mistrial looming, the attorneys had hashed out a plea deal. Prosecutors said that day that they were concerned that, in the case of a mistrial, they would not be able to refile charges against Brunell and that he would ultimately walk completely free.But the 10 years of probation was a far cry from the possibility of the decades in prison Brunell faced if convicted of second-degree murder. And the sentence elicited anger and dismay from Feather’s family and friends. “The only reason you’re getting out now is because of the gross negligence of the Lamoille County Sheriff’s Department,” Lisa Barbeau, Feather’s mother, told Brunell in an emotional statement at the conclusion of the trial. “Because you are a murderer.”In his own remarks, Jean-Francois Barbeau, Feather’s father, condemned the “slap on the wrist” Brunell received.“This isn’t justice. It’s a pitiful parody of justice,” he said. “Fuck you all.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  How a high-profile Vermont murder case fell apart.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/seth-brunell-3-20250415.jpg?fit=1024%2C676&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-28 19:05:41.025639

(Photos courtesy of the Doña Ana County Detention Center)Federal authorities arrested a former New Mexico magistrate judge and his wife on April 24 on criminal charges of evidence tampering related to the prosecution of an alleged gang member from Venezuela.
The U.S. Department of Justice on Friday announced it had charged former Doña Ana County Magistrate Jose Luis “Joel” Cano with one count of evidence tampering and his wife Nancy Cano with one count of conspiracy to tamper with evidence.
Prosecutors allege that Jose Cano told Homeland Security Investigations agents that he had destroyed a cell phone belonging to Cristhian Ortega-Lopez, a Venezuelan national prosecutors allege has ties to the Tren de Aragua gang.
HSI in February searched the Canos’ home and arrested Ortega-Lopez for illegal possession of guns and ammunition, according to the DOJ’s news release. The DOJ said agents seized three of Ortega-Lopez’s cell phones, but he told them about a fourth one, which prompted another search wherein Cano allegedly admitted to destroying it with a hammer.
“Judges are responsible for upholding our country’s laws. It is beyond egregious for a former judge and his wife to engage in evidence tampering on behalf of a suspected Tren de Aragua gang member accused of illegally possessing firearms,” U.S. Attorney Ryan Ellison for the District of New Mexico said in a statement. “The U.S. Attorney’s Office is committed to dismantling this foreign terrorist organization by disrupting its criminal operations in New Mexico. That starts by prosecuting those who support gang members — including judges.”
The DOJ announced the charges against the Canos in the same news release in which they announced the arrest of a Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Hannah C. Dugan for allegedly allowing a Mexican immigrant charged with domestic violence to temporarily avoid arrest by federal agents.
“The allegations against Judge Dugan and Judge Cano are serious: no one, least of all a judge, should obstruct law enforcement operations,” U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a statement. “Doing so imperils the safety of our law enforcement officers and undermines the rule of law. The Department of Justice will continue to follow the facts — no one is above the law.”
In the New Mexico case, immigration authorities arrested Ortega-Lopez in December 2023 in Texas for unlawfully entering the U.S., and released him in April 2024 because of overcrowding at the detention center where he was being held, according to court records.
An anonymous source in January tipped off the Homeland Security Investigations office in Las Cruces that Ortega-Lopez and two others were living in an apartment behind the Canos’ home, an HSI special agent wrote in an application for a search warrant.
The Judicial Standards Commission on March 5 petitioned the Supreme Court to suspend Cano for allegedly committing misconduct by allowing three members of the gang to live on his property in Las Cruces and to have access to firearms.
In a response, Jose Cano wrote to the Supreme Court justices that Ortega-Lopez told Nancy Cano that the trio “all had their legal papers to remain in the U.S. pending their Asylum Court hearings, which were already scheduled,” and that he had verified their court dates.
Jose Cano resigned as a magistrate judge on March 21, according to court records. The New Mexico Supreme Court on April 22 barred Cano from holding any judicial office or exercising any judicial authority. 
Both Canos are scheduled for preliminary and detention hearings Tuesday morning in federal court in Las Cruces.

Republican leaders in the House and Senate continued Monday to make offers back and forth on spending levels and tax relief, but it wasn’t clear whether the Legislature will have to extend its regular 2025 session to get their work done or adjourn on Friday as planned and come back in a special session.
The new fiscal year opens on July 1.
In a media availability with reporters, Senate President Ben Albritton said his goal is for the Legislature to reach an agreement on overall spending and tax relief and extend into next week and “be able to get everything done.”
To that end, Senate Budget Committee Chair Ed Hooper said the Senate had made an offer to the House Monday afternoon and was waiting to hear back. Hooper did not disclose details of the offer, other than to say it was the seventh one he has made to the House.
The Senate had not heard back before Albritton and Hooper addressed reporters.
“You know what the priority of the speaker is, and we are trying to meet him at an affordable number,” Hooper said, adding, “We’re very close on the number.”
Dispute over taxes
The House on Friday voted, 78-29, to pass a $5 billion tax relief package, with most of the opposition involving changes to the collection of tourist development dollars.
Albritton supports tax relief but earlier this session floated a more modest $2.1 billion tax plan, centered around a permanent elimination of the sales tax on clothing and shoes costing $75 or less. Other parts of his plan include a permanent reduction in the business rent tax from 2% to 1%, a one-time credit for vehicle registration fees, and several sales tax holidays.
The difference between the House and Senate proposals for fiscal year 2025-26 is $4.4 billion. Albritton said people shouldn’t focus on the disparity between the chambers and instead focus on the fact that both the House and Senate support large tax cuts.
“We’re contemplating historic tax relief for Floridians. I don’t want that message to be lost. We’re just trying to figure out how it all comes together and everybody gets a piece of it to where they can feel comfortable that the thing they want to address gets addressed,” Albritton said, calling it “great news for Floridians.”
The legislative impasse on spending and tax relief has also slowed down the chambers’ deliberations on substantive policy issues, a reflection that how the chambers negotiate differences on substantive policies can be tied to the budget.
‘Nothingburgers’
Meanwhile, with less than one week left to go just 54 bills have made it through the legislative process, clearing both the House and Senate. Gov. DeSantis has signed 10 of them into law.
The House had passed 230 bills as of April 28, of which 49 have also been passed by the Senate.
The Senate had passed 156 bills, of which five have been passed by the House.
“Very little has passed and everything that has passed is nothingburgers,” one longtime lobbyist told the Florida Phoenix.
One high-profile bill that hasn’t passed but Albritton is optimistic will wind up making it through this week is a condominium bill by Sen. Jennifer Bradley.
Albritton said Sen. Jennifer Bradley, chair of the Regulated Industries Committee, is having conversation with the House, “making great progress,” on the condo bill and he is “very optimistic” about it. That measure involves relief for condo owners burdened by high assessments to improve building safety.

(Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas environmental regulators updated the state Pollution Control and Ecology Commission last week on efforts to help storm-stricken areas of the state recover from multiple rounds of severe weather.
The commission also gave final approval to state water quality standards that address surface water pollutants and are up for review.
Bailey Taylor, director of the Arkansas Division of Environmental Quality, said the agency issued an emergency order to address a large spill of red dye diesel in Craighead County. The tanks storing the fuel were severely damaged after being struck by one of the many tornadoes that have touched down in the state over the last month and a half, Taylor said.
The emergency order, which was posted on DEQ’s website, said the fuel leaked into ditches that “flowed through a nearby residential area and near the Monette Manor nursing home,” with the potential to reach the St. Francis River. The order noted that heavy concentrations of the diesel were seen in the ditches by a government inspector who visited the site.
“Given the extent of the storm impact and damage, imminent heavy rainfall and the forecast for additional severe weather and heavy flooding in the area, it was apparent that immediate action was required to protect human health and safety as well as to mitigate further impact to waters of the state including the St. Francis River,” the emergency order read. 
Taylor said she ordered remediation contractors to the site, and authorized use of funds from the Remedial Action Trust Fund to address the spill if it was necessary to protect public health, safety or the environment on April 3.
Additionally, DEQ staff has been working with local and county officials to set up debris burn sites for trees and other plants, Taylor said, and has been doing additional outreach to areas not impacted by recent storms to plan where a burn site could be, should those communities be affected by storms in the future.
Taylor also updated commissioners on legislative activity, saying that 12 bills proposed by the Arkansas Department of Energy and Environment had been signed into law, most of them bills aimed at cleaning up language in existing law.
Later, commissioners voted to give final approval to Rule 2, which governs the state’s water quality standards and is going through a federally-mandated triennial review. The rule will now go to the Arkansas Legislative Council’s rules committee, and then to the council itself, for review.
Rule 2 water quality standards apply to the concentrations of pollutants in surface waters themselves, such as lakes and rivers, rather than the concentrations of pollutants in discharges from permitted facilities. They are also separate from drinking water regulations, which rely on a different set of rules and laws at both the federal and state level, and are regulated by the Arkansas Department of Health rather than DEQ.
The changes proposed by DEQ to Rule 2 include the addition of five new regulated pollutants: benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene and phenol. Two of those — benzene and ethylbenzene — are known or suspected carcinogens, respectively. The other three are known to have other detrimental health effects in humans in sufficient concentrations.
In documentation included with the rulemaking, DEQ said the new water quality standards were necessary to protect human health.
In addition to the new standards, DEQ is also proposing updates to existing ammonia and chromium standards.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ALP_0026-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-28 19:05:41.025639

Pictured from left are Rep. Zac Ista, Sen. Ryan Braunberger, Sen. Josh Boschee and Rep. Gretchen Dobervich. (Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)A committee of lawmakers on Monday rejected a last-minute bill to make legislators and higher education officials mandatory reporters of child sexual abuse in light of new documents that show a University of North Dakota official may have known about sex crimes committed by former Sen. Ray Holmberg.
Holmberg, who served in the statehouse for more than four decades, was sentenced to 10 years in prison late last month after he pleaded guilty to traveling abroad with the intent to have sex with adolescent boys.
The records, which were released by the Attorney General’s Office on Friday and number over 90 pages, show Holmberg emailed UND entrepreneur Bruce Gjovig in February 2011 about the former senator’s preference for young men and boys. Gjovig founded the school’s Center for Innovation, retiring in 2017. Gjovig also held other prominent roles in the community and the Republican Party.

“What think of my twink?” Holmberg asked Gjovig in the email, using a slang term that refers to young, slim men.
Gjovig emailed back, “too young for me, but thanks.”
“No one is ever to young… remember Prague,” Holmberg replied.
Gjovig’s attorney, Cash Aaland, said in a statement that Gjovig believed the comments were exaggerated, “bawdry, locker room” talk.
“Although Mr. Gjovig knew Mr. Holmberg in a professional and personal capacity, Mr. Gjovig was unaware of the criminal nature of Mr. Holmberg’s sexual conduct,” Aaland said in the statement. “Mr. Gjovig condemns Holmberg’s activities in the strongest terms possible.”
Aaland said that Gjovig fully cooperated with law enforcement during the investigation into Holmberg, and that Gjovig is being painted as an accomplice without evidence.
“As a gay man and a Republican, Mr. Gjovig has been an easy mark for political and media attacks,” Aaland stated.

The records also show that Holmberg emailed former state Sen. Nick Hacker in August 2016 about a sexual encounter Holmberg had with someone in Taiwan. Hacker was a State Board of Higher Education member at the time.
Holmberg did not say in the email that the person in question was underage, or that it was commercial sex.
Hacker, who served in the Senate from 2005 to 2008, said that the email was unsolicited and that he did not reply.
“I don’t even recall getting that email,” he said.
Hacker said he met with the state Bureau of Criminal Investigation in 2022 and cooperated with the agency’s investigation of Holmberg, including giving investigators full access to his messages.
“Until I met with BCI in 2022, I was unaware that Mr. Holmberg was a predator of underage children,” Hacker said in a statement to the North Dakota Monitor. “Individuals like him should be fully prosecuted under the law.”
Others employed by the University of North Dakota also received emails from Holmberg, records show.
Sen. Tim Mathern and other North Dakota Democratic lawmakers in a Monday morning press conference urged the Legislature to greenlight a delayed bill to make lawmakers and higher education employees mandatory reporters of child sex abuse.
“In the future, if this comes to your attention and mine, we will know that it’s our responsibility. I think each one of us needs guardrails to help us make good decisions,” Mathern told other senators in a Senate Delayed Bills Committee hearing that afternoon.
The committee voted 4-1 not to forward the proposal, arguing a mandatory reporting requirement is not necessary and that it is too late in the session to accept the bill. Mathern was the only no vote.
North Dakota Senate kills mandated reporter bill spurred by Holmberg case

Mathern’s peers on the Senate Delayed Bills Committee said they did not feel the bill would make a difference because they did not know of Holmberg’s crimes until he was charged. 
“If we would have known something, we would have said something,” said Sen. Jerry Klein, R-Fessenden.
Sen. Janne Myrdal, R-Edinburg, and Sen. Scott Meyer, R-Grand Forks, suggested taking up the proposal next legislative session.
“Who knew or didn’t know, even in the last 90-page report, is just hearsay,” Myrdal said. 
The other member of the committee was Sen. Cole Conley, R-Jamestown.
The communications in the report were found on electronic devices seized by law enforcement belonging to Ray Holmberg and another subject, Nicholas Morgan-Derosier. Morgan-Derosier was an associate of Holmberg’s who was sentenced in May to 40 years in prison on child pornography charges.
Members of the committee also said that the higher education system may already have mandatory requirements in place. 
A spokesperson for the North Dakota University System said there is no blanket requirement for employees to report sexual abuse, though certain kinds of officeholders and staff have their own reporting mandates. For example, members of the higher education board and employees must report any suspected violations of laws or institutional policies to a designee within the University System.
Statehouse Democrats said during the press conference it is unacceptable that some officials knew or may have known about Holmberg’s conduct years before he was charged with a crime. They said that North Dakota law does not do enough to prevent officials from engaging in, or covering up, crimes against children. 
“It’s obvious that just trusting these people to do the right thing is not good enough,” Mathern said. “We owe it to Holmberg’s victims to do something about it.”
The Senate previously defeated a resolution sponsored by Rep. Nico Rios, R-Williston, and the North Dakota Young Republicans that would have called on the 2027 Legislature to make lawmakers mandatory reporters.
It’s not yet clear whether the University of North Dakota has investigated or plans to investigate Holmberg.  
“If a report is filed with the university, it would be investigated,” David Dodds, a university spokesperson, said in a statement to the Monitor. 
“We are aware and deeply troubled by recent media reports regarding previously sealed federal court documents that were unavailable to the University and were used in the criminal conviction of Ray Holmberg,” Dodds said. “We strongly condemn the actions of anyone who may have enabled Mr. Holmberg’s criminal behavior.”
The University System is drafting a child safety policy that would apply to minors participating in programs that take place on property regulated by the higher education board or are sponsored by the University System, spokesperson Billie Jo Lorius said in an email to the North Dakota Monitor. She said the policy has yet to be approved.
Rep. Zac Ista, D-Grand Forks, said during the press conference he hopes the state Legislature isn’t the only body that implements reforms in response to the Holmberg case.
“I think this is a time for all individuals and institutions to carefully reflect on where their failures were in this process,” Ista said.
Mathern also called on his colleagues to put more money in the North Dakota Ethics Commission’s budget for the 2025-2027 fiscal year. He is chair of the conference committee tasked with workshopping final amendments to the budget, Senate Bill 2004.
“This would be a step forward toward justice as we continue to process Holmberg’s vile crimes and uncover more information on what has become the most egregious scandal in our state’s history,” Mathern said.
The Senate initially set aside money for an additional full-time employee for the commission, which would have brought the board’s number of staff up to four. The House cut the funding and also added a new 180-day deadline for the commission to process ethics complaints.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)  While Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds and Senate Republicans said Monday they have reached a “budget compromise” on how to fund the state heading into the 2026 fiscal year, House Republicans are asking for more money in some areas.
Passing the state budget through a series of appropriations bills is one of Iowa Legislature’s largest jobs, and the final step before lawmakers can adjourn for the year. In Iowa, the goal is for state legislators to wrap up their work by the 110th day of session — this year on Friday, May 2. There’s a financial motivation for lawmakers to finish their work by or near this date, after which they will no longer receive payment for expenses other than mileage between their homes and the State Capitol.
As of Monday, four days before the May 2 deadline, only one budget bill, Senate File 628, has passed through the committee process. The Senate’s transportation budget bill was approved by the chamber last week, but has not yet been taken up in the House. But there was movement Monday to kick off public discussions on the rest of the budget as House Republicans released their spending targets for the upcoming fiscal year.
Also on Monday, Reynolds and Senate Republicans issued a news release stating they had reached a “budget compromise” that leaders said will continue the Republican trifecta’s work of lowering costs for Iowans.
“We cut taxes to ensure Iowans could keep more of their hard-earned money, and we must maintain spending discipline to ensure it stays that way,” Reynolds said in a statement Monday. “Iowa remains on a strong fiscally sustainable path, and we should continue our focus on putting taxpayers first.”
House Speaker Pat Grassley said in a news release the House Republicans budget also follows conservative fiscal beliefs while providing needed state financial support for services Iowans care about.
“Our caucus is committed to delivering a budget that follows responsible budget practices, while funding the priorities Iowans care most about,” Grassley said in a statement. “Iowans expect to see their tax dollars used wisely to fund important services like nursing homes, paraprofessional pay, support for human trafficking victims, and more of that sort, and that’s what this House Republican caucus is fighting to deliver.”
The House plan would give Iowa a state budget of $9.45 billion in FY 2026, an increase of $506 million, or 5.65%, from FY 2025. It’s a higher target than the $9.41 billion budget agreed upon between the Senate and Reynolds.
Comparing the two budget proposals, the differences are:

A roughly $1 million difference for the Administration and Regulations budget, the appropriations for the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals, and Licensing (DIAL), the departments of Administrative Services and Revenue, as well as other state agencies and offices including the Secretary of State’s Office. The Senate target is $73.5 million, and the House’s is $74.5 million.
The House also set a $1.7 million higher budget target in the Agriculture and Natural Resources budget than the Senate and governor are proposing. This funding, going to the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship, Department of Natural Resources and related outdoors and farming services, has a Senate GOP target of $45.6 million and House GOP target of $47.3 million.
For Economic Development appropriations, the House is asking for $450,000 more, a total of roughly $40.6 million, compared to the Senate and Reynolds’ $40.2 million target. This pot of funding goes to the Iowa Economic Development Authority, Iowa Finance Authority, Iowa Department of Workforce Development and related entities.
There’s a larger difference in the Education funding goals between the two chambers projections — House Republicans are asking for $15 million more in the education appropriations bill than what the Senate and governor’s plan provides. This funding is separate from State Supplemental Aid, the per-pupil funding going to Iowa’s K-12 schools. This money heads to the state Department of Education, public universities governed by the state Board of Regents, the Department for the Blind and other education-related services. The Senate’s budget goal is set at $1,026,386,031, and the House at $1,042,264,716.
Health and Human Services is the one of the two funding categories where the Senate and Reynolds’ plan has a higher funding target than the House’s plan. The Senate and governor are asking for nearly $500,000 more for the appropriations bill that goes to the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services and Department of Veteran Affairs. The Senate’s budget target is $2,468,992,645 and the House’s is $2,468,514,264.
For the Justice System and Judicial Branch, the House is asking for roughly $3 million more in funding, with the Senate goal set at $925.9 million and the House at $928.9 million. These funds will go to the state’s judicial system, as well as state law enforcement entities, the Iowa Department of Justice and Department of Corrections.
The chambers’ goals for standings appropriations — typically a grab bag of other state funding obligations that includes the state SSA funding — public K-12 school funding — is the other area where the Senate has a higher target set than the House. The Senate is asking for $4,836,758,719 in standings, while the House is asking for $4,851,312,672. A majority of this money has already been designated through SSA for K-12 funding, but there is still a $3 million difference between the two budget goals for the measure.

As of Monday afternoon, the House budget bills have not yet been released, and not all the specific items causing disagreements between the Senate and House Republicans’ on spending priorities are public. House Republicans said in a news release that budget subcommittees “will continue their work to finalize their individual budgets.”
However, Rep. Gary Mohr, R-Bettendorf, the House Appropriations chair, highlighted increased funding for community colleges and continued support for the paraeducator pay increase included in last year’s bill making changes to the state’s Area Education Agencies system as priorities for House Republicans.
“As Iowa House Republicans, we have built our reputation on passing responsible budgets that have allowed us to lower the tax burden while funding Iowans’ budget priorities,” Mohr said in a statement. “… We are prepared to deliver once again on the promises we make to our constituents.”
Democrats criticized Republicans’ spending goals, stating the GOP budgets provide more money to wealthy Iowans while cutting funding going to those in need. Rep. Timi Brown-Powers, D-Waterloo, denounced Republicans’ budget for including a 44% increase for the state Education Savings Account program, providing state funds for private school tuition and associated costs that will have no income limits beginning in the 2025-2026 school year, and for providing “another $1 billion tax break to corporations that lay off workers.”
“Iowa Republicans have the wrong budget priorities, and plan to spend more than the state takes in forcing the state to borrow money for ongoing expenses,” Brown-Powers said in a statement. “As costs continue to rise for families, House Democrats will fight to lower costs for Iowans and pass a fiscally responsible budget.”
Senate Republicans said they plan to hold subcommittee and committee meetings on their budget bills this week.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch )The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency granted an emergency waiver permitting the nationwide sale of a fuel blend with higher amounts of ethanol through the summer months, which Iowa fuel and farm leaders say will help farmers, fuel producers and Iowans at the pumps. 
Midwestern states, including Iowa, already had waivers in place to allow for summer sales of fuel blended with 15% ethanol, also known as E15. EPA’s decision Monday waives the agency’s summer restrictions on the fuel for the rest of the country and follows guidance from the president’s executive order from January, declaring a national energy emergency. 
The press release from EPA said the move will “provide families with relief” by providing more options at the pump with lower prices per gallon. 
Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig applauded the decision and said Iowa drivers saved more than $38 million by choosing E15 over E10, a lower blend of ethanol fuel, in 2024. 
“Today’s E15 announcement by the Trump Administration is a win for consumers across the U.S. and farmers here in Iowa,” Naig said in a statement. “This decision is a big step toward making our country more energy dominant, independent, and secure.” 
Iowa Sens. Joni Ernst and Chuck Grassley both applauded the measure, noting it was an example of “promises made, promises kept” by the president and would be a “big” boost for corn farmers. 
“It’s clear (President Trump) is making our farmers, producers, and all of rural America a priority, and I look forward to working alongside him to secure permanent, nationwide access to this cleaner, cheaper choice at the pump,” Ernst said in a statement.
According to National Corn Growers Association, year-round E15 sales throughout the country would lead to an increased demand of more than 2 billion bushels of corn annually, which is why the group has pushed for increased ethanol demand. 
Brent Johnson, president of Iowa Farm Bureau Federation, applauded the EPA decision, but noted EPA has consistently issued similar waivers, and urged for a permanent change to the rule. 
“Clearly, there is strong consumer demand for a lower-cost fuel option at the pump, and Iowa farmers stand by readily able to meet the growing demand for biofuels,” Johnson said in a statement.
Naig similarly noted the need for a permanent regulation allowing the sale of the fuel. He, along with Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird and industry groups have all sent letters to congressional leaders urging the passage of such a law. 
“We are tired of waiting,” Monte Shaw, executive director of Iowa Renewable Fuels Association said in a statement. “Consumers and retailers are tired of waiting. E15 could provide a market for 5 to 7 billion gallons of additional ethanol demand at a time when American farmers and rural communities are hurting.”
The EPA waiver is in place from May 1 through May 20, as the Clean Air Act only allows a 20-day waiver, but considering trends from the past several summers, industry leaders expect the waiver will be extended through the other summer months.

Glenn Youngkin's request that he drop out. (Photo courtesy of John Reid)The internal drama roiling Virginia Republicans deepened over the weekend as John Reid, the party’s embattled nominee for lieutenant governor, accused Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s political action committee of extortion — escalating an already explosive rift just months before November’s elections.
In a defiant video posted Sunday afternoon on X, formerly Twitter, Reid alleged that a representative of Youngkin’s Spirit of Virginia PAC told his team the organization would purchase damaging opposition research and “the lies and threats against me would suddenly stop” if he agreed to drop out of the race. 
The allegations come just 48 hours after it became public that Youngkin had personally asked Reid to withdraw over concerns about a social media account linked to explicit content.
Reid, a conservative radio host and the first openly gay statewide candidate from either party in Virginia, said he had hoped the controversy would settle, but instead the pressure had intensified.
“I had certainly hoped that we could put the bigotry and ugliness of last week behind us and unify our Republican ticket this year,” Reid said in the video. “But shockingly, once again representatives of my campaign have been told by the leader of Governor Youngkin’s political organization that the attacks on me will continue unless I drop out of the race for lieutenant governor.”
Spirit of Virginia is headed by political consultant Matt Moran, vice president of Creative Direct.
Under Virginia law, it is a crime to threaten a person’s reputation, safety, property, or immigration status in order to extort money, property, or any financial benefit. Specifically, the law classifies it as a Class 5 felony to use threats, accusations of criminal conduct, or the misuse of immigration documents as leverage for financial or personal gain.
However, Eric Claville, a political and legal analyst at Norfolk State University, urged caution before drawing any legal conclusions from Reid’s allegations. 
“This is politics, and politics is all about perception, and with that being the case, I would not want to speak on the legality of it, because we don’t have all the evidence,” Claville said. “We can only speculate, and that’s what both sides are doing now.”
Claville noted that while Reid’s accusations may stir public outrage, proving criminal conduct would require far more than speculation. 
“When you take a look at what has transpired, it is all speculation and hearsay. Therefore, in the legal court, that would have to be tried out and also go through the legal process in order to make a determination,” he said. “However, in the court of public opinion, which is different from a legal proceeding, it basically comes down to the rules of what is reality and what is not, as it relates to the audience, or the public at large.”
For now, Claville said, Reid appears to have the stronger public narrative. 
“You have candidate Reid making a strong case on his end, and there really is not a strong rebuttal on the other end,” he said. “So at this point, that’s going to have to go through the legal proceedings and of course, the court of public opinion.”
Ultimately, Claville emphasized that the larger issue is mostly political. 
“At the end of the day, the question is, what is the impact upon the ticket – and that impact is massive, and they’re going to have to determine if this is a viable path forward to be competitive in the upcoming election,” he said. 
As of late Monday afternoon, Republican leadership remained notably silent. Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears — the party’s nominee for governor and the headliner of the statewide GOP ticket — has yet to weigh in on the controversy. 
A spokeswoman for Earle-Sears’ campaign and a spokesman for Spirit of Virginia did not respond to multiple phone calls and text messages. Neither did Ken Nunnenkamp, the party’s executive director. Sen. Mark Peake, R-Lynchburg, the newly elected chair of the Republican Party of Virginia, declined to comment Monday.
Adding to the signs of turmoil, an event scheduled for Wednesday at Atlas 42 in Henrico County featuring the statewide Republican ticket — with Youngkin billed as a special guest — has been canceled, according to a report by Virginia Scope.
Even as the controversy swirled, Reid was set to appear Monday evening at a rally hosted by the Loudoun County Republican Committee in Sterling. Loudoun GOP Chair Scott Pio told The Mercury that the event would go forward as planned and that Reid continued to have his support.
“The Republican Party has been removing staunch Republicans for the past three years from elected office all across the state because they’re unhappy with conservatism being pushed,” Pio said, voicing his frustration with efforts to boot Reid off the ticket.
In his video, Reid did not mince words about the pressure he said he faced. 
“This is extortion and it is illegal in Virginia, and I am more outraged now,” he said of the proposal his campaign received from Youngkin’s PAC. Reid added that he has engaged legal counsel to “pursue all options” and slammed what he called the arrogance of party insiders trying to oust him after he became the legal nominee.
“The insiders in Virginia politics made a big miscalculation if they thought that I would bow down to anyone or run away scared,” he said. “I’m a conservative Trump supporter and I’m gay, and everybody knows it because I’ve told you in person and in the media for decades.”
The latest twist follows days of escalating conflict that first broke into public view Friday when The Richmonder reported that Youngkin had privately urged Reid to withdraw after a Tumblr account — bearing the same username Reid uses elsewhere — surfaced featuring sexually explicit content. A spokesperson for Youngkin’s PAC said the governor learned of the account late Thursday and called Reid the next morning.
“The governor was made aware late Thursday of the disturbing online content. Friday morning, in a call with Mr. Reid, the Governor asked him to step down as the lieutenant governor nominee,” Spirit of Virginia said in a statement.
Reid denied the account was his, countering in an earlier video that “anyone on the internet can open accounts with the same or similar names as other people,” and saying he had never publicly performed or posted pornographic material.
Reid said while he expected “harassment and vulgar attacks” from “radical” Republicans and “angry leftists,” he did not expect Youngkin, whom he had long supported, to call for his resignation “without even showing me the supposed evidence or offering me a chance to respond.”
“I did not accept that and I deeply resent it,” he said.
Stephen Farnsworth, a political scientist at the University of Mary Washington, said the turmoil surrounding Reid’s candidacy highlights deeper challenges for Virginia Republicans heading into a critical election cycle.
“The biggest challenge that you have as a first-time statewide candidate is getting your name out there in the public,” Farnsworth said. “That’s not going to be a problem for John Reid.” But, he cautioned, the downside is significant: “This controversy won’t help Reid or the Republican ticket.”
Farnsworth noted the predicament reflects broader tensions within the GOP. 
“It is a very difficult situation for Republicans to both keep the enthusiasm of evangelical Christian voters and reach out to an increasingly visible gay segment of the electorate in Virginia,” he said. While Republicans have long struggled with balancing those constituencies, Farnsworth said, “it is certainly a more intense one right now, particularly given the governor’s rebuffed efforts to avoid a bigger controversy.”
Ultimately, Farnsworth argued, the situation adds yet another complication to an already challenging election year for Virginia Republicans. 
“The Republican party did not need another problem this year,” he said.
Reid’s unexpected ascent to the ticket came after Fairfax County Supervisor Pat Herrity dropped out for health reasons last week. Had Reid agreed to withdraw, the Republican Party of Virginia’s state central committee would have been tasked with picking a replacement, Peake previously confirmed.
The controversy also unfolds against the backdrop of a broader debate over LGBTQ rights, as the General Assembly advances a constitutional amendment to erase a now-defunct ban on same-sex marriage — an issue that has divided Republicans, with many in the House and Senate either voting no or abstaining.

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong vetoed a bill Monday that opponents worried would lead to state employees paying health insurance premiums.
Senate Bill 2160 would have moved the state’s insurance to a plan that offers benefits compliant with the federal Affordable Care Act.
Supporters of the bill said it would have given more flexibility to the state over health insurance plan options and would have provided better coverage of preventative care. Opponents said it could lead to employees paying health insurance premiums, which they don’t currently.
North Dakota House approves change to state health insurance plan

In Armstrong’s veto message to the Senate, he said the state’s health plans are one of the most valued benefits for state employees. He added it was one of the state’s “strongest and most useful recruitment and retention tools.”
“Senate Bill 2160 disposes of that tool and replaces it with a more expensive alternative,” Armstrong wrote.
The health plan switch was estimated to cost at least $25.8 million every two years, according to the governor’s office.
“The current health plan is better for state employees and employees of political subdivisions,” Armstrong wrote. He added, if the bill were to become law, state employees and employees of political subdivisions would have been put in separate health insurance pools, which would have raised the cost on both groups.
The vetoed bill will now go back to the Senate. It would take a two-thirds majority vote to override the governor’s veto.
The Senate passed the bill 44-2.

SB 1270 was one of a slew of bills that the Florida Senate chose to temporarily pass. That means the chamber puts the debate over a bill on hold for the time being. Senate leaders said they intend to vote on the health bill time permitting as the session enters it’s final scheduled week and the state budget for next fiscal year still subject to House-Senate negotiation.
Sen. Jay Collins is the bill sponsor.
The bill amends the existing “Florida Patient’s Bill of Rights” to permanently permanently enshrine policy changes regarding vaccinations that DeSantis put in place during the Covid-19 pandemic.
The bill is problematic for Sen. Gayle Harrell, who worries that it opens physicians to increased medical malpractice lawsuits because it requires physicians to treat patients regardless of whether they reject their advice to be vaccinated. 
Another section of SB 1270 includes a fix to a 2024 law to allow the Florida Board of Medicine to approve an applicant’s licensure by endorsement in certain circumstances, a move that the board supports. That’s the route for any doctor who holds a medical license in one state to apply to practice in another.
The 2024 law law quashed the board’s ability approve by endorsement any physician applying for Florida licensure who:

 Has a complaint, an allegation, or an investigation pending before a licensing entity in another state or territory.
Has been convicted of, or pleaded no contest to, any felony or misdemeanor related to the practice of a healthcare profession, regardless of adjudication, 
Has had a healthcare provider license revoked or suspended by another state,
Has voluntarily surrendered any license in lieu of having disciplinary action taken against the license.
Has been reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank, which includes medical malpractice settlements.

The National Practitioner Data Bank includes information on medical malpractice settlements.
SB 1270 allows the Board of Medicine to approve an applicant’s licensure by endorsement as long as the offense reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank “would not constitute a violation of any law or rule in this state.”

Phil Bryant to FEMA Review Council as state awaits ruling on tornadoes,Geoff Pender and Alex Rozier,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/04/28/trump-appoints-phil-bryant-fema/,"Trump wants to shift disaster relief from federal to state governments, and has denied FEMA aid to several states.","President Donald Trump has appointed former Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant to the FEMA Review Council, which Trump has tasked to “fix a terribly broken system” and shift disaster response and recovery from federal to state government.
The appointment comes as Mississippi awaits a response from the Trump administration on whether it will approve Gov. Tate Reeves’ request for a federal disaster declaration for deadly tornadoes in mid-March. The federal declaration, which Reeves requested April 1, would allow families and local governments devastated by the storms to receive federal assistance. Trump recently denied a similar request for Arkansas.
Trump has said states should shoulder more of the burden for disaster response and recovery, and he and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem have threatened to shut down the Federal Emergency Management Agency altogether.
“I am proud to announce the formation of the FEMA Review Council, comprised of Top Experts in their fields, who are Highly Respected by their peers,” Trump wrote on social media. “… I know that the new Members will work hard to fix a terribly broken System, and return power to State Emergency Managers, who will help, MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN.”
Trump listed other members of the council, including Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and Govs. Greg Abbott of Texas and Glenn Youngkin of Virginia.
Bryant, a longtime political ally of Trump, on social media wrote he is, “Honored to receive this appointment …” and that “Unfortunately, we’ve earned a lot of experience with natural disasters and recovery in Mississippi. Let’s Make America Safe Again.”
Mississippi saw seven deaths and an estimated $18 million in destruction from multiple tornadoes on March 14-15, the same storm system that caused damage in Arkansas. The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency reported that 233 homes were destroyed across 14 counties, and hundreds more were damaged.
During the initial aftermath, Reeves told reporters he believed there was a “high likelihood” the state’s damages from the March tornadoes would meet the threshold for FEMA’s Individual Assistance, which provides direct payments to disaster victims.
The Trump administration’s FEMA has denied federal assistance for flooding in West Virginia, tornadoes in Arkansas and a storm in Washington state, and refused North Carolina’s request for extending relief after Hurricane Helene.
After Hurricane Katrina’s devastation in 2005, Mississippi received nearly $25 billion in federal relief spending, which state leaders have credited with saving the state from ruin and allowing communities and families to rebuild.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/07041842/AP_17343600123362-scaled.jpg,,,2025-04-28 18:07:23.906936

Dave Rader after a Senate Republican Caucus meeting at the state Capitol in Oklahoma City on Monday. (Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — After a private meeting with state Superintendent Ryan Walters, Republican lawmakers made no promises that a leading state senator’s resolution would succeed in rejecting new academic standards proposed for social studies and science education.
Senate Education Committee chairperson Adam Pugh, R-Edmond, filed the resolution Thursday afternoon after half of the Oklahoma State Board of Education said they weren’t aware of changes made to the social studies standards before they approved them in February. Pugh declined to comment while exiting a closed-door Senate Republican Caucus meeting Monday.
Walters joined the caucus meeting midway through. Afterward, he declined to share details of what he discussed but said he had a “great conversation” and “appreciated the invite.”

Senate President Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton, R-Tuttle, said after the meeting the GOP majority is still discussing whether it will put Pugh’s resolution up for a vote by the full Senate. In previous weeks, he said there hadn’t been “a whole lot of movement to reject those standards” among the caucus.
Both the Senate and the House must agree on a resolution by Thursday to take any action on the standards. State law gives lawmakers 30 legislative days after receiving academic standards to consider them and vote. If the Legislature doesn’t pass a resolution, the standards will take effect as written. 
Academic standards dictate the topics that public schools must teach to students. They are reviewed and updated every six years.
Five House members signed on as co-authors of Pugh’s resolution on Monday, including the chamber’s No. 2 Republican leader, Speaker Pro Tem Anthony Moore, R-Clinton. 
The group of co-authors also includes Common Education Committee Chairperson Dick Lowe, R-Amber; the committee’s Vice Chairperson Danny Sterling, R-Tecumseh; Rep. Tammy West, R-Oklahoma City; and Rep. Mike Osburn, R-Edmond, who is listed as the principal House author.
Lowe said lawmakers are troubled by the review and approval process that took place with the state Board of Education, rather than about the contents of the standards. Many of the constituents living in their House districts are concerned, as well, he said.

“We see the process was probably not as transparent as we’d like to see in state government,” Lowe said.
Pugh’s resolution similarly notes that “questions exist regarding the transparency of the subject matter standard adoption process.”
Whether the House has the chance to vote on the resolution depends on the Senate passing it first. Lowe said it then would be “a leadership decision” whether the resolution would get a hearing in the House.
House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, will comment on the resolution if it passes the Senate and comes over to his chamber, his spokesperson said.
Gov. Kevin Stitt and one of his recent state Board of Education appointees, Ryan Deatherage, said they would like the Legislature to send the social studies standards back to the board for another vote. Stitt raised doubts about whether Walters’ administration handled the process with the proper integrity.
Walters denied the governor’s claims that the Oklahoma State Department of Education emailed board members a different version of the proposed standards from what they ultimately approved. 
The Education Department provided email records indicating board members received a copy of the final draft at 4 p.m. the day before they met the following morning of Feb. 27 to vote on the standards. The board voted 5-1 to approve the standards and send them to the Legislature for final review.
The only board member who voted against them, Deatherage, said he hadn’t had enough time to read through the lengthy document.

He and two other board members, Chris Van Denhende and Mike Tinney, said Thursday they weren’t aware at the time of the vote of changes made from the original draft of the standards, which were posted publicly in December.
Some of the changes include the addition of language stating there were “discrepancies” in 2020 election results, including “sudden halting of ballot-counting in select cities in key battleground states, sudden batch dumps, an unforeseen record number of voters and the unprecedented contradiction of ‘bellwether county’ trends.”
Walters said he made the final decision to add the new language after his administration received public comment and input from focus groups. National conservative media personalities and Republican policy advocates made up the leading committee that reviewed the social studies standards.
Pugh’s resolution points out the short timeframe that the board had to review the updated version. It also noted that the governor and board members requested the standards be returned to the state Board of Education “for proper review and consideration.”
  Sen. Adam Pugh, R-Edmond, speaks at a Jan. 27 news conference at the Oklahoma State Capitol. (Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)
Given “the magnitude of the decision” and the $33 million cost to implement the new standards, the resolution proposes the Legislature reject them in full for both social studies and science.
House and Senate Democrats filed resolutions last month to reject the social studies standards. Last week, they again urged their Republican colleagues to take action before Walters’ proposal becomes mandatory teaching in all public schools.
Senate Minority Leader Julia Kirt, D-Oklahoma City, thought of how the new language would mix with the social studies homework her eighth grader brings home from public school.
“This week we talked about Brown v. Board of Education,” Kirt said during a news conference Wednesday. “We talked about Plessy v. Ferguson. We’re talking about very important concepts in history and social studies, and thinking about teachers having to try to present some of these (new) standards and my children trying to analyze them and understand the angle of them and to have critical thinking around them really deeply concerns me.”

(Photo by Felipe Cuevas/TelevisaUnivision)A majority of Florida Hispanic voters believe the country is headed in the wrong direction and blame Donald Trump’s administration for that negative trajectory, according to a poll released on Monday.
The survey, titled the “First 100 Days Bipartisan Poll of the Hispanic Electorate,” was conducted by BSP Research for UnidosUS, Voces Unidas, the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), and Climate Power en Acción. Pollsters conducted interviews in English and Spanish of 1,002 voters nationwide, and 158 in Florida.
The survey of those Florida Hispanic voters shows that 57% believe the country is going in the wrong direction, with 70% of those saying that President Trump and his administration are responsible.
The cost of living/inflation and jobs and the economy were the most important issues for voters surveyed in Florida, although they gave Republicans a one-point lead, 36%-35%, on which party is best equipped to address those issues. Another 18% said neither party, while 12% said both parties.
Regarding immigration, only 17% of Florida Hispanic voters support deporting all undocumented immigrants, no matter how long they have lived in the United States, while 56% support a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who have been here a long time.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced on Saturday that the agency and state law enforcement in Florida arrested nearly 800 people over four days in a “massive, multi-agency immigration enforcement crackdown,” a move celebrated by Gov. Ron DeSantis.
Of the 158 Florida voters surveyed in the poll, 49% said they voted for Trump last fall and 47% for Democrat Kamala Harris. Trump defeated Harris, 56%-43%, in Florida, and Florida Hispanics went for Trump by that same breakdown, according to an exit survey of 500 voters in Florida conducted by the 2024 American Electorate Poll of Hispanic Voters.

Now, affordable housing providers are looking at a much more austere funding landscape: one where they fear deep federal cuts to housing programs are soon in store.“Federal resources will likely no longer be available in the future, and low-income people who rely on a very shaky safety net will soon see that net cut into pieces,” said Michael Monte, the CEO of the housing trust, at a ribbon-cutting event on Monday.Vermont’s housing sphere has seen the initial impacts of the Trump administration’s sweeping staffing and spending cuts, from clawbacks of grants for anti-discrimination work and the sudden terminations of voluntary corps workers building homes. Neighborworks, a congressionally-chartered nonprofit that helped fund the Colchester apartments, has recently come under the security of the Department of Government Efficiency. But housing leaders worry that deeper federal cuts to affordable housing funding and rental assistance programs could be coming – and they fear the state wouldn’t have enough capacity to backfill potential cuts. Nearly a third of the Colchester project’s $31.6 million price tag came from pandemic-era federal funds, said Nancy Owens, president of Evernorth, a co-developer of the project. Amid Vermont’s worsening levels of homelessness, she implored state leaders to find new funding sources for subsidized housing.Michael Monte, CEO of Champlain Housing Trust, speaks at a ribbon cutting event for an affordable housing project in Colchester on Monday, April 28th. Photo by Carly Berlin/VTDigger and Vermont Public“We need to secure more substantial permanent resources to fund housing – for the production of new homes in Vermont. If we don’t, really, the pace of this development will come to a standstill,” Owens said.The three buildings that house the 65 apartments have a long history. During the early 20th century, they served as barracks to one of the first Black U.S. Army regiments in peacetime after the Civil War – who were deployed to clear western lands of indigenous people. The entryways of the buildings have signs documenting that past. More recently, the buildings served as dorms and offices for nearby St. Michael’s College. Studio apartments will rent for $1,100, and one-bedrooms list for $1,250. Eighteen of the apartments have deeper subsidies from the Burlington Housing Authority, meaning rents will be capped at one third of the tenant’s income. (Median rent plus utilities in Chittenden County in 2023 was about $1,600).READ MORE

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)A coalition of labor groups has cleared a major hurdle in an effort to repeal a controversial bill passed earlier this year that prohibits public unions from collective bargaining. 
The Protect Utah Workers coalition, in its bid to repeal HB267, satisfied two of the requirements to qualify for a ballot referendum on Monday. According to data from the lieutenant governor’s office, the coalition gathered signatures from at least 8% of the state’s registered voters — including signatures representing 8% of voters in at least 15 of Utah’s 29 state Senate districts. 
Per the lieutenant governor’s office, county clerks around the state have verified 146,480 signatures, above the roughly 141,000 threshold required to qualify for a referendum. 
Labor coalition shatters threshold to qualify for referendum in effort to repeal union bill

And data analyzed by political consulting and public affairs firm Morgan & May shows that the 8% threshold has also been met in 15 Senate districts. 
If those numbers hold up, it’s likely HB267 will be put on hold until the general election in November 2026, where voters will decide whether the controversial law should take effect. 
“Today, Utahns made history,” the coalition said in a statement on Monday, noting there are still “tens of thousands more signatures awaiting verification.” On April 16, the coalition announced it submitted 320,000 signatures gathered in the 30-day window required under Utah law — if accurate, it would be the most successful referendum effort in state history. 
“The message is clear: Utahns still believe in checks and balances, accountability, and the power of the people to lead,” the coalition said on Monday. 
According to Morgan & May, the coalition met the threshold in the following Senate districts: 

Republican Sen. John Johnson’s District 3, which includes North Ogden, Huntsville and parts of Summit County like Wanship and Coalville. 
Republican Sen. Ann Millner’s District 5, which includes Ogden, South Ogden, Riverdale, Sunset and Clearfield. 
Republican Sen. Jerry Stevenson’s District 6 in parts of Layton and Kaysville. 
Republican Senate President Stuart Adams’ District 7, which includes Layton down to Centerville.   
Republican Sen. Todd Weiler’s District 8, which encompasses North Salt Lake, Woods Cross, Bountiful and parts of Salt Lake City. 
Democrat Sen. Jen Plumb’s District 9 in Salt Lake City
Democrat Sen. Luz Escamilla’s District 10 in Salt Lake and West Valley cities. 
Democrat Sen. Karen Kwan’s District 12 in Kearns, West Valley City and parts of Taylorsville. 
Democrat Sen. Nate Blouin’s District 13, which includes parts of Salt Lake City, Millcreek, South Salt Lake and Murray. 
Democrat Sen. Stephanie Pitcher’s District 14 in Salt Lake City, Millcreek, Holladay and Murray. 
Democrat Sen. Kathleen Reibe’s District 15, which includes parts of Sandy, West Jordan and Cottonwood Heights. 
Republican Sen. Wayne Harper’s District 16 in Taylorsville and West Jordan. 
Republican Sen. Lincoln Fillmore’s District 17 in South Jordan. 
Republican Sen. Dan McCay’s District 18 in Herriman, Riverton and Bluffdale. 
Republican Sen. Kirk Cullimore’s District 19 in Sandy and Draper. 

“Many of the qualified districts are represented by the very politicians who actively pushed (and sponsored) HB 267,” the coalition said. “Now, their own neighborhoods are standing up for public workers’ rights.”

County clerks still have until the first week of May to verify outstanding signatures — once a signature is verified, it’s made public, opening a 45-day window where the voter can choose to rescind their support for the referendum, if they choose.
When the county clerks are done, the lieutenant governor’s office will then review the process. Assuming the coalition has complied with state code and gathered enough valid signatures, ballot language will be crafted for the 2026 general election. The law will be put on hold until then. 
HB267 was one of the most controversial bills to come out of the 2025 legislative session, prohibiting public sector unions from collective bargaining. Once it takes effect on July 1, 2025, a public union, like a teachers union, will no longer be able to negotiate an employment contract with an employer, like a school district. 
Lawmakers say HB267 will protect taxpayer dollars while giving all public employees a voice, not just union members. The bill’s sponsors — Rep. Jordan Teuscher, R-South Jordan, and Senate Majority Leader Kirk Cullimore, R-Sandy — said unions shouldn’t be negotiating terms of employment if they don’t represent a majority of the employees. 
But labor groups and members of the public opposed the bill, speaking out during committee meetings, protesting in the Capitol rotunda and urging the governor to veto. Despite concerns that it would erode their rights and eliminate leverage unions have when meeting with their employers, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox signed it on Valentines Day.

(Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)The Colorado House of Representatives will not vote to override Gov. Jared Polis’ veto of a bipartisan bill to regulate users who illegally sell drugs and firearms on social media platforms.
The chamber voted 51-13 on Monday afternoon to lay over the override vote until May 9, which is after the legislative session ends. That means the veto will stand and the bill will not become law.
“We have accepted the fact that the governor has exercised his authority to veto this bill, that the Senate has exercised their constitutional authority to override that veto, and that today, the votes are not here in this chamber to do the same. That is a statement of fact,” bill sponsor Rep. Andrew Boesenecker, a Fort Collins Democrat, said.
He said he would bring the bill back in the future.

Senate Bill 25-86 aimed to protect vulnerable young people from predatory social media users who try to sexually exploit them online or sell them drugs or guns. It would have required social media companies, such as X and Meta, to investigate and remove users they determine violate policies around those behaviors. It also would have required companies to hand over related materials to law enforcement within three days of a request.
The bill originally passed the Senate on a 29-6 vote and the House on a 46-18. Polis, a Democrat, vetoed the bill last week, but the Senate voted to override the veto, which requires a two-thirds majority from both chambers. The House would have needed 43 votes to override.
If successful, it would have been the first override against a Polis veto.
“This law imposes sweeping requirements that social media platforms, rather than law enforcement, enforce state law,” Polis wrote in his veto letter. “It mandates a private company to investigate and impose the government’s chosen penalty of permanently deplatforming a user even if the underlying complaint is malicious and unwarranted. In our judicial proceedings, people receive due process when they are suspected of breaking the law. This bill, however, conscripts social media platforms to be judge and jury when users may have broken the law or even a company’s own content rules.”
Polis said he looks forward to working with lawmakers to achieve the bill’s goals, but he said “the approach set forth in SB25-086 risks undermining efforts to protect the right of free speech and dissent, and empowers social media companies with police-like powers to make or break someone’s lives and livelihood in a time when free expression is absolutely critical.”
Groups from across the political spectrum, including the ACLU, Working Families Party and Rocky Mountain Gun Owners, urged Polis to veto the bill, primarily on First Amendment concerns.
Bill supporters saw it as a way to protect children who use social media. If a person sold drugs to young people near their school, they would be punished, they argue, and social media is the modern equivalent of that scenario.
Polis also vetoed a bill that would set a different timeline for open records request responses for non-journalists. Sponsors have floated trying to override that veto as well, but the Senate delayed a vote on it until later this week. The legislative session ends May 7.

Chris Murphy takes his ’emergency’ message on the road,Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/28/chris-murphy-ct-emergency-message/,"As other Democrats grasp to respond to Trump, CT Sen. Chris Murphy is channeling his own frustration and anger into a blitz of appearances.","SAXAPAHAW, N.C. (AP) — Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy isn’t drawing arena-size crowds like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are as he tours the country talking to voters. But in a packed concert hall in rural North Carolina, people are starting to view the Democrat as worthy of the national spotlight.
Murphy and Rep. Maxwell Frost, D-Fla., have been staging events in Republican congressional districts in recent weeks, trolling GOP lawmakers such as Rep. Richard Hudson, who represents the area they visited Thursday. Hudson, the chairman of the House GOP campaign arm, has discouraged Republicans from holding town halls, so Murphy and Frost decided to hold one on his home turf in North Carolina.
“We are doing the job that these Republican congressmen and senators won’t do,” Murphy told the hyped-up crowd of mostly older voters at the event, while acknowledging that Democrats need to do more to soothe their anxiety and counter President Donald Trump. “I want to make sure that everywhere, in every corner of this country, people are willing to stand up and fight.”
As other Democrats grasp for a response to Trump’s election, unsure of how to confront him, Murphy is channeling his own frustration and anger into a sustained blitz of television appearances, fundraising appeals, Senate floor speeches and events like the one in North Carolina. He also is talking directly to voters on social media, including through lengthy live videos on Instagram where he sits in his kitchen with a cocktail and tries to explain what he sees as “the central story” of Trump’s presidency — “the billionaire takeover of our government made possible by the destruction of our democracy.”

It’s a methodical approach for Murphy, 51, a serious-minded legislator who has been most well known for his yearslong fight to stem gun violence in the aftermath of the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut that killed 20 first-grade students and six educators.

While the kitchen talks on Instagram seem to come more naturally to Murphy than riling up a crowd, his message is clearly resonating with his party’s base of voters, many of whom are angry at Democrats in Washington for inaction. He raised around $8 million in the first quarter of the year, a significant sum that could rival the totals for Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez, who have been drawing much larger crowds on a tour together.
“I mean, I’m not Bernie Sanders,” Murphy said in an interview after the event in Saxapahaw. “I’m not going to draw 70,000 people. But that doesn’t mean that I don’t still have an obligation to try to go out and support a national mobilization.”
Frustration with the Democratic Party’s leaders came to a boil last month, with most of the anger directed at Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York after he voted for a Republican bill to keep the government open just as the base was hoping to see more fight from their elected officials. Murphy was strongly against the bill, even if opposing it meant Democrats would trigger a government shutdown.
“When people see us engaged in risk-adverse behavior, then they are much less likely to show up for rallies to ultimately engage in the kind of civil disobedience we might need to save the democracy,” Murphy said.

His fundraising haul, and his barrage of media and events, raises questions about his future ambitions. But it is unclear where Murphy’s moment might lead. He insists that he is not thinking about a presidential bid or a future in Senate leadership after the No. 2 Democrat, Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, announced this week that he will retire next year.
“It’s probably not a coincidence that my content is breaking through and more people are listening to me at a time when I’m not getting up every day thinking about my personal political future,” said Murphy, who was reelected to the Senate last year. “There’s not going to be an election in 2028 if we don’t win this fight right now.”
The answer isn’t a cop out, he says. “It seems kind of silly to think about anything other than the emergency that exists today,” he said. “That is legitimately what drives me.”
Ron Osborne, the chairman of the Democratic Party in Alamance County, where Thursday’s event was located, said he had not previously considered Murphy a major contender for the presidency in 2028. But “he’s doing the right things,” Osborne said.
“He is speaking out where others could do the same thing and have not,” Osborne said, and “that takes courage.”
Terry Greenlund, a 78-year-old Democrat who was also in the audience, said he thinks Murphy “has a way of talking with people.”
“I think it’s time for a new generation to move in with some new views and insight and energy,” Greenlund said, echoing many others in the room.

A spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee said Hudson would not comment on the event in his central North Carolina district. The spokesman, Will Kiley, said Murphy had “parachuted in” and his “extreme, far-left values couldn’t be more out of step with these communities.”
Murphy, 51 and the father of two teenagers, seems to be enjoying the attention. He joked at the event that he may not be as “cool” as Frost, who is the youngest member of Congress at 28. But Murphy is still decades younger than Schumer, Durbin and other Democratic colleagues who have controlled the party for years.
“I’m trying to be dad cool,” Murphy said.
Murphy, who did a similar event in Missouri on Friday, is not the only Democrat venturing into red states. In addition to Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the 2024 vice presidential nominee, and Rep. Ro Khanna of California have also recently traveled to talk to voters in Republican areas.
He said he does not want to “reinvent the wheel” with his fundraising haul, but he does not want to sit on it, either. Murphy said he plans to help organizations mobilize voters before the 2026 midterm elections and also put pressure on Republicans as they try to push tax and spending cuts through Congress.
“The only way that history tells us that you stop an elected leader from converting a country away from democracy is mass mobilization,” he said.
“Our party has made mistakes, and if we don’t learn from those mistakes,” Murphy said, “we’re cooked.”

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)Almost 100 days into his second term, President Donald Trump has seen his approval in South Carolina dip slightly, according to a Winthrop Poll released Monday. Still, favor for Trump in the state outperformed his ratings on the national stage.
The poll, published on the eve of his 100th day in office, found that 49.8% of people who had an opinion approved of Trump’s work thus far, a more than three percentage point drop since March.
Scott Huffmon, a political science professor at Winthrop and the poll’s director, told the SC Daily Gazette that the rapid slicing of the federal government, a slew of executive orders and tariffs increased Trump’s polarization, especially as some start feeling the direct impact of those decisions.
“We’re seeing more people get used to Trump the president and not Trump the candidate,” he said.
Whether or not respondents looked favorably upon the president’s performance to date tracked heavily along party lines.
Among self-identified Republicans, who made up roughly a third of all respondents, Trump’s approval rating sits at 80% — largely unchanged since March. Meanwhile, disfavor among self-identified Democrats, who made up a quarter of all respondents, grew four points to 85%.
The remaining 42% of all respondents identified as independent or declined to name a political affiliation.
(Voters don’t register by party in South Carolina, and the poll was not limited to likely voters.)

Similarly, the Winthrop poll found that 47% of South Carolinians believe the country is on “the wrong track.” Eighty-one percent of Democrats hold that sentiment. Inversely, Republicans think the opposite, with 69% of respondents saying it is trending in the right direction.
“People’s opinions on the direction the country is headed depend heavily on whether their side holds power,” Huffmon said. “This is true at both the national and state level.”
More popular in the Palmetto State
Despite increased skepticism, Trump, who received more than 58% of the vote in November in South Carolina, remains more popular in the Palmetto State than he does nationwide.
A survey from Pew Research Center released on April 23 found the president’s national approval rating to be at 40%. Gallup has Trump at 44%, according to its most recent poll.
“South Carolina approval for President Trump among those with an opinion is notably higher than his national support but struggles to break into a clear majority,” Huffmon said.
On average, Trump’s approval rating sits at 44% as of Monday, according to a New York Times aggregation of numerous polls around the country. On Feb. 17, the president had an average approval of 50%.
In a Truth Social post Monday morning, Trump said not to believe the numbers. He specifically criticized a trio of polls, saying they should be investigated for election fraud.
He mentioned a joint survey done by ABC, The Washington Post and Ipsos, which concluded Trump had a 39% approval rating. He also railed against a New York Times-Siena Poll where 42% of respondents approved of him, as well as a Fox News survey that placed his favorability at 44%.
“They are Negative Criminals who apologize to their subscribers and readers after I WIN ELECTIONS BIG, much bigger than their polls showed I would win,” Trump wrote.
Graham lags among GOP
The Winthrop Poll also took South Carolinians’ temperature on other GOP politicians — notably U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, who is seeking his fifth term in the Senate in 2026.
At 44%, Graham’s approval rating among partisan Republicans who expressed an opinion was noticeably lower than two other statewide officials included in the poll — U.S. Sen. Tim Scott and Gov. Henry McMaster.
McMaster and Scott, the co-chairs for Graham’s 2026 re-election campaign, had a 58% and 56% approval rating among Republicans.
Graham has $15.9 million cash on hand, according to the latest FEC filings and already secured Trump’s endorsement for next year’s election.
“Senator Graham has a large campaign war chest and is not underwater approval-wise with his party,” Huffmon said. “This is a decent foundation upon which one could build a strong re-election campaign. Still, many on the right may view the fact that Graham’s numbers are substantially lower than those of his GOP colleagues as an invitation for a primary challenge.”
Graham has drawn multiple primary challengers in his last two Senate bids.
Mark Lynch, a Greenville businessman, announced a bid to challenge Graham in February. He moved more than $5 million of his own money into his campaign account in March, according to FEC filings.
The latest Winthrop poll was conducted online and via telephone between April 4 and April 12 from a sampling of South Carolina adults; 1,546 people responded.
The results were weighted to align with South Carolina’s demographics for race, sex and age based on census data. Findings using all respondents have a margin of error of plus or minus 2.49%. The margin of error increases to 4.29 points with Republican respondents and 5.05 points with Democratic respondents.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/gettyimages-2211668489-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-28 18:07:23.906936

Sitting in his living room, the 78-year-old explained how much his community of manufactured homes means to him — and how frustrated he is with the state. Along the curved roads of Williston Woods Homeowners Association, most residents like Cook are seniors who get by on a fixed income. They can’t afford to make home improvements, Cook said. And some renos, like bathtub railings, are especially important for seniors, he said. Usually someone who lives in a manufactured or mobile home park can apply for state money to help pay for home-improvement projects. But Cook’s community, as a homeowners association, isn’t a mobile home park under Vermont law — so the state won’t list it on the registry that opens up those funds.Cook is one of 47 residents in the neighborhood, a designated affordable housing community for seniors. As a member of the association, he can afford a multi-bedroom house adorned with matte white siding — and, uniquely, ownership of the land it sits on.That’s why the state says the residents don’t face the same challenges, or need the same support, as people in traditional mobile home parks. Cook and his neighbors disagree. “The issue is that we’re not on the state registry — and it’s causing us a lot of grief,” Cook said. A note outlining grievances from Williston Woods Homeowners Association over its exclusion from the state registry for mobile home parks. Photo by Catherine MorrisseyAssociation leaders have been pressuring the state for years to recognize their community. After talks this spring, Sen. Kesha Ram Hinsdale, D-Chittenden Southeast, wrote to the Agency of Commerce and Community Development, which manages the registry. She asked them for an exception and never heard back. “They are the only mobile home community that’s come forward in the state where they own their homes, they own the land underneath them and they own the park collectively,” Ram Hinsdale said. The agency told Community News Service that state assistance is meant to help people more vulnerable than the residents. Officials don’t plan on recognizing the park under current laws but said they will continue to work with residents on other ways to help them. The state offers grants for making repairs, installing foundations, hauling away abandoned homes and more. The manufactured home program has paid over $6 million in awards, the agency says.READ MORE





 


Vermont is pouring millions into manufactured homes and mobile home parks

To fit the state’s definition, at least two mobile homes have to sit on a piece of land owned by one owner. Right next door to Williston Woods Homeowners Association lives Williston Woods Cooperative Housing Corporation, a manufactured home co-op that functions almost exactly the same as the homeowners association. But the co-op itself owns the whole park, while the association parcels land out for individual ownership. And the distinction earns the co-op a spot on the registry. Most of the homes in Cook’s community were built in the 1980s, he said, and manufactured homes need more weatherization and frequent maintenance than traditional homes. Many people in the community can’t afford the repairs, said Cook, and getting maintenance done is often harder for older folks. Joe Yandow, a 73-year-old who joined the community a few years ago, said his house needed major improvements when he moved in. An older woman with mobility issues owned the house before him, and she just couldn’t keep up with the repairs, Yandow said. Gary Nowak, a leader and resident of the association, in discussion in April 2025. Photo by Catherine MorrisseyHe said he had to renovate parts of the house and was denied funding at every step. Now he has a leak in the roof and needs the insulation in his attic replaced — but he’s not sure how to afford it.“The state’s going to have to step up,” Yandow said, speaking for himself and his neighbors.  Cook said recently a number of residents helped a woman walk up the stairs outside her home. She should be able to build a ramp or install a stairlift device without having to cover the cost, Cook said. Legislators tried to tackle the issue last year by proposing a bill to expand the definition of a manufactured home park. But officials at the Agency of Commerce and Community Development voiced concerns that a definition change would open the door for people who didn’t need the assistance. The bill was never passed. One of the main streets in Williston Woods Homeowners Association. Photo by Catherine MorrisseyThis February, Cook and another community leader, Gary Nowak, told a Senate committee about their frustrations. The men stayed in contact with their senator, Ram Hinsdale, and asked her again to take action. She wrote the agency requesting to make an exception on the registry for the homeowners association but got no reply, she said. The agency “legally cannot make an exception for Williston Woods as it does not meet the definition of a mobile home park,” said Scott Sharland, mobile home park coordinator for the agency’s housing department.The state has programs to assist those in manufactured homes because they “do not own their land, which makes them particularly vulnerable to increases in lot rents and the possibility of evictions, park sales or park closures,” Sharland said, speaking on behalf of the department.But residents at the homeowners association in Williston say they’re in need, too. “Just add us to the damn registry,” Yandow said. The agency wants to find “the best way to accommodate” the homeowners association, Sharland said, “without undermining the purpose of the mobile home park registry.” So far, it hasn’t.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Frustration stews at Williston senior community over state’s mobile home park rules.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Morrissey_Mobile_Home-6.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-28 17:11:49.057745

Levenson, who represents the Diocese of Camden, listens to arguments before the New Jersey Supreme Court about clergy sex abuse on April 28, 2025, at the Richard J. Hughes Justice Complex in Trenton. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)The New Jersey Supreme Court heard arguments Monday in a long-fought case about whether a state grand jury can call out a private entity like the Catholic Church and recommend reforms for its public harms, like clergy sex abuse — or if such presentments are permissible only when they involve public entities and ongoing harms, as church attorneys contend.
The Catholic Diocese of Camden has been battling the state to prevent a presentment since 2019, when former Attorney General Gurbir Grewal vowed to investigate clergy sex abuse. He acted after a Pennsylvania grand jury returned a presentment against hundreds of priests who victimized more than 1,000 children over seven decades
Lower-court judges sided with the diocese and sealed the New Jersey case, so while the legal fight has continued for six years in secrecy, abuse victims were left wondering what happened to Grewal’s investigation. The Attorney General’s Office appealed to the Supreme Court for the final word, and the state’s top court agreed last month to consider the case and ordered some records unsealed.

Monday, Michael L. Zuckerman, the state’s deputy solicitor general, told the justices that trial and appellate judges erred by taking a “front-end, stop-the-presses approach” in preventing prosecutors from even taking the case to a grand jury and ruling on a presentment that does not yet exist.
“My frontline argument to you is that it is highly premature, inconsistent with the rule, for the trial court to have short-circuited this process before it could even start,” Zuckerman said. “And so for that reason, this court should simply reverse and remand for the process to go forward, possibly clarifying along the way that presentments can sometimes talk about non-governmental actors too.”
Any concerns about outing private individuals could be handled after a presentment is returned and before it is publicly disclosed, with a judge redacting or striking whatever they find concerning, Zuckerman added.
But attorney Lloyd D. Levenson, arguing for the Camden diocese, said clergy abuse was “long-ago conduct by private individuals that impacted only a fragment of the population.” Presentments must address “imminent” harms against a broad swath of the public perpetrated by public actors, such as government entities or public officials, so the lower courts were correct to thwart a presentment, Levenson added.
“If this court expands the scope of a grand jury presentment to include private individuals and private entities, conducting investigations in secret under the sole influence of a prosecutor with no opportunity to present a defense, the grand jury’s authority will be unlimited,” Levenson said. “Presentments were never intended to call attention to private conduct within private entities. We ask, respectfully, that this court affirm.”
He dismissed Zuckerman’s claim that barring a hypothetical presentment is premature.
“You’d have to be Rip Van Winkle to not realize what is going to come out of this,” he said. “I can tell you what’s going to come out of it: They’re going to say that from 1940 to the present, because that’s what the subpoena included, that there was problems in the Catholic Church with child sexual abuse.”
Abuse victims already have multiple avenues for justice — prosecutors can seek criminal indictments, and victims can sue for civil damages, Levenson said. He also cited a 2002 agreement between the state and New Jersey’s dioceses that required them to report all abuse allegations to public authorities. The state had five years to raise concerns about that agreement — but didn’t, proving that church has effectively “eradicated” the problem of sex abuse from its clerical ranks, he said.
Levenson also accused the state of “partisan” motives, questioning why prosecutors singled out the Catholic Church for investigation instead of other religious or private groups. He warned the justices that allowing the grand jury to weigh private entities’ conduct is “a slippery slope.”
“Where do you end this? Is the local rotary club, because it doesn’t admit women or minorities, subject to a presentment?” he said.
Several justices appeared unpersuaded by Levenson’s arguments.

“If the presentment does not exist, it’s hard to know if it’s based on partisan motives,” Justice Rachel Wainer Apter told him.
A presentment might not even have been returned had a grand jury heard the case, Justice Fabiana Pierre-Louis added.
“It’s really difficult to speculate as to what a presentment — if 12 grand jurors even vote on a presentment — will look like, and trying to determine how to assess something that has not yet come into existence,” Pierre-Louis said.
The justices also mused over what counts as “public affairs or conditions,” which presentments are meant to address. Court rules and precedents don’t specify that “every single member of the public” must be impacted for a harm to rise to the level of a public affair or condition, Wainer Apter said.
Chief Justice Stuart Rabner prodded Levenson about his complaint that Grewal announced his intention to secure a presentment in 2019, instead of just presenting the case to the grand jury without any public notice.
“Would we be here if the state had simply first started summoning victims to testify?” Rabner asked him.
State prosecutors have asked for an expedited review, with the Supreme Court expected to recess for the summer in June until October.
 Victims react
Several clergy abuse victims watched the arguments from the packed gallery. Outside the courtroom afterward, many were cautiously optimistic about how the court will rule.
“I am hopeful. That’s the best I could say,” said Toni Latario of Alpha.
Latario said she was 11 when she first met her abuser, a Catholic missionary. Now 66, she’s a retired sergeant from the Warren County Prosecutor’s Office, where she ran the special-victims unit. She went public with her childhood abuse as an adult because she was concerned her abuser might have preyed on other children too, she said.
Kathy Leddy-Callahan of Bergen County, who said she was abused as a child, objected to shielding the names of abusive priests and any church leaders who hushed up abuse. Anyone else credibly accused, charged, or convicted of abuse would be publicly named, she added.
“Absolutely, the name should be revealed. Without question. That notion of a heavenly umbrella that protects is absurd, and it also attracts people who do that,” Leddy-Callahan said.

Mark Crawford, the New Jersey state director of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, condemned the Camden diocese’s secrecy.
“They’re out there standing on that podium saying: ‘We’ve done all this for victims, we’ve put the truth out there, there’s nothing hidden.’ Then why is it they have worked so hard to suppress this investigation?” Crawford said.
He also disputed Levenson’s claim that clergy abuse no longer is a problem.
“That’s just not true. It’s accepted science that children who are abused don’t generally come forward for decades, if ever. So how can you say in the present, ‘Oh, nothing’s going on?’” Crawford said. “The whole truth has not been told, and that’s why it takes society and a grand jury investigation to one, expose what they still have hidden, and two, to help those victims who were abused heal.”

The Louisiana Department of Children and Family Services will participate in the SUN Bucks program again this summer, although Gov. Jeff Landry’s administration was at first reluctant to do so a year ago. The state agency is proactively telling families about the program, though it says nearly all participants are already signed up to receive the one-time benefit of $120.
“Most eligible children will be automatically enrolled and do not need to apply,” Sammy Guillory, DCFS assistant secretary for family support, said in a statement.
The summer benefits will be added to SNAP recipients’ EBT cards or the SUN Bucks card they were issued last summer. The money is available to use for 122 days after it is issued. It will be doled out starting in the second half of May for children already enrolled in the program. 
To be eligible, children must be born between Aug. 8, 2006, and July 1, 2028 and have received income-based food, financial or Medicaid support since July 1, 2024. The threshold for families to receive the assistance is a household income below 185% of the federal poverty level, which comes to $59,477 for a family of four.
Families who no longer have EBT or SUN Bucks cards should call 1-888-997-1117 or visit www.LifeInCheckEBT.com to request a replacement. Families who need to apply for SUN Bucks can do so online.
SUN Bucks evolved from a federal COVID pandemic food aid program that the Biden administration chose to keep in place in 2024. But when states were asked in late 2023 whether they would continue to participate the following summer, Louisiana Education Superintendent Cade Brumley opted out. His department determines eligibility for the program that DCFS administers.
Brumley explained at the time he thought it wasn’t fair to approve a program the incoming Landry administration would have to shoulder without any say-so.
Shortly after his appointment in early 2024, Landry’s DCFS secretary, David Matlock, also said his agency wouldn’t offer the Summer EBT program because “families deserve a pathway to self-sufficiency.” He insisted existing programs would cover food needs over the summer, although critics said many families lacked transportation to pick up the “grab-and-go” prepared meals Matlock was promoting.
The secretary later told state lawmakers his priority for any public resources would be addressing staff shortages within his department affecting child welfare.
The Landry administration ultimately caved under pressure from Republican lawmakers who noted for every $1 Louisiana spent to administer the summer food program, the state received $1.60 in federal funds. All told, the state stood to miss out on $70 million from Washington.
Louisiana was the second poorest state in the nation with a poverty rate of 18.9% in 2023, the most recent data available from the Census Bureau.  
Last year, nearly 670,000 Louisiana children received SUN Bucks benefits, and almost 100% were automatically enrolled, according to Guillory. Families who have changed their home address are encouraged to update their records with the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and other assistance programs to avoid delays with receiving food assistance this summer.
In 2023, incorrect addresses prevented more than 124,000 children in Louisiana from receiving pandemic food assistance. Several states reported similar problems, but Louisiana was too slow to rectify the issue and lost $16 million in federal aid as a result.

A Tallahassee administrative judge on Monday recommended the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) deny a permit to drill for oil and gas in the Apalachicola River Basin in Northwest Florida.
Administrative Law Judge Lawrence P. Stevenson wrote that he might have ruled differently had Clearwater Land and Minerals LLC, the company intending to drill, presented a better plan for stormwater containment on the site, located in rural Calhoun County.
On April 26, 2024, the DEP issued the proposed permit to Clearwater, authorizing the company “to drill a directional exploratory well.” That permit was challenged in June 2024 by Apalachicola Riverkeeper, a nonprofit dedicated to the protection, restoration, and stewardship of the Apalachicola River and Apalachicola Bay.
The drilling site is within the 100-year floodplain of the Apalachicola River basin.
Riverkeeper has said that that if a spill were to occur at the site, it would have catastrophic consequences due to the proximity of the proposed well to the nearby streams, wetlands, and bodies of water, which would compound the difficulty of cleaning up the spill.
In testimony during an administrative hearing held in December, William K. Jones, described by the judge as an expert in the field of civil engineering and hydrology, was critical of the stormwater management design proposed by Clearwater. He described it as adequate for “a Dollar General in Blountstown,” but not to contain the toxic materials involved in the oil drilling process. (Blounstown is the Calhoun County seat).
“Mr. Jones’s detailed criticisms, set forth in the Findings of Fact above, established persuasively that the stormwater management plan originally proposed was inadequate,” Judge Stevenson wrote.
The judge also was critical of the DEP’s contention that, “because no commenting agency identified it as such, the proposed location by definition cannot be a ‘sensitive environment.'”
“First, DEP is abdicating its own duty to identify and protect sensitive environments by relying on what were, for the most part, very cursory reviews by the commenting agencies,” Judge Stevenson wrote.
“The more reasonable way to read the rule is that it allows commenting agencies to supplement DEP’s analysis, not replace it or absolve DEP from examining environmental issues. If DEP has previously found that an area contains a sensitive environment, it makes no sense that the rule would allow the Calhoun Board of County Commissioners to negate DEP’s finding.”
The order comes as the Florida Legislature was moving on a proposal (HB 1143) to ban oil exploration and drilling near the Apalachicola River. Last week, the Florida Senate took up and passed the House version with an amendment prohibiting drilling, exploration, or production of oil, gas, or other petroleum products in counties designated as “rural areas of opportunity” within 10 miles of a National Estuarine Research Reserve — meaning Gulf, Liberty, Franklin, and Calhoun counties.
Deepwater Horizon
In advocating for the bill, the co-sponsor of the measure in the House, North Florida Republican Jason Shoaf, noted the recent 15th anniversary of of the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill, an event that led to miles of oiled beaches in the Florida Panhandle.
“During the oil spill, just the threat of oil coming to our area completely crippled our economy and now we face another threat that is starting to really scare the entire community,” Shoaf said.
Because the bill was amended, it needs to go back to the House again for a final vote. The regular legislative session is scheduled to end this Friday, May 2. If the bill is passed, it would then go to Gov. Ron DeSantis’ desk.
Stevenson’s recommended order released on Monday now must go back to the Department of Environmental Protection for a final order.
Administrative judges in Florida are employed by the Division of Administrative Hearings (DOAH) within the Florida Department of Management Services. They serve as independent adjudicators, presiding over formal administrative hearings, where they act as both judge and jury to resolve disputes between state agencies and individuals or entities affected by agency decision.

“I really want Landmark College to be seen as an anchor institution in Windham County, and so it's important that we plan for the future,” the college president said. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Landmark College selects interim leader as new president.","Newly appointed president of Landmark College, Jim Dlugos. Photos courtesy of Landmark College.Jim Dlugos has been appointed the fifth president of the Putney-based Landmark College, the first college in the nation specifically designed to serve neurodiverse students, the college announced on Monday. Dlugos was named interim president of Landmark College in July, after a decades-long career in postsecondary education, including an 11-year role as president of St. Joseph’s College in Maine. Dlugos said he welcomed the opportunity to help Landmark College during a transition period and now in a permanent capacity because the mission of the college aligned with his individualized, learner-centered approach to education.Barbara Epifanio, the chair of Landmark College’s board of trustees, said in a written statement that the board realized during the search process that Dlugos had the “right vision and demeanor” for the position. “As we’ve gotten to know Jim as Interim President, and he’s gotten to know us, we came to realize there was an ideal fit for his experiences and the opportunities our institution presents,” Epifanio wrote. Landmark College, founded in 1985, offers six bachelor degree programs and five associate degree programs and serves approximately 500 students with dyslexia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism or executive function challenges.With Dlugos at the helm for most of the past year, the college moved forward on several initiatives, such as adding three majors in history, health sciences and media arts production next fall, he said. “At a time when most news from colleges and universities is about closing programs or shutting programs down, the fact that Landmark is adding programs is a really positive sign about our future,” Dlugos said. In January, Landmark College was named the primary recipient of a federal National Science Foundation grant geared toward bolstering educational and professional opportunities in science, technology, engineering and math in the southern Vermont region. Dlugos said the grant is moving forward, and the college is in the hiring and strategic planning phase of implementing projects made possible by the grant. READ MORE
“It’ll allow us to develop infrastructure for research, and research is the backbone of emerging businesses,” Dlugos said. “It’s really about economic development and strengthening the economy in southern Vermont, and so it’s going to end up with tremendous benefits for everyone who lives in southern Vermont.”Josh Moyse, associate professor of theater arts and the faculty senate chair, called Dlugos a “visionary and creative thinker” who engages in a holistic way with faculty to help steward the institution. The college was originally established as a certificate and tutoring program and began offering four-year degrees more than a decade ago, he said. “Our student profile has continued to evolve over these decades, and what that means is that we are often transitioning to new territory from within,” Moyse said. “Jim brings a wealth of experience in higher ed that is beyond Landmark and is able to see certain areas that we can simplify that may have become a little bit more cumbersome, which allows us to be more nimble as we move forward.”Grace Nelson, the president of the Student Government Association, said Dlugos has maintained an open dialogue with students and considered student perspectives during his stint as interim president and that she is grateful that Dlugos will remain the leader of Landmark College.“He’s done a lot of things that have improved some of my experiences with the school,” Nelson said. “With certain meetings, he’s changed some of the formats to make it more of an open conversation.”Nelson also pointed to weekly emails Dlugos sends out about national affairs and the potential impacts for Landmark to engage students, faculty and staff. “It’s more easily accessible for us and puts it in context,” she said.Last fall, the college acquired the defunct Windham College’s former gymnasium and field house building and is beginning renovations to transform the space into a “college community hub,” according to Dlugos.“Part of my hope for Landmark over the next number of years is that we become clear in our advocacy, developing neuro-inclusive communities, and part of that is having neuro-inclusive spaces,” Dlugos said. “The renovations really are going to be aimed at creating spaces that are going to be the best possible for people to learn differently, and the reality is we all learn differently.” Along with creating inclusive learning and gathering areas, Dlugos said one of his goals as president is to develop a strategic plan in the coming year to foster ongoing engagement with the school’s neighbors and the broader community.“We’re looking to really develop and strengthen our relationships with Putney and with the rest of Windham County,” Dlugos said. “I really want Landmark College to be seen as an anchor institution in Windham County, and so it’s important that we plan for the future, that we know what is important and on the mind of everyone in the area.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Landmark College selects interim leader as new president.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/landmark-college-composite.png?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-28 17:11:49.057745

Gov. Micah Beckwith’s defense of the Three-Fifths Compromise — which he called “a great move” by the country’s founders toward ending slavery — has thrust the Republican official into the national spotlight and triggered sharp pushback from historians and civil rights groups. The statement was made in a Thursday video posted to X […],"Micah Beckwith, now Indiana's lieutenant governor, speaks to a crowd on Saturday, Oct. 26, 2024, in Greenwood. (Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith’s defense of the Three-Fifths Compromise — which he called “a great move” by the country’s founders toward ending slavery — has thrust the Republican official into the national spotlight and triggered sharp pushback from historians and civil rights groups.
The statement was made in a Thursday video posted to X in which Beckwith argued that the 18th century-era compromise limited the political power of pro-slavery states by not allowing them to count enslaved individuals as whole persons for congressional representation. 
The video, shared on the last day of Indiana’s 2025 legislative session, was a response to Statehouse debate around Senate Enrolled Act 289. The heart of that measure, authored by Republican Sen. Gary Byrne, limits diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives in schools, state government and health profession licensing. The bill advanced to the governor on Thursday but has not been signed.
Beckwith took aim at Senate Democrats, specifically, for likening the bill to historical policies — like the Three-Fifths Compromise — that “dehumanized” marginalized groups. Sen. La Keisha Jackson, D-Indianapolis, who invoked the compromise and its history during her chamber testimony, called the Republican-backed legislation “a fight against racial equality.”
 Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith explains in his stance in defense of the Three-Fifths Compromise in a social media video posted Thursday, April 24, 2025. (Screenshot from a video posted to the lieutenant governor’s official X account)
“They were saying this is a bad bill because it actually just encourages discrimination, just like the Three-Fifths Compromise, going all the way back to the foundations of our nation,” Beckwith said. “I would like to share with you, the Three-Fifths Compromise is not a pro-discrimination compromise. It was not a pro-discrimination or a slave-driving compromise that the founders made. It was actually just the opposite. It was a compromise that the North made with the South.”
Beckwith’s official X account also doesn’t allow users to reply to the post.
Critics have since accused Beckwith of rewriting history and downplaying the horrors of slavery. 
In a joint statement issued by the Concerned Clergy of Indianapolis, the Indiana Chapter of the National Action Network and the Alliance of Baptists, the groups labeled Beckwith’s interpretation as “historical revisionism” and called for a formal retraction. They emphasized that the compromise was about consolidating control and political power while denying enslaved individuals their humanity and rights.
The groups further urged Gov. Mike Braun to publicly denounce the comments, but the Republican governor has yet to comment on the matter.
The pushback was highlighted in news stories by The Washington Post, Fox News, Newsweek and other major outlets.
Also on Monday, the Indiana Senate Democratic caucus released a statement denouncing Beckwith’s comments.
“No compromise that counted human beings as fractions can ever be anything but a stain on our nation’s conscience,” it said. “The Three-Fifths Compromise entrenched the enslavement of people, empowered oppression and delayed justice by generations.”










The argument that the Three-Fifths Compromise was actually passed with the intention of destroying or undermining slavery is just, frankly, laughable.


– Indiana University history professor Alex Lichtenstein


Neither Beckwith nor his office have released an official statement about his remarks on the Three-Fifths Compromise, but the lieutenant governor continued to defend his position in the days following the video’s posting.
Alex Lichtenstein, a history professor at Indiana University, described Beckwith’s retelling of history as “a confusion between intention and long-term consequences.”
“The intention of the compromise was, quite frankly, to sell out Black people. That is to lock them into slavery for longer term in the interest of creating the union,” Lichtenstein said. “The argument that the Three-Fifths Compromise was actually passed with the intention of destroying or undermining slavery is just, frankly, laughable.”
In 1787, during the Constitutional Convention, the nation’s founders included “multiple concessions” in the U.S. Constitution to Southern states, “designed to preserve and protect the institution of slavery,” Lichtenstein said.
The most significant was the Three-Fifths Compromise, which allowed Southern states to count three-fifths of their enslaved population for congressional representation — effectively giving them more political power and preventing the union from easily abolishing slavery.
The history professor described Beckwith’s comments and the ensuing debate as “a much broader assault in the country, but particularly in this state,” on universities like IU, and on faculty’s ability “to recognize and teach a complex American history story.”
“They’d much rather have a simple, straightforward story. ‘Oh yeah, the founders were perfect. They might have held slaves, but fundamentally, they were themselves opposed to slavery, and in their infinite wisdom, they built in these clauses that they knew could be used to defeat slavery in the long-term.’ Apparently they just didn’t really tell anyone, nor did they count on a civil war to have to make it happen,” he continued. “They want a particular form of history which makes them feel comfortable, but unfortunately for them, it’s wildly inaccurate.”
‘Rewriting’ the nation’s history
In the video posted on the lieutenant governor’s official X account, Beckwith admonished Senate Democrats for saying on the chamber floor that Byrne’s bill “embodies something to the effect of the Three-Fifths Compromise.”
His remarks continued into a history lesson, of sorts:
“At the time, there were basically 13 independent nations. They had not really created a constitution. They were sort of a European Union-esque nation, and they were saying to the pro-slave states, ‘Hey, if you want to count your slaves to have representation — more representation — in Congress, we’re not gonna let you do that,’ because they knew that that would codify things like slavery into our nation. 
And the North stood up to the South, and they said, ‘We’re going to count your property,’ because the South says, ‘Hey, this is our property, but we want to count them in the congressional representation. We want to count them in the census.’ At the time, 30,000 people would equal one member of Congress. And so they said, ‘We’re going to count our slaves. We’re going to get more members of Congress in the South.’ The North said, ‘You can’t do that.’ So when they came back to the South and they said, ‘Fine, if you want to count your property, your slaves, as whole people, we’re going to count our property. We’re going to count our tables, we’re going to count our chairs, we’re going to count all the stuff that we have in our house.’ And the South said, ‘Well, you can’t do that.’ And they said, ‘Well, you’re doing it with your property. We’re doing it with our property.’
Anti-DEI bill cracking down on ‘unlawful discrimination’ en route to governor’s desk

So what they did is they came up with a Three-Fifths Compromise. They said you will only get three-fifths of a vote when it comes to your slave. And what that did, it actually limited the number of pro-slave representatives in Congress by 40%. This was a great move by the North to make sure that slavery would be eradicated in our nation. They knew what they were doing, but now, here you have Senate Democrats in today’s American Republic who do not understand that.”
Beckwith’s take on the compromise’s history appear to echo interpretations by David Barton, an author and political activist revered in evangelical circles for promoting the idea that the United States was founded as a Christian nation. His interpretations of U.S. history have been met with significant criticism from many historians and scholars, however, who argue that Barton’s work contains inaccuracies and misrepresentations and proliferates the spread of “pseudo-history.”
Follow-up posts on Beckwith’s personal X account included a 2010 interview clip from Glenn Beck’s Fox News show, during which Barton described the Three-Fifths Compromise as a means to “cut the slavery representation in Congress in half.”
“When Frederick Douglass read that, he said, ‘The Three-Fifths Clause has nothing to do with worth. That has to do with representation. It makes it harder to get a pro-slavery representative in Congress. The Constitution’s an antislavery document,’ Barton said. “It was Frederick Douglass who points that out.”
Beckwith agreed with Barton, saying on X that “the great abolitionist, Fredrick Douglass, recognized the strategic value it gave our new nation in ultimately ending the evils of slavery and racial discrimination.”
He reiterated that “(w)ithout the 3/5ths Compromise there would be no United States” and “slavery would likely still be a normal part of the developed world.”
“It was a great step in the right direction which ultimately laid the foundation for the eradication of the evils of slavery and racial discrimination,” he said in on the social media site.
Intent vs. consequences
Lichtenstein said Douglass initially aligned with radical abolitionists who viewed the Constitution as “entirely pro-slavery.” In the 1840s, abolitionists like William Lloyd Garrison, for example, “wanted to burn the Constitution and saw it as a “compact with the devil.”
But by the 1850s, Douglass shifted his stance. He began to see the Constitution as a potential tool to challenge slavery and recognized that the Three-Fifths Compromise “could be strategically used to undermine the institution of slavery,” turning a clause originally designed to protect slavery into a potential weapon against it.

Importantly, Lichtenstein emphasized, Douglass’s approach was “tactical” — not a wholesale endorsement of the original intent of the compromise.
Additionally, the abolitionist never denied the the Three-Fifths Compromise was initially passed to benefit Southern slave-holding states. Instead, Douglass strategically reinterpreted the clause to advance abolitionist goals.
“Frederick Douglass was the most woke person you can imagine in the 1850s,” Lichtenstein said. “These folks who heroicize Frederick Douglass either are being disingenuous or don’t know what they’re talking about.”
The professor made clear, as well, that there is “no disagreement” among historians and academics about the original intent of the Three-Fifths Compromise.
There were other pro-slavery provisions, too, like the Slave Trade Clause, which prohibited Congress from ending the slave trade until 1808.
“That meant there were 20 more years to bring in as many slaves from Africa as you like, which amounted to over one-third of the total slave imports to the colony (and later the United States) over the entire period of the slave trade,” Lichtenstein said.
Separately, the Fugitive Slave Clause required the return of escaped enslaved people to their owners.
“These were deal breakers for the South. They weren’t deal breakers for the North,” Lichtenstein noted.
Historians suggest that without these compromises, slavery might have been constitutionally abolished as early as the 1820s. The concessions were so effective at strengthening slavery that they ultimately emboldened the South to secede and go to war in 1861.
That framing of past events is “universally understood” among historians, Lichtenstein said, although there continues to be “vigorous discussion” about whether the Constitution could ultimately be considered an anti-slavery document, and about how abolitionists like Frederick Douglass strategically reinterpreted constitutional clauses.

Historians like Sean Wilentz contend that the Three-Fifths Compromise, while morally flawed, was a necessary limitation on slaveholder power and helped leave open a path toward slavery’s eventual abolition.
Other historians, including, Nicholas Guyatt, argue instead that the compromise strengthened slavery’s hold on national politics from the start and was not a tactical anti-slavery measure, but a structural embedding of racial injustice into the Constitution.
“What I find so ironic or peculiar about this is that the the extreme right-wing is always insistent on original intent of the Constitution. … But here, all of a sudden, when it comes to the three-fifths clause, they don’t seem to care about the original intent. For this, it’s the living document and how it was put to use later on,” Lichtenstein said. “You can’t have it both ways. If you believe in original intent, then you have to believe that the Three-Fifths Compromise was a concession to slavery in the Southern states.”
“We don’t glorify the founders because they had the magical crystal ball to realize that the Three-Fifths Compromise was going to be anti-slavery. No, they made a flawed compromise with the institution of slavery,” he added. “But we are fortunate enough that people came later on to recognize that that tool could be used for justice instead of injustice.”

(Jonathan Bachman/Getty Images)A proposal to more than double the tax placed on sports gambling in Louisiana – and dedicate some of that revenue to Division I athletics programs – is moving forward in the state legislature.
The House Appropriations Committee voted Monday to advance House Bill 639 by Rep. Neil Riser, R-Columbia, to increase the tax on sports gambling from 15% to 32.5%. The higher rate aligns with the tax the state places on video poker. 
The proposed increase in sports gambling taxes has support from conservative and progressive corners, both saying the revenue should be used to offset the “social ills” of gambling. The new rate would generate another $2 million for addiction programs.
But Riser’s bill goes further, altering the tax revenue split and putting 25% into a Supporting Programs, Opportunities, Resources and Teams (SPORT) fund that would benefit student-athletes at Louisiana’s public universities that compete at the NCAA Division I level. They include UL Lafayette, UL Monroe, Louisiana Tech, LSU, Grambling, McNeese, Nicholls, Northwestern, Southeastern, Southern and the University of New Orleans. 
The committee also tied Riser’s legislation to House Bill 594 by Rep. Chance Henry, R-Crowley, which creates a flat tax on insurance premiums. Riser’s bill can only take effect if Henry’s does. 
Rep. Jerome “Zee” Zeringue, R-Houma, was the only lawmaker on the committee to vote against Riser’s bill, saying he was concerned about the potential budget impact of Henry’s bill. Precise details of the bundled bills’ fiscal impact will be made clear in the next version of the fiscal note, which should be made publicly available before Riser’s bill is debated on the House floor.

Sports gambling companies opposed Riser’s bill, arguing that Louisiana’s 15% tax rate is already higher than the 14% national average. Lawmakers were skeptical of this concern, noting the companies are based out of state and have no physical infrastructure or employees in Louisiana, unlike the casinos here that pay the much higher tax rate of 32.5%.
Riser’s bill has wide support from college athletics department leaders, who packed the committee room at the State Capitol. 
“The need is so high,” Riser said in an interview with the Louisiana Illuminator and Tiger Rag. “When you start talking about the SEC, talking about any level of athletics right now, it’s changed so dramatically.” 
“Even like ULM … just to be competitive [in recruiting], it takes facilities, when you’re dealing with [athletes] they require you to have all those things,” Riser said. 
Riser’s bill was amended to equally split revenue in the SPORT fund among eligible institutions. 
The fund is expected to receive more than $31 million in dedicated funding annually, according to a fiscal note for the bill. Each school would receive approximately $2.8 million annually. 
That’s a small drop in the bucket for LSU, which has an athletics budget of over $200 million. But it would be a significant lifeline for schools such as Southern, Nicholls and ULM, which each spend less than $20 million a year on their sports program. 
Presently, the state’s split for sports gambling tax revenue calls for 25% to go toward early childhood education, 10% to local governments, 3% to gambling addiction programs, and the rest to other priorities and the state general fund. 
Under Riser’s bill, childhood education, local governments and addiction recovery would retain their existing share of tax proceeds. In addition to the 25% that would now go to college athletics, another 3% would be dedicated to the Louisiana Postsecondary Inclusive Education Fund to finance programs for students with disabilities. The rest goes into the state general fund for a variety of government needs.

(File photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — The state’s prisons director was officially sworn in as acting U.S. attorney Monday.
With Bryan Stirling tapped as the state’s lead federal prosecutor, his deputy director of operations, Joel Anderson, will take over leadership of the state’s 21 prisons, according to a news release from the governor’s office.
Stirling started working as head of the Department of Corrections in 2013. That job, which involved overseeing more than 3,700 employees and a prison system with more than 16,000 inmates, was “the privilege of a lifetime,” Stirling said in a statement.
SC prisons director to become interim U.S. attorney

“I look forward to continuing to serve the people of South Carolina and pledge to uphold the high standards set by those who came before me,” Stirling said.
Stirling’s appointment by U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi means a formal nomination from President Donald Trump is likely. Stirling will then need confirmation by the U.S. Senate to officially become the state’s top federal prosecutor. Bondi’s appointment means Stirling will oversee 120 prosecutors and about 20 support staff on an interim basis as he awaits confirmation.
Trump’s administration removed Adair Ford Boroughs, the state’s U.S. attorney since 2022, in February. Boroughs’ assistant attorney Brooks Andrews has filled the role since.
As corrections director, Stirling cracked down on contraband coming into prisons, including a push to change federal law that would legalize signal blocking technology to make inmates’ illegal cellphones useless. He implemented personal development programs for inmates that led to the state having one of the lowest rates in the country of inmates re-offending and returning to prison. And he successfully pushed for higher employee salaries in an effort to recruit and retain correctional officers.
Stirling also guided the department through a 2018 prison riot that left seven inmates dead and the restarting of executions after 13 years, including the first conducted by firing squad in state history.
“Director Bryan Stirling is widely recognized as the best corrections director in the country, and his relentless spirit has turned SCDC into a model for other states to follow,” Gov. Henry McMaster said in a news release.

Before becoming director of the state’s prison system, Stirling was then-Gov. Nikki Haley’s chief of staff. Prior to that, he was deputy attorney general during McMaster’s two terms as the state’s head prosecutor.
Stirling’s name was among those floated for the position during Trump’s first term, though Trump eventually nominated Columbia attorney Sherri Lydon instead. Two years later, after Lydon’s departure, Peter McCoy led the agency for eight months before stepping down after former President Joe Biden took office.
Anderson, who will act as interim head of the prison system, has overseen security, maintenance and food service for the corrections department since 2019.
Originally from Texas, the 66-year-old started working in prisons in 1978 as a correctional officer for the state of Texas. He rose through the ranks, becoming a major by the time he left in 1996, according to his agency bio.
Anderson came to South Carolina that year to lead the state’s inmate work programs and prison food service. After a brief stint working for Florida’s prison system, Anderson returned to the South Carolina Department of Corrections in 2004, where he worked as a prison warden and in several other leadership roles.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current) State officials are curious about how Rhode Islanders are using artificial intelligence (AI).
The Rhode Island Artificial Intelligence Task Force and Gov. Dan McKee launched a new survey Friday asking Rhode Islanders how they feel about AI and how they’re using it. The survey is open through May 9 and takes about 10 minutes to complete, but can take longer depending on the length of one’s responses to write-in questions.
“We’re positioning Rhode Island as a national leader in AI, cybersecurity, and other emerging technologies,” McKee said in a statement. “Our goal is to harness the benefits of AI for our local economy while mitigating potential risks through thoughtful policy and planning. It’s important to hear from Rhode Islanders as we continue to shape the future of AI in RI.”
McKee assembled the AI Task Force in February 2024 to investigate how the Ocean State can responsibly use and build policy around the rapidly expanding and increasingly popular set of technologies colloquially referred to as AI. The rise of generative AI since 2022 has especially shaped widespread consumer and industry use of programs that can create text and images, analyze data, or perform an assortment of mundane tasks. The group includes representatives from multiple sectors including state government, tech, health care, education, business and other sectors.  
The committee is chaired by former U.S. Rep. Jim Langevin, who also chairs the Institute of Cybersecurity and Emerging Technologies at Rhode Island College, another McKee-led project. Chris Parisi, the founder and CEO of Trailblaze Marketing in Providence, serves as the task force’s vice chair.
“The AI Task Force is hard at work to identify the most effective ways Rhode Island can harness the power of this emerging technology while minimizing the risks it brings,” Langevin said in a statement. “As we create our roadmap, we’re asking the public to offer their insights on if and how they’d like to see artificial intelligence implemented across the state, as well as to share any concerns about the future of this technology.”
The survey has five sections, from queries about respondents’ basic familiarity with AI to how people use AI in their job. Questions about on-the-job usage are tailored to the industry selected from a list, which includes government, finance, education, health care, manufacturing/trade/defense, and small businesses/nonprofits/start-ups.
Questions across the survey include “How has AI changed your job in the past 2 years?,” “What do you believe are the biggest opportunities AI brings to Rhode Island?” and “Do you believe AI should be regulated?”
A final section, “AI and the Future of Rhode Island,” invites respondents to muse on whether Rhode Island should or should not “position itself as a leader in AI.”
Respondents can include their email address to receive future updates and information about events, including those with potentially more opportunities for public feedback, from the AI task force.

Marti, R-Broken Arrow, whispers with Rep. Anthony Moore, R-Clinton, during a special legislative hearing probing the finances of the Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services on Monday. (Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — The state’s mental health department should go back to budgeting basics and build out guidelines for the services it must provide, the head of a legislative fiscal oversight agency said Monday.
Regina Birchum, executive director of the Legislative Office of Fiscal Transparency, said the Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services is treating its appropriations as “fungible,” or interchangeable, making it difficult for officials to make sense of how it is being spent.
Of the 195 accounts the Department of Mental Health budgeted for in fiscal year 2024, a LOFT analysis found that 115 were over budget, while 66 were under budget. In all, over $29.3 million was overbudgeted, while about $57.6 million was underbudgeted.
“I would say this is an agency that has a long-standing issue with proper accounting of funds,” Birchum said. “We’re not saying anything improper was done. We’re saying that funds are not properly accounted for in such a way that an outsider can determine what they were spent on, and it’s our hope that we can make some recommendations that will bring some clarity to them.”
Birchum made her comments under oath during the third day of testimony during a special hearing at the state Capitol where House lawmakers continue to probe reports of financial disarray at the mental health agency as well as why some provider contracts were abruptly cut or canceled. Lawmakers were frustrated at a lack of answers from mental health officials during the first two days of testimony. But at the conclusion of Monday’s hearing, some said LOFT helped shed some light on spending and budgeting practices.
Birchum said her agency has been investigating the mental health department at the Legislature’s request since early March. In particular, it has been probing the mental health department’s reported $43 million deficit and whether the agency’s $6.2 million supplement request will be enough to finish the fiscal year.
LOFT assists the Legislature in finding factual information about budgets to hold agencies accountable for properly spending funds. 
Birchum said the mental health officials initially believed they had a $63.7 million shortfall, but later found $19.6 million that could be used for Medicaid reimbursements and another $10.5 million in contract savings. That reduced the overall deficit to $33.6 million.
LOFT records indicate investigators were unsure where the remaining $27.4 million would come to reach the $6.2 million figure, but noted the mental health department continued to work on its budget review.
She said the agency’s $6.2 million supplemental request includes funding to bridge revenue shortfalls for two different facilities and $4.1 million to cover costs related to the recent mental health competency restoration settlement agreement. The later funding was already appropriated by lawmakers, she said.
Birchum said LOFT was also told that all initial cuts to providers have been restored.
Rep. T.J. Marti, R-Broken Arrow,  said after the hearing that lawmakers expect to have some firm budget numbers this week from the mental health department, but said putting caps on what providers can charge for some crisis services could help provide more budget certainty.
Rep. Mark Lawson, R-Sapulpa, who chairs the special committee, said LOFT provided needed detail about the mental health department’s “poor accounting practices” that “lends to the inability to produce real numbers.”
Lawmakers only have 22 working days left in session. Lawson said the committee needs to quickly determine the current financial picture of the mental health department, if a $6.2 million supplement appropriation will be enough, and what sort of budget the agency needs moving forward.
“I feel much more confident that we could work together to put something together that we feel like has some fidelity to it, but it’s certainly concerning that we’re this far into session, and we don’t have the clarity that we need to do our job,” he said.
Lawson said there likely will be some legislation that emerges from the hearings. Some additional testimony may be conducted behind closed doors because it “may be of a protected nature” under non-disclosure agreements, he said.
If time allows, the committee may require the state’s mental health commissioner to testify again.

Instead, state Medicaid programs will retain the choice of whether to cover the high-priced medications for their residents.
The drugs, which have historically been prescribed to diabetic patients, also help patients lose weight and have grown in popularity among doctors and patients. But they are generally too expensive for most people to afford without insurance.
While doctors and patient advocates say these drugs are critical to helping patients struggling with obesity and can save money in the long run by reducing comorbidities such as heart disease, others say the medications are just too expensive for most states to afford. More than a dozen state Medicaid programs have opted to cover GLP-1s for obesity treatment, and the proposed Biden rule would have asked all states to figure out how to pay for them. But now, advocates fear these drugs may continue to be out of reach for many.
“It’s unfortunate that they’re excluding a whole class of medications that seem to have a tremendous number of health benefits to patients,” Dr. Nicholas Pennings, chair of family medicine at Campbell University in Buies Creek, North Carolina, said in an interview.
GLP-1s, which stand for glucagon-like peptide-1, are a class of drugs that balance blood sugar levels. They’ve long been prescribed to patients with Type 2 diabetes. But since the drugs also curb hunger signals, doctors may prescribe these drugs — including popular brands Wegovy and Ozempic — to help patients lose weight.
Medicaid is a joint federal-state funded program that mostly serves people with lower incomes under the age of 65 or who have a disability. The federal Medicare program focuses primarily on people above the age of 65, no matter their income.
How and whether to cover expensive treatments and drugs can be a significant deliberation for state Medicaid directors. In North Carolina, where 70% of people struggle with being overweight or obese, officials opted to begin covering the drugs for weight loss last year. That coverage has been a game changer, said Pennings, who continues to treat Medicaid patients.
“They are expensive, but there’s a lot of other medications that are expensive too. Why is it that obesity medications and diabetes medications are being selected out?” Pennings said. “I think that’s just part of the inherent bias towards the treatment of people with obesity, feeling like it’s cheating or not necessary.”
The list price for Wegovy is around $1,300 per month, and for Ozempic, around $1,000. Even so, the skyrocketing popularity of these drugs has prompted at least 14 state Medicaid departments to begin covering these drugs to treat obesity in the past decade.
In addition to North Carolina, those states include California, Delaware, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Virginia and Wisconsin.
An annual survey of Medicaid directors from health policy research group KFF recently found that half of the 47 responding states not already covering the drugs were considering doing so.
In January, the National Association of Medicaid Directors told the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services that state Medicaid departments had “significant concerns over the fiscal impacts” of the Biden proposal to require coverage of GLP-1s, and “strongly recommend that CMS maintain the current state option to cover or not cover anti-obesity medications.”
But others say covering the drugs will yield long-term savings.
John Cawley, a professor of economics and public policy at Cornell University who has studied the economic impacts of obesity, has found that obesity essentially doubles a person’s annual health care costs due to comorbidities such as heart disease, fatty liver disease and kidney disease.
He’s found that weight loss among those with extreme obesity, with a BMI of 40 or higher, can yield substantial reductions in medical care costs.
Cawley added that state Medicaid programs “have a lot of flexibility” in ensuring costs don’t get out of control, by, for example, covering a newly available generic version of GLP-1s, requiring prior authorization, and asking patients to try behavioral programs before getting a prescription.
North Carolina’s Medicaid department began covering GLP-1s for obesity in August. The state has been able to afford GLP-1 coverage by negotiating rebates, or discounts, with drug manufacturers, and by getting the federal government to cover some costs. Department leaders think lowering obesity will save the state money in the long run, said Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for North Carolina Medicaid.
He said that one of the benefits of Medicaid is that “we get to choose, as a state, where we want to make kind of those extra investments or not.” He added that covering the medications could be potentially financially feasible for other states.
“Each program is different and has its own pressures. It would be welcome to be able to come together with other states to be able to negotiate broader deals,” Ludlam said. “If North Carolina is able to get a good deal, I don’t know why other states wouldn’t be able to participate in that.”
In 2023, Connecticut enacted a law requiring Medicaid to cover obesity treatment services. The program began covering GLP-1s for weight loss, but costs were significant enough that the state told providers this year that it is now focusing on other obesity treatments instead.
Sean Scanlon, the Connecticut comptroller, said that not covering GLP-1s is “shortsighted, bad policy.” The state health plan, which takes care of teachers and other state employees, has been covering the drugs for weight loss since 2023. The plan controls costs by only prescribing GLP-1s after patients go through some online weight-loss counseling, said Scanlon.
“The most fiscally conservative thing we can do is give people tools that will save the taxpayers money in the long run,” he said in an interview. “And GLP-1 drugs are one of the best tools that we have to ensure that the taxpayers are not going to pay more money for the health care of hundreds of millions of people in the long run.”
It’s unclear whether the federal government will reverse course. In the past, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has recommended “three good meals a day” and behavioral changes rather than weight-loss medication.
But this month, Kennedy told CBS News he’s considering a regulatory framework to have Medicare and Medicaid cover these “extraordinary drugs” in the future, once their cost goes down.
“Ideally, over the long-term, we’d like to see those drugs available for people after they try other interventions,” Kennedy said.

For many years, Eric Wunderlin’s health issues made it hard to find stable employment.
Struggling to manage depression and diabetes, Wunderlin worked part-time, minimum-wage retail jobs around Dayton, Ohio, making so little he said he sometimes had to choose between paying rent and buying food.
But in 2018, his CareSource Medicaid health plan offered him help getting a job. It connected him to a life coach, who helped him find full-time work with health benefits. Now, he works for a nonprofit social service agency, a job he said has given him enough financial stability to plan a European vacation next year.
“I feel like a real person and I can go do things,” said Wunderlin, 42. “I feel like I pulled myself out of that slump.”
Republicans in Congress and several states, including Ohio, Iowa and Montana, are pushing to implement work requirements for nondisabled adults, arguing a mandate would encourage enrollees to find jobs. And for Republicans pushing to require Medicaid enrollees to work, Wunderlin’s story could be held up as evidence that government health coverage can help people find employment and, ultimately, reduce their need for public assistance.
Yet his experience is rare. Medicaid typically does not offer such help, and when states do try to help, such efforts are limited.
And opponents point out that most Medicaid recipients already have jobs and say such a mandate would only kick eligible people off Medicaid, rather than improve their economic prospects. Nearly two-thirds of Medicaid enrollees work, with most of the rest acting as caregivers, going to school or unable to hold a job due to disability or illness, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.
Existing efforts to help Medicaid recipients get a job have seen limited success because there’s not a lot of “room to move the needle,” said Ben Sommers, a professor of health care economics at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Most Medicaid enrollees already work — just not in jobs with health benefits, he said.
“The ongoing argument that some folks make is that there are a lot of people freeloading in Medicaid,” he said. “That’s just not supported by the evidence.”

Using health programs to encourage work
The GOP-controlled Congress could allow or require states to implement a Medicaid work requirement as part of revamping and downsizing Medicaid. The first Trump administration encouraged those work mandates, but many were struck down by federal judges who said they were illegal under federal law.
Policy experts and state officials say more attention should be paid to investments that have helped people find better jobs — from personalized life coaching to, in some cases, health plans’ directly hiring enrollees.
They argue work requirements alone are not enough. “The move to economic mobility requires a ladder, not a stick,” said Farah Khan, a fellow with the Brookings Institution, a nonpartisan think tank.
While Medicaid work requirements have been debated for decades, the issue has become more heated as 40 states and Washington, D.C., have expanded Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act to the vast majority of low-income adults. More than 20 million adults have gained coverage as a result — but Republicans are now considering eliminating the billions in extra federal funding that helped states extend eligibility beyond groups including many children, pregnant women and disabled people.

Only Georgia and Arkansas have implemented mandates that some Medicaid enrollees work, volunteer, go to school or enroll in job training. But a study Sommers co-authored showed no evidence work requirements in Arkansas’ program led to more people working, in part because most of those who could work already were.
In Arkansas, more than 18,000 people lost coverage under the state’s requirement before the policy was suspended by a federal judge in 2019 after less than a year. Those who lost their Medicaid health care reported being unaware or confused about how to report work hours. Since 2023, Arkansas has been giving Medicaid health plans financial incentives to help enrollees train for jobs, but so far few have taken advantage.
Some plans, including Arkansas Blue Cross and Blue Shield’s, offer members $25 to $65 to complete a “career readiness” certificate. In 2024, some Arkansas health plans offered enrollees educational videos about topics including taxes and cryptocurrency.
Health plans don’t have an incentive to help someone find a better-paying job, because that could mean losing a customer if they then make too much to qualify for Medicaid, said Karin VanZant, a vice president at Clearlink Partners, a health care consulting company.
Rather than offering incentives for providing job training, some states, such as California and Ohio, require the insurance companies that run Medicaid to help enrollees find work.
In Montana, where some lawmakers are pushing to implement work requirements, a promising optional program nearly collapsed after state lawmakers required it be outsourced to private contractors.
Within the program’s first three years, the state paired 32,000 Medicaid enrollees with existing federally funded job training programs. Most had higher wages a year after starting training, the state found.
But enrollment has plummeted to just 11 people, according to the latest data provided by the state’s labor department.
Sarah Swanson, who heads the department, said several of the nonprofit contractors that ran the program shuttered. “There was no real part in this for us to deliver direct services to the folks that walked through our door,” she said. The state hopes to revive job training by allowing the department to work alongside contractors to reach more people.
The hunt for results
State officials say they don’t have much data to track the effectiveness of existing job programs offered by Medicaid plans.
Stephanie O’Grady, a spokesperson for the Ohio Department of Medicaid, said the state does not track outcomes because “the health plans are not employment agencies.”

Officials with CareSource, which operates Medicaid plans in multiple states, say it has about 2,300 Medicaid and ACA marketplace enrollees in its JobConnect program — about 1,400 in Ohio, 500 in Georgia and 400 in Indiana.
The program connects job seekers with a life coach who counsels them on skills such as “showing up on time, dressing the part for interviews, and selling yourself during the interview,” said Jesse Reed, CareSource’s director of life services in Ohio.
 
Since 2023, about 800 people have found jobs through the program, according to Josh Boynton, a senior vice president at CareSource. The health plan itself has hired 29 Medicaid enrollees into customer service, pharmacy, and other positions — nearly all full-time with benefits, he said.
In 2022, California started offering nontraditional health benefits through Medicaid — including help finding jobs — for enrollees experiencing homelessness or serious mental illness, or who are otherwise at risk of avoidable emergency room care. As of September, it had served nearly 280,000 enrollees, but the state doesn’t have data on how many became employed.
The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, which is among the largest private employers in Pennsylvania, running both a sprawling hospital system and a Medicaid plan, has hired over 10,000 of its Medicaid enrollees since 2021 through its training and support services. Among other jobs, they took positions as warehouse workers, customer service representatives and medical assistants.
The vast majority left low-paying jobs for full-time positions with health benefits, said Dan LaVallee, a senior director of UPMC Health Plan’s Center for Social Impact. “Our Pathways to Work program is a model for the nation,” he said.
Josh Archambault, a senior fellow with the conservative Cicero Institute, said Medicaid should focus on improving the financial health of those enrolled.
While the first Trump administration approved Medicaid work requirements in 13 states, the Biden administration or federal judges blocked all except Georgia’s.
“I don’t think states have been given ample chance to experiment and try to figure out what works,” Archambault said.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – A day after telling lawmakers it wouldn’t hire a chief financial officer until it “gets through” its budget situation, a state agency said it is moving forward with filling the position permanently.
The Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services’ job posting Friday came a day after House lawmakers questioned the qualifications of Skip Leonard, the agency’s interim CFO. During an extensive grilling, he was unable to answer basic questions about the agency’s financial irregularities.
Leonard, a former city manager, said he has no experience overseeing finances for a state agency and is not a certified public accountant. Lawmakers said he was being paid $165 an hour to serve as interim or as much as $343,000 a year.
Leonard told lawmakers that the mental health department was waiting to hire a permanent CFO until it “gets through” its current budget situation. 
Lawmakers are trying to determine why the agency has a $43 million shortfall and why mental health officials believe a $6.2 million supplemental appropriation would be enough to fill the gap.
Leonard, who oversees the agency’s over $610 million budget, was unable to answer many of the questions, leading some lawmakers to focus instead on his own qualifications and pay rate. 
The agency said in a statement to Oklahoma Voice on Monday that it posted the position on Friday “as part of our ongoing operational readiness and succession planning.”
The agency did not provide a responsive statement as to what changed between Leonard’s testimony Thursday and Friday when the job was posted.
“The agency wants to ensure it is positioned for success in the future,” the agency’s statement said. “We remain committed to making staffing decisions only when they are fully aligned with both fiscal priorities and operational needs.”
Rep. T.J. Marti, R-Broken Arrow, who was among the legislators who questioned Leonard’s qualifications, said Monday that hadn’t heard that the agency had launched a search for a new CFO, but said it’s “great news.”
“I think they need to launch a search for a CFO, somebody that can dig deep into the numbers and that is trained for the position,” Marti said. “It sounded like they were going to name Skip the CFO, and I’m not so sure that that’s something that many of us in here would be on board with.”

Assistant coach Justin Parker will serve as interim head coach for the remainder of the season.
Mississippi State made the announcement in a press release Monday afternoon. 
“A change in leadership is what is best for the future of Mississippi State baseball,” State athletic director Zac Selmon said. “We have not consistently met the standard of success that our university, fans and student-athletes expect and deserve. I want to thank Coach Lemonis for his work and the time he gave to our program, including a national championship in 2021. We appreciate his efforts and wish him and his family all the best moving forward.”
A national search is underway to identify the program’s next head coach, Selmon said.
“In a team meeting moments ago, I expressed to our student-athletes the confidence we have in their abilities and the potential they have for the remainder of the season,” Selmon said. “I encouraged them to compete with pride, resilience, and intensity. With the hard work, preparation, and talent already within this group, we are committed to putting them in the best position to finish the season competing at the highest level.
“Mississippi State is the premier job in college baseball. The tradition, the facilities, the NIL offerings and the fan base are all second to none. Dudy Noble Field is the best environment in the sport, period.”
The current Bulldogs have a 25-19 record and are 7-14 in the SEC. Most recently, the Bulldogs lost two of three weekend games to Auburn, the nation’s 11th-ranked team. State has lost its last two SEC series and five of seven this season. The Bulldogs are currently No. 45 in the nation in ratings percentage index (RPI) and are in danger of not making the NCAA Tournament for the third time in four years.
Lemonis’ MSU teams won 232 games and lost 135 in his six-plus seasons. Hired by former MSU baseball coach and athletic director John Cohen from Indiana, Lemonis has an overall coaching record of 373-226-2.
“This program is built for success,” Selmon said. “Our history proves it, and our future demands it. We are one of only four programs in NCAA history to reach the College World Series in six consecutive decades. With 40 NCAA Tournament appearances, 12 trips to Omaha, 11 SEC regular season titles, and a national championship, our program has always been a national contender. That is the bar. We’re going to find a leader who will embrace that, elevate our program and compete for championships.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/06184656/AP_21182116611315-scaled.jpg,,,2025-04-28 17:11:49.057745

The landfill is expected to reach capacity in 2028. (Photo by Claire Sullivan/New Hampshire Bulletin)As the state’s largest landfill nears capacity amid concerns about the environmental impact of possible expansion, two legislators that represent its neighboring communities are seeking greater legislative oversight for the state-owned Juniper Ridge Landfill.
The Legislature’s Environment and Natural Resources Committee held a public hearing Monday for a series of bills related to waste management, including two that seek to address and increase oversight of future use of the landfill, which straddles Old Town and Alton. The facility is owned by the state through the Bureau of General Services, which has an operating contract with NEWSME Landfill Operations, a subsidiary of the waste management company Casella. 
When Rep. Jim Dill (D-Old Town) knocked on doors before last November’s election, one of the biggest complaints he heard from residents was the poor quality of the garbage bags they must purchase to dispose of their trash. That’s why LD 1782 would require the operator of a state-owned landfill to provide free disposal of household waste for the local residents. 
However, Dill explained that his bill also seeks to address what he described as the “crisis” of the landfill soon reaching capacity by imposing new fees on the operator and requiring state agencies to develop a solid waste management plan that addresses the issues associated with Juniper Ridge. 
The committee also heard bills seeking to increase recycling of construction materials, reduce the volume of solid waste and better manage waste from wastewater treatment plants. 
The Departments of Environmental Protection and Administrative and Financial Services opposed Dill’s proposal. Since the DEP is already required to submit a waste generation and disposal capacity report in January, the department argued the additional reporting requirements in the bill would be burdensome. 
Just over half of Maine’s landfill waste ends up in Juniper Ridge, which is expected to reach capacity in 2028. The state has signaled its support for expanding the facility despite objections from environmental advocates, the local community and the Penobscot Nation, whose reservation sits just five miles from the landfill.
The Bureau of General Services has not submitted an application to expand the landfill, but Deputy Commissioner Anya Trundy said during the hearing it intends to. However, the site expansion is separate from an extension of the current 30-year operator agreement that expires in 2034. 
Trundy said that building out the landfill to its maximum capacity should allow it to operate until 2040. That is why the expanded capacity would also necessitate extending the contract with Casella so that both line up with the 2040 timeline. 
The committee also heard a bill from Sen. Mike Tipping (D-Penobscot) that, if passed, would shape the process of extending that contract. While the executive branch has so far handled the negotiations, LD 1349 would require approval from two-thirds of the Legislature for contract or contract renewal to operate Juniper Ridge. 
Maine opens door for landfill expansion despite community objections

Though the Department of Administrative and Financial Services would normally advocate for contracts to go out to bid, Trundy said doing so could sever the indemnification clause in the existing contract. Rather than giving Casella a “sweetheart deal,” Trundy said continuing the agreement holds them accountable to that clause that would leave them responsible for financial and environmental liability down the road. 
Committee members also voiced concern that requiring two-thirds support from the Legislature would be insurmountable; however, environmental organizations who testified in support of the bill were open to changing that to a simple majority because they have concerns over Casella’s operation of the landfill and welcomed more opportunity for public input. 
Maulian Bryant, executive director for the Wabanaki Alliance, spoke in support of LD 1349 over similar dissatisfaction with the landfill’s management. She said changes to air and water quality that can be affected by the landfill isn’t communicated to neighbors who can often smell the facility from their front yards. 
However, the Maine State Chamber of Commerce opposed the bill, saying that it could politicize the contract process and deter companies from doing business with the state.  
Tipping put forward another proposal that was heard Monday seeking to address forever chemicals from landfill leachate entering groundwater and surface waters. 
The legislation would require entities discharging wastewater to annually report to the DEP the origin, volume and final disposition of solid waste leachate, sometimes referred to as “trash juice.” It would also prohibit discharging any wastewater containing leachate from a solid waste landfill unless the discharge satisfies department limits to perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, and require third-party testing of leachate for PFAS.
Last session, the Legislature passed a bill that would have required Casella to treat PFAS in a way that ensures levels don’t exceed established drinking water standards, but the measure was vetoed by Gov. Janet Mills. The DEP later mandated that Casella install a department-approved system for treating landfill leachate for PFAS before expanding operations.

One person died at a Casper home Monday after police received a report of an armed burglar. Court files reviewed by WyoFile show she was listed as a legal resident of the house.
The post Woman killed when Casper police responded to burglary report lived at the home, court documents show appeared first on WyoFile .","A woman killed Monday morning during an encounter with police responding to a burglary report at a Casper residence is listed in court documents as living in the home.
Police have declined to say if the person killed was a criminal suspect or the resident of the house, but court records examined by WyoFile indicate the woman, 37-year-old Jody Cobia, legally resided at the home.
Casper police officers responded to the 1600 block of South McKinley Street, a residential neighborhood in the central part of the city, around 12:36 a.m. Monday. They were responding to a report of an armed burglar in the residence, according to a police statement. 
The officers “made contact with a subject armed with a firearm,” shots were fired and the woman was then taken to the hospital, where doctors declared her dead, the statement said. 
The statement is not explicit about whether officers shot Cobia. “During the encounter, shots were fired,” it reads.

A department official declined to provide WyoFile with additional information Monday morning, including whether the person who was shot lived at the home, citing the early stages of the investigation. 
Early Monday afternoon, the Natrona County Coroners’ Office identified the dead woman as Cobia. Court records reviewed by WyoFile indicate she had sole legal possession of the home as part of a protection order granted in August, though tax records put the home in her husband’s name.
According to the filings, Cobia was the mother of three children and was in the early stages of a divorce from her husband. Court records indicate Cobia petitioned a judge for, and received, a protection order from her husband in August. 
That protection order, reviewed by WyoFile, granted Cobia sole possession of the house, 1623 S. McKinley Street, until August of this year. Multiple court documents list the McKinley Street address as her residence.
Mid-morning Monday, a WyoFile journalist observed that the door of 1623 S. McKinley street remained slightly open, though there was no other evidence of an active crime scene investigation nearly 12 hours after the shooting. 
On Monday, Casper Police Capt. Jeremy Tremel declined to say whether the person shot was the home resident or a burglary suspect, or whether there was a burglary suspect on the scene. “All I can tell you right now is we responded to a report of a suspected burglary,” he said.
He did not immediately respond to a second request for comment after the coroner published its identification. 
Cobia’s husband, Aren Cobia, indicated he was a resident of the home in a divorce petition filed earlier this month. But the court record also indicates Jody Cobia was served with the divorce petition, in person, at the South McKinley Street address on April 15. 
Reached briefly by WyoFile, Aren Cobia asked for time to grieve Jody Cobia’s death and declined to otherwise comment. Aren Cobia told a reporter from another news outlet, Cowboy State Daily, that there was no burglar in the home and police had killed his wife. 
The Wyoming Division of Criminal Investigation will investigate the shooting. After police shootings, it’s typical for DCI to conduct an investigation and then provide the findings of that review to an elected county attorney. The prosecutor then decides whether or not to charge officers with any crimes. Prosecutors, in some cases, refer that decision to an outside county attorney to bring an additional level of independence to the investigation.
The officers involved in the shooting are now on administrative leave, according to the department’s news release. 
Officials did not describe the person shot as a suspect in that news release, only as a “subject armed with a firearm.” Because of the ambiguity of the official statement, commenters on social media, as well as two Wyoming news outlets, described the deceased as a criminal suspect.
“Suspected burglar dead in Casper Police shooting,” was the headline on an initial Cowboy State Daily story that was online throughout the morning Monday. By the early afternoon, the news site had updated that headline to “One dead in officer-involved shooting during Casper burglary response,” and the site had issued a correction. 
“Suspect dead after Casper police respond to armed burglary,” Casper-news site Oil City News reported. 
On Facebook, a large number of commenters commended the officers who responded to the home and in several instances suggested a burglary suspect deserved to be killed. “Finally a story with a happy ending,” one commenter wrote. “Clearly he valued their stuff more than his life and got what he deserved,” wrote another.

  Sen. Tammy Baldwin (Wisconsin Examiner, 2024 photo)
The letter, led by Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin and two colleagues,  follows a funding halt in late January and early February; the closure of Head Start regional offices in April and the termination of those offices’ employees; and a subsequent report that the program has reduced payments in this first half of 2025 compared with a year ago.
“It is abundantly clear that these actions are part of a broader effort to ultimately eliminate the program altogether, as the Administration reportedly plans to do in its fiscal year 2026 budget proposal,” states the letter sent by Baldwin, Sens. Patty Murray (D-Washington) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont), and 39 other Senate members.
Head Start has already been appropriated $12.3 billion for 2025 — the same amount as in 2024 — and has a formula for allocating funds, the senators wrote, leaving “no justifiable reason” for funding delays, while there has been no explanation from the administration.
Earlier in April it was reported the Trump administration’s 2026 budget proposal included no funding for Head Start. The senators’ letter notes that the Office of Management and Budget directed the Department of Health and Human Services to set aside funds from the 2025 budget “to close out the program” in budget documents leaked 10 days ago.
“If this explains any of the delay in awarding fiscal year 2025 funding, we want to be clear, no funds were provided in fiscal year 2025 to ‘close out the program,’ and it would be wholly unacceptable and likely illegal if the Department tries to carry out this directive,” the senators wrote.
The letter is directed at U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
“You promised ‘radical transparency’ as Secretary, yet it is unclear how these actions will improve Head Start programs, and you and your staff refuse to respond to basic inquiries and requests for information,” the senators wrote.
The letter cites additional Trump administration actions involving the program over the last three months.
The federal Office of Head Start has told local programs that funding would not be approved for “training and technical assistance or other program expenditures that promote or take part in diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives,” but the agency hasn’t provided any guidance “for what would be considered ‘DEI,’” the letter states.
Nevertheless, the senators add, that could conflict with requirements for the program under federal law, such as one that programs provide appropriate instruction for English learners.
Programs submitting documentation for payment of expenses that they have incurred and are authorized under their federal grants are now being asked to provide additional justification, which the letter states “creates an illusion of improving oversight but only serves to add unnecessary red tape. “
The five-page letter asks Kennedy to answer a series of questions, including whether HHS will reverse the regional office closures and reinstate fired Head Start personnel, when Head Start agencies will receive confirmation that they can access their additional grant installments for the year and whether the administration will distribute all of Head Start’s funds for the 2025 fiscal year “as required by the Head Start Act.”

Ben Koppelman, R-West Fargo, speaks about term limits during a committee hearing on Jan. 23, 2025. (Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)A bill clarifying the state date for North Dakota’s term limits law failed in the House on a 61-28 vote Monday.
The bill was debated over multiple conference committee meetings in recent days. The Senate version contained a Jan. 1, 2023 start date for the term limits, while the House version advanced a Nov. 7, 2022 start date.
North Dakota voters in 2022 approved a ballot measure that limits lawmakers to serving up to eight years in each chamber.
Previously, Rep. Ben Koppelman, R-West Fargo, chief sponsor of House Bill 1300, said the bill was to provide clarity on the start date for term limits approved by the voters. 
Term limits bill reconsidered, headed to North Dakota conference committee

Rep. Steve Vetter, R-Grand Forks, said the House reconsidered its actions after previously voting against the bill and sent the measure to a conference committee to see if senators would agree to the House’s start date.
“It didn’t look like we kept our position, so I’d ask for a red vote,” Vetter said before voting against the bill. 
The failure of the bill in the House leaves Senate Resolution 4008, which passed both chambers of the Legislature, as the only term limit resolution passed by lawmakers during the 2025 session. If approved by the Secretary of State’s Office as a valid resolution it would go to the voters as a ballot measure during the 2026 general election.
The resolution would allow lawmakers to serve four terms, up to 16 years, in a single legislative chamber. It also clarifies that a partial term does not count against the limit.

Shri Thanedar speaks at his election night party in Detroit on Aug. 6, 2024 (Photo by Ken Coleman)Michigan Congressman Shri Thanedar (D-Detroit) on Monday brought seven articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump, saying the president has “repeatedly demonstrated that he is unfit to serve,” and “represents a clear and present danger to our nation’s constitution and our democracy.”
In a statement from Thanedar’s office, he pointed to “sweeping abuse of power, flagrant violations of the Constitution and acts of tyranny that undermine American democracy and threaten the rule of law” as his reasons for introducing the charges.
“[Trump’s] unlawful actions have subverted the justice system, violated the separation of powers, and placed personal power and self-interest above public service. We cannot wait for more damage to be done. Congress must act,” Thanedar said.
Each article alleges a separate violation of the Constitution, with Thanedar’s office offering the following breakdown of his resolution:

 Obstruction of Justice and Abuse of Executive Power: Including denial of due process, unlawful deportations, defiance of court orders, and misuse of the Department of Justice.
Usurpation of Appropriations Power: For dismantling congressionally established agencies and impounding federal funds.
Abuse of Trade Powers and International Aggression: Including imposing economically damaging tariffs and threatening military invasion against sovereign nations.
Violation of First Amendment Rights: Through retaliatory actions against critics, media and attorneys exercising constitutionally protected speech.
Creation of an Unlawful Office: By establishing the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and unlawfully empowering Elon Musk to unilaterally violate the Constitution.
Bribery and Corruption: Involving dismissing criminal cases, soliciting foreign emoluments, and extortionate settlements for personal and political gain.
Tyrannical Overreach: Seeking to consolidate unchecked power, erode civil liberties, and defy constitutional limits on presidential authority.

“This is not about partisanship. It’s about protecting our democracy and ensuring that no one, not even a President, is above the law,” Thanedar said in a statement.
Thanedar’s effort is likely to face an uphill battle in the House, where Republicans hold a seven seat majority. The Senate, which conducts the trial should the resolution receive a majority of votes in the House, is also held by Republicans, with a two-thirds vote needed in order to convict the president.
Thanedar’s introduction of the articles comes the same day that his second primary opponent, state Rep. Donavan McKinney (D-Detroit), announced he would seek his 13th District seat in the 2026 primary.

McHENRY — John Gerend, a Vietnam War veteran from Lake Villa, Illinois, was exposed to Agent Orange while on duty. Suffering from diseases associated with exposure to the toxic chemical, he said he still considers himself fortunate.

“I've had some issues with it — diabetes, some heart issues and so on — but there are many more that have suffered a lot more than I have and need the care a lot more than I do,” said Gerend, 77. “It's very upsetting to think that the people who have served their country and have lost limbs or mental health might now lose the benefits, all the support, both for mental health and physical health, and the doctors and medications available.”

“I am mad about what’s going on. I’m angry,” he added.

A retired U.S. Army first lieutenant, Gerend was among the 200 people who gathered outside the McHenry Veterans Affairs clinic Sunday to protest the Trump administration’s plans to slash the agency’s workforce, sparking fears among veterans over the prospect of worsening care and growing unemployment.

Across Illinois, protests have been gaining strength since the proposed cuts were revealed. They range from veterans protesting last month at the Capitol in Springfield to demonstrations by nurses and staff at the Jesse Brown VA Medical Center in Chicago, who are concerned about the dangers to proper care and risk for veterans.

In an internal memo to senior agency leaders on March 4, VA chief of staff Christopher Syrek said the agency's initial goal was “to return to our 2019-end strength numbers of 399,957 employees.” VA Secretary Doug Collins later confirmed the department’s target is to fire roughly 80,000 employees later this year, but he insisted the agency would strive for more efficiency while not cutting benefits and care to the 9 million veterans it serves. According to the Pew Research Center, a quarter of the workers at the Department of Veterans Affairs are themselves veterans.

The move comes after the VA expanded during the Biden administration, fueled by the passing of legislation like the 2022 Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics, PACT, Act, expanding medical benefits for veterans who were exposed to toxins from burn pits of trash on military bases.

“I'm getting later in my years, so it's gonna affect some younger folks possibly more than me, so I'm more afraid for them than I am for myself,” said Gerend, who has used VA services for 12 years.

VA workers in distress

The VA attempted to lay off at least 2,400 probationary employees in February. According to the department,  those in “mission-critical” positions — including Veterans Crisis Line responders — were not affected. Yet, several crisis line staffers received a notice, according to union leaders.

Some of the department’s Illinois workers were axed, too, and U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth said the ensuing “chaos” had left the VA less efficient with longer wait times and more backlogs in service.

“I was almost finished with my two-year-long probationary period when I received an email saying I was terminated because of my performance effective that day, (Feb. 24),” said one Illinois-based VA employee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. “I had outstanding performance reviews, but the fact that they labeled it as a performance-based solution meant that I couldn't get unemployment (benefits).”

The employee was rehired in March after a federal judge ordered the Trump administration to reinstate the fired probationary employees at several departments, including the VA.

In April, however, the Supreme Court halted the federal judge's ruling, allowing the federal government to keep thousands of probationary federal employees it attempted to fire off the payroll while lower courts weigh whether the downsizing efforts are legal.

“Everybody is nervous and on edge,” the employee said. “Their jobs are not secure. Nobody's jobs are secure.”

With the threat of more cuts looming, some Illinois facilities have already started laying people off, causing health care workers more distress.

Heather Fallon, a VA nurse in the Chicago area, said one of her colleagues returned to the facility as a patient after learning that their job “was being eliminated.”

“The person had a conversation with family over dinner about how they are going to pay for their daughter’s college,” she recalled. “The patient ended up developing some pain related to the stress, coming to the emergency department and being admitted because of the health problems that were precipitated by the stress that that person was under.”

“That really affected our staff quite a lot,” Fallon added.

Some fear that the upcoming mass layoffs, especially in smaller towns across rural Illinois, are going to negatively impact populations at large.

“Danville is a small town. It consists of about 29,000 people, and if we lose 400 good-paying government jobs, that will devastate our economy here,” said Mickensy Ellis-White, a veteran of the Iraq War from Vermilion County and chair of the Vermilion County Democratic Party. “Where are those people going to go to get new jobs? That's going to negatively affect all of us.”

The level of care diminishes 

Even before the cuts were announced by the Trump administration, it had been difficult for health facilities within the VA system to maintain enough staff and resources, like beds, available. According to the 2024 VA Office of Inspector General report, 86% of all Veteran Health Administration medical facilities reported severe staffing shortages of medical officers, whereas 82% reported severe shortages of nurses.

The mass slashes to the department’s workforce will only worsen the preexisting lack of personnel, according to Fallon, who said she knows of several nurses who have already submitted job applications to other places in the private sector as the threat of the layoffs looms. “A friend of mine at the St. Louis VA had her care appointment canceled because they didn't have a provider, and that's a direct result of the cuts,” said Jessica Motsinger, a disabled U.S. Navy veteran living 12 miles east of St Louis in the Metro East. “It really is devastating, and if it hasn't really affected somebody, it will very shortly.”

This is not an isolated incident.

“We had a patient yesterday who needed services that we didn't have open beds at our facility. The solution was that they were going to send him to a different facility, more than an hour away, and he was very upset about that,” Fallon said. “He wasn't able to go home to get his belongings, and he didn't feel like his belongings were safe where they were, and his family wouldn't be able to visit him there, so he would be very isolated.”

According to the official data, 247,140 Illinoisians were enrolled in the VA health care system in fiscal year 2023, and the state’s veteran medical facilities provided services to 162,366 unique patients. Although the impacts of the layoffs are likely to extend throughout the state, the cuts would hit northeastern Illinois the hardest, the counties with the highest percentage of veteran population.

Many veterans are fearful of what is to come — but also angry.

“They think that, since we use the word ‘disabled,’ somehow we're receiving benefits that we're not entitled to,” Motsinger said. “But people don't get this just because we somehow scammed somebody or paid something, we've totally earned this. We raised our hand; we offered to sacrifice our lives.”

“I'm sorry America decided to have war for over 20 years. Now you have veterans, an entire generation that you owe us to care for us, not asking for anything other than what we've earned,” she said.

in Miami. (Photo courtesy of Alvaro Perpuly with U.S. Rep. Wilson's office)U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement added a semi-permanent structure to house migrants at a detention center in Miami following reports of overcrowding.
An ICE spokesperson acknowledged the structure on Monday, after South Florida U.S. Rep. Frederica Wilson, a Democrat, said she saw a “tent city” at the Krome North Service Processing Center during her visit Thursday. Wilson decided to visit the detention facility after hearing that people had to sleep on concrete floors.
“The new multi-use facility is a climate-controlled structure with beds, showers and bathrooms to house detainees,” ICE public affairs officer Nestor Yglesias wrote to the Florida Phoenix. “The facility complies with detention standards in accordance with ICE policy. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement does not provide population or capacity numbers due to operational tempo and security concerns.”
Yglesias described the structure as hard-sided but didn’t provide information about the number of beds or whether ICE had added other semi-permanent buildings in other detention centers in the state.

After her visit to Krome, Wilson told reporters that she had seen a “tent city” that she estimated could house 400 people and that officials told her had been built in 14 days. The ICE spokesperson declined to confirm how long it took to build the structure. Wilson also said she hadn’t seen overcrowding that immigrant rights groups, detainees, and attorneys have reported.
“This is not my first rodeo. I was down at Homestead when the children were there, and I’ve been to Krome before, and I’ve been to prisons all across Florida, especially female prisons,” Wilson said. “So, I know what they do. They take them on a field trip, so you won’t see who is actually in there, but they did admit that they are building a tent city.”
Juan Agudelo, field office director for ICE in Miami, said some detention centers experienced temporary overcrowding but that conditions Wilson saw in Krome were not staged.
“What Congresswoman Wilson saw today is what ICE does on a daily basis,” Agudelo said in a statement. “Ensuring the safety, security, and well-being of individuals in our custody is a top priority at ICE.”
A four-day large-scale operation in which federal authorities and local police claimed they had arrested nearly 800 people subject to deportation could lead to increased population numbers at Krome.

Trump has invoked the centuries-old law for just the fourth time in U.S. history in an attempt to expedite the removals of hundreds of people […],"A view of the Alfred A. Arraj U.S. Courthouse in downtown Denver on May 30, 2023. (Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)President Donald Trump’s administration is asking a panel of appellate judges to overturn a lower court’s order temporarily blocking the deportation of detainees in Colorado under the Alien Enemies Act.
Trump has invoked the centuries-old law for just the fourth time in U.S. history in an attempt to expedite the removals of hundreds of people the administration claims are part of an “invasion” of the United States by the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. It was used last month to send 137 detainees to a brutal maximum-security prison in El Salvador before multiple federal courts, including one in Colorado, ordered a halt to such removals over due process concerns.
U.S. District Court Judge Charlotte Sweeney’s temporary restraining order against Alien Enemies Act removals from Colorado is set to remain in effect until at least May 6, but Trump’s Department of Justice promptly appealed Sweeney’s ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit.

The government has asked the three-judge panel hearing the appeal — Judges Harris L. Hartz, Gregory Alan Phillips and Joel M. Carson — to rule on its motion to overturn Sweeney’s TRO by no later than Tuesday afternoon, arguing that the order’s “impositions interfere with the President’s core authority to protect the nation.”
The case, D.B.U. v. Trump, originated earlier this month as a petition for habeas corpus and proposed class action by lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union, on behalf of two Venezuelan nationals held at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Aurora. The plaintiffs, who are identified by their initials, D.B.U. and R.M.M., say they have been falsely identified as Tren de Aragua members by the Trump administration and fear imminent deportation to the CECOT facility, criticized by human rights groups for its crowded and abusive conditions.
Sweeney’s order also provisionally certified the class that the two plaintiffs seek to represent, blocking the removal of “all noncitizens in custody in the District of Colorado who were, are, or will be subject to” Trump’s March 14 proclamation invoking the Alien Enemies Act. ACLU attorneys estimate that could apply to more than 100 detainees held at the Aurora detention center.
About 90% of the deportees sent to CECOT last month had no criminal record, according to Bloomberg. At least one, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, was removed as a result of an “administrative error,” while advocates, attorneys and family members for other deportees say that they were falsely identified as TdA members because of tattoos honoring family members or their favorite soccer team. Trump has openly floated plans to send American citizens to CECOT next.
DOJ attorneys continued to argue in a Court of Appeals filing Sunday that the courts lack jurisdiction to hear the case because the “Petitioners have not been designated as alien enemies under the AEA.” At the same time, they rejected widespread due process concerns and defended the administration’s practice of providing as little as 12 hours’ notice to detainees to indicate they wish to contest their designation as alien enemies.
“The AEA permits the Executive enormous discretion to establish the conditions and processes the Executive will use to implement a Presidential Proclamation, and does not impose any particular notice time period,” the DOJ’s filing says.
Sweeney’s order requires ICE to provide at least 21 days’ notice, written in a language the detainee understands. But Trump’s DOJ argues that providing an English-language form that is “explained orally in another language, if necessary,” is sufficient.
In a response to the DOJ’s appeal, attorneys for D.B.U. and R.M.M. again accused the Trump administration of failing to comply with a Supreme Court opinion earlier this month requiring greater due process for AEA designees.
“The Supreme Court made unequivocally clear that individuals designated under the AEA are entitled to ‘due process’ and ‘notice and opportunity to be heard,’” the plaintiffs’ attorneys wrote. “In short, 12 hours would be unreasonable under any circumstances but it is especially unreasonable here given the nature of the class and the consequences of ending up in a Salvadoran prison for the rest of their lives.”

In November 2020, a federal grand jury indicted Chelsea Gless, then 31, of Princeton, Iowa, on multiple counts of mail fraud. Prosecutors alleged Gless, as part-owner and manager of Royal Metals Group, offered prospective clients an opportunity to purchase and sell precious metals, such as gold and silver, through the company for an agreed-upon fee.
Gless pleaded guilty to one count of felony mail fraud, punishable by up to 20 years of imprisonment, and six other charges were dropped. She was sentenced to three years in prison, plus three years of supervised release, and ordered to pay $2,935,906 in restitution.
Gless was released from prison in November 2023, and in 2024 was awarded an associate’s degree in nursing from Scott Community College.
In October 2024, she applied for an Iowa registered nurse’s license and was denied on the basis of her felony conviction. She appealed that decision and requested a hearing. Board records indicate the hearing was scheduled for April 10 — but on that day, Gless and the board entered into consent agreement in which the board agreed to issue Gless a license to work in Iowa as a registered nurse, subject to monitoring and three years of probationary status.
As part of that agreement, board has barred Gless from working in any setting, such as a nursing home, “where patients are particularly vulnerable to exploitation,” and where she might have access to patients’ financial information.
In her criminal case, prosecutors alleged that between May 2014 and February 2018, Gless devised and carried out a scheme to defraud clients of Royal Metals Group, in part by using their money to make personal credit card payments.
When clients inquired as to the status of payments they were owed, or the delivery of precious metals they had purchased, Gless allegedly sent them falsified tracking numbers for deliveries, sent them unsigned checks or checks made out for the wrong amount, or sent them checks that later bounced due to insufficient funds, court records show.
At least 71 clients were defrauded a total of more than $2.9 million, prosecutors claimed. Assistant U.S. Attorney Rachel J. Scherle told the court Gless’ conduct was “financially and emotionally devastating” to the victims.
“Chelsea Gless was running the business, and she was in charge,” Scherle said. “Chelsea Gless had the power to stop the manipulation, but she continued to lie and lie over and over again until there were no more metals or money – leaving the victims high and dry.”
Court records indicate one of Gless’ victims lost their entire retirement savings of $260,326, telling prosecutors, “I am a very quiet, non-confrontational person. Just the thought of contacting the FBI was so stressful to me that my daughter had to step in and do the contact for me.”
Gless’ attorneys characterized her as a pawn in the business which was initiated by her husband, Richard Gless, who was 20 years older than Chelsea. Richard Gless died in 2012, before the alleged fraud occurred. Court records indicate that as of January 2025, Gless had paid $14,201 toward restitution, leaving $2,921,391 still owed.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/BON-1024x459.jpg,,,2025-04-28 17:11:49.057745

Ray Holmberg, left, served 45 years in the North Dakota Legislature. Wayne Stenehjem, right, served as attorney general for 22 years. The two Republicans were close associates who began their political careers at the same time. (Photos provided by Sherburne (Minn.) County Jail, Office of Attorney General)Newly released call logs show the late Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem communicated with former Sen. Ray Holmberg as the lawmaker was being investigated for sex crimes, including calls the day Stenehjem sat for a law enforcement interview.
Yet Stenehjem only told law enforcement about one phone conversation with Holmberg, according to Attorney General Drew Wrigley, who succeeded Stenehjem after his January 2022 death.
“That’s a pretty troubling log,” Wrigley said late Friday after his office made the call logs public. “The attorney general was asked about contacts with Ray Holmberg. He said that he had spoken to him once, and that was not accurate.”
There also is evidence that Stenehjem and the state Bureau of Criminal Investigation knew years earlier about a sexual assault allegation against Holmberg but no criminal charges resulted from that report.
Holmberg was sentenced late last month to 10 years in federal prison for traveling out of the country with the intent to pay for sex with underage boys. That conviction largely resulted from a federal investigation that began in 2021.
Holmberg sexually exploited others, including people in North Dakota, witnesses say in court

But a man who spoke at the March 26 sentencing hearing came forward to the FBI years earlier to report sexual exploitation by Holmberg.  
Handwritten notes in a former Grand Forks prosecutor’s file obtained by the North Dakota Monitor indicate Stenehjem knew in 2015 about that report.
David Jones, former Grand Forks County state’s attorney, wrote in an Aug. 31, 2015, note:  “A.G. office doesn’t want T.F. involved at all. (Wayne decision.)”
Jones said he used the initials T.F. as shorthand for a multi-jurisdictional law enforcement task force. The state BCI, within the attorney general’s office, is part of the task force.
Jones’ notes indicate that federal investigators were looking into reports of overseas trips. Jones said he did not talk to Stenehjem directly and does not know why he didn’t want the task force involved.
“If it’s a federal investigation, part of the thing is, we don’t want to step on their toes as they’re going forward with something,” Jones said. “So anything beyond that, it’d just be speculative on my part.”
Holmberg and Stenehjem were known to be friends, both beginning their time in public service in 1977 as Republican state legislators from Grand Forks. Stenehjem went on to become North Dakota’s longest-serving attorney general, and Holmberg spent 45 years in the Legislature, rising to the powerful role of Senate Appropriations chair.
Beth Stenehjem defended her husband in a statement to the North Dakota Monitor.
“It is nothing short of unfortunate that after the release of Wayne’s emails, text messages, and interview with the BCI, there remains misguided focus to find a connection between him and Mr. Holmberg’s criminal activity. As everything has shown, there is none,” she wrote. “This misguided effort is especially disappointing in the fact that Wayne is not here to defend himself against these baseless assumptions and accusations that are nothing but pure speculation.”
Call logs
Call logs show communications between Holmberg and Stenehjem in December 2021 and January 2022, including connections made on three dates. Holmberg called on Dec. 9, 2021, and they had a 43-second conversation. Holmberg left a 16-second voicemail on Dec. 19, 2021, which law enforcement did not recover, records show. Holmberg called Jan. 10, 2022, and they talked for 11 minutes, the logs show.
A report also shows that federal prosecutors asked law enforcement to compare what messaging apps Holmberg and Stenehjem had on their cellphones that could be used for communication. Both had WhatsApp, Viber, Facebook Messenger and others, documents show. 
The logs show 11 phone text messages between Holmberg and Stenehjem during December 2021, but not about the investigation. The texts primarily discussed state politics, including who was going to be appointed tax commissioner.
Stenehjem did not report the communications to law enforcement, Wrigley said. 
“You’re talking to a guy who is the subject of a very serious investigation,” Wrigley said. “That you’re talking to him at all is an outrage, and on top of it you’re not telling law enforcement that ‘he continues to call me, I talked to him, and he said the following things.’”
Former ND Sen. Ray Holmberg sentenced to 10 years in prison for sex crime

Stenehjem, who oversaw the BCI, had not recused himself from the Holmberg case, according to Wrigley.
On Nov. 17, 2021, after law enforcement seized Holmberg’s phone and electronic devices while executing a search warrant at his home, Holmberg asked for Stenehjem’s phone number, Dan Casetta, a special agent with Homeland Security Investigations, said during Holmberg’s sentencing hearing.
Stenehjem received two calls that day from a number identified in his contacts as “Holmberg Burner Phone,” records show. Both calls were rejected and Holmberg left one voicemail, records show.
Holmberg told Stenehjem in the voicemail that he was in “big trouble,” Casetta testified. Holmberg also tried calling Stenehjem at his office that day and left a message with an assistant. Stenehjem did share that voicemail with law enforcement at the time.
On Dec. 1, 2021, Stenehjem was interviewed by Homeland Security Investigations about the November voicemail, records show. 
That same day, call logs show five phone calls between Stenehjem and Holmberg, though the logs do not indicate they spoke. The documents show Stenehjem calling Holmberg once but the call was not answered. Holmberg initiated the other four calls, which were all rejected, documents show. Holmberg left a 14-second voicemail, which law enforcement did not recover, records show.
Holmberg also texted “Hi from Ray” on the day of the former attorney general’s interview with law enforcement, but the records do not indicate Stenehjem responded.
A report detailing the law enforcement interview with Stenehjem has not yet been made public. 
Wrigley said he learned from law enforcement that Stenehjem told investigators about one phone conversation he had with Holmberg. When asked what Holmberg said about the search warrant, Stenehjem said it never came up and the conversation had only been about politics, according to Wrigley.
When investigators later reviewed Stenehjem’s phone data, they discovered that the voicemails from Holmberg had been deleted, including the one from the day of the search warrant, Wrigley said.
“Nobody can understand why anybody, let alone an attorney general, would delete evidence that has been collected in the furtherance of a criminal investigation,” Wrigley said. “But that’s what happened.”
Beth Stenehjem said her late husband dedicated decades to North Dakota in a career of public service.
“I am saddened by the current attorney general’s persistent campaign to malign Wayne’s legacy,” she said in a statement. “I’m proud of him, all he accomplished, and the integrity that Wayne brought to the ND Office of Attorney General.”
Mark Friese, Holmberg’s attorney, did not immediately respond to questions related to the call logs. Earlier this month, he declined to comment when asked about Holmberg’s connection to Stenehjem.
2015 report
Ahead of Holmberg’s sentencing, federal prosecutors revealed for the first time in a sentencing memorandum that a victim had come forward years earlier to report sexual exploitation. The man, who gave a victim impact statement at court, said “for reasons unknown to me” nothing ever came of his report. 
Mike Ness, a retired BCI agent, said in a statement he received a report from the FBI in 2015 or 2016 that a victim wanted to talk about sexual acts involving Holmberg, but the man wanted a letter of immunity.
Ness said he sent the information to the director of the BCI, which at the time was Dallas Carlson. Ness, who worked in the BCI’s Grand Forks office, said he also put the FBI in touch with a local state’s attorney.
Carlson said he does not remember whether the BCI received a report about Holmberg. 
“I’ve been racking my brain, and I just do not remember,” said Carlson, who is now the U.S. marshal for North Dakota. “Protocol at the time in a situation like this, it would have been ran through the attorney general.”
He added that sensitive cases were referred to the attorney general.
“I don’t recall a letter, to be quite honest, I do not recall a letter. And if there was a letter, which I don’t recall, it would have gone to Wayne,” Carlson said, referring to the former attorney general.
Former North Dakota lawmaker pleads guilty to traveling for sex with children

Jones, who was Grand Forks County state’s attorney at the time, kept handwritten notes about the information he received. A note dated July 29, 2015, identifies Holmberg as a suspect and indicates sexual assault allegations from the early 1990s in Grand Forks. The note mentions Holmberg’s role as a state senator and retired school counselor. Jones’ notes also indicate concerns about the statute of limitations.
The document also mentions that the man told investigators Holmberg is “not dealing with local boys” and was now going overseas. The note indicated that Holmberg’s travel was being tracked by the FBI.
Another note in the file indicates the FBI found the man’s report to be credible. “High probability he’s telling the truth,” the note says.
Jones worked with an assistant attorney general on a letter of immunity for the man. The man, who spoke during the sentencing hearing, said he took money from Holmberg at times in exchange for his silence. The North Dakota Monitor does not identify victims of sex crimes.
Acting U.S. Attorney Jennifer Klemetsrud Puhl said she looked into the man’s report but did not determine that a federal offense occurred, so she was unable to pursue it. 
At the time, she had a conversation with a BCI agent who told her the case had been referred to South Dakota for investigation, Klemetsrud Puhl said.
When Wrigley became attorney general, he said he also was told that the 2015 report about Holmberg had been referred to South Dakota for investigation.
But a spokesperson for the agency in the neighboring state that would have handled the referral — the South Dakota Division of Criminal Investigation — told the North Dakota Monitor the agency has no record of such a request.
Jones said his role was primarily to assist with the letter of immunity and he didn’t receive any additional law enforcement reports about Holmberg.
“I assumed that they were going to do their investigation and move it along, which obviously they did,” Jones said.
Child sex tourism fuels demand for human trafficking, expert says

Ness said the BCI was not asked to investigate. He said he later learned from a county official that the statute of limitations had expired.
But one allegation the man told the FBI involved a sexual assault that occurred in Bismarck in 2012, according to the prosecutors’ sentencing memo. It’s unclear if this information was shared with local authorities. Jones’ notes only mention the 1990s allegations.
A spokesperson for the FBI said the agency doesn’t comment on how it handles complaints.
Burleigh County State’s Attorney Julie Lawyer said her office has no record of Holmberg as a suspect at any time. The Bismarck Police Department has no record of any investigations involving Holmberg, said Lt. Luke Gardiner.
Lori Cohen, an attorney who leads the organization known as PACT, or Protect All Children from Trafficking, said she’s seen a pattern in which predators are often given a pass, particularly if the predator is in a position of power.
“There is a tendency to protect the predator rather than the victim, and that then allows the predator to continue to harm other victims,” Cohen said. “I think this conviction sends a message that it has to stop, but we need to stop it earlier. We need to stop it before more children are harmed.”
Klemetsrud Puhl said without the man’s early report about Holmberg, “it would have been very difficult to proceed” with the investigation that ultimately led to his federal conviction.
“He’s the first one that came forward and it was him affirmatively reporting to law enforcement about what happened at a time when nobody suspected anything,” she said.

(Dean Hanson/Albuquerque Journal)As an advocate for children in foster care and a former foster parent myself, I was heartened to see lawmakers prioritize reforms to the state’s Children, Youth, and Families Department (CYFD) during the recent legislative session, and grateful to see several critical reforms signed into law. These new laws will help bring much needed transparency, accountability, and oversight to the troubled agency, so it can better serve New Mexico’s kids and their families. 
But I am deeply troubled that Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham line-item vetoed crucial funding for one of these important reforms: the Office of the Child Advocate, a new, independent office that will oversee child well-being in the state.
Earlier this year, the governor pleasantly surprised me by acknowledging the need for significant change at CYFD in her State of the State speech. For several years now, her administration has resisted calls from advocates like me, members of the public, and lawmakers for greater oversight of the agency. I felt like maybe our calls were finally being heard. 
Since then, however, her words and actions tell a different story. While the governor signed the legislation creating this office, House Bill 5, she wrote a poison pen message as she did so, accusing those who championed the bill of pursuing a “vendetta” against her and attempting to “intimidate” CYFD staff. She even told a reporter that she was concerned the bill’s supporters were using children and families “as some sort of political effort to harm or discredit another elected official.” 
The harms we should be worried about are not political. Too many children have already paid the price for CYFD’s mistakes and failures. Too many kids have been harmed or even killed on CYFD’s watch. Those of us who are pushing for change are doing it for one reason only: to better protect our kids. 
While I know that most of the agency’s frontline staff are hardworking individuals who are dedicating their careers to helping kids, the agency has long been plagued by a culture of secrecy and defensiveness. That culture has undermined CYFD’s ability to accomplish its mission and resulted in a loss of public trust that makes it harder to hire new caseworkers and recruit foster families. 
The Office of the Child Advocate will help restore that trust by giving kids a stronger voice within the system that is supposed to keep them safe. The Child Advocate will investigate and resolve complaints from children and families involved with CYFD and report on the agency’s progress and challenges to help us understand what else needs to change. 
Legislators allocated $1 million dollars in this year’s $10.8 billion dollar state budget to help the Office of the Child Advocate get off the ground. That’s a small price to pay to improve the well-being of the most vulnerable children in our state and help CYFD begin to earn back our trust. 
Thankfully, New Mexico’s Attorney General has indicated that the state’s Department of Justice can help make up for the vetoed funding. By vetoing this funding and taking efforts to reform CYFD personally, the governor has only proven the necessity of outside oversight.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CYFD-1024x522.jpeg,,,2025-04-28 17:11:49.057745

In a statement from Thanedar’s office, he pointed to “sweeping abuse of power, flagrant violations of the Constitution and acts of tyranny that undermine American democracy and threaten the rule of law” as his reasons for introducing the charges.

Obstruction of Justice and Abuse of Executive Power: Including denial of due process, unlawful deportations, defiance of court orders, and misuse of the Department of Justice.
Usurpation of Appropriations Power: For dismantling congressionally established agencies and impounding federal funds.
Abuse of Trade Powers and International Aggression: Including imposing economically damaging tariffs and threatening military invasion against sovereign nations.
Violation of First Amendment Rights: Through retaliatory actions against critics, media and attorneys exercising constitutionally protected speech.
Creation of an Unlawful Office: By establishing the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and unlawfully empowering Elon Musk to unilaterally violate the Constitution.
Bribery and Corruption: Involving dismissing criminal cases, soliciting foreign emoluments, and extortionate settlements for personal and political gain.
Tyrannical Overreach: Seeking to consolidate unchecked power, erode civil liberties, and defy constitutional limits on presidential authority.

“This is not about partisanship. It’s about protecting our democracy and ensuring that no one, not even a President, is above the law,” Thanedar said in a statement.
Thanedar’s effort is likely to face an uphill battle in the House, where Republicans hold a seven seat majority. The Senate, which conducts the trial should the resolution receive a majority of votes in the House, is also held by Republicans, with a two-thirds vote needed in order to convict the president.
Thanedar’s introduction of the articles comes the same day that his second primary opponent, state Rep. Donavan McKinney, D-Detroit, announced he would seek his 13th District seat in the 2026 primary.

(Photo by Kathie Obradovich/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Gov. Kim Reynolds’ lawsuit against the Des Moines Register is both unusual and dangerous for open government in Iowa.
Reynolds announced last week that she was filing suit seeking to stop the Register “from demanding production of the documents protected by executive privilege.”
That’s strange and alarming. Typically, a government agency – including this governor’s office – has simply denied requests for records they believed could be kept confidential (or just didn’t want to release). Until now, it’s been up to the requester, in this case, the Register, to decide whether it’s worthwhile to go to the time and expense of challenging a denial in court.

That was how it worked when Iowa Capital Dispatch and other media representatives and advocates sued the governor and her staff for withholding public records, in some cases as long as 18 months. The case went to the Iowa Supreme Court, which reinforced that the governor’s office is subject to Iowa’s Open Meetings and Records law and that indefinitely withholding public records was a violation.
In this new case, Reynolds is forcing the issue and dragging the Register into court over four emails and claiming “executive privilege” for refusing to release them.
The dispute relates to public statements Reynolds made about Lutheran Family Services, a not-for-profit organization engaged in refugee assistance.
Reynolds had been asked at a U.S. House Oversight Committee meeting whether she agreed with a former adviser to President Donald Trump, Michael Flynn, who claimed Lutheran Family Services was connected to a “money-laundering operation.”
Reynolds refused to respond directly at the hearing but days later, she said she “absolutely” did not agree with Flynn’s statement, according to the Register, and praised Lutheran Family Services for its charitable works.
According to the governor’s lawsuit, the Register requested emails to and from several of Reynolds’ advisers that referenced Lutheran Family Services. Reynolds’ office says it turned over more than 800 pages of documents, while withholding four documents that it said contained “candid, private advice and counsel from her most senior advisors.”
Because the governor did not send nor receive any of the emails, the Register argued that any executive privilege would not apply. The governor’s office claimed the Register’s position means that the governor “may not communicate with, or privately correspond with, her most senior advisors without those communications being open public records. That is not — and cannot be — the law.”
It’s not the law. There is absolutely nothing in Iowa law that prevents the governor from picking up the telephone or calling a meeting of her closest advisers and getting all the advice she might possibly want. But Iowa law does state that written communications among executive branch employees are public records. The governor’s office staff – and everyone working in the executive branch – should know this. There are over 60 exceptions in the law, none of which includes “executive privilege.”
The Reynolds administration is the least transparent in 30 years

That the governor is going to court over these four emails suggests there’s more at stake here than one or more of her staff disagreeing with her about a potentially politically charged issue. Reynolds has already announced she’s not running for reelection, so it’s hard to imagine what kind of response would be so explosive as to be worth a preemptive lawsuit to keep it secret.
More likely, Reynolds is trying to carve out or solidify some sort of “executive privilege” for the governor’s office through court precedent. But again, she’s leaving office at the end of next year, so why is that a priority?
The governor’s office statement casts the action as an effort to preserve the constitutional powers of the office: “It is unfortunate that state resources must be used to defend against the Register’s aggressive threats, but it is in the broader public interest to preserve the powers reserved in our constitution for the effective operation of government.”
Let’s be clear.  There’s nothing in the constitution about the governor keeping embarrassing emails secret. It was 100% the governor’s choice to spend public resources to initiate this lawsuit. And it is entirely in the broader public interest to have access to government documents and meetings – including those that may be embarrassing to elected officials.
By going to court against the Register for seeking public records, Reynolds is threatening all media that they may get sued for doing their job. Not all Iowa media outlets have the resources to withstand a taxpayer-funded lawsuit. It’s a direct attack on press freedom and therefore on the First Amendment.
Whether the governor’s lawsuit is successful or not, the citizens of Iowa will be the losers.

Jeff Bridges speaks before Gov. Jared Polis signs the budget for the 2025-2026 fiscal year on April 28, 2025. (Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)Colorado Gov. Jared Polis signed the state’s $43.9 billion budget for the upcoming fiscal year on Monday, culminating nearly a year’s worth of work to craft a spending plan that appropriately funds public education and Medicaid while cutting enough program spending to fill a billion-dollar gap.
“A lot of hours and time went into writing this document. This balanced, bipartisan budget holds strong reserves for an uncertain future. It makes smart investments to protect what matters most, including education, public safety and health care,” Polis said during a signing ceremony at the Governor’s Residence in Denver.
The budget includes about $16 billion in general fund spending, the portion of the budget over which the Legislature has the most control. The new fiscal year begins in July.

The tight budget conditions were partially a product of ballooning Medicaid costs within the state’s Department of Health Care Policy and Financing and slowing inflation, which impacts how much tax revenue the state is allowed to retain and spend under the state constitution. A cap set by the Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights will increase by about 3.6% next year but will be outpaced by health care costs.
That means the six bipartisan members of the powerful Joint Budget Committee had to figure out what to cut in order to create the constitutionally-required balanced budget.
“This is one of the most complicated budgets we have ever put together,” JBC Chair Sen. Jeff Bridges, an Arapahoe County Democrat, said.
Over 60 companion bills ran alongside the primary budget bill, known colloquially as the “long bill,” to shift spending and change state law to balance everything. Polis signed those last week.
More difficulties in future years
The budget makes spending reductions in about a dozen state departments.
One move delays about $70 million this year and $56 million next year in planned transportation spending. Another eliminates about $7 million for the Revitalizing Main Street program and over $70 million in awarded, though not under contract, grants for small-scale infrastructure improvements.
The budget also cuts or reduces many recently enacted programs, such as a Kidney Disease Task Force, free phone calls for incarcerated people, and a bullying-prevention effort in the Department of Education.
There are also instances where the budget bumps funding, including $150 million more to public schools and $21.7 million to the Child Care Assistance Program. It includes a 2.5% across-the-board salary increase for state employees and a 1.6% increase in the state reimbursement for Medicaid providers.
The budget funds the state’s universal free school meal program, approved by voters in 2022, until the end of the year. After that, the program’s financial future could be left to voters again if the Legislature refers to the fall ballot a measure asking to keep additional tax money to pay for the unexpected demand.
Lawmakers expect the difficult budget circumstances to continue in the upcoming years. Some attribute that to the constitutional limit of how much tax revenue the state can keep, and others say it is a spending problem that leads to a structural issue.
“You don’t get out of a structural deficit in a one-year budget. This is a two-, three- and four-year cycle that we have to work on and make sure that we are doing our due diligence,” said Sen. Barbara Kirkmeyer, a Weld County Republican.
“We had over $351 million of one-time spending again this year. That’s not good,” she said.
This year’s budget constraints left little room for any new programs and legislation that included spending.
The House voted 44-21 and the Senate voted 22-11 to approve the budget. The JBC’s two Republican members joined Democrats to vote in favor.

The Connecticut Board of Regents for Higher Education “will not seek to extend” Cheng’s contract beyond June 30, 2026, when it’s slated to end, according to a press release. Starting this July 1, Cheng will “transition” into a new role as a strategic advisor to the board as part of a mutual agreement, the press release stated.
Officials did not announce a replacement to succeed Cheng as the head of CSCU, which includes four public universities and over a dozen community colleges.
In a statement included in the press release, Cheng said, “I am incredibly proud of the work we have done to eliminate barriers to higher education, and increase educational access, equity, and opportunity for students, particularly for first-generation and minoritized students.
“Together, we have opened new doors for students and changed the trajectory of their lives,” Cheng’s statement went on. “I remain deeply committed to this work and will continue to work with the Board of Regents and build on the success of the CSCU system.”
The decision came after some deliberation, according to Gov. Ned Lamont. Speaking to reporters outside of the state Capitol Monday, Lamont said discussions between Cheng and the Board of Regents had been going on for “a while” prior to Monday’s announcement. The governor is responsible for appointing nine of the board’s 15 members, including its chair.
“Look, he’s been a good friend, he’s accomplished a lot there at Connecticut State,” the governor said, pointing specifically to the schools’ consolidation into a single higher education system in 2023, two years after Cheng was hired.
“Applications are up, graduations are up, but we just thought it was time to make a change,” Lamont added. “We did that together and to see if we can continue to speed up the process there.”
Cheng’s tenure also coincided with a time when many colleges are struggling with stagnant or declining enrollment, along with persistent questions about how much money the state should provide to support higher education. 
Those troubles worsened last year when CT Insider reported that the chancellor had charged tens of thousands of dollars to his state credit card on travel and meals — including chauffeured rides to and from his home in New York, despite his contract providing stipends for a car and apartment in Hartford.
A report from the Comptroller Sean Scanlon’s office later confirmed that many of those expenses exceeded certain limits, were missing receipts or violated other rules such a prohibition on purchasing alcohol with public money.
“At a time where we’re trying to manage within our budget, obviously some of the spending was an issue,” Lamont said Monday. “But for me, much more important is the direction of Connecticut State, what it’s going to look like in 10 years. And we’ve made good progress over the last four years, we still have a way to go.”
Marty Guay, the chair of the Connecticut Board of Regents for Higher Education, thanked Cheng for his service on Monday in another statement included in the system’s press release.
“The future is bright for CSCU as we look to set a new direction for the system,” Guay said. 
“We have a real opportunity to make impactful investments in our system in the best interests of the students we serve and the state as a whole,” he added. “We will continue to create more opportunities and access for students, boost graduation rates, and strengthen our talent pipelines to ensure they are aligned with industry needs and meet workforce demands.”
Richard Balducci, a former House speaker and member of the Board of Regents, said the board had been dissatisfied with the pace of change under Cheng and it was evident for months that his contract would not be renewed when it expired in June 2026.
Issues over Cheng’s personal spending solidified the consensus that a change was necessary, Balducci said. “That kind of set it off,” he said. 
“I think the Board of Regents should use this as an opportunity to refocus on what’s  really important, which is student outcomes, what’s happening in the classrooms,” said Rep. Gregg Haddad, D-Mansfield, who serves as co-chair of the Higher Education and Employment Advancement Committee.
Lamont said Monday that the board already has an interim replacement for Cheng ready to announce following graduation ceremonies next month. However, the governor said he couldn’t recall the name of the person.
Samantha Norton, a spokeswoman for the system, said that an interim chancellor has not been selected by the board, “but we hope to make an announcement in the coming weeks.”
Cheng’s current contract is set to expire on June 30, 2026. Norton said Monday that Cheng will continue to earn his base annual salary of $442,187 until then.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025_0307_SR_CampusSurveillanceHearing_042-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-28 16:05:21.831496

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Fallout from the 2025 legislative session remains all over the news, reminding me of my brief time interacting with the Utah Legislature. It marked the most frustrating chapter of my academic and professional careers.
For the past school year I was able to be at the state Capitol during the recent session. I started out excited to cultivate relationships, have meaningful conversations and address important questions. By the end, I felt like an object of pity — and I realized the Legislature has failed to confront two major air quality issues: the literal pollution in our skies, and the air of arrogance within the Capitol each session.
My first interaction with a legislator was quite embarrassing. I patiently waited outside the House of Representatives chamber to talk with my representative about affordable housing.
When the chamber doors opened, my legislator waved in my direction. As we made our way towards each other, I reached out my hand, ready to introduce myself as a constituent. He brushed right past me to speak with someone else. Respectfully, I waited my turn. But after thanking the lobbyist for contributing to his campaign, he brushed past me again and disappeared. I felt my respect for the process disappear with him.
I’ve also spent two semesters interning in Washington, D.C. There was a stark difference between my experience at our state Capitol and my time working in D.C. While in D.C., I was able to meet with members of Congress from all over the country; every office had full-time staff, and several interns, who were quick to welcome constituents into their space for conversations.
I expected an even better experience with our state Legislature. I had always heard that our Legislature is approachable, efficient and constituent-friendly. “The legislative website is amazing!” “It’s easy to contact your legislator!” “Utah politics is so different!” But from my first interaction to my last, I found myself thinking, “Really? Did that just happen?”
Utah has a part-time legislature that meets for only 45 days each year and lawmakers have almost no professional staff. Every year we are shocked at the amount of bills they introduce and pass. But we should be more shocked by what this number says about the quality of those bills.
During committee hearings, it was clear that legislators had not read the bills they were meant to be vetting, much less understand their impact. Later, when the consequences hit their districts, legislators can just say, “well, we didn’t mean for that to happen.” But their affected constituents don’t get off the hook so easily.
There is also a purposeful lack of access-to information, to lawmakers, and to opportunities to be involved in positive policy change. By contrast, in D.C., it was so easy for me to connect with real people, find out about town halls, and get news from each district. While D.C. has its issues, I could clearly feel the passion and professionalism.
Our Legislature exudes an arrogance I did not experience in D.C. They seem to think themselves different from their constituents: more important, more worthy of respect. What I saw, does not back that up.
Our leaders seem determined to govern by nostalgia, as Utah continues to grow and experience new challenges. They cling to a vision of the nuclear family, market self-regulation, and rugged frontier individualism. Those images of “the Utah Way” haven’t been a reality for most Utahns for decades! Following “the Utah Way” and “disagreeing better” are not valid excuses for our legislature’s lack of professionalism and lack of access. They don’t justify ignoring the things Utahns need right now, and in the future.
When it comes to governance and leadership, we deserve better than just a balanced budget and tax cuts. We need something better than “what we’ve always done.” If that includes pushing past constituents to meet with donors, passing bills without serious review, or restricting public access-we should be coming up with a new “Utah Way,” and fast.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/020625_HB267_12-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-28 16:05:21.831496

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Republicans on the House fraud prevention committee grilled Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison on Monday over a 2021 meeting with people ensnared in the massive Feeding Our Future scandal, which took place just a month before the FBI shut down the fraud.
In a recently unearthed audio recording, Ellison can be heard agreeing with the Feeding Our Future participants that state agencies, i.e., his clients, are discriminating against East African state contractors. The recording was made — without Ellison’s knowledge — during his meeting with the vendors in December 2021. One month later, the FBI executed multiple search warrants on Feeding Our Future and other nonprofits. Federal prosecutors say the nonprofit and groups it sponsored fraudulently received $250 million in federal funds to feed hungry children during the pandemic, but the fraudsters used the money on luxury cars, real estate, jewelry and travel.
Republican members of the House Fraud Prevention and State Agency Oversight and Policy Committee asked Ellison to testify about why he seemed to be siding with the Feeding Our Future participants over the state agencies that were trying to stop the fraud.
Ellison said at the time he believed he was meeting with constituents and didn’t know they were involved in Feeding Our Future. After the 2021 meeting, Ellison said he spoke with his staff, who informed him that they were bad actors. Ellison said he didn’t do anything the Feeding Our Future participants asked of him and refused their fundraising help in the meeting.
“The proof of the pudding is in the tasting. What did I do for these people? Nothing. I investigated after the conversation, and then what did we do? We cooperated (with the federal government) to help get these people found accountable, as they eventually were,” Ellison said Monday.
Republicans on the fraud committee prepared clips of the recording and played them for Ellison, and asked him to respond to some of the most embarrassing parts. They questioned why he didn’t know the Feeding Our Future participants he met with, especially because his office had been representing the Department of Education in its legal battle with Feeding Our Future for about a year prior to the 2021 meeting.
Ellison painted himself as a politician doing run-of-the-mill constituent service and said that he doesn’t know every detail of all the cases his office is working on. He argued Republicans were being unrealistic by expecting him to know who the people were because Feeding Our Future and the fraud were at the time unknown.
“It’s impossible for any individual to know everything about every file that every agency does. It’s simply not how large organizations work. I have highly competent managers working on this … They knew, even if I didn’t know every single detail,” Ellison said. “What I knew was that people in the community said, ‘We feel like we’re not being treated fairly.’”
Republicans on the committee questioned the veracity of Ellison’s explanations, particularly that he didn’t know with whom he was meeting.
“I’ve got to believe that you were aware, unless your office is poorly run, which I don’t believe. I think it’s well-run,” Rep. Patti Anderson, R-Dellwood, told Ellison.
Democrats on the committee argued the hearing was a political hit job. Rep. Emma Greenman, DFL-Minneapolis, praised Ellison for his work prosecuting Medicaid fraud and said the committee should be focused on working to protect public dollars, not on nearly four-year-old recordings.
“If the work of this committee is actually serious and not political, what we should be asking is, what are we learning to ensure that we are protecting public funds?” Greenman argued.
Ellison closed his remarks Monday by assuring the committee that his office is committed to combatting fraudulent activity.
“I hope we can work together to fight waste, fraud and abuse,” Ellison told the committee. “I’m not naive. I know that we live in a political world, but if we can leave politics aside and try to figure out how to protect the public dollar, you have a partner in me.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MG_8541-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-04-28 16:05:21.831496
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-28 19:27:21+00:00,CT Mirror,Boosting direct care hours at nursing homes would cost $24M,Jenna Carlesso and Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/28/ct-nursing-homes-direct-care-bill/,A bill that would increase how much time nursing home staff must spend with residents would cost $24M as CT is facing financial challenges.,"Legislators intent on boosting direct care for nursing home residents have recommended raising the daily minimum staffing requirement from three to 3.6 hours, a change that would provide about 36 minutes of additional care per resident each day.
But a recent analysis by the state’s nonpartisan Office of Fiscal Analysis shows the move would come with a hefty price tag: $24.2 million, half of which would be picked up by the state through Medicaid payments.
“It’s going to be very difficult to pass this year,” said Sen. Jan Hochadel, D-Meriden, co-chair of the Aging Committee. “Unfortunately … we cannot afford [it] at this time.”
Hochadel said she continues to advocate for the measure, which her committee voted to advance in March, but “We have a rocky road.”
“This is something we have wanted to do, to increase staffing to take care of our elderly, but in this fiscal climate we have to make some hard choices,” Aging Committee Co-Chair Jane Garibay, D-Windsor, added.
Legislators are grappling with unprecedented challenges to state finances.
More than $500 million in emergency federal pandemic grants that are being used to fund ongoing programs will be unavailable going forward. A series of budget caps that have generated huge surpluses since 2017 have gradually weakened health care and other core programs and must be scaled back, Democratic legislative leaders say.
State officials’ largest concern, though, involves large anticipated reductions in federal aid in the coming months.
Under the staffing bill, nursing homes would be required to provide a minimum of 3.6 hours of direct care for each resident every day. They currently must provide three hours, though some homes already staff at higher levels.
Direct care is defined as hands-on care from a registered nurse, nurse’s aide or licensed practical nurse that includes feeding, dressing and bathing.
The measure also would impose new penalties for violations. Facilities that fail to comply with the increased staffing requirements could face fines of up to $10,000 per violation. The bill also gives the state health commissioner the authority to suspend a nursing home’s license or certificate or issue citations for lapses.
Nursing home industry leaders oppose the plan.
Matthew Barrett, president and CEO of the Connecticut Association of Health Care Facilities, said the cost is a challenge, as is recruiting staff.
“We have a reimbursement system where costs drive the rates. If you mandate increased costs to the facilities, those have to be reimbursed under the Medicaid program,” he said. “While that’s a challenge in any environment when there’s staffing shortages, it’s especially challenging to come up with the dollars to do it in the current fiscal climate.”
Earlier this year, he testified on the bill: “Because of the ongoing staffing shortages in the sector, nursing homes will inevitably need to unsatisfactorily rely, in increasing frequency, on temporary nursing staffing agencies in an attempt to comply with these highly prescriptive standards.”
Mag Morelli, president of LeadingAge Connecticut, which represents nonprofit nursing homes and adult care providers, said she supports strong staffing but worries about the expense.
“Right now, everyone is very concerned about how much they’re spending and potential cuts to the Medicaid program from the federal side,” she said. “There’s a shortage of workforce, so as one sector needs to increase staffing, it raises the cost of all staffing. There is a limited amount of people to go around in the health care sector.”
House Speaker Matthew Ritter, D-Hartford, said the lack of clarity around federal Medicaid funding makes it difficult to back numerous proposals, including nursing home staffing increases.
“One of the most disappointing things as a state right now, for me, is the uncertainty at the federal level is impacting a lot of our Medicaid decisions,” he said. “Whether it’s an Aging Committee bill or the Medicaid caucus priority bill, we do need to wait for more information from Washington.”
Congress is trying to achieve savings in Medicaid and other programs worth $880 billion over 10 years to help pay for President Donald Trump’s proposed federal tax cuts.
Connecticut expects to spend $11.6 billion this fiscal year on Medicaid. About $4.7 billion of that is the state’s cost, with the other $6.9 billion covered by federal reimbursement.
But state officials fear that if Congress hits all or most of its cost-cutting target, Connecticut will lose hundreds of millions of dollars in annual support at best, billions at worst.
Along with the federal funding uncertainty, lawmakers also are confronting expired labor contracts for nursing facilities’ staff.
More than 6,000 nursing home employees spread among more than 60 facilities statewide are working with expired contracts. And another 3,500 health care workers, most assisting clients with disabilities in group homes, are due for wage hikes.
Though no specific work stoppage date has been announced, SEIU District 1199 New England — the state’s largest health care workers union — has said it wants legislators to expand Medicaid funding to support raises before the regular General Assembly session ends June 4.
“We also have a nursing home contract issue going on, so we have to balance all of the different bills relative to the industry,” said Sen. Cathy Osten, D-Sprague, co-chair of the Appropriations Committee.
“We’ve got to get our arms around the nursing home industry and direct care. We’ve had [several] nursing homes close in the last 12 months. As we continue to move through this process, we have to remember that we want to still have nursing homes, and we’re going to have to grapple with the needs the industry has.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024_0222_SR_NursingHomes_126-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-28 16:05:21.831496

How does that affect policy?
WSHU’s Ebong Udoma spoke with CT Mirror’s Ginny Monk to discuss her article, “Nearly 1 in 5 CT lawmakers are landlords. Could that affect policy?” as part of the collaborative podcast Long Story Short. Read Ginny’s story here.
WSHU: Hello, Ginny. Why did you decide to investigate whether being a landlord affects Connecticut lawmakers as they craft state housing policy?
GM: So this is something that particularly tenants’ rights advocates have asked me about every legislative session for the past couple of years, and I think this year in particular, we heard a lot of discussion from legislators about their personal experiences as landlords. So I decided to dig into it by looking at their financial disclosure reports.
WSHU: And what did you find?
GM: Based on the reporting from the financial disclosure reports, about one in five Connecticut lawmakers are also landlords, and this varies a lot in scale. So some folks only rent out one additional property. One rents out nearly 60 properties. And there was also sort of a variety in how thoroughly people filled out the forms. So some people listed LLCs that own rental properties, but didn’t list the individual properties on their forms. So there’s still a good deal unknown, but I think we are able to quantify at least a bit how many lawmakers are also landlords.
WSHU: You didn’t take into consideration that many lawmakers are lawyers who have landlords as clients as well, right?
GM: Right, so, many, many lawmakers are also lawyers, like you said, who have landlords as clients. We also didn’t count the number of people involved in real estate, which has some obvious ties to the landlord industry.
WSHU: Now you’ve talked to some of the lawmakers. What did they say?
GM: So it was really a wide variety of responses on how much lawmakers thought that this influenced policy. Some, particularly Democrats, said, yes, absolutely. This is influencing policy. It’s making it difficult to pass bills that are favorable to tenants. It’s watering down these bills. And then some said, of course, landlords should be lawmakers. They have expertise in providing housing.
WSHU: Yeah, you mentioned Rob Sampson (R-Cheshire), the ranking Republican on the committee, and he feels that his experience comes to bear when he makes his decisions, and it’s important to have that experience.
GM: Yeah, and he’s one who often mentions during particularly public hearings and public debates, his own experience as a landlord with some good tenants and some not-so-good tenants, and he’s opposed to many of the bills that tenant rights advocates have championed.
WSHU: Now tell us about the bills tenants’ rights advocates have championed and where they stand this year.
GM: Yeah, so particularly this year, they’re working on a bill that would reform eviction law in Connecticut. It would expand some existing protections that right now are only available to seniors and to people with disabilities. Essentially, it would end no-fault evictions. So these are evictions that typically occur at the end of the lease, and the expansion would apply to larger apartments, so five or more units. This is something they’ve worked on for the past couple of years. It hasn’t passed. This year, it’s gotten through committee. So we’ll see where it lands as we go to the full House and Senate over the next few weeks.
WSHU: You talked with Larry Butler, the Democrat. How’s he looking at it this year?
GM: Yeah, so Larry Butler is a long-standing member. He’s not the current chair of the Housing Committee. He was on one end of the spectrum, saying, you know, I didn’t realize that so many lawmakers are landlords, because I hardly ever hear about it, whereas the current chairs sort of said, you know, I hear about this more frequently.
WSHU: And right now, how does it look as far as passage of the tenants’ rights bills this year?
GM: Yeah, so it’s hard to say at this point. There seems to be a good amount of support, particularly from freshmen lawmakers. There’s a lot of support from folks who have historically been interested in housing and landlord-tenant issues, but there’s still a way to go. It got a couple of no votes from Democrats on the Housing Committee, which isn’t terribly common, and Republicans have been really staunchly against this bill.
WSHU: If this passes, would it be a first for the nation? Is this the first of this kind of bill, or do we have similar bills in other states?
GM: There are similar bills in other states, and I think that’s one of the points that advocates are making to folks who say this would drastically change the landscape of the rental industry in Connecticut. They’re saying other states have done this and made it through, and Connecticut already offers these protections to select groups of renters.
WSHU: Those are the associations that have this provision.
GM: Yeah, there are certain Connecticut folks over 62 and people with disabilities as well as the people that are caring for them, who are not subject to no-fault eviction.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/assembly-24.jpeg,,,2025-04-28 17:11:49.057745

(Photo by Getty Images, board seal courtesy the State of Iowa) The Iowa Board of Medicine has charged an emergency-medicine doctor from Des Moines with sexual misconduct.
Board records indicate Dr. Douglas Selover, 67, has been charged with unprofessional conduct, a charge that includes acts that violate the “standards and principles of medical ethics,” or are “contrary to honesty, justice or good morals, whether the same is committed in the course of the licensee’s practice or otherwise.” Selover is also charged with sexual misconduct, a charge the board says “includes sexual harassment.”
The board has not disclosed when, where or how the alleged violations took place. State records indicate Selover has practiced as an emergency-medicine physician at MercyOne Des Moines Medical Center.
A board hearing on the charges is scheduled for Dec. 12, 2025.
Board records show that in 1991, the board approved Selover’s residency in Iowa pursuant to a consent agreement in which he agreed to abstain from the use of nonprescribed drugs, inform his treating physician of his “previous history of chemical abuse,” and abstain from drinking alcohol. As part of that agreement, Selover also promised to attend regular support-group meetings and submit to periodic testing for drugs and alcohol.
In 1992, shortly after Selover was arrested on a charge of drunken driving, the board alleged that on several occasions Selover had violated the terms of his consent agreement by consuming alcohol. Later that year, the board resolved the case by suspending Selover’s license for 30 days, after which his license was to be placed on probationary status for five years. The arrest resulted in a conviction for second-offense drunken driving, according to court records.
In 1993, the board granted Selover a license to practice osteopathic medicine in Iowa subject to probation and many of the same conditions that were imposed on his residency in 1991. In 1996, the board terminated Selover’s probation and granted him a license free and clear of any restrictions.
In November 2003, Selover was arrested again on a charge of second-offense drunken driving. The charge was later reduced to reckless driving.
Selover is currently a defendant in two separate medical malpractice cases in which he is alleged to have failed to diagnose hydrocephalus in patients he saw seven days apart at MercyOne Medical Center of Des Moines. Both patients — one of whom was a 7-year-old boy, while the other was a 12-year-old girl — subsequently died.
Selover has denied any wrongdoing in the two cases, which are currently scheduled for trial in July and September of 2027.



Dubuque physician faces charges again
The Iowa Board of Medicine has charged a Dubuque physician with unprofessional conduct.
Board records indicate Dr. Barry J. Waack, 59, a doctor of osteopathy, is charged with unprofessional conduct, a charge that includes acts “contrary to honesty, justice or good morals, whether the same is committed in the course of the licensee’s practice or otherwise,” or acts that violate “the standards and principles of medical ethics or rules.”
The board has not disclosed when, where or how the alleged violations took place. According to the board, Waack is a family-medicine physician practicing in the Dubuque area.
A hearing on the matter is scheduled for Oct. 24, 2025.
In 2018, the board alleged Waack violated appropriate professional boundaries, engaged in improper prescribing, and failed to establish an appropriate physician-patient relationship. The board also alleged Waack failed to perform appropriate examinations and failed to maintain appropriate medical records.
In that case, Waack was accused of prescribing multiple medications — including antibiotics, a corticosteroid and an antidepressant — for a subordinate female coworker with whom he was having a sexual relationship, without ever establishing an appropriate physician-patient relationship.
He and the board later agreed to resolve the case with a warning and a $5,000 civil penalty. As part of the agreement, Waack also agreed to complete a board-approved course on professional boundaries, and his license was placed on probation.
In December 2021, the board restored Waack’s license to full privileges, free and clear of any restrictions.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/DOCTOR.jpg,,,2025-04-28 16:05:21.831496

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Hundreds filed past the message “Rest in Peace Pope Francis” on the reader board outside St. Anthony Church in North Providence Monday on their way inside to honor the late Rhode Island Senate President Dominick Ruggerio.
Comparisons between the two titans of their worlds — Ruggerio, of state politics, and Francis of the Catholic Church — were unavoidable during the Mass in celebration of Ruggerio.
Both died on April 21. Ruggerio was 76, and Pope Francis was 88.
The Rev. Edward Cardente, who led Ruggerio’s funeral Mass, called it a “double whammy.”
“Just as Pope Francis was known throughout the world, so was Senate President Ruggerio known throughout the state of Rhode Island,” Cardente said.
Indeed, the crowd for Ruggerio’s Mass spilled out from the Mineral Spring Avenue church, filling a room in the rectory set up with projector screens and folding chairs. Cars lined the streets of the neighborhood around the church, as family, friends, elected officials, judges and union leaders from across the country gathered to pay their respects.
The attendee list included North Providence Mayor Charles Lombardi, House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi, Gov. Dan McKee, Rhode Island’s congressional delegation and former U.S. Commerce Secretary and former Gov. Gina Raimondo, who traveled from D.C. to attend the funeral.  
“Donny was special, a dear friend,” Raimondo said in comments after the Mass. “We argued a lot. We probably disagreed more than we agreed. But he was always so respectful, a true gentleman.”
The pair of LaSalle Academy alumni, though both Democrats, differed on hot-button social issues like guns and reproductive rights during their overlap on Smith Hill. Raimondo served as governor from 2015 to 2021.
Ruggerio, a former administrator for the Laborers’ International Union of North America representing construction workers, was first elected to the Rhode Island House of Representatives in 1980. He served two terms before he successfully ran for the Senate, where he represented District 4, spanning northern Providence and North Providence, for the next four decades. He was elected Senate president by his colleagues in 2017. 
Ruggerio was known for more conservative stances on social issues, while championing worker protections and expanding legal gambling. But colleagues remembered Ruggerio’s willingness to listen to views other than his own, and to change his views as time progressed.

‘Indestructible’
Ruggerio’s son, Charles Ruggerio, said his dad’s once formidable demeanor toward his family eased in his later years, too. In a remembrance given during the Mass, Charles Ruggerio described his father as “indestructible” and “old-school.”
“What he struggled to express in words, he demonstrated in actions,” Charles Ruggerio said of his dad, recalling the countless sports games, graduations and other celebratory events his father attended for his children. 
But, as time went on, the elder Ruggerio’s hard facade softened, and his outward displays of affection towards his family, especially his grandchildren, were numerous.
“It was rare for him to end a phone call without saying ‘I love you,’” Charles Ruggerio said of his dad in his later years. 
The late Senate president was known as a mentor to his colleagues at the State House, eager to pass on the knowledge and expertise he’d developed as the most senior member of the Rhode Island General Assembly and the “dean” of the Senate.
Despite the public nature of his life in politics, Ruggerio kept his personal life, including his health, private even to his family. Charles Ruggerio recalled a family trip to Disneyland Paris five years ago; his father kept up with his grandchildren despite being 71 years old, and having cancer — a diagnosis Charles Ruggerio didn’t know about at the time.
“He had cancer at least three times that I was aware of,” Charles Ruggerio said.
When Ruggerio publicly revealed he was again battling cancer in April 2024, amid visible signs of decline, he refused to say what kind, or when he had been diagnosed. This year, as illness forced Ruggerio to miss a majority of the Senate’s floor sessions, his aides continued to tout his recovery and promised an imminent return to the chamber.
Concern over Ruggerio’s ability to lead the Senate given his health problems divided Democratic lawmakers, with nearly one-third backing Sen. Ryan Pearson for Senate president over Ruggerio in a November caucus. 
Ruggerio’s death has reopened the freshly healed wounds from the contentious leadership battle. Pearson is again vying for the president role while Ruggerio’s second-in-command, Senate Majority Leader Valarie Lawson, has teamed up with Sen. Frank Ciccone as a slate for president and majority leader, respectively.

Leadership elections Tuesday
The Senate, which has been on hiatus since Ruggerio’s death, is expected to elect its new president tomorrow afternoon, Greg Paré, a Senate spokesperson said. A party caucus will be held prior to the full Senate session, which is tentatively scheduled for 4:30 p.m.
Lawson, Ciccone and Pearson all attended Ruggerio’s funeral, along with the rest of the chamber and members of the House of Representatives. Rep. Arthur Corvese, a North Providence Democrat and friend of Ruggerio, said the “Prayer of the Faithful” during the Mass.
Lawson, an East Providence Democrat, declined to comment after the Mass.
Pearson, who had a falling out with Ruggerio last year, said he did not hesitate to attend Ruggerio’s funeral.
“Donny was my friend for over 15 years,” Pearson, a Cumberland Democrat, said after the Mass. “Of course, I am here.”
Asked about the comparisons with Pope Francis, Pearson said, “Donny would be loving that.”
Charles Ruggerio also acknowledged the associations between his father and the leader of the Catholic Church.
“He would say, ‘always the bridesmaid, never the bride,’” Charles Ruggerio joked.
“But we know that couldn’t be further from the truth after seeing the tremendous outpouring of love this past week.”
Ruggerio passed the Rhode Island State House one last time around 1 p.m., as his funeral procession drove east on Smith Street en route to St. Francis Cemetery in Pawtucket. 
A handful of state workers started gathering around 12:30 p.m. on the walkway outside the State House. The group swelled to a large crowd, including senators who arrived by bus following the funeral Mass, in time to watch the motorcade pass. 
A lifelong North Providence resident, Ruggerio is survived by his children, Charles and Amanda; his sister Lisa Aceto; and his grandchildren, Ava, Mia, Natalie, and Jameson.

With the addition of the omissions and other accounting adjustments, the base budget’s corrected total is $426,732 more than initially calculated, according to administrators and their updated spreadsheet.As a result, the town selectboard will have to cut nearly a half-million dollars from the new number just to level down to the 12% tax hike defeated last month, leaders have determined.“The budget news is really disappointing,” selectboard Chair Elizabeth McLoughlin said at the start of a special Thursday session on the topic.Five and a half hours later, the board asked Town Manager John Potter to return this week with a plan to cut $500,000 in expenses for the fiscal year that starts July 1. That would allow leaders to present a revised proposal at a special Town Meeting on May 27 that’s lower than the original, if only by about $75,000.“The numbers have been corrected and our task has gotten way more difficult,” selectboard Vice-Chair Oscar Heller said.Heller, newly elected to the board, headed the town’s advisory Finance Committee this winter when it issued a rare public resolution questioning why local leaders, facing double-digit-percentage increases in staffing, health insurance and trash disposal costs, weren’t studying decreases in the biggest single source of spending: personnel.READ MORE





 


In a first, Brattleboro Town Meeting rejects proposed municipal budget

“We recognize that the concept of staff cuts is painful,” the committee said in its statement, “but we believe that considering it is an essential part of the responsible management of the town.” The selectboard at the time — which lost three of its five members in March when the former chair didn’t run for reelection and two incumbents were defeated — chose not to reduce employees. On Thursday, continuing board member Peter Case, who has opposed layoffs, asked how the town would achieve $500,000 in savings.Replied Potter: “It’s going to come from positions.”And McLoughlin: “Nothing is off the table.”The selectboard is scheduled to receive and review proposed reductions at a special session this Thursday. Leaders so far have chosen not to fill two open administrative jobs: assistant town manager and finance director. But they are considering the addition of three firefighters after determining that station overtime is so high — currently upward of $700,000 or more annually — that hiring help would be less expensive.“I don’t see any way to reduce that number,” new Fire Chief Jay Symonds said of the overtime spurred by vacancies and contract requirements, “other than adding staff.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Brattleboro rejected a $25M municipal budget as too high.

(Ellen Schmidt/Minnesota Reformer)Just two years after Minnesota became the first state to extend unemployment insurance to school bus drivers, cafeteria workers and teachers’ aids, Democratic legislators are considering eliminating the benefit after summer 2028 to reach a budget deal with Republicans.
The law continues to face stiff opposition from school districts, which say paying for unemployment benefits for hourly school workers takes critical funding away from the classroom while making it harder for them to find workers to fill part-time summer positions.
Advocates say the benefit provides a critical lifeline to workers, who make around $17 an hour, while helping school districts retain experienced staff year after year.
The Republican and DFL co-chairs of the House Education Finance Committee on Monday presented a budget agreement (HF1388) that provides additional funding for school districts to pay for unemployment benefits in the coming year but repeals the benefits in four years.
Democrats tried to amend the education budget bill to maintain unemployment benefits for hourly school workers, but the effort failed on a tie vote in the evenly divided committee. The budget was then laid over to be taken up by the House Ways and Means Committee.
House Education Finance Committee Co-Chair Rep. Cheryl Youkim, DFL-Hopkins, called agreeing to eliminate the benefits her “biggest disappointment” during Monday’s hearing and said she hopes they can find a way to retain it going forward.
Setting the repeal date so far in the future means Democrats could reverse course again and keep the benefits going if they win back control of government.
But some Democrats say they aren’t willing to vote for the deal and bank on a strong election in 2026, which means the issue could divide the DFL House and Senate caucuses and become a key sticking point in budget negotiations over the next three weeks.
The Legislature is set to adjourn May 19; they need to pass a budget by June 30 to keep the government open.
More than half a dozen House Democrats held a news conference on Friday with hourly school workers during which they blasted Republicans for demanding a repeal of the benefits long afforded other seasonal workers like those in construction.
“This is a line-in-the-sand moment for Democrats,” said Rep. Emma Greenman, DFL-Minneapolis, who authored the bill in the 2023 legislative session.
Kristen Scott, who’s worked as a special education paraprofessional for 20 years in the Elk River School District, said the unemployment benefits have helped her stay afloat during the summer months, when full-time work in schools is hard to come by.
“It also allows us to continue to come back each year to do the important job of helping all of our children thrive,” Scott said. “Cutting unemployment benefits will force many in my field to seek other full-time jobs, leaving our kids wondering who will be there to care for them year after year.”
School districts haven’t had to pay anything toward unemployment benefits because the Minnesota Legislature created a $135 million fund to cover the costs until 2027 or the funds ran out.
Benefits cost an estimated $45 million in 2023 and $57 million in 2024, according to the Minnesota Department of Education. That leaves about half of what’s expected to be needed to pay for the benefits this summer.
Gov. Tim Walz has proposed shoring up the fund with $30 million for this summer to help districts cover the cost, and a DFL-led Senate proposal would provide an additional $70 million the following year.
After that, school districts would have to factor in the cost of unemployment into their regular budgets.
Greenman said they passed the bill in 2023 with the expectation that school districts would eventually pick up the cost without state aid.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Minnesota-Reformer-File-67-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-28 15:13:12.486537

The project in West Des Moines will add bioretention cells, or rain gardens, native plants and a stormwater wetland to the Legacy Woods Nature Sanctuary, as part of its plan to expand to include trails and recreation for the public. This will help to capture and clean stormwater runoff before it reaches Jordan Creek and Raccoon River. 
“Our investment, on the part of the department, is focused on water quality, but we know that projects like this also provide other values for the community, and we love those layered benefits of education and recreation and cultural preservation,” Naig said.

“I hope it’ll inspire folks who spend time here to consider what they might do on their own property, but also other cities can come and see how this can be incorporated into the landscape,” Naig said.

“Water quality improvements aren’t just the responsibility of rural Iowa farmers,” Trimble said. “It’s incumbent upon all of us to do our part to clean up and improve our water.” 
The grants cover up to 50% of each of the 14 projects and are funded, in part, through the state Water Quality Initiative. IDALS invested $250,000 into the wetland project in West Des Moines and overall invested nearly $2.7 million for all of the projects. 
Including the local matches, the urban water quality projects will leverage more than $5.7 million for projects located in: Algona, Ankeny, Bondurant, Cedar Rapids, Clear Lake, Clinton, Decorah, Des Moines, Dunlap, Durant, Evansdale, Mount Ayr, Oskaloosa and West Des Moines.
Projects range from adding permeable parking lots and pavers to infrastructure, landscaping with oxbows and rain gardens or using native species and wetlands to filter runoff water. 
Naig made the announcement during Iowa Soil and Water Conservation week, and said all Iowans have a role to play in soil and water conservation, regardless of where they live or what type of property they own.  
“There’s certainly more work to do, but we’re seeing progress towards achieving our Nutrient Reduction Strategy goals,” Naig said. “Projects like this make a difference.”

Shri Thanedar speaks at his election night party in Detroit on Aug. 6, 2024 | Ken ColemanMichigan Congressman Shri Thanedar (D-Detroit) on Monday brought seven articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump, saying the president has “repeatedly demonstrated that he is unfit to serve,” and “represents a clear and present danger to our nation’s constitution and our democracy.”
In a statement from Thanedar’s office, he pointed to “sweeping abuse of power, flagrant violations of the Constitution and acts of tyranny that undermine American democracy and threaten the rule of law” as his reasons for introducing the charges. 
“[Trump’s] unlawful actions have subverted the justice system, violated the separation of powers, and placed personal power and self-interest above public service. We cannot wait for more damage to be done. Congress must act,” Thanedar said. 
Each article alleges a separate violation of the Constitution, with Thanedar’s office offering the following breakdown of his resolution:

 Obstruction of Justice and Abuse of Executive Power: Including denial of due process, unlawful deportations, defiance of court orders, and misuse of the Department of Justice.
Usurpation of Appropriations Power: For dismantling congressionally established agencies and impounding federal funds.
Abuse of Trade Powers and International Aggression: Including imposing economically damaging tariffs and threatening military invasion against sovereign nations.
Violation of First Amendment Rights: Through retaliatory actions against critics, media and attorneys exercising constitutionally protected speech.
Creation of an Unlawful Office: By establishing the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and unlawfully empowering Elon Musk to unilaterally violate the Constitution.
Bribery and Corruption: Involving dismissing criminal cases, soliciting foreign emoluments, and extortionate settlements for personal and political gain.
Tyrannical Overreach: Seeking to consolidate unchecked power, erode civil liberties, and defy constitutional limits on presidential authority.

“This is not about partisanship. It’s about protecting our democracy and ensuring that no one, not even a President, is above the law,” Thanedar said in a statement. 
Thanedar’s effort is likely to face an uphill battle in the House, where Republicans hold a seven seat majority. The Senate, which conducts the trial should the resolution receive a majority of votes in the House, is also held by Republicans, with a two-thirds vote needed in order to convict the president. 
Thanedar’s introduction of the articles comes the same day that his second primary opponent, state Rep. Donavan McKinney (D-Detroit), announced he would seek his 13th District seat in the 2026 primary.

Collectively, they form the financial linchpin to the state’s next budget and would generate the revenue needed to erase a chunk of a shortfall Ferguson has pegged at $16 billion over the next four fiscal years. The tax package is expected to net around $9.4 billion over that time.
Democrats drew up the bills. They used their majorities in the House and Senate to pass them over the opposition of Republicans and a few moderate Democrats.
It is not known if the first-term Democratic governor will sign them all. He rejected Democrats’ recent $12 billion package as unsustainable and too risky.
Before that, Ferguson stated his objections publicly to relying on a novel wealth tax that was an original cornerstone of Democratic lawmakers’ approaches. So it got set aside.
He shared his dislike privately of raising the cap on annual property tax growth. It disappeared. As did a payroll tax on large companies.
Below is a breakdown of five tax bills heading to the governor, which would help pay for spending in the two-year $77.8 billion state operating budget lawmakers approved. These measures do not cover the slate of tax and fee increases legislators are relying on for the separate transportation budget.
House Bill 2081 is the most far-reaching, affecting an estimated 191,000 taxpayers, per the latest fiscal analysis. It is projected to bring in the most money of the tax bills, nearly $2.1 billion for the next budget and $5.6 billion over four years. That covers roughly a third of the shortfall.
It permanently increases the state’s two primary business and occupation tax rates on gross proceeds — 0.471% and 0.484% — to 0.5%, starting Jan. 1, 2027. Another provision of House Bill 2081 boosts the tax rate for service businesses with annual taxable revenue exceeding $5 million from 1.75% to 2.1%. 
Financial institutions with annual net income of $1 billion or more would see the rate for an additional tax they pay rise from 1.2% to 1.5% starting Oct. 1. This will impact about 200 businesses, Democrats have said. 
About 400 corporations with more than $250 million in annual revenue would be subject to a 0.5% surcharge for three years starting Jan. 1, 2026. That extra would be levied on amounts above the $250 million threshold. Among those exempted from that surcharge is Boeing. 
There’s also a major change in a levy on technology companies that goes directly toward higher education, including student financial aid. The “advanced computing surcharge” applies to firms with global revenue above $25 billion — think Microsoft and Amazon. It would raise the tax rate from 1.22% to 7.5% and boost a cap on payments from $9 million to $75 million. 
Senate Bill 5814, the other major money-maker for the state, is counted on to raise $1.1 billion for the next budget and $2.7 billion over four years. It would do so by applying the retail sales tax to more services, such as temporary staffing, advertising, security and lobbying. The change would occur Oct. 1 and affect an estimated 35,000 firms, according to a Department of Revenue analysis.
It also contains a provision to begin taxing certain products with nicotine, like Zyn pouches. If it becomes law, this new tax takes effect Jan. 1, 2026.
And an estimated $1.1 billion will flow into coffers of local governments around the state since they receive a share of sales tax.
Senate Bill 5813 will add a layer to the capital gains tax. In addition to the existing 7% tax on gains over $270,000 from the sale or exchange of long-term assets like stocks, bonds and business interests, the bill tacks on another 2.9% for gains exceeding $1 million. About 900 taxpayers would be impacted.
The bill also makes revisions in the state’s estate tax — a tax on the right to transfer property at the time of death. Rates would increase, but the value of property excluded from the tax would climb to $3 million, up from the current $2.1 million. Lawmakers assume this legislation will generate $321.6 million for the next budget, and slightly less in the one after that.
Senate Bill 5794 seeks to bring in revenue by getting rid of tax breaks that the Department of Revenue estimates are used by 15,000 taxpayers. These changes are counted on to bring in $148.5 million for the next budget, according to budget documents.
Among the many tax preferences targeted for elimination are ones exempting sales of precious metal bullion. Another change would make operators of self-service storage facilities begin to pay taxes on the renting or leasing of individual units.
House Bill 2077 would begin taxing the sale of electric vehicle credits between automakers. This has been dubbed the “Tesla tax” because the firm led by Elon Musk is the only automaker with credits to sell in Washington. This brand-new tax is projected to generate $54.5 million for the operating budget.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/money-closuep-1024x678.jpeg,,,2025-04-28 15:13:12.486537

Keith Jackson, a Democratic lawmaker from Kemper County, can remain in office despite a felony indictment by participating in a pre-trial intervention program, according to court documents. 
A grand jury last year indicted Jackson, a first-term House member, on charges of receiving stolen property – specifically, a 2006 Magnolia timber trailer worth about $15,000. The grand jury also indicted two other people, Fredwrick (sic) Young and William Tate, in connection with the criminal charges. 
Jackson did not respond to a request for comment, and his attorney, Christopher Collins, declined to comment. 
Cassie Colman, the district attorney in the 10th circuit district, told Mississippi Today that the state agreed to let Jackson participate in pretrial intervention because he had no prior criminal record. If Jackson completes the terms of the pre-trial agreement, then the criminal charges will be expunged from his record. 
Going to trial would likely be risky for the lawmaker because, if convicted of the offense, he could lose the right to hold elected office. 
Receiving stolen property is a disenfranchising crime in Mississippi, and if someone is convicted of a disenfranchising crime, they lose their right to vote. To run for office in Mississippi, someone must be a registered voter. 
But Coleman, who prosecuted the case against Jackson, said the legislator’s agreement to enter the program is neither a guilty plea nor a conviction. Instead, he will enroll in the intervention program for at least a year and pay around $3,350 in fees, according to court documents. 
If he fails to meet the terms of the agreement, the district attorney could remove him from the program and prosecute him for the original crime.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/28134326/jackson_45th.jpg,,,2025-04-28 15:13:12.486537

Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, in regard to comments by Michigan’s Democratic U.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin.
Speaking Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press”, Sanders was asked about Slotkin’s suggestion in an interview with Politico that Democrats needed to fight back against the perception that they are “weak and woke” and stop using the term “oligarchy” when criticizing Trump and his allies, such as billionaire Elon Musk, and instead say they are opposed to “kings.”

“Well, jeez, we had 36,000 people out in Los Angeles, 34,000 people in Colorado. We had 30,000 people in Folsom, California, which is kind of a rural area,” Sanders said, referencing recent “Fighting Oligarchy” rallies he and fellow progressive, U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-New York), has hosted in opposition to Trump administration policies.
“I think the American people are not quite as dumb as Ms. Slotkin thinks they are,” Sanders said.
A request for comment was made to Slotkin’s office by the Michigan Advance, but has yet to be returned.
Slotkin, who won her Senate seat in 2024 by less than 20,000 votes out of more than 5 million cast, has made her political career out of winning tight races in districts and states that otherwise supported Trump.
Her rising star in the party was exemplified by Slotkin’s selection to give the Democratic response to Trump’s address to Congress in March.

However, in his “Meet the Press” interview, Sanders, who drew an estimated 10,000 supporters in early March to Lincoln High School in Warren, Michigan, said an acknowledgment was necessary about the nature of the forces championing policies that have deepened the nation’s economic inequality.   
“The very rich getting richer, working class people are struggling, 800,000 people sleeping out on the streets. If we don’t address that issue, the American people will continue to turn their backs on democracy because they’re looking around them and they’re saying, ‘Does anybody understand what I am going through?’ And unfortunately, right now, to a large degree, neither party does,” Sanders said.
Slotkin, posting on the social media platform X on Friday, said Democrats needed more than rhetoric if they hope to win against Republicans.
“After this 100 days of the Trump Administration, we owe the nation a plan: reclaiming our patriotism, a real economic plan for the Middle Class, and a fight for our democracy that recognizes the stakes,” Slotkin wrote.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/AMR_0240-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-28 15:13:12.486537

The portal[...],"South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden reads the title of a bill he signed in Sioux Falls on March 17, 2025. (Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)State employees in South Dakota will soon have a secure web portal to submit allegations of misbehavior by their coworkers.
Gov. Larry Rhoden signed an executive order telling the state Bureau of Human Resources and Administration and the Bureau of Information and Telecommunications to create a “secure standard reporting mechanism” for employees. The portal will deliver reports of malfeasance to the state’s auditor and attorney general.
The order also requires supervisors and encourages employees to submit such reports, and directs the human resources department to conduct training in ethics and use of the portal.
The order is an outgrowth of Senate bills 62 and 63, which tightened the state’s internal controls after a series of 2024 scandals involving former state employees. 
Governor prevails in dispute over penalties for supervisors who stay silent on misdeeds

One such employee, Lonna Carroll, used her position at the Department of Social Services to illegally collect nearly $1.8 million over the course of 13 years. A jury found Carroll guilty of grand theft earlier this month.
Other former employees stood accused of forging vehicle registrations, falsifying food service inspections and using foster family food service vouchers for themselves.
Representatives for Rhoden and Attorney General Marty Jackley sparred during the 2025 legislative session over whether supervisors should face felony charges for failure to report state employee misdeeds. 
Rhoden’s office argued supervisors should face misdemeanor rather than felony charges, particularly if the unreported employee misbehavior isn’t felonious in nature. The kerfuffle over that provision in SB 62 forced multiple rounds of debate, one of which appeared to doom the bill before a revival effort the following day. In the end, lawmakers narrowly sided with Rhoden.
In a press release announcing the creation of the online reporting system, Rhoden wrote that the executive branch took “decisive action” to address the rash of corruption cases.
“Under my leadership, South Dakota will have a government that is accountable and responsible with taxpayer dollars, and this executive order is an important step forward,” he wrote.

“I take issue with what was said last week,” she told her Democratic colleagues at the beginning of the Senate’s business on Monday afternoon. “We may not hold the majority, but we have something just as powerful — a vision, rooted in fairness, in justice, in equality, and in care.”
Her caucus elected Berman on Thursday afternoon, shortly after Pizzo stunningly announced on the floor of the Senate that he was leaving the Florida Democratic Party and would instead become a non-party-affiliated (NPA) voter.
“I am very disappointed about the way things unfolded last week,” Berman acknowledged in a conference call with reporters earlier in the day. 
“I can’t believe with one week left in session we had this huge disruption. But I am moving on, and I think that’s what we in the Democratic Party need to do. I feel that our Democratic Caucus here in the Senate — ‘The Tenacious Ten’ — we are more unified than ever. We are ready to finish this session strong. We are ready to make sure our Democratic values get heard in the bills that we pass. We will be fighting bad bills. We will be making sure that we get appropriations that are impactful for our districts at home.”
She added that she considers herself a unifier.
“I want all my members to shine, and that is going to be my goal, to make sure that each member of our caucus has the opportunity to move forward and do the job that we were are all elected to do, to represent the people of our districts.”
Pizzo’s resignation was the latest in a series of devastating blows that the Florida Democratic Party has suffered in recent years. The party fell into superminority status in both the state House and Senate after the 2022 elections — in which its candidates for governor lost by 19 points and for U.S. Senate by 16 points.
A year earlier, the Republican Party for the first time took the lead in voter registrations in Florida, a lead that has since increased to more than 1.2 million voters. Then, after the Democrats failed to win back any new seats in the Legislature last fall, they saw their numbers in the Florida House dwindle by two more last December to just 33 in the 120-member body after Hillsborough County Rep. Susan Valdés, and then South Florida’s Hillary Cassel, announced that they were ditching the Democrats to go Republican.
Criticism
With Pizzo’s departure and the death of Orange County Sen. Geraldine Thompson before the session began in March, there are now just 10 Democrats in the 40-member Senate.
In announcing his resignation, Pizzo said that the “Florida Democratic Party is dead,” adding that “there are good people that can resuscitate it, but they don’t want it to be me.”
Pizzo added more criticism of his now-former party over the weekend.
“I’ve spent thousands of hours trying to resuscitate something that’s just not there, and we just got so consumed with taking the bait and the opportunity cost lost with going ahead and going down a rabbit hole of socially divisive issues that — there was no plan. If you go on whether it’s the state [web] site or a local site as it relates to party, there’s no policies. There’s no plan,” Pizzo said in an interview aired Sunday on WPLG television in Miami. “There’s just a lot of anger and a lot of hate — which I understand, because it’s been a generation of Republican control.”
Berman and House Democratic Leader Fentrice Driskell disputed that assessment.
“Unfortunately, we had to be reactive in past years because there were so many bad bills that came through and so much policy that you had to react to, but I think we clearly have an agenda,” Berman said. “Our agenda is to help the working people here in the state of Florida. To make sure that people can get access to health care. To support public education. To make sure that we have a clean environment for everyone to flourish.”
Driskell said that in fact what she calls the party’s “platform bills” have been focused on making life better for everyday Floridians, not on culture war issues.
“They focused on making housing more affordable,  expanding Medicaid so we can help health care be more affordable for all of us, protecting our drinking water and our natural resources. Focusing on commonsense gun solutions, gun reform. … We focus on protecting workers, we focus on investing in our kids in terms of public education, so those are the issues that we center on, but please understand that, as a party of opposition, where we have to stand up and fight for the Constitution and fight for the least among us, we will do it at every time.”
Hope Florida
Berman and Driskell later focused on developments in the saga revolving around Hope Florida, the welfare program started by First Lady Casey DeSantis, which has dominated the second half of the legislative session in terms of news coverage.
A House committee announced last week that it was ending its investigation into reports of $10 million going to the Hope Florida Foundation from a state Medicaid overpayment settlement. Much of that $10 million was later sent to a political committee run by James Uthmeier, Gov. Ron DeSantis’ former chief-of-staff (now state attorney general), that was working to combat last year’s referendum on recreational cannabis.
“I don’t think this issue will fade,” Berman said, “because when everybody goes home to their districts over the summer, they are going to hear about this issue and I really believe that … we need to continue to investigate this issue. It should not be allowed to go without a response, whether it’s a legal response or whether it’s a political response, but we should never allow this kind of graft to happen in our state of Florida.”
Boca Raton Democratic Rep. Kelly Skidmore said that Gov. DeSantis certainly hopes that the controversy over Hope Florida will fade.
“That is why he is going so hard after his own Republican colleagues, because he wants them to be afraid and not focused on this fraud that was perpetrated on taxpayers.” SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/0-1-1024x598.png,,,2025-04-28 15:13:12.486537

(Image via Maine Legislature live stream)A Republican lawmaker who had been censured by her legislative peers for posting personal information about a transgender student on her official social media account is taking her fight to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Rep. Laurel Libby of Auburn said she filed the petition Monday after the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals denied her motion for an expedited appeal to end the censure by the Maine House of Representatives.
“For over 60 days, my constituents have had no say in actions taken by their government, actions that directly impact their lives,” Libby said in a press release. “Every vote taken on the floor of the legislature is a vote my constituents cannot get back. The good people of our district have been silenced and disenfranchised.”
On Feb. 25, the House voted 75-70 to formally reprimand Libby, preventing her from speaking or voting until she apologizes for the post, which she has so far declined to do.
The post, which included the name, photograph and other details about a transgender student athlete, drew national attention. Days later, President Donald Trump threatened to withhold federal funding to Maine over the state’s transgender policy, arguing it is in violation of federal anti-discrimination protections. Since then, the state has been subject to several funding cuts and probes, culminating in a lawsuit by the U.S. Department of Justice. 
Libby is arguing that the censure is a violation of her First Amendment right. Additionally, Libby’s lawsuit against Maine House Speaker Ryan Fecteau (D-Biddeford) and House Clerk Robert Hunt asserts that their sanction is a violation of her constituents’ right to free speech and that it disenfranchises the voters by depriving them of legislative representation.
On Friday, Justice Melissa DuBois of the U.S. District Court for the District of Maine denied Libby’s request for a preliminary injunction against enforcement of the censure, arguing that legislative immunity — which largely protects lawmakers from being sued for strictly legislative acts — shields Fecteau and Hunt from the claims in the case.
While acknowledging that the ability to suspend an elected representative’s privileges to speak or vote on the House floor “is a weighty sword to wield,” DuBois determined Fecteau’s actions “ultimately reflected the will of the majority of the House members” and that the sanction “is not of such extraordinary character as to obliterate the formidable shield the courts have provided to legislative acts.”
There have only been four censures in the Maine Legislature since 1820 and three of them — including the ongoing censure of Libby — have come in the past year and a half under Democratic majorities. The first censure was an independent from Auburn in 2001.
Libby appealed that ruling to the 1st Circuit Court, which on Monday denied her motion for an expedited ruling, according to Maine Public.
Seeking immediate intervention, Libby filed an emergency request with the U.S. Supreme Court and said while the broader case continues through the appeals process, she is “hopeful the court will act swiftly” to end the censure.

You put your family in that position.”The children, all under the age of 10, were placed on deportation flights to Honduras on Friday after their mothers checked in with a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in New Orleans as part of the Intensive Supervision Appearance Program, which allows immigrants to stay in their communities while undergoing immigration court proceedings.An attorney for one of the children, Gracie Willis at the National Immigration Project, said the 4-year-old U.S. citizen with Stage 4 cancer was deported without access to his medication.Homan has argued the mothers requested to be deported with their children, but attorneys for the families argue they were “denied access to legal counsel, and swiftly deported without due process.”Due process concernsU.S. District Judge Terry Doughty, whom Trump appointed to a seat on the Louisiana federal bench in 2018, expressed concern that a 2-year-old U.S. citizen had been deported, despite her father’s wishes she remain in the U.S., according to court filings.Doughty scheduled a May 16 hearing because of his “strong suspicion that the government just deported a U.S. citizen with no meaningful process.”“The government contends that this is all okay because the mother wishes that the child be deported with her,” Doughty wrote in his order. “But the court doesn’t know that.”Willis, from the National Immigration Project, raised concerns about a lack of due process and how the deportations have separated families.“What we saw from ICE over the last several days is horrifying and baffling,” she said in a statement. “These mothers had no opportunity to speak with their co-parents to make the kinds of choices that parents are entitled to make for their children, the kinds of decisions that millions of parents make every day: ‘what is best for our child?’”Homan has argued the children were deported at the request of the mothers and that the Trump administration was “keeping families together.”“What we did is remove children with their mothers who requested their children depart with them,” he said. “When a parent says, ‘I want my 2-year-old baby to go with me,’ we made that happen. They weren't deported. We don't deport U.S. citizens. The parents made that decision, not the United States government.”Wisconsin judgeMonday’s remarks from Homan come the day before President Donald Trump will mark the 100th day of his second term. His early days in office have centered on carrying out his campaign promise of mass deportations of millions of people in the U.S. without permanent legal status.Trump will sign two executive orders on immigration late Monday: one relating to border security and another to require the Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security to publicly list so-called sanctuary cities that do not coordinate with federal immigration law enforcement.Homan also stood by the Trump administration’s decision to arrest a federal judge in Wisconsin on the grounds she obstructed immigration officials from detaining a man attending his court hearing. It marked an escalation between the Trump administration and the judiciary branch, raising concerns from Democrats.The arrest of Judge Hannah Dugan was highly publicized after she was handcuffed in public and FBI Director Kash Patel bragged about the arrest on social media.Attorney General Pam Bondi said on Fox News that the Trump administration was going to continue to go after judges who “think they’re above the law.”“When you cross that line to impediment or knowingly harboring, concealing an illegal alien from ICE, you will be prosecuted, judge or not,” Homan said.",,,,2025-04-28 15:13:12.486537

Sara Attleson is the new chair of the Democratic Party of New Mexico, according to voting results announced on Sunday.
Attleson, of Albuquerque, chairs the party’s Labor Caucus, as well as the Albuquerque Teachers Federation’s Committee on Political Education. She defeated Marisol Enriquez, Letitia Montoya and Joseph Weathers to lead the party. Former Chair Jessica Velasquez did not seek reelection.
Attleson said in a statement she wants to work with county-level Democratic parties “to make sure we have a presence in every community.”
“Democrats across the country have our work cut out for us,” she said in a statement. “But here in New Mexico, we have the energy to make sure that MAGA Republicans and Donald Trump are never able to get a foothold here.”
DPNM announced the results at the spring meeting of its governing body, the State Central Committee, at the Albuquerque Little Theater following voting by 466 SCC members via online absentee ballot from April 19-26. The new party officers’ terms end in 2027.
Party members elected Cameron Crawford as vice chair. Crawford, of Santa Fe, defeated incumbent Manny Crespin and Augustine Montoya to win the seat.
“In an era of unprecedented political turmoil, I will go to counties red and blue to rebuild community by showing up for everyone, regardless of who they vote for,” Crawford said in a statement. “Politics is about making people’s lives better, and I’m more than prepared to take that message far and wide.”
The party elected Brenda Hoskie as its treasurer. Hoskie, from Springstead, is an enrolled member of the Navajo Nation and chair of the McKinley County Democrats. She defeated Daniel Alfredo Garcia and Barbara Jordan to become secretary.
Members elected Julie Rochman as Secretary. Rochman, of Albuquerque, defeated Joseph Ortiz to become treasurer.
The Republican Party of New Mexico elected its party officers in December.

(Photo by Mathieu Lewis-Rolland/Getty Images)ISSAQUAH, Wash. — In the wake of recent natural disasters, state leaders across the country are finding that emergency support from the federal government is no longer a given.
Under President Donald Trump, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has denied federal assistance for tornadoes in Arkansas, flooding in West Virginia and a windstorm in Washington state. It also has refused North Carolina’s request for extended relief funding in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.
While it’s not uncommon for the feds to turn down some requests for disaster declarations, which unlock federal aid, state leaders say the Trump administration’s denials have taken them by surprise. White House officials are signaling a new approach to federal emergency response, even as Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem threaten to shut down FEMA altogether.
“The Federal Government focuses its support on truly catastrophic disasters—massive hurricanes, devastating earthquakes, or wide-scale attacks on the homeland,” Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the National Security Council, which advises the president on issues of national security, said in a statement to Stateline.
Hughes said state and local governments “often remain an impediment to their own community’s resilience.” He called on states to take on a more extensive role.
“States must have adequate emergency management staff, adoption and enforcement of modern building codes, responsible planning and strategic investment to reduce future risk, commonsense policies that prioritize preparedness over politics, disaster reserve funds to handle what should be routine emergencies, pre-negotiated mutual aid and contingency contracts that speed up recovery, and above all, an appetite to own the problem,” the statement said.
State emergency management leaders say the federal retreat from disaster response has upended a long-established system.
“This is very unusual,” said Karina Shagren, communications director with the Washington Military Department, which oversees the state’s emergency management division. “This is the first time in recent memory that we have hit all the indicators to get FEMA’s public assistance program and we’ve been denied.”
Michael Coen, who served as chief of staff at FEMA during the Obama and Biden administrations, said the president has “broad discretion” to approve or deny disaster requests, regardless of whether they meet specified conditions. If Trump intends to curtail federal support, Coen said, he should give states clear guidelines.
“They should have a dialogue with the states, so the states aren’t spinning their wheels making requests that are going to get denied,” Coen said.
He added that states need guidance if they’re expected to build emergency management programs to take on what the feds once handled. Not all states, Coen said, have the capacity to replicate those functions. And disasters are expected to increase in frequency and severity because of climate change.
“Having that capability in every single state instead of having one FEMA is not the best use of tax dollars to prepare for the worst day,” he said.
Historically, FEMA has coordinated the federal response during emergency situations. In the National Security Council statement, Hughes said Trump has promptly authorized “life-saving emergency support to states during and in the immediate aftermath of disasters.”
But the agency’s larger role has focused on recovery after disasters, assessing damage and distributing funding to help communities rebuild. Now, some communities are finding that support is no longer a sure thing.
Issaquah, Washington, was among the cities hit hard by the “bomb cyclone” that ripped through the state last November. Severe winds killed two people in the state, knocked out power for hundreds of thousands of residents and caused millions in damage, state officials said.
A city of about 40,000 residents in the Cascade foothills, Issaquah’s costs from the storm totaled $3.8 million — covering road repairs, removal of 800 tons of tree debris and overtime pay for first responders. Mayor Mary Lou Pauly said the city has seen four events since 2020 that qualified for federal disaster aid, with no previous denials. If Washington is unable to win its appeal with FEMA, she said, Issaquah will take a financial hit to its reserves, leaving it more vulnerable to future storms.
“We put a lot of investment in being resilient,” Pauly said. “When you get to a number like $3.8 million, that is too big of a number for us to be able to rebuild without assistance. Our residents pay federal taxes, and this is what they think they pay them for, this is what they expect their national government to do. They do not want me to set property taxes 100% higher.”
Pauly echoed Coen’s view that FEMA should give states a clear outline of the role it will play.
“What we all want to know is what are the rules of the game?” she said. “If the criteria has changed, then why aren’t we getting told about it?”
Washington state leaders said they were shocked when FEMA denied their request for $34 million to help repair roads, utilities and power systems. Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson said the state’s application met all of the “very clear criteria to qualify.” He has vowed to appeal the decision.
“We were really relying on that funding,” said Shagren, of the Washington Military Department. “If the appeal is denied, our local jurisdictions will have to prioritize which projects they can move forward with and which they don’t. They’re going to be impacted greatly. This wasn’t some small storm.”
Other states also have been surprised by FEMA denials. Arkansas suffered 14 tornadoes last month, triggering a request for a disaster declaration from Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders. But the feds told state leaders to handle it on their own.
“[I]t has been determined that the damage from this event was not of such severity and magnitude as to be beyond the capabilities of the state, affected local governments, and voluntary agencies,” the federal government’s denial read, according to Arkansas Times.
Sanders has appealed that decision, saying the disaster caused “widespread destruction” that requires federal help.
In West Virginia, state leaders asked for disaster aid to cover 14 counties that were struck by flooding in February. But FEMA denied individual assistance to seven of those counties. Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey said in a statement that he is looking at options to appeal, but praised the Trump administration for its “strong support” following the floods.
Democratic leaders in the state have called on Morrisey to demand more help from the feds, WOWK reported.
Meanwhile, FEMA has said it will no longer match 100% of North Carolina’s spending to recover from September’s Hurricane Helene. Democratic Gov. Josh Stein said the cost share was crucial to the state’s efforts to rebuild.
“The need in western North Carolina remains immense — people need debris removed, homes rebuilt, and roads restored,” Stein said in a statement this month, according to NC Newsline. “I am extremely disappointed and urge the President to reconsider FEMA’s bad decision, even for 90 days.”

(Photo courtesy of the U.S. Fire Administration)The state of South Dakota will spend up to $250,000 to clear PFAS chemicals from local areas in the coming year.
Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, known as PFAS or “forever chemicals,” break down at an exceedingly slow rate in the natural environment. They’re found in products like nonstick cookware, water-resistant items like umbrellas or rain jackets, and cleaning products, among other items. 
Concerns about their prevalence in the environment and their impacts on human health have grown steadily in recent years, as they’ve been discovered in drinking water, fish and food packaging.
SD House defeats bill requiring ‘forever chemical’ labels on firefighting gear

PFAS are also found in a kind of firefighting foam that’s fallen out of favor, but fire departments around the U.S., including in South Dakota, still have some and need to dispose of it.
The South Dakota Board of Water and Natural Resources awarded a $250,000 Solid Waste Management grant to the state Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources (DANR) last month to help communities collect and dispose of some PFAS sources. The citizen-led water resources board evaluates projects and signs off on funding through the solid waste program.
The grant will allow fire departments with PFAS foam, or schools whose science labs may still have chemicals, to summon the department’s contractor to collect and safely dispose of them at an out-of-state location. The state will also reach out directly to agencies, and has begun to contact fire departments, airports, and other public entities by phone to find out if they have PFAS for disposal.
The money comes from the Inspection, Compliance, and Remediation program, funded by a mix of fuel tank inspection fees and the sale of lottery tickets. Typically, cleanup grants through the program cover 80% of cleanup costs, with the entity requesting cleanup expected to cover the rest.
The South Dakota Legislature approved Senate Bill 33 this year to let DANR put $250,000 of program funds toward PFAS cleanups with no local match.
Andy Bruels with the DANR told the water resources board in March that a previous PFAS cleanup a few years ago cleaned up “a fair amount of material.” The contractor hauled it out of state for disposal, as typical landfills can’t adequately prevent the chemicals from continued seepage into the environment.
The legislation also allowed for the grants to be used in waste tire cleanup, but Bruels said the primary focus will be PFAS and that it’s unlikely much will be left for that secondary purpose.

(Photo courtesy of FEMA)Attorney General James Uthmeier settled a suit Monday accusing the former Federal Emergency Management Agency head and a FEMA supervisor of discrimination against supporters of then-presidential candidate Donald Trump during disaster relief efforts following Hurricanes Helene and Milton.
The suit came in November, after the supervisor advised relief workers in Florida to avoid houses displaying yard signs favoring Trump in Lake Placid, in Highlands County. Uthmeier agreed to drop the suit in exchange for an apologetic letter on behalf of the federal government, according to the notice of dismissal filed Monday.
“The United States and Ms. Criswell regret the actions giving rise to this case and agree with the State of Florida that those actions never should have occurred,” the letter states. “We are also hopeful that, in light of all we have provided, the State of Florida and its people can be confident that FEMA is striving to avoid a repeat of the events giving rise to this case and that the agency is committed to the fair, compassionate, and even-handed delivery of services.”
The letter from the U.S. Department of Justice also states that FEMA commits to providing political-discrimination training for employees.
Deanne Criswell, the former FEMA head, didn’t admit wrongdoing, and the letter directs responsibility to Marn’i Washington, the supervisor. As part of the settlement, Criswell and the state agreed to pay their own attorney fees, and Uthmeier also dropped the claims against Washington.
Former Attorney General Ashley Moody, whom Gov. Ron DeSantis appointed to the U.S. Senate, originally sought nominal and punitive damages from Criswell and Washington.
Criswell announced on Nov. 9 that the agency had fired Washington and called her behavior a clear violation of FEMA’s core values and principles. Moody’s complaint cited multiple interviews in which Washington said the message she sent to the relief workers, which the Daily Wire published, lacked context and that her supervisors knew about and encouraged her decision to avoid the homes of Trump supporters.
In a letter to the federal judge in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, Washington wrote that she had received numerous death threats and that she didn’t have knowledge of the suit for months.
“The effort for scapegoating at my expense has methodically been implemented to the point that all of my inquiries and fair treatment throughout this process has been negated and intentionally delayed,” Washington wrote to U.S. District Judge Donald Middlebrooks.
Uthmeier’s office did not immediately respond to Florida Phoenix’s request for comment.

(Photo provided by the Indiana Department of Correction)Clemency hearings for Indiana death row inmate Benjamin Ritchie will take place in the coming weeks as the condemned man’s legal team fights to delay — or stop altogether — a pending May 20 execution.
Ritchie’s clemency petition, signed by the inmate on April 22, argued that he was “born with a severely damaged brain due to prenatal alcohol exposure.”

“His mother drank nearly every day during her pregnancy with Ben. She also smoked marijuana daily and took other drugs,” according to the filing. Lawyers additionally noted that a geneticist diagnosed Ritchie with Partial Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (pFAS), “meaning his brain damage limits Ben’s functioning to that similar to a person with intellectual disability.”
Ritchie’s team further pointed a recent ruling handed down by the Indiana Supreme Court in which justices “unanimously agreed that Ben has brain damage caused by prenatal exposure to alcohol and other toxins.” But the court was split, 2-2, on whether Ritchie should be allowed to present evidence “of the effect of that damage on his behavior” on the night of his crime.
With clemency, the governor — in tandem with Indiana’s Parole Board — can elect to commute a death sentence to life imprisonment or grant a pardon for a criminal offense.
The parole board announced two upcoming clemency hearings for Ritchie to consider his petition: one on May 5 at the Indiana State Prison, located in Michigan City; and another on May 12 at the Indiana Government Center in Indianapolis.
Both meetings are open to the public. The parole board will conduct a 10 a.m. interview with Ritchie at the state prison hearing. During the latter meeting, the board will hear testimony in favor of clemency from 9 a.m. to 11:00 a.m., and testimony opposed to clemency from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m.
The developments follow a ruling issued earlier this month by Indiana Supreme Court justices to set a May 20 execution date for Ritchie, who was convicted in 2002 for killing a law enforcement officer from Beech Grove.
What to expect
The Indiana Constitution gives the governor exclusive authority to grant reprieves, commutations and pardons for all offenses — including capital crimes — except for treason and impeachment. The parole board is tasked by state law with assisting in that process.
The five-member board, specifically, is responsible for conducting an investigation into the merits of a clemency petition. 
Three clemencies have been granted in Indiana since 1976, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.
Shortly after an execution date is set, the board sets a schedule for the filing of clemency petition; submission of supporting materials; an interview and psychiatric examination of the death row inmate; a public hearing; and a public announcement of the parole board’s recommendation.
Story continues below.

Members of the press and the general public are permitted to attend the inmate’s interview. 
The subsequent public hearing typically takes place two or three days prior to the execution date and is held in the Indiana Government Center in Indianapolis.
Each side — the state and counsel for the death row inmate — is given 90 minutes to present their case for or against clemency. The parole board presides over the hearing, and frequently interjects with questions.
Once complete, board members individually submit their recommendations to the governor, who has final say over the matter.
Defense team seeks a stay
In a separate legal filing last week, Ritchie’s defense team petitioned the state supreme court for a new hearing to reconsider the inmate’s request for post-conviction relief.
They’re also seeking a stay to pause the execution altogether “to permit the full and fair consideration of the issues presented” in the rehearing request. Ritchie’s latest petition, attorneys emphasized, “has asserted unusually complex questions of fact and law that would be aided by oral argument or further briefing on the issues if the Court allows.”
The high court denied Ritchie any post-conviction relief in a decision issued April 15, following a series of exhausted appeals previously filed by the inmate and his legal team.



In 2004, former Indiana Gov. Joe Kernan commuted the death sentence of Darnell Williams to life imprisonment without parole on the basis that his co-defendant initially received a life sentence, making it “unjust” to execute only Williams.
Kernan, a Democrat, commuted another death sentence in 2005 of Michael Daniels, emphasizing doubts about Daniels’ personal responsibility for the crime and the quality of legal process leading to his death sentence.
The most recent was in 2009, when then-Gov. Mitch Daniels commuted the death sentence for Arthur Baird, who killed his pregnant wife and her parents in 1985. Although the parole board denied his petition for clemency, Mitch Daniels granted Baird clemency one day before the scheduled execution, in part citing questions about Baird’s sanity.
The former Republican governor additionally noted that life without parole in murder cases was not an option at the time of Baird’s sentencing; it became an option in 1994.



Included in the post-conviction filings were claims that his trial and post-conviction counsel “provided ineffective assistance” by not investigating Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) and by failing to “analyze the effect of Ritchie’s childhood exposure to excessive amounts of lead.”
Additionally, counsel emphasized that Ritchie was only 20 years old at the time of the crime, and “recent developments in the law” require the state supreme court to consider his age at sentencing. Ritchie’s team held, too, that the state “engaged in prosecutorial misconduct” throughout his jury trial.
Chief Justice Loretta Rush, who disagreed with the decision to deny further post-conviction relief proceedings, said in her opinion that she believed evidence submitted to the court suggested “a strong likelihood” that Ritchie suffered from FASD when he murdered William Toney, the police officer, in 2000.
Indiana Supreme Court sets May 20 execution date for death row inmate Benjamin Ritchie

Rush noted that Ritchie had recently been evaluated by two FASD experts, and she preferred to hold off on an execution date so the court has more time to “receive and consider” the experts’ evaluations.
But Justices Derek Molter and Geoffrey Slaughter said in their opinion that “what Ritchie’s experts turned up is irrelevant.” The issue before the court “is not whether Ritchie suffered from FASD in 2000 or whether he does so today,” they said. Rather, the justices must decide whether Ritchie’s trial lawyers “were constitutionally ineffective during sentencing for failing to investigate the possibility that Ritchie suffered from FASD then.”
The affirming justices maintained that Ritchie was unable to show a “reasonable possibility” of relief. 
Per court documents, the underlying crime began as a police pursuit of a stolen van on Sept. 29, 2000. Toney, the Beech Grove police officer, later pursued Ritchie on foot. Ritchie ultimately fired four shots at Toney, who did not survive the shooting.
The court set a Monday afternoon deadline for Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita’s office to respond to the defense counsel’s motions.
The Republican attorney general requested an execution date for Ritchie last fall.
Executions were put on hold for 15 years in Indiana until convicted killer Joseph Corcoran was put to death in December. The state paid $900,000 on execution drugs but won’t say how much was purchased. 
Ritchie and six other men remain on the state’s death row at the Indiana State Prison in Michigan City.

“As it relates to cannabis markets, Missouri is pretty famously the model to follow,” said Mackenzie Slade, CEO and owner of New York-based Cannabis Public Policy Consulting. “So I’m very interested in doing a super deep dive.”
In March, the state issued a request for proposals looking for a vendor to conduct a cannabis market and economic impact study. Currently, Missouri has issued nearly 400 cannabis licenses to operate full-scale cultivation and manufacturing facilities and dispensaries. The state will also eventually have 144 microbusiness licenses, which are limited in size and scope and meant to benefit disadvantaged business owners.

In 2024, Missouri sold$1.46 billion in total marijuana sales in the state’s second year of adult-use marijuana, outperforming states with a longer history of marijuana legalization like Arizona, Colorado and Nevada.
The results of the study will help the state determine “whether or when the state will be required to issue additional cannabis facility licenses and, if so, how many, where, and of what type,” according to a March press release from the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services.
Missouri received three responses that fit the requirements of having at least five years of experience specializing in the economic impact of marijuana, or at least 10 years of experience conducting economic impact studies in general.
The responding agencies were Slade’s firm, St. Louis-based Capital Consulting Services and Oregon-based Whitney Economics. The firm that wins the bid will be awarded the $X million contract. 
Beau Whitney’s company, which conducts studies globally, gathers data monthly on the cannabis industry for each legal state on business licenses, supply capacity and revenues. 
“I have data that goes back multiple years,” he said, “and so I can say, ‘Here’s the progression of the state and its program,’” along with providing future projections 10 years out. 
Whitney calls Missouri a “success story.” In one of his recent reports that looked at investment potential nationwide, he found there’s still opportunities for growth, development and investment into the Missouri market. 
“And that’s unusual,” he said. “In Oregon where I’m based out of, I just gave an update to the Office of Economic Analysis and I basically said, there’s no investment opportunity in Oregon for any new businesses. Zero for the next 10 years.”
That’s because there’s too much supply, an over saturation of licenses and prices are so low that people can’t make any profit, he said. 
“My goal with Missouri is to give them the data that they need to avoid that scenario,” Whitney said.
Slade has seen the same in New York, where her firm has been based for about seven years. 
Her company administers a national survey on cannabis use, which essentially measures and quantifies demand behavior for consumers. One of the things that they use it for, she said, at a national level is to try to understand how states are performing based on their policies. 
“And Missouri continuously outperforms other states, relative to their date of sale,” she said. “…because they were able to stand up a market so quickly.”
Secrecy around ownership records raises questions about Missouri marijuana networks

That was in part because Missouri limited the number of licenses to get operational within just a few months. For the study, Slade proposed to use the state’s track and trace data to identify the efficiencies of the licenses. 
“That’s a prime example of where we would uncover some extremely important considerations for policy,” she said. “And I do believe that the intent of the study is to identify areas of policy that need to be updated.”
Tracey Jeffries’ company, Capital Consulting Services, has helped governments with economic feasibility studies for 15 years on a state and federal level, and she’s a certified Missouri minority-owned business enterprise as a Black woman owner. According to state policy, winners of any state contract must employ 10% minority-owned and 5% women-owned businesses. 
The advantage Jeffries believes she brings to the program is knowing her state and its economy, having led projects throughout Missouri. 
“DHSS has done a great job,” she said, “but it’s timely to have the feasibility study because this will benefit the regulators, the businesses, and most importantly to me, in my opinion, the community.”
State law says the cannabis regulators may “lift or ease any limit on the number of [cannabis] licensees or certificate holders in order to meet the demand for marijuana in the state and to ensure a competitive market while also preventing an over-concentration of marijuana facilities within the boundaries of any particular local government.” 
Experts generally agree that Missouri’s decision to only issue the minimum licenses allowed under its constitution has been the key to the industry’s boom. However, critics have long argued that the decision created a monopoly that’s kept out opportunities for people who were most impacted by the War on Drugs. While the microbusiness license program was included in the 2022 consutitional amendment to address inequities, the limitations on what these businesses can do make it difficult to turn a profit. 
If the department does issue additional licenses, at least half of those licenses must be awarded to owners of cannabis microbusiness facilities that have been operational for at least a year.
The study will also provide information regarding the overall economic stability of the regulated market, including strengths and risks, with a special emphasis on the market’s impact on economically distressed areas of the state. 
Jeremy Washington, spokesman for the Office of Administration, the agency that handles contracting for the state, said there isn’t a “published schedule for the completion of the evaluation process.” 
However, upon completion of the evaluation process, the MissouriBUYS Bid Board will be updated to reflect the changed status.  In addition, the entire procurement file will be published on the Division of Purchasing’s awarded bid and contract document site.

More than 3 million people with Medicare could be eligible for the difficult-to-find and expensive weight-loss drug under new guidance which can cover the medication for patients who are obese or those who have a history of heart disease and are at risk of a heart attack or stroke.  (Photo Illustration by Scott Olson/Getty Images)The Trump administration this month scrapped a Biden-era proposal that would have required state Medicaid programs and allowed federal Medicare to pay for some GLP-1s for obesity treatment. Instead, state Medicaid programs will retain the choice of whether to cover the high-priced medications for their residents.
The drugs, which have historically been prescribed to diabetic patients, also help patients lose weight and have grown in popularity among doctors and patients. But they are generally too expensive for most people to afford without insurance.
While doctors and patient advocates say these drugs are critical to helping patients struggling with obesity and can save money in the long run by reducing comorbidities such as heart disease, others say the medications are just too expensive for most states to afford. More than a dozen state Medicaid programs have opted to cover GLP-1s for obesity treatment, and the proposed Biden rule would have asked all states to figure out how to pay for them. But now, advocates fear these drugs may continue to be out of reach for many.
“It’s unfortunate that they’re excluding a whole class of medications that seem to have a tremendous number of health benefits to patients,” Dr. Nicholas Pennings, chair of family medicine at Campbell University in Buies Creek, North Carolina, said in an interview.




I think that’s just part of the inherent bias towards the treatment of people with obesity.


– Dr. Nicholas Pennings, chair of family medicine at Campbell University



GLP-1s, which stand for glucagon-like peptide-1, are a class of drugs that balance blood sugar levels. They’ve long been prescribed to patients with Type 2 diabetes. But since the drugs also curb hunger signals, doctors may prescribe these drugs — including popular brands Wegovy and Ozempic — to help patients lose weight.
Medicaid is a joint federal-state funded program that mostly serves people with lower incomes under the age of 65 or who have a disability. The federal Medicare program focuses primarily on people above the age of 65, no matter their income.
How and whether to cover expensive treatments and drugs can be a significant deliberation for state Medicaid directors. In North Carolina, where 70% of people struggle with being overweight or obese, officials opted to begin covering the drugs for weight loss last year. That coverage has been a game changer, said Pennings, who continues to treat Medicaid patients.
“They are expensive, but there’s a lot of other medications that are expensive too. Why is it that obesity medications and diabetes medications are being selected out?” Pennings said. “I think that’s just part of the inherent bias towards the treatment of people with obesity, feeling like it’s cheating or not necessary.”
The list price for Wegovy is around $1,300 per month, and for Ozempic, around $1,000. Even so, the skyrocketing popularity of these drugs has prompted at least 14 state Medicaid departments to begin covering these drugs to treat obesity in the past decade.
In addition to North Carolina, those states include California, Delaware, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Virginia and Wisconsin.
An annual survey of Medicaid directors from health policy research group KFF recently found that half of the 47 responding states not already covering the drugs were considering doing so.
As demand for weight-loss drugs rises, states grapple with Medicaid coverage

In January, the National Association of Medicaid Directors told the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services that state Medicaid departments had “significant concerns over the fiscal impacts” of the Biden proposal to require coverage of GLP-1s, and “strongly recommend that CMS maintain the current state option to cover or not cover anti-obesity medications.”
But others say covering the drugs will yield long-term savings.
John Cawley, a professor of economics and public policy at Cornell University who has studied the economic impacts of obesity, has found that obesity essentially doubles a person’s annual health care costs due to comorbidities such as heart disease, fatty liver disease and kidney disease.
He’s found that weight loss among those with extreme obesity, with a BMI of 40 or higher, can yield substantial reductions in medical care costs.
Cawley added that state Medicaid programs “have a lot of flexibility” in ensuring costs don’t get out of control, by, for example, covering a newly available generic version of GLP-1s, requiring prior authorization, and asking patients to try behavioral programs before getting a prescription.
North Carolina’s Medicaid department began covering GLP-1s for obesity in August. The state has been able to afford GLP-1 coverage by negotiating rebates, or discounts, with drug manufacturers, and by getting the federal government to cover some costs. Department leaders think lowering obesity will save the state money in the long run, said Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for North Carolina Medicaid.
He said that one of the benefits of Medicaid is that “we get to choose, as a state, where we want to make kind of those extra investments or not.” He added that covering the medications could be potentially financially feasible for other states.
“Each program is different and has its own pressures. It would be welcome to be able to come together with other states to be able to negotiate broader deals,” Ludlam said. “If North Carolina is able to get a good deal, I don’t know why other states wouldn’t be able to participate in that.”
States consider high costs, possible savings of covering weight-loss drugs for their workers

In 2023, Connecticut enacted a law requiring Medicaid to cover obesity treatment services. The program began covering GLP-1s for weight loss, but costs were significant enough that the state told providers this year that it is now focusing on other obesity treatments instead.
Sean Scanlon, the Connecticut comptroller, said that not covering GLP-1s is “shortsighted, bad policy.” The state health plan, which takes care of teachers and other state employees, has been covering the drugs for weight loss since 2023. The plan controls costs by only prescribing GLP-1s after patients go through some online weight-loss counseling, said Scanlon.
“The most fiscally conservative thing we can do is give people tools that will save the taxpayers money in the long run,” he said in an interview. “And GLP-1 drugs are one of the best tools that we have to ensure that the taxpayers are not going to pay more money for the health care of hundreds of millions of people in the long run.”
It’s unclear whether the federal government will reverse course. In the past, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has recommended “three good meals a day” and behavioral changes rather than weight-loss medication.
But this month, Kennedy told CBS News he’s considering a regulatory framework to have Medicare and Medicaid cover these “extraordinary drugs” in the future, once their cost goes down.
“Ideally, over the long-term, we’d like to see those drugs available for people after they try other interventions,” Kennedy said.

Sean Tarwater, a Republican from Stilwell, convinced the 2025 Legislature to reduce by two-thirds the amount of state income tax credits available to incentivize construction or rehabilitation of low-income housing statewide. Since 2022, Kansas has used the tax credit to make faster progress on addressing the state's housing shortage and advocates of the credit opposed the cutback touted by Tarwater. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Assistant city manager Braxton Copley pleaded with Kansas House members to reject a proposal to end the state’s participation in a tax incentive program shown to be successful in promoting construction or rehabilitation of low-income housing.
Copley, representing the city of Topeka, stood at a microphone in February at the Capitol to address Rep. Sean Tarwater, chairman of the House commerce committee and the sole public proponent of a bill eliminating Kansas’ low-income housing tax credit, or LIHTC, on July 1. Copley wasn’t alone in opposition to the bill. Nearly 40 organizations and individuals offered testimony denouncing details and timing of House Bill 2119.
“Simply put, government cannot afford to construct and manage a sufficient amount of housing to meet the needs,” Copley said. “Developers are unable and unwilling to construct low-income housing because the low rents will not allow them to achieve a market rate of return. The LIHTC program leverages tax credits to induce private developers to construct affordable housing by providing them a market rate of return.”
In exchange for state and federal tax credits, the affordability of the incentivized housing units was assured for terms of 15 years or 30 years with covenants placed on the real estate.
Copley said undercutting the state’s approach to LIHTC would exacerbate homelessness in communities throughout Kansas.
Tarwater, a Republican from Stilwell, listened as a string of community activists, investors and bankers expanded on Copley’s thesis.
“I must say there are 39 opponents and I’m the only proponent, evidently,” Tarwater said. “This is not fair. You guys are going to need more people.”
Fast forward two months, and Tarwater pushed across the finish line on the final day of the 2025 legislative session the contents of House Bill 2289, which included a modified version of the much-maligned HB 2119. Instead of deleting LIHTC in July, the program would survive, on a shorter financial leash, until 2028.
“This is not exactly what we wanted when we set down this road,” Tarwater said. “We took a page out of Ronald Reagan’s book, and we’re going to take what we can get today and fight for the rest tomorrow.”
Tarwater objected to the ultimate cost of a program adding each year to tax credits that had to be honored by the state. Over a 10-year period, for example, the compounding effect of $25 million annual allocations of LIHTC tax credits could result in a state obligation of $250 million. The figure wouldn’t represent a direct expenditure by the state of Kansas, but would reflect the amount of future tax revenue foregone by the state as investors redeemed credits against their state tax liability.
Last week, Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly signed the bundled bill rather than veto the measure and push the issue to the 2026 Legislature.
 
Financial haircut
The new Kansas law set a maximum on the amount of state housing tax credits issued this year at $25 million. In the final three years of LIHTC, only $8.8 million in annual credits would be available from the state for investors in affordable housing.
The law discontinued the state’s LIHTC match for investors receiving the 4% federal low-income housing credit, but retained the state match for developments qualifying for a 9% federal low-income housing credit.
Sen. Stephen Owens, R-Hesston, led negotiations on LIHTC legislation for the Senate. He viewed the final bill as a compromise that resulted in a diminished incentive, but provided a window of opportunity to convince lawmakers it should continue.
“This came to us from the House as a complete elimination of the low-income housing tax program,” he said. “Recognizing that there’s also some value to this program, the Senate’s position was to go back in and reduce it by about 70%.”
The program is managed by the Kansas Housing Resources Corporation, a self-supporting, nonprofit public corporation tasked with helping Kansans gain access to safe, affordable housing.
Emily Sharp, of the state Housing Resource Corporation, said substantial reduction in annual tax credit awards and deletion of the 4% program would diminish the state’s ability to fill wide gaps in housing. There will be a bigger scramble for the remaining credits, she said.
The 2028 sunset to the LIHTC should be concerning to communities struggling to meet housing demand, she said.
She said a 2021 state housing survey was conducted in collaboration with the governor’s Office of Rural Prosperity. The first Kansas assessment of its kind in 30 years showed an acute shortage. It was estimated the state needed to add at least 3,800 units annually, but was falling far below that level.
The National Low-Income Housing Coalition estimated Kansas had a deficit of 50,000 affordable housing units.
“We need more houses,” Sharp said. “Nationwide we’re seeing a shortage of housing. Kansas is no exception.”
 
Evolution of thought
In 2022, the Legislature and governor responded with passage of the affordable housing tax credit act that put in place a d0llar-for-dollar match by the state to the federal low-income housing credit.
The objective was to expand the volume of tax credits available to investors. The credits could be sold to generate revenue for construction of housing. The lower debt assumed by developers meant tenants could be offered below-market rental rates.
The state’s rate of housing development through state or federal investment tripled after implementation of the Kansas reform law three years ago. In 2021, state and federal government resources were associated with construction of 1,028 homes in Kansas. In contrast, 6,500 Kansas homes were funded in 2023 and 2024.
Ryan Vincent, executive director of the state Housing Resources Corporation, said the elimination of the state’s tax credit for housing — currently scheduled for 2028 — would mean that Kansas lagged further behind other states dangling lucrative incentives to attract housing investment.
“Eliminating the KAHTC would send a negative message to current and potential investors, signaling that housing development is a risky prospect in our state,” Vincent said. “Potential partners will avoid investing in an uncertain environment.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/P3051340-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-28 14:11:57.316531

(Kristian Thacker for West Virginia Watch)Morgantown voters on Tuesday will decide the future of a law that would prohibit homeless people from camping on public property.
Early voting in the city’s election has been underway since April 16. 
Morgantown City Council passed the ordinance in September, joining dozens of cities around the country to prohibit public camping after the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a similar camping ban in Grants Pass, Oregon, amid record levels of homelessness. 
Morgantown’s law, which has so far not gone into effect, would prohibit camping on any public property — including streets, parks and trails — and also prohibit storing personal property in public areas. Second and third violations of the law are punishable by fines of $200 and $300 and/or 30 days in jail, respectively. 
After the ordinance passed, Morgantown Coalition for Housing Action successfully petitioned to have it repealed or put it on the ballot during a city election. Council voted four to three for the latter in November. 
According to the city, the camping ban appears on the right side of the ballot under “Ballot issues.” Voting “yes” on “Article 1157 Prohibiting Camping on Public Property” would be a vote to repeal the ordinance. Voting “no” would be a vote in favor of keeping the ordinance in place. 
Voters will also decide their council members in wards two, four and six and a ballot issue to allow the city manager to live outside the city while in office.
Polls open at 6:30 a.m. Tuesday and close at 7:30 p.m.

Witnesses spotted the Otero Fire in the bosque east of Socorro and the Alamo Fire in a neighborhood in Grants on Sunday evening. The Grants Fire is fully contained at between 3 and 5 acres, said Forestry spokesperson George Ducker. Despite progress overnight in Socorro, where crews built a fire line across the northern edge of the 360-acre fire, the Otero Fire is 0% contained, Ducker said. 
The causes of both fires remains under investigation, Ducker said, though they occurred amid high winds and ongoing drought across the state. The National Interagency Fire Center earlier this month warned that most of the state would experience above-normal wildfire risk, and that the risk would spread to the western two-thirds of the state as May approaches. A new forecast is expected in the next few days. 
High winds around 7 p.m. pushed the Alamo Fire on the east side Grants into structures, burning eight structures and six outbuildings and prompting evacuations. Residents are being allowed to return this morning, Ducker said, and crews will focus on watching for hotspots and dealing with the burned structures, now that the fire is fully contained.

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM)Hundreds of leaders at colleges and universities from across the United States recently signed  an open letter to the Trump Administration, rebuking “the unprecedented government overreach and political interference now endangering American higher education.”
Only one New Mexico higher-education leader signed the letter — from a small college in Santa Fe.
In the first 100 days, the Trump administration has frozen billions of dollars in research grants and threatened further cuts if universities fail to comply with policies to reshape admissions, curriculum and speech on campus. Broadly, the Trump and Republicans have alleged higher education indoctrinates students with left-wing ideologies, and are using federal funds as leverage to require universities to change campus policies.
Last week, Harvard University sued the Trump administration over its freezing of $2.2 billion in grants after the school refused to comply with federal demands to limit activism on campus.
The letter from academics, released last week by the American Association of Colleges and Universities, pushes back against the Trump Administration, penning a defense of higher education.
“We are open to constructive reform and do not oppose legitimate government oversight,” the letter states. “However, we must oppose undue government intrusion in the lives of those who learn, live, and work on our campuses. We will always seek effective and fair financial practices, but we must reject the coercive use of public research funding.”
As of Monday morning, the letter had amassed 523 signatures from colleges, universities and scholarly societies.
Leaders from University of New Mexico and New Mexico State University, the state’s largest schools, did not sign on.When reached for comment, Cinnamon Blair, a spokesperson for UNM wrote: “What I can share is that UNM’s participation in any statements is an internal administrative decision, and will be reflected in the public record.”
New Mexico State University spokesperson Amanda Bradford confirmed the administration had not signed the letter, stating: “The university has no further comments on this topic at this time.”
As of press time, Thom Chesney, president of Southwestern College, a private graduate-level school tucked away on Santa Fe’s Southside, remains the only New Mexico school leader on the list.
Southwestern College offers a variety of graduate-level programs and certificates, including: master’s degrees in counseling, art therapy and consciousness in action; as well as a Ph.D in visionary practice and regenerative leadership.
In an interview with Source NM, Chesney said higher education is facing unprecedented threats at multiple levels. Chesney took the position at Southwestern College eight months ago, following three years as president at Clarke University in Iowa and nearly eight years as president of Brookhaven College in Texas, among other academic postings. He’s been in higher education for nearly 30 years and started his work in academia teaching English, American and British literature and the humanities.
“We’ve not seen this before,” Chesney said. “The federal government stepping in and making demands about how we admit, who we admit and what we teach — that flies directly in the face of independence, of building a curriculum.”
Chesney told Source NM that this was the right time for his college to speak out, and said other New Mexican institutions are trying to navigate a difficult position.
“I’m going to defend my colleagues, my peers from the public and private institutions in New Mexico, who haven’t signed the letter,” Chesney said. “They’re not on the sidelines, they’re not silent, in assent or giving in — we can’t assume any of that. They are absolutely, I believe, thinking through where their space is, at this time, for this type of response.”
Chesney said the letter he signed offers the chance to be part of “a collective, unified voice.”
“It fits in with not only the mission of my institution, but also the broader need to respond in a call to action for dialogue, for decorum to come together and recognize we have a shared space, to identify the successes, the flaws — all of that, rather than react reactionarily,” he said.
Chesney noted that all higher education institutions face threats, regardless of size and programs. Southwestern College’s enrollment is just over 320 students. While his institution does not receive federal research grants, some of the students rely on Title IV funds to attend college. The college also offers a counseling center at which its counseling and therapy students receive real-world experience and provide low-cost or no-cost services for 500 Santa Fe residents.
“If someone comes in and says ‘you can’t do that anymore,’ that’s a threat,” he said. “That threatens the wellness of Santa Fe’s Southside, Santa Fe in general and ultimately New Mexico, in my mind.”
Not only did Chesney sign the letter, he hopes his participation in a national dialogue creates an opportunity for students to become more engaged with faculty and administrators in addressing the future of higher education.
And he has a message for prospective students who are considering further training or schooling: “Don’t become cynical.”
“No one should give up on that dream or that aspiration to do the kind of learning that leads them into opportunities to serve and create and have jobs that are for the greater, common good,” Chesney said.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly announced Friday she had signed into law 11 bills, meeting a deadline and cementing public education funding, tax incentives for major data centers and a new crime for possessing, creating or distributing AI-generated child pornography.
The bills were bipartisan, Kelly said, as she signed them before the end of the 10-day period she has to take action after the Legislature delivers them to her.
Crime and law enforcement
Senate Bill 186 crafted first-time, clear protections for those who are the subject of AI-generated imagery without their consent. It’s an effort to mitigate the harms caused by technology, “in both the digital realm and the physical world,” Kelly said in a news release.
“Given the rise of AI-enabled crime, enhancing public safety for our fellow Kansans is crucial,” Kelly said.
The law applies to the alteration of real photos or generating new material from scratch, said Rep. Brad Barrett, an Osage City Republican who sat on the House committee that heard and negotiated the original bill. 
“This legislation strengthens our child exploitation laws to protect kids from this evolving threat and also updates our breach of privacy law to shield adults from having their images maliciously altered to appear nude or sexually explicit when they have an expectation of privacy,” he said.
The law adds to the definition of sex crimes within the Kansas Criminal Code to include AI-generated material. It also modifies existing criminal bond-setting procedure to hike up bond rates for any defendant with prior convictions of sexually violent crimes. The minimum bond for those defendants is now $750,000, which Senate Minority Leader Dinah Sykes said addresses patterns of “predatory behavior.”
“This part of the bill ensures the safety of victims comes first,” Sykes, a Lenexa Democrat, said. “By requiring the consideration of similar prior acts when setting bond, we can alleviate some of the fear for victims.”
Senate Bill 156 increases the amount of money inmates can receive from the Kansas Department of Corrections for losses, personal injury or property damage.
Senate Bill 204 seals criminal and juvenile cases — meaning information is kept secret — until an arrest warrant is executed. It also creates a new appointment process for trustees of county law libraries.
Senate Bill 237 empowers law enforcement officers to investigate violations of the Scrap Metal Theft Reduction Act, which targets scrap metal dealers. It was initially proposed by the Wichita Police Department.
Industry and development
Kelly said a new law that incentivizes major data center projects in Kansas gives “the state another tool in the toolbox to bring jobs, infrastructure, and prosperity to Kansas communities through economic development.”
Senate Bill 98 creates a 20-year sales tax exemption for data centers investing at least $250 million within five years of opening. The exemption could include land acquisition, development and construction, equipment acquisition and permitting, design, engineering, labor for installing and maintaining data center equipment, and lease payments.
Businesses that receive the exemption must by law conserve, reuse, and replace water, pay for electricity from a public utility for 10 years and maintain at least 20 new jobs at the data center within two years of launching.
Kelly also signed into law House Bill 2289, which was championed by Stilwell Republican Rep. Sean Tarwater and enacts limits on housing tax credits. Over time, the law eventually will dismantle the state’s affordable housing tax credit program.
Taxes and government
House Bill 2125 reauthorized the 20-mill statewide school property tax levy to finance public schools through the 2025-2026 and 2026-2027 school years. The bill also sets strict deadlines on local taxing entities, enabling county clerks to use a taxing jurisdiction’s budget and tax levy from the previous year if it doesn’t submit budget information by Oct. 1.
House Bill 2231 shifts Kansas to a corporate income tax calculation method that aligns with the majority of states. Kelly said the law evens “the playing field for Kansas-based businesses, making the state more attractive for capital investment, and encouraging job creation.”
House Bill 2335 creates, beginning in January, a new license plate for members of hunting organization Hunter Nation.
House Bill 2007 cleans up statutes that were amended multiple times during the 2025 session.
House Bill 2275 enables a handful of Kansas counties to ask voters whether they favor a sales tax proposal to fund projects. It also creates a tax exemption for custom meat processing sales.
In Finney County, county commissioners want to impose a 0.5% sales tax to finance construction or remodeling projects in the county courthouse, jail, law enforcement center or other administrative building.
In Jackson County, commissioners want to ask voters if they would favor a 0.25% sales tax to support hospital services.
In Pawnee County, commissioners can ask voters if they want to pay an up to 1% sales tax for providing health care services and “furnish” and “equip” public safety operations.
In Seward County, voters will decide if they want to pay a 0.5% sales tax to fund road and bridge projects.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/P5140012-1024x575.jpg,,,2025-04-28 13:12:30.119679

Gerry Connolly, D-Fairfax, speaks at a press conference outside of USAID headquarters on Feb. 3, 2025 in Washington, D.C. (Photo by Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images)U.S. Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Fairfax, a fixture in Northern Virginia politics for more than three decades, announced Monday he will not seek reelection after a resurgence of cancer, saying the sun is setting on his time in public service.
In a statement published on his social media accounts, Connolly thanked supporters for their “good wishes and compassion,” crediting their encouragement with giving him strength “in my fights — both against cancer and in our collective defense of democracy.” 
He revealed that although initial treatments had seemed successful, his cancer has returned. “I’ll do everything possible to continue to represent you and thank you for your grace,” he wrote.
Connolly, 75, said he will soon step down as ranking member of the House Oversight Committee and finish out the remainder of his term with “no rancor and a full heart.” He added, “With pride in what we’ve accomplished together over 30 years, my loving family and staff sustain me. My extended family — you all have been a joy to serve.”
The news struck a deeply emotional chord among colleagues and political leaders across Virginia and Washington, D.C.
U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., reflected on Connolly’s announcement with admiration, saying, “No one has fought harder when it comes to Virginia’s federal workforce, transportation infrastructure, congressional oversight, and our commitment to critical alliances like NATO.” 
Kaine said he spoke with Connolly on Monday morning, telling him of his “profound admiration for his service and deep love for him and Smitty,” Connolly’s wife.
House Oversight and Government Reform Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., Connolly’s counterpart on the committee, also expressed his support following the announcement.
“I’m saddened to hear that Ranking Member Connolly’s cancer has returned,” Comer said in a statement Monday. He praised Connolly as “a steadfast public servant who has spent his career serving Northern Virginians with honor and integrity.”
Comer added, “It’s an honor to serve the American people alongside him and I am rooting for him as he battles cancer once again. Our prayers are with Ranking Member Connolly and his family.”
Born in Boston, Connolly’s life reflected a unique mix of scholarship, global expertise, and local passion. He spent a decade with the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, managing oversight on international economics, narcotics policy and U.N. affairs, and publishing reports on U.S. policy in El Salvador, Central America, Israel and the Persian Gulf.
Later, Connolly moved into leadership roles in the private sector at SRI International and SAIC before fully turning to public service in Fairfax County. He was elected Providence District Supervisor in 1995, and in 2003, became chairman of the county’s Board of Supervisors, where he guided Fairfax’s rapid growth while promoting education, environmental stewardship and smart development.
Virginia Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, recalled first working with Connolly during those local government years. 
“The congressman was a visionary leader for Fairfax County who moved on to a national role defending federal workers and our democratic institutions,” Surovell said. “Northern Virginia is a better, stronger place because of Gerry Connolly’s tireless advocacy, and our democracy is healthier because of his unwavering dedication.”
Connolly carried that same blend of policy chops and political muscle to Washington after winning election to Congress in 2008. Representing Virginia’s 11th District — anchored in suburban Fairfax County — he quickly built a reputation for mastering the nuts and bolts of government reform.
He co-authored the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act with Republican Rep. Darrell Issa of California, seeking to streamline how the government buys new technology and reduces waste. 
Connolly also worked to cut red tape through the Government Reports Elimination Act of 2014, which scrapped about 100 outdated or redundant federal reporting requirements. His commitment to oversight and efficiency earned him recognition as one of the most effective lawmakers in Congress by the Center for Effective Lawmaking.
“Throughout his career, Gerry Connolly has exemplified the very best of public service — fiercely intelligent, deeply principled, and relentlessly committed to the people of Northern Virginia and our nation,” U.S. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., said Monday. Warner called Connolly “one of the toughest fighters I know” and said he was “keeping him in our hearts and prayers.”
Connolly’s record reflected a consistently progressive bent. He championed abortion rights, voting against the Stupak-Pitts Amendment and supporting federal funding for Planned Parenthood. He campaigned for LGBTQ rights long before marriage equality became the law of the land, backing efforts to repeal “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” and the Defense of Marriage Act.
He was also a strong advocate for environmental protections, helping to found the Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition, and supported investments in renewable energy technologies.
Connolly did not shy from political combat, especially during the Trump presidency. He voted to impeach Donald Trump and memorably blasted Republican proposals to rename Dulles Airport after Trump, quipping, “If Republicans want to name something after him, I suggest they find a federal prison.”
State Sen. Lamont Bagby, D-Henrico, chair of the Democratic Party of Virginia, praised Connolly’s fighting spirit and intellect. 
“Congressman Connolly always brings unmatched intellect, wit, and passion to his work,” Bagby said. “Cancer stands no chance against his fighting Irish spirit.” Bagby credited Connolly with making the commonwealth stronger through decades of dedicated service.
In recent years, Connolly continued to dominate his electoral contests, defeating a primary challenger in 2024 with more than 86% of the vote and cruising to reelection against Republican Mike Van Meter. 
Even as health challenges loomed, he maintained an active role in legislative oversight and defending democratic institutions.
Connolly’s retirement marks the close of an era for Northern Virginia, where his leadership became synonymous with effective, passionate advocacy. His colleagues emphasized that his impact would long outlast his time in office.
Former U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, the Democratic nominee for governor, also praised Connolly’s legacy and spirit, calling him a model public servant whose impact will be felt across Virginia for generations.
“For more than three decades, Congressman Connolly has stood up for Virginians — dedicating his career to public service and making our Commonwealth stronger,” Spanberger said Monday. “He has responded to the needs of his neighbors, strengthened the communities he represented, and worked to grow the Democratic Party in Fairfax and across Northern Virginia.”

The Trump administration this month scrapped a Biden-era proposal that would have required state Medicaid programs and allowed federal Medicare to pay for some GLP-1s for obesity treatment. Instead, state Medicaid programs will retain the choice of whether to cover the high-priced medications for their residents.
The drugs, which have historically been prescribed to diabetic patients, also help patients lose weight and have grown in popularity among doctors and patients. But they are generally too expensive for most people to afford without insurance.
While doctors and patient advocates say these drugs are critical to helping patients struggling with obesity and can save money in the long run by reducing comorbidities such as heart disease, others say the medications are just too expensive for most states to afford. More than a dozen state Medicaid programs have opted to cover GLP-1s for obesity treatment, and the proposed Biden rule would have asked all states to figure out how to pay for them. But now, advocates fear these drugs may continue to be out of reach for many.

“It’s unfortunate that they’re excluding a whole class of medications that seem to have a tremendous number of health benefits to patients,” Dr. Nicholas Pennings, chair of family medicine at Campbell University in Buies Creek, North Carolina, said in an interview.











I think that’s just part of the inherent bias towards the treatment of people with obesity.


– Dr. Nicholas Pennings, chair of family medicine at Campbell University



GLP-1s, which stand for glucagon-like peptide-1, are a class of drugs that balance blood sugar levels. They’ve long been prescribed to patients with Type 2 diabetes. But since the drugs also curb hunger signals, doctors may prescribe these drugs — including popular brands Wegovy and Ozempic — to help patients lose weight.
Medicaid is a joint federal-state funded program that mostly serves people with lower incomes under the age of 65 or who have a disability. The federal Medicare program focuses primarily on people above the age of 65, no matter their income.
How and whether to cover expensive treatments and drugs can be a significant deliberation for state Medicaid directors. In North Carolina, where 70% of people struggle with being overweight or obese, officials opted to begin covering the drugs for weight loss last year. That coverage has been a game changer, said Pennings, who continues to treat Medicaid patients.
“They are expensive, but there’s a lot of other medications that are expensive too. Why is it that obesity medications and diabetes medications are being selected out?” Pennings said. “I think that’s just part of the inherent bias towards the treatment of people with obesity, feeling like it’s cheating or not necessary.”
The list price for Wegovy is around $1,300 per month, and for Ozempic, around $1,000. Even so, the skyrocketing popularity of these drugs has prompted at least 14 state Medicaid departments to begin covering these drugs to treat obesity in the past decade.
In addition to North Carolina, those states include California, Delaware, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Virginia and Wisconsin.
An annual survey of Medicaid directors from health policy research group KFF recently found that half of the 47 responding states not already covering the drugs were considering doing so.

In January, the National Association of Medicaid Directors told the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services that state Medicaid departments had “significant concerns over the fiscal impacts” of the Biden proposal to require coverage of GLP-1s, and “strongly recommend that CMS maintain the current state option to cover or not cover anti-obesity medications.”
But others say covering the drugs will yield long-term savings.
John Cawley, a professor of economics and public policy at Cornell University who has studied the economic impacts of obesity, has found that obesity essentially doubles a person’s annual health care costs due to comorbidities such as heart disease, fatty liver disease and kidney disease.
He’s found that weight loss among those with extreme obesity, with a BMI of 40 or higher, can yield substantial reductions in medical care costs.
Cawley added that state Medicaid programs “have a lot of flexibility” in ensuring costs don’t get out of control, by, for example, covering a newly available generic version of GLP-1s, requiring prior authorization, and asking patients to try behavioral programs before getting a prescription.
North Carolina’s Medicaid department began covering GLP-1s for obesity in August. The state has been able to afford GLP-1 coverage by negotiating rebates, or discounts, with drug manufacturers, and by getting the federal government to cover some costs. Department leaders think lowering obesity will save the state money in the long run, said Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for North Carolina Medicaid.
He said that one of the benefits of Medicaid is that “we get to choose, as a state, where we want to make kind of those extra investments or not.” He added that covering the medications could be potentially financially feasible for other states.
“Each program is different and has its own pressures. It would be welcome to be able to come together with other states to be able to negotiate broader deals,” Ludlam said. “If North Carolina is able to get a good deal, I don’t know why other states wouldn’t be able to participate in that.”

In 2023, Connecticut enacted a law requiring Medicaid to cover obesity treatment services. The program began covering GLP-1s for weight loss, but costs were significant enough that the state told providers this year that it is now focusing on other obesity treatments instead.
Sean Scanlon, the Connecticut comptroller, said that not covering GLP-1s is “shortsighted, bad policy.” The state health plan, which takes care of teachers and other state employees, has been covering the drugs for weight loss since 2023. The plan controls costs by only prescribing GLP-1s after patients go through some online weight-loss counseling, said Scanlon.
“The most fiscally conservative thing we can do is give people tools that will save the taxpayers money in the long run,” he said in an interview. “And GLP-1 drugs are one of the best tools that we have to ensure that the taxpayers are not going to pay more money for the health care of hundreds of millions of people in the long run.”
It’s unclear whether the federal government will reverse course. In the past, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has recommended “three good meals a day” and behavioral changes rather than weight-loss medication.
But this month, Kennedy told CBS News he’s considering a regulatory framework to have Medicare and Medicaid cover these “extraordinary drugs” in the future, once their cost goes down.
“Ideally, over the long-term, we’d like to see those drugs available for people after they try other interventions,” Kennedy said.

Members of the North Carolina General Assembly took a post-Easter break last week as they prepared for what promises to be the busiest period of the 2025 session in May and June, but prior to that, Republican leaders in the state Senate unveiled and quickly approved their version of a new two-year state budget.
The proposal attracted sharp criticism from Democratic senators who blasted the tiny pay raises allotted to teachers and state employees, as well as the decision to double down on regressive corporate tax cuts at a time in which the state’s economists are warning of impending revenue shortfalls. And recently, NC Newsline caught up with one of those critics, State Senator Graig Meyer. He’s not only worried about the budget, he’s deeply concerned about what a host of other top state and national GOP priorities portend for our country’s future.

U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth endorsed Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton on Monday in the 2026 Democratic primary for Illinois’ open seat to replace longtime Sen. Dick Durbin.

Duckworth’s endorsement comes after Gov. JB Pritzker endorsed Stratton on Friday, one day after she entered the Senate contest. With no other Democratic candidates announcing campaigns for the 2026 primary by Monday morning, Stratton secured the endorsement of two of the state’s top Democrats before fielding any competition.

“Juliana has not only proven to be an experienced and effective Lieutenant Governor — she’s demonstrated time and again that she truly understands and cares for working people,” Duckworth said in a statement. “Their struggles are her struggles. Their wins are her wins.”

Duckworth, a Democrat from Hoffman Estates, will take over as the state’s senior senator in January 2027 after Durbin’s term ends, as he announced last week he plans to retire. An Army veteran who earned a Purple Heart while serving in Iraq, Duckworth was elected to the Senate in 2016.

“Her many years spent in public service, along with her experience as a mom to four daughters and a caregiver to her own mother, have given her the tenacity, grit and perspective to be a true advocate on behalf of working families,” Duckworth said of Stratton.

Durbin told reporters at his Springfield home last week that he will likely not make any endorsements in the primary.

Stratton secured Pritzker’s endorsement Friday. The two have spent the last six years leading Illinois following two successful elections.

Pritzker praised Stratton as a “champion for women’s rights, for job creation, for rural families, for farmers, for criminal justice, for early childhood education,” and credited the lieutenant governor as having played an integral role in his administration.

Asked Friday whether his endorsement tamps down a competitive race for Durbin’s seat, Pritzker said, “Anybody who wants to run should run. But I’m telling you this is the person whose best able to serve with integrity, with honor.”

Stratton, of Chicago, has quickly risen through the ranks of Illinois politics after first being elected as a state representative in 2016. She was elected lieutenant governor two years later as Pritzker’s running mate during the 2018 campaign.

It’s still unclear whether other Democrats will announce they are joining Stratton in the primary as whoever enters the race will go in knowing they won’t be endorsed by two of the state’s leading Democrats.

U.S. Reps. Lauren Underwood, of Naperville, Raja Krishnamoorthi, of Schaumburg, Robin Kelly, of Matteson, and state Treasurer Mike Frerichs, of Chicago, all have said they are considering entering the race.

Meet Jennifer and read more of her reporting on gender, politics and policy.
It feels like nowadays, you can’t talk about the professionalized world of fighting for entertainment without talking about Donald Trump.
Earlier this month, Trump and several Cabinet members sat cageside at the UFC match in Miami; Trump himself holds a spot in the WWE Hall of Fame, where his official bio page notes that he’s the first WWE Hall of Famer to hold the presidency. Ahead of last weekend’s annual WrestleMania, wrestling news sites were abuzz with rumors that the president might again be ringside. At the same time, one of professional wrestling’s biggest stars, Roman Reigns, made headlines for declaring himself as a Trump supporter. 
The former CEO of WWE, Vince McMahon, is a longtime friend of the president’s and financial supporter of his political endeavors; McMahon’s now-estranged wife, Linda, is also a former WWE CEO and a current member of Trump’s Cabinet. And the CEO of UFC, Dana White, introduced Trump before he spoke on the final night of last summer’s Republican National Convention — Hulk Hogan also spoke, ripping off his shirt to reveal Trump/Vance campaign merch — and attended Trump’s inauguration in January. 
The kinds of theatrics baked into the massive success of professional wrestling have been on display throughout Trump’s ascendency in American politics. On the campaign trail and now in the White House, a Trump event has a distinctive feel, a well-honed blend of spectacle, pageantry and hypermasculinity. It’s a style that feels lifted from the professional wrestling handbook, where aesthetics and narrative device choices are central to the delivery. In professional wrestling, this product is a form of entertainment that lets fans — predominantly young men — openly feel and freely celebrate masculinity. In the second Trump administration, the product is a barrage of new policy measures intent on crafting a very specific version of America where the feelings of men are prioritized and their power is irrefutable. 
Though not a part of the action in the ring, there’s another significant tie between professional fighting and the Trump administration: allegations of sexual misconduct that have stretched back for decades. Vince McMahon, the visionary showman who made professional wrestling into the cultural force it is today, built the persona of “Mr. McMahon” around being a womanizing, vindictive philanderer — and today faces real-life accusations of sex trafficking, which he has denied. Donald Trump, the visionary showman who reshaped American politics in the mold of reality television, built his industry-spanning brand in part around the idea of being the consummate ladies’ man — and won the presidency for the first time just weeks after the “Access Hollywood” tape leaked in which Trump boasted, “And when you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything….Grab ’em by the pussy. You can do anything.”
Central to the concept of professional wrestling is the practice of kayfabe, or committing to the illusion that clearly staged events are real and true. It’s a narrative device that asks audiences to suspend their disbelief, not in a way of passive acceptance, but rather active participation in the creation of what is possible. 
“It really does matter how well you’re doing the performance, but then what also really matters is how much the audience is going to buy into it. If they’re emotionally connected, that’s where the buy-in comes in,” said CarrieLynn Reinhard, an associate professor of communication arts and sciences at Dominican University and an expert on narrative devices in professional wrestling. “When you look at what Trump does, he is very good at getting to people’s emotions and understanding their emotions and — I’m going to say — manipulating their emotions for his own goals, and in doing so, he focuses on a reality that he believes in or at least he performs to believe in.”
Reinhard pointed to Trump’s rollout of tariffs — which he touted as immediately bolstering the economy even as markets tumbled — as an example of this dynamic. “What’s interesting is that with that little bit of doubt, his followers, his fans, they have the ability to engage in that rationalization that allows them to say, ‘He’s got a plan.’” 
The gimmicks
Professional wrestling is immensely popular in America, one of the most enduring and dominant forms of pop culture of the past three decades. Just last year, the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) merged with the WWE under one new parent company, TKO. UFC is now the fourth-most watched sports league in America, after MLB, the NFL and the NBA. 
And the people who made UFC and WWE what they are today are also inextricably intertwined with the creation and actions of the dual Trump presidencies. 
By the time Trump mounted his first campaign during the 2016 presidential race, the McMahons were already major Republican donors. Linda, the former CEO of WWE and the current secretary of education, contributed a total of $7.2 million to two pro-Trump super PACs that cycle — Rebuilding America Now and Future45 — and the couple together donated more than $10 million to outside groups funding Trump’s race for the presidency. The McMahons also supported Trump before he formally entered politics, donating $5 million to the Trump Foundation in 2007.
Linda McMahon’s ability and facility in playing a role — a skill honed during her time as not only a WWE executive but also an on-screen performer — is essential to understanding her nomination within this administration, according to Kelly Dittmar, an associate professor of political science and the director of research at the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. 
In naming her to his Cabinet, Trump “chose somebody who was willing to work herself out of a job. He had to find somebody that was willing to go and sit at a confirmation hearing and try to explain how she wanted to be the secretary of education, but also effectively get rid of the Department of Education, which is an incredibly hard position to be put in,” Dittmar said.
It feels not dissimilar to a part she had in what is considered by many fans to be one of the most infamous WWE storylines, playing comatose in a wheelchair for weeks before ultimately rising from her supposed catatonic state inside the ring to kick her philandering husband in the groin on live TV. 
This time, of course, the shock ending isn’t revenge for a titillating affair, but effectively shuttering a major federal agency. 
Dana White, the CEO of UFC, has also been a longtime fixture in Trumpworld. He spoke at the Republican National Convention in 2016, 2020 and 2024. When it was clear Trump had won a second term last November, White spoke at the victory celebration, saying, “I’m in the tough guy business, and this man is the toughest, most resilient human being that I’ve ever met in my life.” White has long credited Trump for supporting UFC from its start, hosting UFC matches at Trump properties, attending events cageside, and generally being a champion of the brand of macho entertainment that became explosively popular under White’s watch. 
The accusations
The Trump administration and WWE share another overlapping characteristic: The way leaders of both have faced numerous allegations of sexual misconduct and sexual abuse, or of ignoring such misconduct. 
Trump, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by multiple women and long surrounded himself with men who have been similarly accused during his time in the public eye, was found liable by a jury in 2023 of sexually abusing and defaming the advice columnist E. Jean Carroll. In his second term, he put forth multiple nominees accused of or linked to sexual misconduct allegations.    
White has offered more tacit support in other ways that underscore the misogyny and allegations of criminal sexual misconduct that proliferate in Trumpworld. In March, White welcomed Andrew and Tristan Tate ringside. The brothers — who face charges in Romania, including rape, human trafficking, trafficking of minors and sex with a minor — returned to the United States in February. They have denied any wrongdoing, calling the charges against them “garbage” and part of a “conspiracy.”  The Financial Times reported that the Trump administration asked Romanian officials to return the Tates’ passports to them and allow them to travel while the criminal case against them proceeded in court. Trump’s presidential envoy for special missions, Richard Grenell, raised the Tates’ case with the Romanian foreign minister. Additionally, Paul Ingrassia, a former Tate attorney, is now a White House liaison for the Department of Justice. 
The McMahons are currently facing a lawsuit accusing them of failing to stop abuse by an employee from the 1970s to the early 1990s. The suit, from “ring boys” who helped with setting up and breaking down wrestling matches, was filed in October. It says that a former WWE employee, Mel Phillips, sexually assaulted the ring boys and that the McMahons fired him in 1988 because of abuse allegations and then rehired him six weeks later. In a February statement, Greg Gutzler, the attorney representing the ring boys, said, “My clients’ lives were destroyed by the defendants who allowed and enabled the open, rampant sexual abuse to occur for years. … We will bring light to their truth and fight for accountability and justice.”
In early April, attorneys for Linda McMahon filed a motion to dismiss the ring boys’ lawsuit, saying that she has no connection to the state of Maryland, where it was filed. She also asserts that she has never met or communicated with the plaintiffs, to the best of her knowledge and memory. Vince McMahon has also denied all wrongdoing. Attorneys for Vince McMahon, Linda McMahon and WWE did not respond to The 19th’s request for comment.  
Linda McMahon’s time in the WWE, including the ring boys’ suit, was barely a topic in her February confirmation hearing. 
Tom Cole was the first of the ring boys to come forward with allegations about sexual abuse while employed by WWE, according to his brother, Lee Cole. Tom Cole died by suicide in 2021. 
Lee Cole said that he thinks people have failed to take the allegations against the McMahons seriously because of their ties to wrestling. “This has always been a wrestling story, and people have always known wrestling has been faked. And so they look down at these things, not knowing whether it’s a job — whether they’re pulling a job — or whether it’s real. They don’t know. People don’t take wrestling seriously,” Cole said. 
Cole said he understands that there has been an increase in attention around the McMahons and the ring boys’ lawsuit as a result of Linda McMahon’s role within the Trump administration. Too often, he said, he has seen reporters miss the mark by focusing their stories on the McMahons through the lens of Trump. 
But to understand Trump, you need to understand the McMahons, the way they have used power, fame, and the ability to craft narratives that keep fans invested in the WWE brand and willing to dismiss the naysayers. 
As a Trump supporter, Cole said he can see the appeal McMahon holds for the administration. 
“They’re entertainers. Linda McMahon is an entertainer. She was part of the entertainment world. Why else would Donald Trump love her so much? He’s an entertainer.”
The ring boys’ suit isn’t the only accusation of misconduct against the McMahons. In 2024, Vince McMahon was sued by former employee Janel Grant; in her suit, Grant accuses McMahon of sex trafficking, making her employment contingent on engaging in a sexual relationship with him and being sexually available to others within WWE. WWE and former WWE executive, John Laurinaitis, are named as defendants in the suit as well. All defendants in Grant’s lawsuit have denied all wrongdoing. Attorneys for Vince McMahon and WWE did not respond to The 19th’s request for comment.
When it comes to the allegations of sexual assault against both Trump and McMahon, Reinhard said she sees “the double whammy of the toxic masculinity that still accepts and promotes — something we are seeing more of now since Trump won — the idea that women are supposed to be controlled and then the idea that if you’ve got the money and you’ve got the time, you’re able to essentially spend your way out of these allegations, spend your way out of any charges and essentially wait out the public debate until people forget about it.” 
The feelings
Both Trump and professional wrestling are massive cultural entities that allow men to express their emotions, especially about their own masculinity. In the ring and now in the White House, men’s feelings matter — especially when it comes to defending their own identities and the men who give them that space to publicly feel and perform. “The idea of emotions being antithetical to politics really needs to be addressed, because they’re not just emotions — they’re a motivating force,” Reinhard said.
In the administration, the feelings lead to policies that promote a world where men can not only feel freely, but control the levers of society to make space for these feelings, too. 
Letting voters get caught up in the fandom makes the unprecedented policy decisions all the more possible. From tariffs that threaten to raise daily costs on voters who say they voted because of the economy, to DOGE cuts resulting in job and program losses that are upending economic security for many, to a proclamation for National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month from a sitting president found liable for sexual abuse in 2023, the second Trump administration has taken to operating in a way that constantly asks constituents to not just accept but actively buy in to a reality that runs counter to the facts on the ground. It’s kayfabe for government: Creating a world for men to freely express emotion and set policies with no limits — and no consequences — for violating once accepted standards and norms.
The second Trump administration is showcasing a “much more extreme” version of the first Trump term’s commitment to “dismantling a particular version of politics on the Hill,” said Sarah Banet-Weiser, dean of the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania whose research focuses on gender, media and politics. “And if you dismantle those politics, you know, you have to replace them with something,” Banet-Weiser said. 
And what remains is a stoking of men’s feelings in the wake of a slew of public policy decisions that in turn provoke even more emotion — even when the feelings run counter to the facts. The difference between reality television as entertainment and reality television as a political system is the consequences, Banet-Weiser said. “It’s not a group of housewives who fight and are riddled with scandal and then go on with their lives. It’s about the livelihoods of the American people.”

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Welcome to The Topline, a weekly roundup of the big numbers driving the Minnesota news cycle, as well as the smaller ones that you might have missed. This week: green cities; a stunning decline in Black homeownership; America’s most polluted air; an unusually long stretch without homicides; and Minnesota’s most conservative county. 
The greenest cities (literally)
The Washington Post has used data from the Arbor Day Foundation and the U.S. Forest Service to map tree cover across the country’s urban areas. Tree cover is primarily a function of the local climate — they grow readily in areas that were naturally forested before the arrival of Europeans, and less so in places like deserts.
More than half of Atlanta is covered by trees, for instance. Less than 9% of Phoenix is.
But policy plays a role too, and some cities are taking steps to plant more of them for a variety of reasons, including their cooling effect on the urban environment. 
Here in Minnesota, where the eastern forests meet the central prairie, you can see the gradient in canopy cover as you drive west. Duluth, for instance, is about 40% trees. Minneapolis-St. Paul is closer to 30%. Less than 15% of Fargo-Moohead has tree cover.
Black homeownership nosedives
A recent report by the Minnesota State Demographic Center shows that the overall rate of homeownership since 1970 has held steady at roughly 72%. But there has been a precipitous decline in Black homeownership over the same period.
In 1970, for instance, 42% of Black families were homeowners. In 2022 just 26% were. 
“In other words, since the 1970s, Black or African American householders have been increasingly concentrated into rental housing units,” according to the analysis. “This is a historical trend unique to Black or African American households.” The decline has been consistent across every decade except the 1990s. 
Another interesting wrinkle: The decline happening almost exclusively among U.S.-born Black families. Among Black immigrants, homeownership rates increased. 
The numbers suggest that Minnesota’s well-known racial disparities, among the worst in the nation, owe more to Black families falling behind than to white ones getting ahead. The fact that Minnesota-born Black families seem to be doing worse than their new immigrant counterparts is especially damning, and a sign that policymakers’ efforts to address the state’s disparities are failing.
America’s most air-polluted places
They’re mostly in California, according to the American Lung Association’s latest State of the Air report. But a couple Midwestern cities also make the list, including Chicago, Detroit, Indianapolis and Cleveland.
The study finds, overall, that nearly half of the U.S. breathes in unhealthy levels of air pollution. 
“Air pollution is causing kids to have asthma attacks, making people who work outdoors sick, and leading to low birth weight in babies,” said Harold Wimmer, CEO of the American Lung Association. “This year’s report shows the dramatic impact that air pollution has on a growing number of people.”
The findings are especially concerning this year as the Trump administration is taking steps to both weaken federal regulations on air pollutants and to stop collecting much of the data that scientists use to track air pollution around the world.
Minneapolis posts longest stretch without a homicide in more than eight years
The 62 days between February 15 and April 18 mark the longest homicide-free stretch in Minneapolis since at least 2017, the Star Tribune reports. It’s a nice little milestone but bear in mind that homicides are currently falling virtually everywhere in the country, making it difficult to ascribe Minneapolis’ recent dry spell to any particular policy or policing decision.
So far this year, Minneapolis homicides are down by more than 50% from where they were last year at this time. That’s an impressive number, but it remains to be seen whether it’s the start of a durable trend or just the reflection of the regular ebb and flow of violent crime.
Minnesota’s most conservative county
It’s Morrison County in north-central Minnesota, population 34,000, per the Star Tribune. More than 70% of the county’s voters picked Donald Trump in the last three elections, and the overwhelming majority of them remain pleased with their pick despite the economic chaos he’s already caused.
Morrison is virtually all white and in the bottom fifth of the state for household income. Several of the voters who spoke with the Star Tribune appear to be deeply misinformed on basic facts about American society. 
One government employee, who believes antifa was behind Jan. 6 and who is indefinitely postponing building a new home because of Trump’s policies, told the paper he remains 100% devoted to the billionaire convicted felon in the White House: “He’s me, just at a lot bigger level.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1468619438.jpg,,,2025-04-28 13:12:30.119679

Sign up for their newsletter here.
The North Carolina Supreme Court seemed to side with the agriculture lobby last Wednesday in a hearing for a case whose outcome could nullify key environmental, civil rights and public health protections for neighbors of the state’s 2,000 industrialized livestock farms.
If the justices uphold an appellate court’s decision in favor of the N.C. Farm Bureau Federation, the N.C. Department of Environmental Quality would not be allowed to enforce three provisions in the state’s general permits for concentrated animal feeding operations that were forged as part of a civil rights settlement.
Instead, those three requirements for certain farms—groundwater monitoring, annual reporting and soil testing for phosphorus loss—would have to go through a more extensive rule-making process led by the Environmental Management Commission.
The EMC is composed of political appointees, whose appetite for regulation varies.
“This case presents a foundational question of administrative accountability whether state agencies may sidestep the safeguards of rulemaking by imposing sweeping regulatory mandates through general permits,” the Farm Bureau Federation attorneys wrote in court documents.
The case stems from several settlement conditions contained within a 2014 civil rights complaint. Lawyers for several environmental justice groups and neighbors of industrialized hog farms had filed a complaint with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, alleging that DEQ, by issuing general permits without adequate protections, disproportionately burdened people of color and low-income residents, who are more likely to live near the farms.
Most of the state’s concentrated animal feeding operations, or CAFOs, hold a general permit, which applies to a class of operations. A smaller number have individual permits, whose conditions are tailored to specific farms. DEQ renews and, if necessary, revises general permits every five years, after several public hearings and opportunities to comment.
As part of the settlement, DEQ incorporated three conditions in a 2019 general permit.

All CAFOs must file a two-page annual report summarizing information from existing records, such as the number of animals, permitted lagoons and acres on which waste is applied.
CAFOs whose lagoons or waste collection systems lie within a 100-year flood plain must conduct annual groundwater monitoring; this accounts for fewer than 3 percent of general permit holders, according to DEQ.
Based on soil testing, some CAFOs would have to measure phosphorus loss from their fields where animal waste is applied. This requirement would affect roughly 5 percent of CAFOs.

Groundwater monitoring is important because runoff or leakage from enormous hog waste lagoons can seep into private drinking water wells or rivers and streams. Annual reporting, environmental groups argued, can detect problems at the CAFOs sooner.
Phosphorus loss tests are key because they can indicate erosion or runoff from the farms, which in turn can create harmful algae blooms in waterways.
  This map shows the locations of all permitted concentrated animal feeding operations in North Carolina. In total, these farms raise 86,000 cattle and cows, 9.45 million swine, and 7.19 million poultry where the animal waste is stored and applied as a liquid. The map does not show the millions of poultry on farms that use dry waste systems; those farms aren’t required to obtain a permit. (Credit: N.C. Department of Environmental Quality)
The N.C. Farm Bureau Federation contested those aspects of the general permit before an administrative law judge, who ruled in its favor.
DEQ appealed to Wake County Superior Court, which reversed the administrative law judge’s ruling. The Farm Bureau subsequently won in state appellate court.
For 28 years the state legislature has enacted and revised statutes allowing DEQ and other agencies to write and issue general permits without going through rulemaking, a process that can take years.
Only if a provision has “general applicability” does it need to be a rule.
Associate Justice Trey Allen, a Republican, agreed that state lawmakers granted some permitting authority to state agencies, but said “it’s difficult for me to believe GA’s intent was to enable the agency to avoid rulemaking.”
“These permit conditions do not have general applicability,” said Taylor Crabtree, an attorney with the N.C. Department of Justice representing DEQ. Even though the permits are “general,” farmers can apply for an individual permit instead, Crabtree said, and potentially avoid the three provisions in dispute.
State law also requires every requirement in a general permit to tie back to a specific condition or statute, which the three provisions achieve, Crabtree said.
DEQ’s actions for the three provisions, Republican Associate Judge Richard Dietz said, “sound like rulemaking.”
Dietz said that while the legislature has the authority to delegate some rulemaking to the executive branch, such as DEQ, that power has limits, such as procedural safeguards.
A farm can still challenge the permit conditions in court, Crabtree told the justices. “It’s not accurate to say this regime has no procedural safeguards.”
Jacob Parker, attorney for the Farm Bureau Federation, argued without the guardrails of formal rule-making, “an agency can go off into its black box and make decisions” about what to include in permits, “which we contend is what sort of happened here with the sue and settle issue.”
The “sue and settle issue” is the 2014 civil rights complaint against DEQ, which the EPA determined was valid. The EPA directed DEQ and environmental groups to enter confidential mediation, but those talks broke down in 2016, when agency officials in a conservative administration allowed the NC Pork Council to attend a confidential mediation session. ??
Attorneys for the neighbors and environmental groups asked the pork industry representatives to leave the building. Instead they stayed in the hallway near the mediation room during the talks, according to a second complaint, a move that neighbors alleged was a form of intimidation.
The EPA found the second complaint to be valid and wrote in a letter to DEQ that it had “grave concerns” about the incidents.
Two years later, under new DEQ Secretary Michael Regan, the parties reached a settlement. Regan went on to become EPA administrator under President Joe Biden.
Parker, the Farm Bureau Federation attorney, told the court today that “absent the farm interests, we ended up with a draft swine permit with conditions that had not been adopted as rules.” Unlike rules, the conditions contained no fiscal note, so farmers didn’t know how much compliance would cost, Parker said.
Associate Justice Anita Earls, one of two Democrats on the bench, asked about the possible ramifications on DEQ’s other 21 general permits as well as all state agencies. “If we were to say the conditions for the permitting process here have to go through rulemaking … would these extend beyond DEQ?”
Crabtree, the DEQ attorney, replied that if the scope of the opinion is broad, it could affect all state agencies that issue general permits. “It would work a great deal of uncertainty into the system,” Crabtree said. In that case, any statutory clarifications should fall to state lawmakers, he said. “If there’s a change, it’s an argument for the General Assembly, not the courts.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Hog-Farm-eastern-NC-Rick-Dove-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-28 13:12:30.119679

SPRINGFIELD – The cost to attend state universities has been rising, and some institutions have said they’ll have to continue pushing the brunt of state budget shortfalls onto students and families if there isn’t a change.

Data from the Illinois Board of Higher Education, which oversees public universities, shows university income has had to make up for the steady loss of funding from the state since around fiscal year 2009 as compared to inflation.

Since that point, state investment hasn’t kept up with inflation, and tuition and fees have risen steadily despite the fact that Gov. JB Pritzker’s administration has regularly increased higher education funding. The fiscal year 2026 proposed budget includes a 3% increase for higher education in the general fund for operating costs – which is about the same as the rate of inflation.

The cost of tuition and fees for statewide undergraduates on average has risen 10% higher since FY09 than if it had simply kept pace with inflation. For graduate students, that discrepancy is 16%.

The University of Illinois Chicago is the only school that has seen tuition and fees for both graduate and undergraduate students grow more slowly than inflation.

Administrators from many of the states’ universities have said they’re holding out hope that a new funding formula, contained in Senate Bill 13 and House Bill 1581, will alleviate some financial burden.

The formula as it is currently proposed would use data from the Illinois Board of Higher Education to determine how much money public universities would need on a per-student basis. University officials said the current system for allocating funds to universities isn’t quite as clear about determining why one university gets more funding than any other.

During a Senate appropriations hearing last week, Sen. Michael Halpin, D-Rock Island, and Northern Illinois University President Lisa Freeman each supported a data-based funding formula over the current method.

Administrators for almost every public state university who have spoken to the same committee have said they need to keep asking for more money than what the governor proposed in order to fend off tuition and fee increases.

“We understand funds are more constrictive this year than in the recent past,” said Eastern Illinois University President Jay Gatrell during the committee meeting. “That said, we do have bills to pay, and we only have two real sources of revenue: state appropriations, which cover roughly one-third of our operating costs, and student tuition and fees, which cover the remaining two-thirds.”

During fiscal year 2003, that breakdown was flipped – the state covered more than two-thirds of universities’ operating costs.

“No university really wants to increase tuition cost,” said Corey Bradford, interim president of Governors State University in an interview. “We do it in order to balance our budgets.”

The proposed funding formula hasn’t made its way through either chamber yet, though legislators generally have ways of moving major legislation beyond stated bill deadlines, up until end-of-May adjournment. If it doesn’t move, universities will continue being appropriated funds by standards set from years past.

“Even if there are differences in dollars per FTE (full time equivalency student) after we were to implement this formula, at least those differences would be grounded in this data in the program,” Halpin said. “Right now, we have these discrepancies, but there’s … not necessarily a hard data point, or set of data points, to justify it.”

 

MAP grants

In his February budget plan, Pritzker proposed increased funding of $10 million for Monetary Award Program grants for students to use toward tuition and fees, matching the same increase he made for the previous year’s budget.

MAP grants can go to any student who’s eligible for financial aid across the state. Pritzker’s proposed increase would make the new MAP grants pool total $721.6 million – up from $400 million when he was first elected in 2019.

However, MAP grants don’t directly fund universities the same way money from the general fund does.

“MAP goes to all colleges,” Bradford said. “Community colleges, private colleges, it doesn’t all come to public universities.”

 

University building projects

Sen. Chapin Rose, R-Mahomet, asked every university president during recent committee hearings if their schools had received any funding for deferred maintenance projects on campuses for the current fiscal year.

Rose said no one has said “yes” yet.

“I think we’d like to know before we get to next year’s budget how we’re spending last year’s budget,” Rose said. The current budget year concludes on June 30.

Ginger Ostro, IBHE’s executive director, said the board is working with universities and meeting with them and the Illinois Capital Development Board to maintain lists about deferred maintenance projects and make sure funding is distributed.

Proponents of Senate Bill 2 from Sen. “Big Mike” Fesi, R-Houma, leaned on data and research that blames fluoride for thyroid disorders and lowering the IQ of children (we’ll circle back to that later). The proposal advanced last Wednesday from the Senate Committee of Health and Welfare in a 6-3 party line vote, with Republicans prevailing. 
The results were the same for another Fesi bill to authorize the over-the-counter sale of ivermectin at pharmacies without a doctor’s prescription. As with the anti-fluoride bill, ivermectin supporters had ample info to support their viewpoint (we’ll get back to this, too).
Yet despite this apparent pro-science and pro-research mindset, overwhelming evidence of higher rates of cancer and other chronic ailments in communities along the Mississippi River’s petrochemical corridor in Louisiana are routinely ignored – if not doubted – within conservative circles.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Just three years ago, a peer-reviewed Tulane Environmental Law Clinic study found the estimated cancer risk was highest in the River Parish communities right next to point sources of pollution. Most of these settlements are predominantly Black and low-income, inhabited in part by the descendants of slaves who toiled on the plantations where refineries and chemical plants now stand.
The same study found the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) issued permits to allow industrial pollution emissions at rates 7 to 21 times higher among Black communities than in predominantly white ones. 
According to 2024 health data research from Human Rights Watch, people living in areas with the worst air pollution in Louisiana, including much of “Cancer Alley,” had rates of low birthweight more than double the state average (11.3%) and more than triple the U.S. average (8.5%). Preterm births were nearly double the state average (13%) and nearly two-and-a-half times the national rate (10.5%).
State officials are not willing to acknowledge the disparities. 
“LDEQ does not use the term Cancer Alley,” a department spokesperson told Human Rights Watch last year. “That term implies that there is a large geographic area that has higher cancer incidence than the state average. We have not seen higher cancer incidence over large areas of the industrial corridor between Baton Rouge and New Orleans.”
Now let’s go back to last week’s Senate committee hearing to see if we can’t connect that statement to why state officials can’t – or won’t – acknowledge verified scientific facts that are staring them in the face.
That includes state Surgeon General Dr. Ralph Abraham, who was by Fesi’s side to support both of his bills. Regarding the removal of fluoride from drinking water, Abraham said there “probably is a direct correlation between fluoride intake in pregnant ladies and lower IQs in their babies.” Crowley chiropractor Sandra Marks, who also testified in favor of the bill, made the same claim and cited a Harvard School of Public Health study.
What Abraham and Marks didn’t share was that the Harvard study involved children in China with high overexposure to fluoride. They implied the lower IQs were tied to exposure to permissible levels of fluoride in the U.S. 
Jeanie Donovan, New Orleans deputy health department director, shared details on the Harvard research with lawmakers when testifying against Fesi’s bill. She also pointed out the lack of any reliable scientific research that connects fluoride with thyroid disease. 
“We have many, many health issues in our city and in our state that we should address and that we should be spending time and money to address,” Donovan told the committee, making it clear that fluoride overexposure was not one of them. 
Anne Jayes with the Louisiana Public Health Institute and Dr. Robert Delarosa, a Baton Rouge pediatric dentist for 41 years, both cited a University of Queensland study that found children with access to properly fluoridated water had higher IQs. 
Marks, who said her research was sourced through Meta AI, also sounded the alarm over skeletal fluorosis, which can result in bone density changes and an increased risk of fractures. What she failed to mention was the bone disorder involves exposure to excessive amounts of fluoride. 
Jayes later pointed out the potentially dangerous fluoride levels in the study Marks cited were 21 to 28 times the recommended amount for drinking water systems, and that skeletal fluorosis studies themselves have been “widely challenged for their poor quality.”    
Annette Droddy, executive director of the 1,900-member Louisiana Dental Association, noted to the committee a trend of states reversing their bans on fluoridated drinking water, including Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and Tennessee. 
Calgary, Alberta, removed fluoride from its water in 2011 but restored it in 2023, Droddy said. The reversal came after health officials noted a 700% increase in children hospitalized for dental inflections and abscesses.
In Louisiana, only 39% of the population is provided fluoridated water through their public utility – well below the 72% national average, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. Removing fluoride will compound issues for the nearly 500,000 children in Louisiana who don’t see a dentist regularly, even though they qualify for dental coverage through Medicaid, Droddy said. Without fluoridated water, she said the state will have to ask the federal government for more money to cover a likely increase in children’s dental problems.
“Why would we take away the best public health measure of the 20th century?” Droddy said.
Yet Fesi stuck to his guns in his closing statement for Senate Bill 2, doubling down on the debunked low IQ and thyroid claims — and adding autism for good measure without any supporting evidence. 
On Fesi’s other bill, Abraham provided what he called a “guesstimate,” saying “a fairly large percentage of the population of the United States takes ivermectin on a daily basis.”
The most recent number available for daily ivermectin use in the U.S. is 185,550 people, according to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, an arm of the U.S. Department of Health and Hospitals. 
That’s only 0.05% of the national population; it’s not nothing but certainly not “a fairly large percentage” of Americans. That poor grasp of health data might be cause for concern among Abraham’s patients – animal and human.
The surgeon general and other backers of Fesi’s bill frequently mentioned “health freedom” during the Senate committee hearing. That concept apparently doesn’t apply to neighbors of industrial facilities who no doubt would like freedom from toxic exposure linked to chronic ailments and a significantly lowered quality and length of life.
Fesi also referred to fluoride as “toxic waste,” something that communities along the river could probably help him better define.   
If Louisiana leaders are going to pull fluoride out of our drinking water, it stands to reason they should show equal concern for the health of residents in “Cancer Alley.”

It’s hard to believe, but it’s now been nearly six months since the November 2024 election and one race remains officially undecided – the contest for an associate justice seat on the North Carolina Supreme Court. Two recounts have confirmed that incumbent Justice Allison Riggs was the narrow victor, but remarkably, challenger Jefferson Griffin refuses to concede and continues to pursue the audacious strategy of seeking to have thousands of ballots – ballots cast according to the rules in effect on Election Day – thrown out.
The challenge has led to multiple lawsuits and numerous state and federal court rulings and recently, in order to try and get a handle on where things stand, what’s at stake and what might happen next, NC Newsline’s Rob Schofield caught up with one of our state’s top good government champions, Common Cause of North Carolina Policy Director, Ann Webb.

From the precipitous economic decline, to the mass firings of federal workers, to the rise of an immigrant deportation program that has cast aside traditional norms of due process, the national news has been chockful of unprecedented and highly controversial actions.
So how has this drumbeat of controversy impacted the views of North Carolina voters? A new public opinion survey from the Meredith College Poll indicates that people are very concerned – both about the direction the country is headed and the performance of the Trump administration. And recently NC Newsline’s Rob Schofield caught up with poll director David McLennan to learn more.

(Photo illustration by Scott Olson/Getty Images)The Trump administration this month scrapped a Biden-era proposal that would have required state Medicaid programs and allowed federal Medicare to pay for some GLP-1s for obesity treatment. Instead, state Medicaid programs will retain the choice of whether to cover the high-priced medications for their residents.
The drugs, which have historically been prescribed to diabetic patients, also help patients lose weight and have grown in popularity among doctors and patients. But they are generally too expensive for most people to afford without insurance.
While doctors and patient advocates say these drugs are critical to helping patients struggling with obesity and can save money in the long run by reducing comorbidities such as heart disease, others say the medications are just too expensive for most states to afford. More than a dozen state Medicaid programs have opted to cover GLP-1s for obesity treatment, and the proposed Biden rule would have asked all states to figure out how to pay for them. But now, advocates fear these drugs may continue to be out of reach for many.
“It’s unfortunate that they’re excluding a whole class of medications that seem to have a tremendous number of health benefits to patients,” Dr. Nicholas Pennings, chair of family medicine at Campbell University in Buies Creek, North Carolina, said in an interview.










I think that’s just part of the inherent bias towards the treatment of people with obesity.


– Dr. Nicholas Pennings, chair of family medicine at Campbell University


GLP-1s, which stand for glucagon-like peptide-1, are a class of drugs that balance blood sugar levels. They’ve long been prescribed to patients with Type 2 diabetes. But since the drugs also curb hunger signals, doctors may prescribe these drugs — including popular brands Wegovy and Ozempic — to help patients lose weight.
Medicaid is a joint federal-state funded program that mostly serves people with lower incomes under the age of 65 or who have a disability. The federal Medicare program focuses primarily on people above the age of 65, no matter their income.
How and whether to cover expensive treatments and drugs can be a significant deliberation for state Medicaid directors. In North Carolina, where 70% of people struggle with being overweight or obese, officials opted to begin covering the drugs for weight loss last year. That coverage has been a game changer, said Pennings, who continues to treat Medicaid patients.
“They are expensive, but there’s a lot of other medications that are expensive too. Why is it that obesity medications and diabetes medications are being selected out?” Pennings said. “I think that’s just part of the inherent bias towards the treatment of people with obesity, feeling like it’s cheating or not necessary.”
The list price for Wegovy is around $1,300 per month, and for Ozempic, around $1,000. Even so, the skyrocketing popularity of these drugs has prompted at least 14 state Medicaid departments to begin covering these drugs to treat obesity in the past decade.
In addition to North Carolina, those states include California, Delaware, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Virginia and Wisconsin.
An annual survey of Medicaid directors from health policy research group KFF recently found that half of the 47 responding states not already covering the drugs were considering doing so.
In January, the National Association of Medicaid Directors told the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services that state Medicaid departments had “significant concerns over the fiscal impacts” of the Biden proposal to require coverage of GLP-1s, and “strongly recommend that CMS maintain the current state option to cover or not cover anti-obesity medications.”
But others say covering the drugs will yield long-term savings.
John Cawley, a professor of economics and public policy at Cornell University who has studied the economic impacts of obesity, has found that obesity essentially doubles a person’s annual health care costs due to comorbidities such as heart disease, fatty liver disease and kidney disease.
He’s found that weight loss among those with extreme obesity, with a BMI of 40 or higher, can yield substantial reductions in medical care costs.
Cawley added that state Medicaid programs “have a lot of flexibility” in ensuring costs don’t get out of control, by, for example, covering a newly available generic version of GLP-1s, requiring prior authorization, and asking patients to try behavioral programs before getting a prescription.
North Carolina’s Medicaid department began covering GLP-1s for obesity in August. The state has been able to afford GLP-1 coverage by negotiating rebates, or discounts, with drug manufacturers, and by getting the federal government to cover some costs. Department leaders think lowering obesity will save the state money in the long run, said Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for North Carolina Medicaid.
He said that one of the benefits of Medicaid is that “we get to choose, as a state, where we want to make kind of those extra investments or not.” He added that covering the medications could be potentially financially feasible for other states.
“Each program is different and has its own pressures. It would be welcome to be able to come together with other states to be able to negotiate broader deals,” Ludlam said. “If North Carolina is able to get a good deal, I don’t know why other states wouldn’t be able to participate in that.”
In 2023, Connecticut enacted a law requiring Medicaid to cover obesity treatment services. The program began covering GLP-1s for weight loss, but costs were significant enough that the state told providers this year that it is now focusing on other obesity treatments instead.
Sean Scanlon, the Connecticut comptroller, said that not covering GLP-1s is “shortsighted, bad policy.” The state health plan, which takes care of teachers and other state employees, has been covering the drugs for weight loss since 2023. The plan controls costs by only prescribing GLP-1s after patients go through some online weight-loss counseling, said Scanlon.
“The most fiscally conservative thing we can do is give people tools that will save the taxpayers money in the long run,” he said in an interview. “And GLP-1 drugs are one of the best tools that we have to ensure that the taxpayers are not going to pay more money for the health care of hundreds of millions of people in the long run.”
It’s unclear whether the federal government will reverse course. In the past, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has recommended “three good meals a day” and behavioral changes rather than weight-loss medication.
But this month, Kennedy told CBS News he’s considering a regulatory framework to have Medicare and Medicaid cover these “extraordinary drugs” in the future, once their cost goes down.
“Ideally, over the long-term, we’d like to see those drugs available for people after they try other interventions,” Kennedy said.

Two volunteers pretend to cook over a stove when another pair acting as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents comes knocking at the cardboard cutout of a door.
This is the set up for a skit that undocumented advocates put on at their Know Your Rights training sessions. Rojas helps organize them.
“I am committed to waking my people up so they know that he, she or they can share with others their rights,” Rojas said.
Rojas is an immigrant who is actively involved with the undocumented community in her city. She’s asked to not use her full name for the safety of herself and the undocumented community she works with.
She’s worried because of recent allegations that federal immigration officers have wrongfully detained residents in New England and beyond. At Boston Logan Airport recently, two people with legal immigration status were detained. One had a green card and was detained. The other had a legal work visa and was deported.
“It makes me nervous,” Rojas said in Spanish. “It makes me think of how we can be even more strategic with these kinds of attacks.”
Part of that strategy is teaching people their constitutional rights, because she said it’s now more important than ever for people to know how to use them if they ever interact with an ICE agent.
“Being out and about is scary, but I am committed to planting those seeds, because I know they’ll bloom,” Rojas said.
Blah-blah-blah, cha-cha-cha and practice
The Know Your Rights workshop Rojas and her fellow activists put on has three parts. She calls them the “blah, blah, blah”, the “cha, cha, cha” and then “practice, practice, practice.”
The “blah, blah, blah” is a lecture in which activists explicitly tell audience members their rights. The New Haven Immigrants Coalition has a slideshow presentation with the majority of the constitutional rights that Rojas goes over in her own presentation. It is available in English and Spanish.
Trainees then get to see these rights in action with skits, during the “cha, cha, cha” portion of the workshop.
“The skit is a theatrical way to get as close as we can to reality and to expose our trainees in different scenarios so they can think about it, feel about it, and then practice it,” Rojas said.

Scenarios include what to do when you are at home, in your car, at your workplace and when you’re in a public area.
Rojas and her team provide handout copies of a legitimate court-ordered warrant signed by a judge and an ICE administrative order. With an administrative order, you do not need to open the door, Rojas said, but it is a common tactic immigration agents use to gain entry into someone’s home, so it’s important to know the distinction.
“If [the ICE agents] come with different tricks, just don’t fall for it,” Rojas said. “If [the agents] say, ‘We have here a document that proves that we can get into your house.’ [You should say] ‘Okay, just slide it [under] the door.’”
Then comes “practice, practice, practice.”
Rojas has all the trainees line up in pairs with partners facing each other. With one person as themselves and the other person as an ICE agent, they’ll practice the skills they’ve learned using different scenarios that Rojas poses.
The ‘each one teach one’ approach
This April, Rojas’ advocacy group is starting a new program called “Train the Trainer.” The idea is to train people how to give these Know Your Rights workshops.
“This is intended to be in the safety of your house,” she said. Imagine it like a gathering, she said, where Mexican sweet corn cake and coffee is served.
“We are going to have tomalitos, café and know your rights,” Rojas said. The goal is to offer training sessions to people who are too afraid to go out in public.
“Can you imagine if we can train 40 people this time, and then the next session, they invite one, just one, one of the people that they train to come to another ‘Train the Trainer?’ Now we are going to have 80 people,” she said. “It makes a huge difference.”
Prepare a layered defense
At Castle Church in Norwich, Philip Berns was giving a Know Your Rights presentation with the Latino advocacy group LEAD late into the night in March. The people in the audience either spoke English, Spanish or Haitian Creole. Thankfully, Berns speaks all three languages.
Berns, an immigration attorney based in Stamford, has been giving Know Your Rights presentations since 2006. When President Donald Trump returned to office, Berns ramped up to offer about two presentations a week.
He likes to teach people a strategy for how to use a red card (la tarjeta roja). Think of it like a business card, but instead of your contact information, it has your constitutional rights listed. You can give it to an immigration agent if you’re unable to verbally state your rights, he said.

He recommends having at least six red cards on hand at all times and to give them out to each agent you interact with, but he said you should save the last one for the deportation judge to show that if you were detained, it was done while violating your constitutional rights.
“You just have to be ready to have a layered defense,” Berns said.
Knowing which of your rights were violated is the best way to defend yourself when facing a deportation judge if you end up detained, which is why, Berns said, Know Your Rights training is still “absolutely” important regardless of the cases of alleged wrongful detentions.
It also helps to have a video recording of the interaction with the immigration agent, Berns said, another right that Berns teaches people they have.
“They’re going to take your phone away from you, so you’re not gonna be able to record it yourself,” he said. “It’s going to have to be other people.”
That’s where bystanders can act as allies, he said.
Open the door to your community
Both Berns and Rojas agree that these workshops are not just for the undocumented. They’re for family members, friends and neighbors, regardless of immigration status.
“If you know your rights, you know that you don’t have to open the door, and that is the single biggest line of defense you have against [ICE agents] picking up anybody they’re looking for,” Berns said. “For all the other people in the house that [the ICE agents] are not looking for, but I suspect will likely pick up just to drive their numbers up, if they know their rights, then they can protect themselves against deportation [too].”
In Spanish, Rojas and her fellow activists have a saying.
“Close the door on ICE,” she said. “Open the door to your community.”

Norman served as secretary of the Kansas Department of Health and Environment throughout the pandemic. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Five years ago, Lee Norman was trying to dissuade Kansans from ingesting chemical cleaners to prevent COVID-19, preparing for the end of a statewide stay-at-home order and deciding whether to send tests for everyone in long-term care facilities and prisons.
Norman, then secretary of the Kansas Department of Health and Environment, jokes that reflecting on those years is like taking “a walk down bad memory lane.”
“We were meeting 24/7, 365,” Norman said on the Kansas Reflector podcast. “And trying to figure out — without having enough resources, without having (a) vaccine, without having any medications and without having any testing — what the heck we were going to do with this lethal virus that has now landed in the United States.”


Within two years of the first cases in Kansas, Norman stepped down from his cabinet post at the request of Gov. Laura Kelly’s administration.
The first case was recorded March 7, 2020, and about a week later, Kelly declared a state of emergency.
Less than a week after that, she ordered K-12 schools closed.
By the end of the month, national case counts inched toward 100,000, deaths reached 1,000, President Donald Trump signed a $2 trillion stimulus bill and Kelly issued a stay-at-home order for the entire state.
The first four weeks went “swimmingly well,” even amid uncertainty and shock, Norman said.
But, he said, things quickly became contentious as executive action from the governor, public health recommendations and attempts at understanding a brand new virus unfolded.
“You know, four weeks was pretty unusual to have that kind of engagement,” he said. “And after that, it became distinctly unfun.”
He admitted public health was slow to address the social and psychological impacts of the pandemic. But by the point he and other public health officials realized that, he said, resistance to following public health guidance had already begun to take shape.
The politicization that crept into Norman’s role during the COVID-19 pandemic still exists in public health today. The 2025 Kansas Legislature passed bills in April that hinder the governor’s authority to limit public gatherings and pare back vaccination requirements for children.
Norman, who now works in the private sector, said investing in public health infrastructure is key for preparing for future health crises.
As Kansans faced last year a spike in tuberculosis cases and more recently a growing measles outbreak, Norman emphasized the importance of vaccinations and adhering to public health guidance.
The governor signed into law in April modifications to vaccine requirements for children that make it easier for parents to claim religious exemptions as justification for their unvaccinated children. The governor vetoed another piece of legislation that created a pathway for people to sue state and county health officials for their decisions about quarantines and other public health guidance. The Legislature overrode Kelly’s veto, making the change law.
Masks and limiting large gatherings work, Norman said. They have for centuries, he added.
“Half of everybody, kind of wants to undo the benefits of public health, and mock it even, which is particularly hurtful,” Norman said. “I think that the Legislature needs to, one, respect personal autonomy and responsibility, and then secondly, if people are want to have more autonomy, I think they have to listen to very, very good guidance.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PC303579-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-04-28 13:12:30.119679

A few weeks after the birth, the two were temporarily separated. Hailey poses for a portrait after being temporarily reunited with her daughter on April 1 in Cuba. Asked what she misses most, Hailey replied: “Her smiling.” (Photo by Anna Spoerre/Missouri Independent)CUBA, Mo. — Hailey cradled her cat like a baby and nuzzled his fur. It wasn’t long before he rejected the attention and leapt from her arms in the callous way cats do. She cursed him in the way hormonal teenagers do.
Ash, a gray stray Hailey took in against her great-aunt’s protesting, became the teen’s comfort through a pregnancy and postpartum that spanned 10 foster homes, hospitals and group homes across Missouri.
Hailey entered the state foster system at 2 years old. She’s lost count of how many roofs she’s slept under.
Last spring at 15 years old, Hailey learned she was pregnant.
When she asked the state for an abortion, Hailey was told the possibility wasn’t up for discussion. By the time her stomach started to bulge, Missourians voted to codify the right to abortion in the state Constitution, and Hailey decided she wanted to parent.
But it wasn’t so simple.
By then, Hailey was staying with her great-aunt, Jodi Spradley, but the state remained her legal guardian. Though Hailey took initiative to prepare for motherhood, caseworkers on several occasions during her pregnancy threatened to take the baby after she was born, rolling out examples from Hailey’s long history in the state’s care.
In late February, just a few weeks after Hailey turned 16, her daughter was born. The resemblance is unmistakable: vibrant red locks, pale skin and blue eyes.
From the moment her baby girl entered the world, Hailey feared the state would take her. While that hasn’t happened permanently, the state did temporarily separate the young mother and child, moving them to different cities in different corners of the state.
By eight weeks postpartum, Hailey had slept in two hospitals and four homes.
Desperate to reunite her child with family as she was shuffled around the foster system, Hailey signed power of attorney of her daughter over to Spradley, to whom she also wanted to return.
In early April, after months of protesting the state’s push to move her into a faith-based maternity home, Hailey acquiesced. It allowed her to reunite with her daughter.
A few weeks later, on the eve of a court hearing to discuss her permanent placement, Hailey ran away from the maternity home with her 6-week-old in her arms. Both were quickly found and returned to state custody.
Hailey said she fled, in part, out of fear the state would officially declare she couldn’t live with Spradley. And she was terrified about where they might send her next.
The family’s fate remains uncertain.
Missouri has long been one of the most anti-abortion states in the country, with elected officials and advocates preaching the virtue of supporting young mothers to ensure abortion isn’t their only option.
But Hailey said this sentiment is a far cry from her experience. To her, it felt like the state first made the decision to continue the pregnancy for her, then actively worked to keep her from parenting her child.
The Independent spent months following Hailey and reviewing communications between her, Spradley, their advocates and the state that spanned Hailey’s pregnancy and postpartum.
The record of her struggles in the system illustrate what youth advocates and foster care experts say are repeated failures by the state to support Hailey, and later her daughter.
“Hailey was saying she wanted to parent, so she should have been supported,” said Laura Sullivan, a licensed independent social worker in Ohio who has spent several months advocating for Hailey. “In these states where they’re forcing pregnancies, especially teen pregnancies, they have to be ready to help these moms to parent.”
A spokesperson for the Missouri Department of Social Services, which oversees the state foster care system, said she could not discuss the specifics of Hailey’s case, instead pointing to Missouri’s Child Welfare Manual.
 ‘Don’t get pregnant’

The Facebook message came from a stranger.
“I have a child on my caseload who I believe is a relative to you,” an employee with a Missouri foster care agency wrote the morning of May 21, 2024.
Within hours, the state cleared and authorized Spradley to take her niece in under a temporary arrangement. Hailey was on her doorstep by that evening.
A letter dated that same day stated that while Hailey remained in the custody of Children’s Division, she was being placed with Spradley for an “indeterminate period.”
Though filled with gaps, the aunt and niece have a long history. Spradley used to take Hailey to the St. Louis Zoo, propping her up against the wooden railings to catch a glimpse of the animals. As Hailey got older, Spradley would take her driving around different corners of southeast Missouri to get ice cream or go to a park.
At times they went years without seeing one another. Though another great-aunt of Hailey’s — Spradley’s sister — adopted Hailey when she was 4, Hailey spent much of her childhood shuffled between different foster homes and mental hospitals.

She was a flight risk almost everywhere she went until she landed at Spradley’s.
“Don’t get pregnant,” Hailey recalled Spradley telling her when she moved in.
A few weeks later, Hailey went to the doctor to confirm what she feared. Hailey, who only a few months earlier had turned 15, was pregnant.
She wanted an abortion in the beginning. When Hailey asked her case worker if it was possible, she was told the state wasn’t allowed to discuss it with her. Abortion at the time remained illegal in Missouri with limited exceptions for medical emergencies.
Hailey couldn’t get up the nerve to tell Spradley she was pregnant, so she made a friend break the news instead. But Spradley didn’t kick her out. She doubled down on her desire to help.
Spradley searched the internet for answers. She sent a note to JustChoice — an agency based out of Ohio that helps people create abortion, adoption or parenting plans — saying her niece had been denied an abortion and now wanted to raise her child.
There was just one problem, Spradley said: Though months from her due date, the state was already threatening to take away Hailey’s baby.
 ‘We’re going to remove that baby’

Sullivan, the licensed independent social worker at JustChoice, reached out to Spradley after her organization received her message in late 2024. With Spradley’s permission, she started communicating with Hailey’s case worker to talk about a parenting plan.
Sullivan recalls the case worker in their initial calls telling her: “I don’t think Hailey’s going to be able to parent. We’re going to remove that baby. Her and her aunt, this is not a stable situation; they have a long history with the agency.’”
Most urgent, the case worker told Sullivan, was Spradley’s lack of adequate housing. If she wanted to maintain custody of Hailey through her pregnancy, she needed somewhere else to live.
After staying with a friend in St. Louis, Spradley and Hailey moved into the home and church of a former pastor in Wright City. Some of Spradley’s friends had pointed them to the old building off a rural highway as emergency accommodations.
The house, which abutted woods and farmland, sat untouched after the pastor died months earlier.
In the main room, religious relics crowded the wall. Behind one closed door was what Hailey dubbed the “porn room,” after they found explicit images on an abandoned computer. Hailey slept upstairs beneath old posters of semi trucks plastered to the walls.
The lack of heat became a growing concern as winter approached.
The state began talking of removing Hailey from Spradley’s care; a faith-based maternity home in the St. Louis suburbs that contracts with the state was suggested. Hailey remained adamant she didn’t want to go. When her case worker recommended she have bags packed and by the door the week of Christmas, she listened.
But she also shut down, growing moodier as the looming threat of removal hung over the holidays.
The new year came and went. Hailey’s bags remained by the door. The state never stopped by.
Sullivan, searching for a solution, teamed up with Right By You, an “all options” nonprofit focused on helping pregnant youth, to raise money for Spradley to rent an upgraded apartment.
Within weeks, Right By You raised $5,000 — primarily through Missouri donors and abortion funds — to cover Spradley’s rent through May. Meanwhile, Sullivan worked the phones with Spradley, calling landlords in an attempt to find someone who would accept a pregnant teen, a 52-year-old on disability, two dogs and one cat.
She found a solution in Cuba, a town about 80 miles southwest of St. Louis.
By mid-January, Hailey and Spradley were moved into a small, unadorned two-bedroom apartment.
Spradley reached out to her network of friends, asking if they could help furnish the apartment with baby essentials as a birthday surprise for Hailey, who turned 16 in late January.
They came by the truck-load, dropping off strollers, onesies and a swing. Spradley used some of the disability back-pay she received to splurge on a crib and a bottle sanitizer.
In the end, it still wasn’t enough.
 ‘Where are you going to live?’

Spradley didn’t take Hailey in sooner for many reasons. Poverty and poor health were the most prevailing.
“So what’s your plan for where you are going to live?” Hailey’s case worker asked in a text to Spradley months earlier, shortly after Hailey learned she was pregnant. “Do you have any money saved?”
“I had absolutely no income when Hailey was brought to me,” Spradley replied. “Not a dime. I get SSI disability which is very little.”
But once together, Hailey didn’t want to leave. Finally, someone understood her — a sarcastic and brash teen with a tendency to raise her voice.
“Some people would see what she’s doing and would freak out, but they don’t understand what she’s grown up and what she’s went through,” Spradley said. “That’s why I don’t judge her on that. That’s the big difference between me and other people.”
Unlike a foster parent, Spradley didn’t receive consistent financial benefits from the state for taking Hailey in. Though she attempted on several occasions to get certified as a foster parent through the state, she never received the final approval.
Spradley suspects it’s because she’s poor and sick.
She’s often seized by anxiety, which she said has only worsened since beginning to navigate the state’s hurdles in her attempts to help Hailey. She suffers from agoraphobia, Crohn’s disease, heart conditions and often uses a walker.
Spradley attributed some of her ailments to growing up in Times Beach, Missouri. It’s now a ghost town, beset by a chemical contamination that came to light in the 1980s. The Environmental Protection Agency deemed it “one of the worst environmental disasters in our nation’s history.”
Hailey is as determined as her aunt.
She enrolled in teen parenting classes through Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis as she started her second trimester. Between that and her prenatal appointments, she made weekly trips to St. Louis through her third trimester.
Most weeks, she made the trip without Spradley, booking and boarding a van through MO HealthNet, the state’s Medicaid program. The vehicle usually picked up other patients along the way, stretching what was normally a 90-minute drive into multiple hours.
The state on several occasions expressed concern with this arrangement, telling both Spradley and Sullivan that Hailey needed constant supervision.
Instead, Spradley kept an eye on Hailey’s location from an app on her cell phone.
Every year, Missouri social services agencies seize millions of dollars in Social Security benefits from foster children. Hailey is among them.
When Sullivan questioned how the state was using Hailey’s payments, which typically go toward funding foster care, she was told it was being used to pay for Medicaid expenses and the van rides.
She remains skeptical. That $400 a month could have gone a long way to help Spradley purchase furniture and buy groceries, both of which she said were held against her toward the end of Hailey’s pregnancy.
 Birth, ‘then I was out’

Days before Hailey went into labor, the state followed through on its threat.
Hailey was removed from Spradley’s apartment in Cuba and sent to a private foster home near St. Louis.
The foster mother, a stranger, drove her to the hospital. Once settled into a room, Hailey said the foster parent told her she was running down to the cafeteria.
Instead, she left Hailey at the hospital and never returned.
Hailey’s daughter was born two days later, on Feb. 26. The moment of joy was brief; within minutes, Hailey lost consciousness.
“I had a whole asthma attack, then I ended up throwing up everything in my stomach, and then shaking so bad that my jaw was hurting,” she said. “Then I was out.”
It took two blood transfusions to stem her postpartum hemorrhage.
Hailey ultimately stayed in the hospital for 12 days. Not because of her health, she said, but because the state didn’t know where else to send her.
This isn’t uncommon. In 2024, there were 314 Missouri foster children residing in hospitals. Others were held in hotels, offices and out-of-state residential treatment facilities.

While at the hospital, Hailey learned how to breastfeed. She believes her daughter shares her own lactose intolerance since she doesn’t take well to most formulas.
In many ways the two girls resemble Hailey’s mother, who was found dead in 2011, two years after Hailey had been removed from her custody. She was in the third trimester of pregnancy with a second daughter, who didn’t survive. The autopsy concluded a drug overdose. Spradley still believes it was something more nefarious.
A few months before Hailey gave birth, she asked Spradley if she could see the place where her mom died. They drove 60 miles to the apartment and asked the current tenant if they could look around. Hailey asked lots of questions. Spradley hoped it was healing.
She tries to tell Hailey stories of her mother often. Like the time Hailey’s mother, while pregnant with her, found a free mini fridge at a scrap sale and walked miles home with it. She later did the same with a kiddie pool.
Hailey doesn’t know her father. She hopes her daughter won’t, either.
The line for “father” on the birth certificate is blank, as Hailey intended.
She says little about the 20-year-old other than that they first met at a foster home years earlier, that he beat her and that he was, for a time, homeless.
Multiple warrants are out for his arrest, including for failure to appear in court on trespassing and theft charges.
Throughout Hailey’s pregnancy, one of Spradley’s closest friends, Brandie Coleman, was among her fiercest defenders. When Hailey gave birth, Coleman was by her side, Facetiming with Spradley, who feared the state might punish her for being there.
As Hailey recovered from her hemorrhage, Coleman says a hospital social worker confided in her that a state case worker had been trying to convince her to report Hailey to child protective services so they could remove her baby. But Coleman says the hospital employee refused, not seeing any evidence of abuse or neglect.
Stephanie Kraft Sheley, founder of Right By You, the Missouri-based reproductive rights group that helped fundraise for Hailey and Spradley, said the family’s self-advocacy was admirable.
And in a way, she believes, they were punished for it.
She called Hailey’s case “such a blatant example of a pregnancy literally forced by the state, and then a very clear bias against this person and this notion that her child would be better off with a different family, and she was told that explicitly. And I just honestly was a little bit surprised how unveiled that was. There wasn’t really any pretense about it.” 
  Stephanie Kraft Sheley, founder of Right By You, called Hailey a “forceful self advocate,” adding: “It’s really admirable for someone so young, who’s in such a disempowered situation.” (Photo by Anna Spoerre/Missouri Independent)
Kraft Sheley, who is also an attorney, said the fact that Hailey had a family member who wanted to take her in — who understood her — was huge. That Hailey was deprived of that support in the days leading up to and after her labor was “such inhumanity.”
“For any person to lose their home and be ripped away from their loved one within three days, four days of giving birth, one of the most formative, transformational experiences of a person’s life, she was treated with such a lack of care,” Kraft Sheley said. “… As a teen in such a vulnerable situation, she deserved to be held and surrounded by care, and instead, she was placed in this really precarious, uncertain situation.”
 Postpartum ‘disrupted’

When Hailey was finally discharged from the hospital, she and her baby were driven 200 miles southwest to Springfield.
There, they were placed in a private foster home with other teen moms.
Less than a week later, Hailey called Spradley. She was being taken to a mental health hospital to be screened for postpartum depression. Hailey said she was told it was because the foster parent heard her yelling; Hailey said she was yelling at a friend on the phone, not at her baby.
“I never heard this kid cry like she did,” Spradley said of Hailey during the phone call.
Her daughter was napping when they took Hailey away.
At the hospital, Hailey said she didn’t screen positive for postpartum depression but was diagnosed with adjustment disorder, meaning she has stronger emotional or behavioral responses to stress and trauma.
Hailey said when she learned she was being admitted to the hospital without her daughter, she had to be sedated after she started “throwing hands” at staff. She remained there for six days.
Spradley had little contact with Hailey in the hospital once her phone was taken away. When Hailey was released, she signed power of attorney for her daughter over to Spradley.
As Spradley drove to pick up Hailey’s child, Hailey was taken to yet another location — this time a group home in southeast Missouri.
Hailey believes the separation from her daughter was intentional. Within the first month of her child’s life, the two had been apart nearly as much as they’d been together.
She tried to continue pumping breast milk. At the start of her third trimester, Hailey had already started collecting small bottles of colostrum. But it didn’t take long after being separated from her daughter for her milk supply to diminish.

“For a teen mom, especially one with attachment issues like Hailey has, to be able to breastfeed successfully, that is beautiful and amazing, and could have been really healing,” Sullivan said. “But it was disrupted. So that caused both Hailey harm and (her daughter) harm.”
Sullivan, who has also worked as a social worker in two states, said it’s easy to use a teen’s years-long history in the system against them unfairly. She doesn’t believe Missouri ever gave Hailey a fair chance.
“Instead of being like, ‘This is a kid who we know has a lot of trauma and a lot of stuff, we should probably try to figure out how we’re going to help her parent and heal so she can be a good parent,’” Sullivan said. “‘It was just, ‘We’re on a mission to make her not be able to parent.’”
 ‘I’m not giving up on you’

On a sunny day in early April, Hailey returned to her aunt’s home in Cuba.
For the second time in a week, she held her daughter, who was one day shy of 5 weeks old.
Hailey’s milk supply had mostly dried up. She considered attempting to breastfeed, but then opted to make a bottle instead.
“Has she given you all the stink face yet?” Hailey asked as Spradley confirmed with a chuckle.
“Good. That’s my child,” Hailey replied, smiling down at her daughter as she fed her.
She sat in her old room again, across from stickers adhered to the wall welcoming her baby home. She urged the dogs to be careful as they investigated her baby’s scent. She cuddled her cat.
It was all temporary.

Hailey was back for just part of the day on an authorized off-site visit. A few hours later, Spradley would drive her 90 minutes back to the group home where Hailey would again kiss her baby goodbye.
Until then, she changed diapers, went through paperwork and sorted baby clothes, a sense of normalcy in a life that had been anything but.
As Hailey lounged on the couch with her daughter and Spradley rocked her small dog, named Baby, in the corner, Spradley’s cell phone rang. At the sight of the caller ID, an old friend of Spradley’s, Hailey perked up and grabbed for the phone to say hello.
“You know what? I love the sound of your voice right now. You sound so happy,” Spradley’s friend said to Hailey before pausing. “Honestly, are you doing OK?”
“Not for good, sadly,” Hailey said. “Jodi kidnapped me for the day though.”
She outlined her plan to return permanently to her daughter. The first step was the maternity home she initially resisted. It was her only option she saw to parent.
Less than a week later she checked into the St. Louis area facility. Spradley met her in the lobby with the baby.
The past several months have been hard on Spradley. Anxiety attacks bare themselves in the middle of the night. She worries over Hailey and her daughter. She worries over herself. When she first took in Hailey, there were days she wondered if the stress was too much and if she should send Hailey away. But now, the house feels devastatingly empty without her.
When Hailey was 11 weeks pregnant, she snuck Ash, the cat, into the house against Spradley’s wishes. At the time it infuriated Spradley, who was already having a difficult time feeding two humans and two dogs, making frequent trips to the food pantry. Then she saw how much comfort the cat brought Hailey as she faced an unknown future.
When Hailey was taken away, Spradley started letting the cat sleep beside her at night.
Over the years, Hailey ran from multiple family members and foster homes.
But she never ran from Spradley. It’s something Hailey’s social worker pointed out to Spradley in messages throughout Hailey’s pregnancy, and something Spradley continues to emphasize in her fight to bring Hailey and her daughter back under her roof.

It’s why Spradley wasn’t shocked when she learned at Hailey’s most recent placement hearing in mid-April that she had run away from the maternity home just hours earlier.
“I don’t believe what the system is doing to her… She is a child that’s been in that system for so long that they broke her,” Spradley said the next day, after police located Hailey and her daughter about 130 miles east, in south-central Illinois.
“Sometimes she makes me so mad,” Spradley continued, “but I just can’t blame her for what they did to her. I blame them. I blame the system.”
After Hailey and her daughter were located by the state, they were moved to another foster home, just outside St. Louis.
A few days later, Hailey said her case worker showed up with police, insisting her daughter was underweight and needed to be evaluated at the hospital. Spradley rushed to St. Louis Children’s Hospital to meet them. There, she said doctors gave the baby a clean bill of health and noted she gained weight since the week prior.
Then on Friday, hours after the Missouri Department of Social Services responded to a request for comment on Hailey’s case from The Independent, her case worker called Spradley. The state would soon allow Hailey and her daughter to return to Spradley’s care, at least until a court made a more permanent placement decision, Spradley said.
Despite the sudden good news, nothing about the family’s situation is set in stone.
“I’m scared about what tomorrow’s going to bring,” Spradley said Sunday.
She often reflects on words she spoke to Hailey’s mother not long before she died. Hailey was in a private foster home at the time.
“I promise you I’m going to bring Hailey home,” she said more than a decade ago.
It’s why Spradley didn’t hesitate when Hailey reached out for help. Though when asked about that decision, Hailey, who doesn’t tend toward sentimentality, said, “I knew she’d take my dumb ass.”
She flipped Spradley the bird. Spradley mirrored the motion.
“Me and Hailey, our relationship, even when she has hardships, I’m like, ‘I’m not letting you go,’” Spradley said. “I’m not giving up on you.”
It’s why Hailey chose Spradley to help raise her daughter.
She’s adamant her daughter won’t end up in the state’s care the way she did.
“What they’re doing is f**ked,” Hailey said of her lifetime spent in the foster system.
Spradley is ready to fight right there alongside her niece.
“We want her to experience an actual caring family and have support rather than toss you aside whenever they can’t handle you,” Spradley said. “If they can’t handle you at your worst, then they don’t deserve you at your best, right?”

WASHINGTON — Americans are increasingly unsure what to believe about measles as an outbreak spreads throughout the country, according to a survey released Wednesday by the nonpartisan health research organization KFF.
The poll shows that nearly a quarter of those asked believe a commonly repeated false claim that getting a child vaccinated against measles could lead to autism. About the same percentage of those surveyed believe it’s either definitely or probably true that vitamin A can prevent someone from contracting measles, even though it cannot.
And 19% of those surveyed believed untrue statements that the vaccine for measles is more dangerous than contracting the virus.
Parents who believed at least one of the three incorrect claims were more likely to have delayed or skipped some vaccinations for their children. Nearly a quarter, 24%, of those surveyed said they haven’t protected their children via vaccination, more than double the 11% of parents who responded that all three of the false statements about measles were definitely or probably untrue.
 Ongoing outbreak

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that as of late last week there are more than 800 measles diagnoses throughout at least 25 states.
The infections are spread throughout different age groups with 31% of cases in children under five years old, 38% of diagnoses in those between five and 19 years old, 29% in people above the age of 20 and 2% in those with an unknown age, according to the CDC.
Eighty-five patients have been hospitalized and three have died. Nearly all of the confirmed cases, 96%, are in people who have not received the MMR vaccine or who are unsure about their vaccination status, according to the CDC.
States with confirmed cases include Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont and Washington.
Virginia reported its first case this year over the weekend, though that’s not yet included on the CDC’s website about the ongoing outbreak.
 Understanding linked with concern

KFF’s survey shows that even though there are many people who believe untrue claims about measles or the MMR vaccine — which protects against measles, mumps and rubella — there are higher percentages of people who understand basic facts about the virus and who are concerned about the ongoing outbreak.
Seventy-five percent of those polled said it was incorrect that the MMR vaccine leads to autism, 81% responded it was wrong to say the vaccine is more dangerous than contracting the virus and 75% said it was false that vitamin A can prevent someone from getting measles.
About half, or 51%, of those surveyed said they are at least somewhat concerned about the spread of measles. That worry was highest among Hispanic adults, 62%, and Black adults, 61%.
Most of the people surveyed, 56%, knew that the spread of measles was higher this year than during prior years, though that number varied among people of different political leanings.
Seventy-one percent of Democrats knew that diagnoses of measles have spiked in recent months, compared with 54% of independents and 49% of Republicans.
KFF conducted the survey of 1,380 adults between April 8 and April 15 via telephone and online questions.

Gun regulation has been one of the most hotly contested issues at the North Carolina General Assembly this year.
Lawmakers have introduced bills on a myriad of topics: constitutional carry, handguns at private schools and privacy around concealed carry permits, to name a few.
Permitless concealed carry — known as constitutional carry due to the idea that individuals have the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms without infringement — has drawn the most attention.
Senate Bill 50, Freedom to Carry NC, would allow individuals who are U.S. citizens, at least 18 years of age and not otherwise prohibited by law to carry concealed weapons without applying for a permit.
It’s backed by Republican leadership and would make North Carolina the 30th state to approve of constitutional carry. The bill has passed the Senate and awaits further approval in the House.
Its counterpart in the lower chamber, House Bill 5, or NC Constitutional Carry Act, is largely the same. This measure still needs approval from the House Rules Committee.
The biggest difference in the legislation is that HB 5 would authorize elected officials in the state to carry a concealed firearm “while performing their official duties if the official has a concealed handgun permit.” While the State Capitol and Executive Mansion are excluded from this list, it would be allowed at the State Legislative Building and Legislative Office Building, where lawmakers conduct their business.
States move to outlaw popular ‘Glock switches’ that make some guns fully automatic

North Carolina residents are overwhelmingly opposed to the measures, according to newly released polls. But lawmakers have chosen to move forward.
“There is political play around this policy that is lawmakers in both chambers pandering to the far right extremists and, frankly, being more worried about their own primaries … than they are about the safety of their constituents,” said Monisha Henley, senior vice president for government affairs at Everytown from Gun Safety. “That is why they’ve been trying to push it through the legislature at lightning speed.”
A 2022 study from the Crime Prevention Research Center looked at changes in crime and killings of police after adopting constitutional carry. Using data from 13 states, researchers found that the drop in murder is statistically significant, but the change in violent crime is not.
Paul Valone, president of the Grass Roots North Carolina gun rights group, has spent decades working on the issue. He’s modeled his advocacy after legislation in Vermont, the first state that didn’t have restrictions requiring permits for concealed carry.
“SB 50 and HB 5 are not perfect bills, but they’re what’s achievable right now,” Valone said. “Those of us who have spent a lot of time in the movement believe that because we lost our rights over generations incrementally, we will probably have to win them back incrementally.”
The movement has spread to schools. House Bill 193, Firearm Law Revisions, authorizes individuals with a valid concealed handgun permit to possess or carry a handgun on educational property owned, used, or operated by a private school.
The bill’s wording would allow anybody lawfully entitled to carry a concealed weapon to do so on the premises of a private school below the college level, with written permission from the school. This could be school officials, teachers, and even students.
“This bill endangers students, it endangers teachers, and people don’t want it,” Rep. Deb Butler (D-New Hanover) said during a committee hearing. “You’re telling the teachers of North Carolina that we don’t really care what you say.”
Coming up Tuesday, members of the House Judiciary 2 committee will discuss The Firearms Liberty Act. House Bill 674 would among other changes allow for the issuance of lifetime concealed handgun permits.
School districts promote secure storage
NC S.A.F.E. (Secure All Firearms Effectively), a statewide initiative to raise awareness on storing firearms safely, announced a partnership with the Wake County Public School System last Thursday. NC S.A.F.E for Schools is designed to help school districts across the state share resources about safe gun storage with parents in the district.
Youth gun deaths in the US have surged 50% since 2019

The Wake County Board of Education unanimously passed a resolution in March of last year to “regularly and consistently” provide families with information and resources on the importance of secure gun storage.
North Carolina experienced at least 12 incidents of gunfire on school grounds in 2024, resulting in one death and nine injuries. Residents of Raleigh’s Hedingham neighborhood are still reeling from an October 2022 mass shooting in which a teenager who was able to access his father’s firearms killed five people and wounded two others. The teen charged in that shooting spree will go to trial in 2026.
Research has shown that secure firearm storage practices are associated with up to a 32% reduction in the risk of self-inflicted and unintentional firearm deaths.
“As a school system, we have resolved to educate our community on the importance of safe gun storage and its role in protecting students.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)I watched the April 8 Senate Finance Committee hearing on Rhode Island’s critically essential but chronically underfunded public transit system, which faces a $32.6 million budget deficit. Committee members hammered the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority’s (RIPTA) new CEO for the agency’s decision to delay a mandated efficiency study due back in March. As lawmakers hinted that the delay in conducting the study justified not providing additional funding for RIPTA, a thought circled my mind: Where is the efficiency study for the new Washington Bridge?
Public transit in Rhode Island has always been held to an unfair standard compared to other public services, especially highways. Nobody proposed doing a cost/benefit analysis before funding the new Washington Bridge despite it costing $713 million. Legislators may argue that the potential for financial savings is a good reason for withholding funding from RIPTA until the efficiency study finishes, but I can make a pretty good guess as to what the results will be. RIPTA has been studied for efficiency seven other times. 
The Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council did so in 2002. The Acadia Consulting Group did so in 2006. Consultants Abrams-Cherwony & Associates did so in 2007. The Special Legislative Commission to Study Transit Service in the State of Rhode Island did so in 2007. Then-Gov. Don Carcieri did so in 2008. The Senate Commission on Sustainable Transportation Funding did so in 2011. And finally, RIPTA gave a presentation to the Senate Oversight Committee in March 2023, which references findings by the American Bus Benchmarking Group of RIPTA “outperforming similar agencies across the country in almost every key performance indicator. Despite a chronic lack of funding, RIPTA provides more trips, across a larger area, at a more effective cost per trip than other transit agencies that serve similar population areas anywhere in America.” 
These reports didn’t find inefficiencies within RIPTA that would magically fix its fiscal cliff – rather, many highlighted the need to expand transit and praised RIPTA’s ability to run efficient, award-winning service despite chronic underfunding. Nearly all of these reports proposed many solutions to address the critical need for sustainable, long-term funding for RIPTA; yet two decades later, few of these solutions have ever materialized as RIPTA hobbles from one fiscal year to the next. 
At this point, it’s challenging to see how this eighth efficiency study is anything other than an attempt to avoid funding public transit and deprive Rhode Islanders of the economic growth, traffic reduction, and mobility justice that we deserve.
There is a reason we don’t ask public libraries, state parks, or highway builders to do efficiency studies before giving them money: Financial efficiency is at odds with serving the public effectively. RIPTA’s highest cost services are its rural routes, like the 10x that provides the only transit service to Foster and North Scituate. However, these “inefficient” rural routes are lifelines for the riders who use them and are often the only difference between financial stability and unemployment. RIPTA is a public service, not a business, and it can’t effectively serve the needs of all Rhode Islanders if it is forced to be efficient. There is a reason it’s not called the “Providence County Public Transit Authority.”










At this point, it’s challenging to see how this eighth efficiency study is anything other than an attempt to avoid funding public transit and deprive Rhode Islanders of the economic growth, traffic reduction, and mobility justice that we deserve.


There is no more couch change to find. RIPTA was forced to do more with less when federal funding cuts  plowed a $6M budget gap in 2014. Since 2010, RIPTA has slimmed and slimmed as its largest funding source has withered up, while RIDOT’s budget grew one and a half times as fast. Any belt-tightening left was erased in the financially destructive COVID pandemic, as RIPTA remained one of the only transit agencies in the nation that didn’t cut service.
We don’t need one more study to know that RIPTA is one of the most efficient transit systems in the nation, that 30,000 Rhode Islanders depend on it daily, and that hundreds to thousands would lose their jobs if service is cut. We don’t need one more study to know that the state’s highway system can’t handle even more cars on the road, and it will be impossible to meet our state’s Act on Climate mandates if RIPTA collapses. What we do need is for our state leaders to fund transit as the essential public service it is, to recognize how detrimental letting RIPTA collapse will be for household income, student outcomes, congestion, and the local economy. We don’t need an eighth efficiency study to understand that for tens of thousands of Rhode Islanders, the collapse of RIPTA is like the collapse of a second Washington Bridge.

The Delaware Prescription Opioid Settlement Distribution Commission (POSDC) has opened applications for its third round of grant funding, announcing approximately $13 million in available funds to support initiatives tackling the state’s ongoing opioid crisis.
The funding is aimed at empowering local organizations to launch or expand programs focused on addiction recovery, prevention, and support for those impacted by opioid use disorder.
The grants are part of Delaware’s broader effort to use opioid settlement dollars to address the public health emergency caused by the nationwide epidemic.
“This grant funding offers a critical opportunity to provide real help to individuals, families, and communities struggling with the devastating effects of opioid addiction,” said Joanna Champney, co-chair of the POSDC. “We are committed to supporting programs that promote healing through evidence-based solutions and measurable outcomes.”
Attorney General Kathy Jennings, who also serves as co-chair of the commission, emphasized the importance of using funds recovered from pharmaceutical companies to drive meaningful change.

“This work is close to my heart,” Jennings, co-chair of the POSDC, said. “We at the Department of Justice have been fighting tooth and nail, often punching above our weight, to hold Big Pharma accountable for the devastation they have caused in Delaware. And we have had some big wins, bringing back millions of precious dollars to fund treatment and abatement of the opioid crisis in our state.”
Grants from opioid settlement
Three types of grants are available:

Micro-Grants (up to $10,000): For rapid-response projects, particularly from smaller or community-based organizations.
Mini-Grants ($10,000–$30,000): For more structured projects targeting specific outcomes.
General Grants ($30,000 and up): For larger, long-term programs with established infrastructure and a proven track record.

“We are seeing some real progress with a staggering reduction in the epidemic’s death toll over the last year thanks to the many fantastic people and organizations, the commission included, dedicated to this vital work,” Jennings said. “Yet, there is still so much to be done. Now is the time to dig in and double down, and I trust that this round of grant funding will give us that edge to keep pushing forward.”
Applications opened on April 21. A series of informational webinars for prospective applicants will be held on April 28, May 5, and May 12. The application deadline is May 19.

(Courtesy of Jon Bahr/MilkShake Factory)The number of births in some Western states that are adding new housing rose last year, reversing losses the year before in many cases, according to new federal statistics released Wednesday.
Increases from 2023 to 2024 were highest in Colorado (4.5%), Idaho (3.8%), Utah (3.6%), Washington state and Nebraska (each 2.6%). Births increased around 2% in West Virginia, South Dakota, North Carolina, Montana, Rhode Island and South Carolina.
Almost all those states had decreases in births the previous year, and many have been building housing rapidly since 2023. Idaho, North Carolina and Utah have issued enough building permits in 2023 and 2024 to add about 4% to their housing stock, the highest in the nation.
Melissa Kearney, an economics professor at the University of Maryland who specializes in families and fertility, said there could be a link between homebuilding and more babies.
“It is quite possible that increased access to home ownership, coming from a reduction in the price of houses in places that are building more houses, could meaningfully increase birth rates,” Kearney told Stateline in an e-mail.
Many of the other states with increases in births are also seeing building booms: Colorado, Nebraska, South Carolina, South Dakota and Washington state are all set to add more than 2% to housing stock based on permits issued in 2023 and 2024, according to a Stateline analysis of U.S. Census Bureau Building Permits Survey data.
Building permits can take up to two years to translate into finished houses and apartments, but they indicate which states are most willing to allow new housing that can boost population, tax receipts and the workforce. In Colorado, Denver County is set to add almost 10,000 housing units and in Idaho, Ada County, which includes Boise, could add 11,200 units based on building permits.
Nationally births were slightly higher in 2024 than the year before, by about 1%, according to provisional federal numbers from the National Vital Statistics System within the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The fertility rate also increased slightly, but it remains below the “replacement level” needed to keep the population stable — 2.1 children for each woman over her lifetime.
All the increase nationally was in births to Hispanic and Asian mothers, with births continuing to decline for Black, American Indian and white mothers. Births to teenagers and women ages 20-24, in sharp decline since 2007, continued to drop last year, while births increased for women 25 and older.
The number of births dropped most in states struggling with stagnant population: falling about 4% in Louisiana, 3% in Mississippi, and 2% in New Mexico and New Hampshire. All those states had little or no population growth between mid-2023 and mid-2024, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates.

Cigarette smoking has declined dramatically among adults and youth, state data shows. (Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Smoking has steadily declined in Alaska over the past decades, evidence that coordinated health campaigns mounted over several years have been effective, a new report from the state Department of Health said.
Adult cigarette smoking rates fell to 16% in 2023 from 28% in the 1990s, according to the Alaska Tobacco Prevention and Control Program’s annual report, released Wednesday. Among Alaska Native adults, who have long had higher rates of smoking use than the state average, the declines were notable: down to 29% in 2022 from 41% in 2013.
However, about one in four Alaska adults used tobacco or nicotine products in 2023, the report said. That rate has remained constant over several years.
Among Alaska youths, both cigarette smoking and the use of electronic cigarettes have declined, indicating that public health campaigns have been effective, the report said.
Youth smoking rates declined from 37% in the mid-1990s to 7% in 2023, the report said. A sharp decline coincided with the state’s decision in the 1990s to dramatically increase the tax on cigarettes and other tobacco products. The increase, in 1997 legislation, gave Alaska what was at the time the nation’s highest tobacco tax, and it was geared toward discouraging youth from taking up the habit.
Youth use of electronic cigarettes, products that are newer on the market, has also declined, from 26% in 2019 to 17% in 2023, the year with the most recent data from the Alaska Youth Risk Behavior Survey.
Christy Knight, manager of the Alaska Tobacco Prevention and Control Program, said the decline in use of e-cigarettes has come amid a coordinated education campaign within schools and elsewhere.
Still, the 17% rate “is still quite high,” Knight said. “We still have a lot of work to do, but we know that what we’re doing has brought it down and we can continue to bring that down with these comprehensive partnerships and approaches.”
The declines in Alaska tobacco use come amid big declines nationally, and Alaska’s tobacco-use rates remain higher than national averages.
Among adults nationally, cigarette smoking declined from 42.4% in 1965 to 11.6% in 2022, a 60-year low, according to the CDC. About 1 in 5 U.S. adults used tobacco products of any kind in 2022, according to the CDC.
Among youths nationally, use of tobacco products nationwide hit a 25-year low last year, according to the CDC. Only 1.4% of U.S. high school and middle school students reported last year that they regularly smoke cigarettes, and 5.9% reported regular use of e-cigarettes, according to the CDC.
Within Alaska, tobacco and nicotine users have demonstrated strong interest in quitting those habits, the state report said. Last year, 1,816 people made use of services provided through the Alaska Tobacco Quit Line, a free state program, the report said.

	But education and cessation efforts face some additional challenges in rural areas of the state, Knight said.
One is the relative lack of access to health care resources, she said. Primary health providers are key to inspiring people to quit tobacco, but rural residents may be missing that inspiration, she said.
“If somebody’s in a community where they don’t have access to that provider, that can impact whether or not they’re being advised to quit at the same rate as people who are in communities that do have easy access to a health care provider,” she said.
Disparities can result from other factors, such as poverty and discrimination that make it harder for people to know about or get services, or tobacco marketing campaigns that target certain population segments, she said.
In recent years, health organizations and tribal governments in rural areas have stepped up their tobacco prevention and cessation programs, the state report said.
Knight cited the Yukon-Kuskokwim Health Corp. tobacco control program as one example. That tribal health organization provided information that helped convince the Bethel City Council to expand its city tobacco tax to include nicotine-containing products like e-cigarettes, and it regularly refers patients for tobacco-cessation services, the report noted.
Taxes continue to be used as a tool around the nation to discourage smoking or vaping, but Alaska has no state tax on e-cigarette products.
For the third time, state lawmakers are working on legislation to impose taxes on those products.
One bill to do that was passed by the Legislature in 2022 but was vetoed by Gov. Mike Dunleavy. The sponsor, Senate President Gary Stevens, R-Kodiak, introduced another version in 2023, but that bill failed to move forward after the House last year altered it and removed the e-cigarette tax provisions.
Now Stevens has introduced a new version, Senate Bill 24, that had reached the Senate Finance Committee as of late April. A House version, House Bill 49, is pending in that body’s Finance Committee.
Dunleavy has not decided yet whether to sign or veto a bill with an e-cigarette tax, said spokesperson Jeff Turner. “If and when it passes, and is transmitted to the governor’s office, he will review the bill and make a determination,” Turner said by email.
Alaska last raised its state tobacco tax in 2006. Several municipalities have their own taxes on tobacco and e-cigarette products.
While smoking and youth vaping have declined, Alaskans’ use of smokeless tobacco products has remained steady over several years, according to department statistics. From 2011 to 2023, that rate remained around 6%, according to the Alaska Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.
Among Alaska smokeless tobacco users, nearly 16% used iqmik, a potent mixture of tobacco and fungus and plant ash that is traditionally used in parts of Western Alaska, according to state statistics. The use of iqmik was showed distinct patterns, according to the department’s data. Among Alaska Native adults who used smokeless tobacco products between 2021 and 2023, about a third used iqmik, Knight said. And among Southwest Alaska residents who used smokeless tobacco between 2021 and 2023, about two-thirds used iqmik, she said.

(Photo by Mathieu Lewis-Rolland/Getty Images)In the wake of recent natural disasters, state leaders across the country are finding that emergency support from the federal government is no longer a given.
Under President Donald Trump, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has denied federal assistance for tornadoes in Arkansas, flooding in West Virginia and a windstorm in Washington state. It also has refused North Carolina’s request for extended relief funding in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.
While it’s not uncommon for the feds to turn down some requests for disaster declarations, which unlock federal aid, state leaders say the Trump administration’s denials have taken them by surprise. White House officials are signaling a new approach to federal emergency response, even as Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem threaten to shut down FEMA altogether.
“The Federal Government focuses its support on truly catastrophic disasters—massive hurricanes, devastating earthquakes, or wide-scale attacks on the homeland,” Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the National Security Council, which advises the president on issues of national security, said in a statement to Stateline.
Hughes said state and local governments “often remain an impediment to their own community’s resilience.” He called on states to take on a more extensive role.
“States must have adequate emergency management staff, adoption and enforcement of modern building codes, responsible planning and strategic investment to reduce future risk, commonsense policies that prioritize preparedness over politics, disaster reserve funds to handle what should be routine emergencies, pre-negotiated mutual aid and contingency contracts that speed up recovery, and above all, an appetite to own the problem,” the statement said.
Trump wants states to handle disasters without FEMA. They say they can’t.

State emergency management leaders say the federal retreat from disaster response has upended a long-established system.
“This is very unusual,” said Karina Shagren, communications director with the Washington Military Department, which oversees the state’s emergency management division. “This is the first time in recent memory that we have hit all the indicators to get FEMA’s public assistance program and we’ve been denied.”
Michael Coen, who served as chief of staff at FEMA during the Obama and Biden administrations, said the president has “broad discretion” to approve or deny disaster requests, regardless of whether they meet specified conditions. If Trump intends to curtail federal support, Coen said, he should give states clear guidelines.
“They should have a dialogue with the states, so the states aren’t spinning their wheels making requests that are going to get denied,” Coen said.
He added that states need guidance if they’re expected to build emergency management programs to take on what the feds once handled. Not all states, Coen said, have the capacity to replicate those functions. And disasters are expected to increase in frequency and severity because of climate change.
“Having that capability in every single state instead of having one FEMA is not the best use of tax dollars to prepare for the worst day,” he said.
Historically, FEMA has coordinated the federal response during emergency situations. In the National Security Council statement, Hughes said Trump has promptly authorized “life-saving emergency support to states during and in the immediate aftermath of disasters.”
But the agency’s larger role has focused on recovery after disasters, assessing damage and distributing funding to help communities rebuild. Now, some communities are finding that support is no longer a sure thing.










They should have a dialogue with the states, so the states aren't spinning their wheels making requests that are going to get denied. 


– Michael Coen, former chief of staff at the Federal Emergency Management Agency


Issaquah, Washington, was among the cities hit hard by the “bomb cyclone” that ripped through the state last November. Severe winds killed two people in the state, knocked out power for hundreds of thousands of residents and caused millions in damage, state officials said.
A city of about 40,000 residents in the Cascade foothills, Issaquah’s costs from the storm totaled $3.8 million — covering road repairs, removal of 800 tons of tree debris and overtime pay for first responders. Mayor Mary Lou Pauly said the city has seen four events since 2020 that qualified for federal disaster aid, with no previous denials. If Washington is unable to win its appeal with FEMA, she said, Issaquah will take a financial hit to its reserves, leaving it more vulnerable to future storms.
“We put a lot of investment in being resilient,” Pauly said. “When you get to a number like $3.8 million, that is too big of a number for us to be able to rebuild without assistance. Our residents pay federal taxes, and this is what they think they pay them for, this is what they expect their national government to do. They do not want me to set property taxes 100% higher.”
Pauly echoed Coen’s view that FEMA should give states a clear outline of the role it will play.
“What we all want to know is what are the rules of the game?” she said. “If the criteria has changed, then why aren’t we getting told about it?”
Washington state leaders said they were shocked when FEMA denied their request for $34 million to help repair roads, utilities and power systems. Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson said the state’s application met all of the “very clear criteria to qualify.” He has vowed to appeal the decision.
“We were really relying on that funding,” said Shagren, of the Washington Military Department. “If the appeal is denied, our local jurisdictions will have to prioritize which projects they can move forward with and which they don’t. They’re going to be impacted greatly. This wasn’t some small storm.”
Legislature poised to pass emergency bill to better prepare Maine for extreme weather

Other states also have been surprised by FEMA denials. Arkansas suffered 14 tornadoes last month, triggering a request for a disaster declaration from Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders. But the feds told state leaders to handle it on their own.
“[I]t has been determined that the damage from this event was not of such severity and magnitude as to be beyond the capabilities of the state, affected local governments, and voluntary agencies,” the federal government’s denial read, according to Arkansas Times.
Sanders has appealed that decision, saying the disaster caused “widespread destruction” that requires federal help.
In West Virginia, state leaders asked for disaster aid to cover 14 counties that were struck by flooding in February. But FEMA denied individual assistance to seven of those counties. Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey said in a statement that he is looking at options to appeal, but praised the Trump administration for its “strong support” following the floods.
Democratic leaders in the state have called on Morrisey to demand more help from the feds, WOWK reported.
Meanwhile, FEMA has said it will no longer match 100% of North Carolina’s spending to recover from September’s Hurricane Helene. Democratic Gov. Josh Stein said the cost share was crucial to the state’s efforts to rebuild.
“The need in western North Carolina remains immense — people need debris removed, homes rebuilt, and roads restored,” Stein said in a statement this month, according to NC Newsline. “I am extremely disappointed and urge the President to reconsider FEMA’s bad decision, even for 90 days.”

Two announcements last week were good news for South Carolina’s electric customers and instructive news for our legislators trying to pass an energy bill in the last few days of the session.
The focus of these announcements was on data centers and who pays for the new power plants and transmission lines they will need.
These data centers are large, windowless buildings packed with computers and related components to store massive amounts of data and do high-speed data analysis necessary for AI, artificial intelligence.
They consume huge amounts of electricity that earn them the name “energy hogs.”
Big tech needs these data centers to sell AI services to drive their profits.  Unlike other large industries they create few jobs.
According to our utility executives, data centers account for about 65% of the new energy generation needs of the state.
Private utilities, like Duke Energy and Dominion Energy, are more than willing to build new power plants to serve data centers since building things is the way these utilities really make their money, i.e. profits approved by the South Carolina Public Service Commission.
Typically, all utility customers pay for new power plants.
However, the growth of data centers across the country and the new power plants they will require have alarmed state officials nationally.
Other states are looking to protect residential and small business customers from paying higher electric bills driven by the energy needs of big tech data centers.
Last year, a Senate Special Committee on South Carolina’s Energy Future took testimony covering a wide range of issues including data centers.
The consensus of that committee was that consumers needed to be protected from the costs of building new power plants and other facilities mostly to serve new data centers.
As a result, the Senate amended an energy bill (H.3309) previously passed by the House to require data centers to pay their own way for their energy.  There would be no cost shifting to other consumers.
New data centers would pay for the new power plants and transmission they need with higher rates, a minimum billing requirement and a 15-year contract with the utility to guarantee that the data center would pay for the energy generation they said they needed even if they moved or reduced their energy use.
Other consumers would be protected.
The Senate also removed tax incentives for new data centers.  No longer would these data centers be exempt from paying sales tax on their computers and the electricity those computers use.
The Senate concluded that state taxpayer dollars should not be used as an incentive for data centers that produce few local jobs and little other economic benefit to the entire state.
That energy bill is now back in the hands of the House where some members are concerned that data centers would no longer be interested in investing in South Carolina and local governments could lose property tax opportunities.
So, now for last week’s surprising news.
A $2.8 billion computing center was announced in Spartanburg County, reportedly the second largest investment ever in South Carolina.
What makes this supercomputing operation important is that it will generate its own electricity from natural gas. This shows that requiring data centers to cover all costs associated with their energy needs is not a deal breaker.
They will still be very profitable.
The second announcement was that the Board of Santee Cooper, the state-owned utility, voted unanimously not to wait on the state Legislature.
The board voted to immediately adopt special rates, as proposed by the Senate, that would result in data centers not shifting any of their energy costs to other consumers. The board also included new large manufacturers in this policy.
With last week’s energy-related announcements as instructive, the House should accept the Senate’s and Santee Cooper’s lead on protecting other ratepayers from rate hikes due to the costs of providing electricity and transmission to new data centers.
Regarding state tax exemptions to lure data centers, the Senate position should be kept.
Taxpayer money should not be used to attract a data center that generates few employees in a local community but provides very little economic benefit to the rest of the state. Local governments can offer any sweetheart property tax deal they want, as was done for the Spartanburg County data center.
Data centers are coming to South Carolina and every state.  Do we need them here?
No.
But they are welcome as long as the rest of us don’t have to subsidize their profits with higher electric rates and state-tax incentives.

(Photo courtesy of Robin Tallon Jr.)More than three decades after leaving elected office, a former South Carolina congressman transferred $1.25 million from his campaign reserves into a Morgan Stanley account for charitable giving.
Robin Tallon Jr., who represented the 6th Congressional District for 10 years before not seeking re-election in 1992, moved the money last October as a “donation of securities,” according to the description on his last federal campaign filing. That’s not for personal investments, he told the SC Daily Gazette, but to a donor-advised fund to be distributed to charities.
The transfer was intended as the first step in officially shutting down the account, as the 78-year-old Florence resident thought he’d closed the door on attempting a return to politics. But as of Friday, he was rethinking that decision.
Despite not being in office since Bill Clinton’s 1993 inauguration, Tallon said he’s kept his campaign account open — and filed regularly with the Federal Election Commission — ever since, just in case he decided to make another run. In the meantime, he invested donations from decades ago, which is how he had that much money to transfer, he said.

  Former U.S. Rep. Robin Tallon speaks at a press conference on Wednesday, April 29, 1992. (Screenshot courtesy of C-Span.)

“I’ve been encouraged to run by constituents and other people to run over the years,” he told the SC Daily Gazette last week.
And he may yet try to return to Washington — this time as a senator.
He’s considering a 2026 bid to challenge U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham as an independent.
Tallon, a native of Dillon, represented the 6th District as a Democrat when it spanned the Grand Strand and entire Pee Dee region. After a federal court drastically redrew the district’s lines following the 1990 census to create a House seat with a majority Black population, Tallon decided not to seek re-election. Democrat Jim Clyburn has held the seat since.
While he left Congress, Tallon didn’t altogether leave Washington. He worked as a lobbyist on Capitol Hill for a quarter century. His clients included Atria, one of the largest producers of tobacco, and dentists.
Tallon no longer considers himself a Democrat. The party’s moved too far left, he told the Gazette.
But unlike many other former Democrats in South Carolina who switched parties, Tallon doesn’t consider himself a Republican either. He thinks South Carolina has become a “lap dog” for President Donald Trump, who he considers bad for the country. 
So, he’s considering running as an independent, knowing he can’t win that way. But he could “perhaps hold some of our elected officials’ feet to the fire,” he said Friday. 
“It’s almost why not,” he said of a potential bid using the remaining $96,500 left in his campaign account. He would not undo the transfer to Morgan Stanley, he said.
The transfer was part of his 2024 end-of-year report filed April 12, more than two months late. Tallon blamed that on his accountant, saying he didn’t even realize it was past due.
Outside of Tallon, there’s only one former South Carolina congressman with an open campaign account: Gov. Mark Sanford.
As of his last FEC filing, the former two-term governor and two-time 1st District representative had more than $1.3 million cash on hand in his congressional campaign account. He told the Gazette he’s keeping it open because he may seek office again.
Sanford last campaigned in 2019, in a short-lived challenge to Trump. He was ousted from his congressional seat in the 2018 GOP primary, which led to Democrat Joe Cunningham briefly turning the coastal district blue.
If Sanford does return to politics, it wouldn’t be his first comeback. He was widely expected to be done with politics when he left the Governor’s Mansion in January 2011 following a scandalous affair with a woman in Argentina. But two years later, voters sent him back to Congress in a special election to replace Tim Scott, after then-Gov. Nikki Haley appointed him to the U.S. Senate.

Sanford, who has long railed about out-of-control federal spending, had no details of his potential future bid.
“Time will tell,” he told the Gazette about his plans.
FEC requirements
Tallon initially told the Gazette his account would likely be emptied within six weeks. But, with a potential future bid, it will stay open indefinitely.
While certainly unusual, there’s nothing illegal about keeping an account open as long as Tallon, according to the FEC.
The federal agency recommends emptying and closing campaign accounts within six months of leaving office, according to a 2013 advisory opinion. However, there’s no required timeline, a spokesperson for the commission said in an email to the Gazette.
And if a former officeholder is considering a run, as Tallon claims he has been for the last three decades, there’s no requirement to zero out the account at all.
It’s illegal for officeholders to use campaign donations for personal expenses, even after they leave office.
Departing officeholders’ options include reimbursing their donors, donating to charities or giving money to other campaigns and PACs, as South Carolina’s other former congressmen have done.
Former 3rd District Rep. Jeff Duncan, who decided not to seek an eighth term last year, terminated his account in April. He gave the Jobs, Energy and Our Founding Fathers PAC that he sponsored more than $640,000 in the process.
Former 4th District Rep. Trey Gowdy left Congress in 2017 but didn’t close out his account until 2021. He listed a $905,000 donation to the Miriam Foundation, a faith-based organization that provides mentorship and support for young women, in his final FEC filing.
And former Rep. Henry Brown, who represented the coastal 1st District after Sanford left Congress the first time, drained his account slowly, officially closing it nine years after not seeking re-election in 2010. In that time, he made a number of donations to candidates ranging from mayoral races to President Donald Trump.
The donor-advised Morgan Stanley account that Tallon transferred his campaign money to allows him to decide which charities will get the money and when. Determining which organizations to donate has been difficult, he said.
Tallon, who previously served on the Medical University of South Carolina board, said some of the money will go to the hospital, although he doesn’t yet know how much.
Contemplating campaigns
It isn’t unusual for former officeholders to keep accounts open for years after leaving office, said Jordan Libowitz, an expert on campaign finance for the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.
Decades, however, is another matter. He’s never seen someone keep an account open as long as Tallon, he said.
“That money probably should have been disposed of years ago,” he said.
A 2018 investigation by the Tampa Bay Times and Tampa-based 10News WTSP, as well as numerous other TV stations, found 100 examples of so-called zombie campaigns. But Tallon stood out as showing “just how much former lawmakers can get away with,” the reporters wrote seven years ago.
Spending from his campaign account included a $20,000 payment to his son as campaign treasurer, $4,000 for a computer in 2007, and a $900 iPad in 2017, according to the report.
At the time, he defended keeping the account open while weighing a potential return to office but conceded it was unlikely.
“I need to give that money away at this point,” he said in January 2018.
But then he changed his mind. In July 2019, Tallon’s lawyer, Butch Bowers, told the FEC that he would not close the account.
“At this time, he has not decided to do so, but he may very well elect to run for office in the near future,” Bowers wrote.
Between the 2018 report and the Morgan Stanley transfer last fall, most of Tallon’s campaign spending went to charities, accounting fees and nearly $8,700 in legal expenses, which he said was used for finding out what his options were for closing the account.
Tallon said he’d contemplated running in multiple elections over the years, both in the House and Senate. He seriously considered challenging U.S. Rep. Tom Rice for the 7th District in 2022 but then decided against it. (Rice was ousted that year by former state Rep. Russell Fry.)
Earlier last week, he told the Gazette he’d decided he was officially done with politics. He planned to close out the account. But on Friday, he was contemplating a run to call out the problems with both major parties.
“This would be a very low budget campaign, but a chance to hold our leaders in Washington accountable,” he said.

Donavan McKinney says his residents have been severely impacted by power outages and poor energy reliability at an Aug. 10, 2023 event centered on climate and energy policy. | Kyle DavidsonState Rep. Donavan McKinney (D-Detroit) announced Monday that he would mount a challenge to U.S. Rep. Shri Thanedar (D-Detroit) in the Democratic primary for Michigan’s 13th Congressional District.
McKinney, who noted that the 11th state House District he currently represents is one of the poorest in Michigan while the 13th Congressional District is among the poorest in the nation, said that he would bring working class representation to residents.
“I was born next to smokestacks. We moved 13 times as a kid. Sometimes it was an apartment, sometimes it was a family member’s house. Sometimes it was even our own car. But wherever it was, my mom and grandma made sure it felt like home. I spent my life trying to get back to help the place and people I love. I’ve never forgotten my roots, or the true purpose of why I serve; to always put the people first,” McKinney said in his campaign launch video, adding that Thanedar has “more in common with Donald Trump and Elon Musk than people like us.”

Thanedar, who spent $10 million of his own funds seeking the governor’s seat in 2018, served one term in the Michigan Legislature from 2021 through the end of 2022. He was elected to Congress for the first time that year, winning reelection in 2024.
“I bring the lived realities of the people of this district, lived realities that multimillionaires have no understanding of,” McKinney told the Michigan Advance ahead of his campaign’s launch. “I know our community’s struggles because I’ve lived them — and that’s why I understand just how urgent delivering monumental solutions to their monumental problems are.”
He said he would focus on economic security, environmental justice, education, public transportation, workers’ rights and more.
McKinney isn’t the first state lawmaker to launch a primary challenge against Thanedar. He joins a race that also features former state Sen. Adam Hollier (D-Detroit).
“I think the fact that there are multiple candidates in this race already just makes it crystal clear how fed up our community is with Shri, and how excited they are for representation that truly fights for us in Washington as hard as I have been fighting for us in Lansing,” McKinney said. “I’m running because our community has been calling me over and over to stand up and fight for them in DC, and they want a fresh, new voice leading the biggest, baddest coalition to deliver for this community and that’s exactly what we’re going to do.”
Thanedar has defended his constituent service record while in Congress, previously telling the Advance that since his election, his office has solved over 2,800 constituent cases, recovered nearly $3 million for constituents, received approval for $30 million in community projects, and sponsored and cosponsored 810 different bills. 
“We have world class constituent communication, including a record 11 in-person town halls,” Thanedar said.  SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Since the retirement of former U.S. Rep. Brenda Lawrence (D-Southfield) in 2022, neither of the two congressional districts that encompass Detroit have had a Black representative, an issue considered to be critical by leaders in the predominantly Black city. Both McKinney and Hollier are Black.
Detroit elected its first Black U.S. representative, Charles Diggs Jr., in 1954, and consistently elected a Black representative up until 2022, when voters elected Thanedar, who immigrated from India, alongside Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Detroit), who is Palestinian American, to Michigan’s 12th Congressional District. 
When asked what resources he plans to bring to a race against Thanedar, who he called “Detroit’s own Elon Musk,” McKinney told the Advance he was supported by an “incredible coalition of elected officials, faith leaders, labor, community members, and more” and he was excited to grow that coalition between now and 2026.
“I’m not running because I’m a millionaire. I’m running because I’m not. I’m running because our community deserves to be able to sleep at night knowing they have a Representative in Congress who truly knows their struggles and truly fights for them every single day,” McKinney said.
McKinney’s campaign claimed the endorsement of a dozen Democratic state legislators on day one, including state Sens. Darrin Camilleri, Stephanie Chang, Veronica Klinefelt and Paul Wojno, and state Reps. Stephanie Young, Erin Byrnes, Kimberly Edwards, Alabas Farhat, Peter Herzberg, Tullio Liberati, Tonya Myers-Phillips and Veronica Paiz.
McKinney plans to hold an official campaign launch event Monday evening at SAY Detroit Play at the Lipke Community Center in Detroit.

In the aftermath of the deadly January Los Angeles County wildfires, Gov. Gavin Newsom traveled to L.A. and Washington, D.C. to lobby President Donald Trump and members of Congress for federal aid. 
But three months later, Congress has yet to move on Newsom’s $40 billion request, reports CalMatters’ Alexei Koseff. Meanwhile, frustrations from Democratic voters over Trump’s other policies put mounting pressure on the governor to push back — even though Newsom must still work with Trump to secure disaster relief.
Newsom met the president during a particularly tense time in their relationship: Trump had repeatedly threatened to withhold federal disaster aid; and the state Legislature wrapped up a special session, called by Newsom, to earmark funds for potential legal clashes against Trump’s administration.
After their meetings, Trump said an “L.A. fire fix” was coming, and Newsom — compared to his self-positioning last fall as an outspoken leader to the Trump resistance — didn’t hold any press events for most of late February. (Instead, he grabbed headlines while speaking with conservative firebrands on his new podcast.)
But in the months that followed, the Trump administration has attempted to enact tariffs that threaten California’s economy; proposed deep cuts to federal agencies and programs; and defied court orders regarding mass deportations — prompting Newsom to either file lawsuits or publicly speak out against the federal policies.
The governor has had a “tone shift,” said Bob Salladay, Newsom’s senior communications adviser, because “there has been a policy shift from D.C. that is beyond alarming.”
And what about that aid money? The Newsom administration is optimistic Congress will approve additional disaster aid by this summer. A bipartisan group, made up of all of California’s congressional delegation, is advocating for the relief package.
As for Newsom, he told reporters last week that he is continuing to work behind the scenes to maintain his relationship with Trump, but would still defend the state’s core principles.

Newsom: “If you want to make a point, you may want to reconsider. If you want to make a difference, stand tall and firm. And that’s kind of the approach.”

Covered California shared personal data

More than 2 million Californians are enrolled in Covered California, the state’s health insurance marketplace under the Affordable Care Act. Last year, some of these enrollees had their personal data shared with LinkedIn.
Recent forensic testing by CalMatters’ Tomas Apodaca and Colin Lecher revealed that Covered California’s website has been sending sensitive data to the for-profit job recruiting social networking site — and that visitors could have had their data tracked for more than a year.
As visitors filled out forms on Covered California’s website, trackers sent information to Linkedin. The information included whether visitors were blind, pregnant or used a high number of prescription medications. The trackers also monitored whether visitors said they were transgender or possible victims of domestic abuse.
In a statement, a spokesperson for Covered California confirmed that data was sent to LinkedIn as part of an advertising campaign that began in February 2024. Since CalMatters and The Markup’s reporting about the issue, however, most ad trackers have been removed from the site.

Should CA freight trains be shorter?

Today the Senate Transportation Committee is considering a bill that would shorten the length of freight trains in California. Proponents say the bill would make railways safer, but critics argue the measure could raise the price of goods in a state already struggling with a high cost-of-living.
As CalMatters’ Ryan Sabalow explains, the bill by Democratic Sen. Bob Archuleta of Norwalk would cap the maximum length of a freight train to 7,500 feet, or about 125 60-foot-long rail cars. The railway industry employs several thousand workers, including ones represented by the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen. The union argues that shorter trains are less likely to derail. The bill passed its first committee hearing last week after Democrats in the Senate’s committee on energy, utilities and communications voted to advance the measure.
The train industry and at least two dozen other business groups oppose the bill. They argue that shortening trains could make transporting goods more expensive since longer trains require fewer engines and crew members to pull. The proposal also may not be legal: The federal government wields broad authority over interstate commerce, enabling it to have final say on regulating railroads.

,California,2025-04-28 12:31:00+00:00,CalMatters,How the state sent Californians’ personal health data to LinkedIn,Tomas Apodaca and Colin Lecher,,,,,https://calmatters.org/health/2025/04/covered-california-linkedin-tracker/,The state’s health insurance exchange transmitted pregnancy and domestic abuse data during a marketing campaign. It is reviewing its website practices.,"In summary
The state’s health insurance exchange transmitted pregnancy and domestic abuse data during a marketing campaign. It is reviewing its website practices.


The website that lets Californians shop for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, coveredca.com, has been sending sensitive data to LinkedIn, forensic testing by CalMatters has revealed. 
As visitors filled out forms on the website, trackers on the same pages told LinkedIn their answers to questions about whether they were blind, pregnant, or used a high number of prescription medications. The trackers also monitored whether the visitors said they were transgender or possible victims of domestic abuse. (See the data on our Github repo.)
Covered California, the organization that operates the website, removed the trackers as  CalMatters and The Markup reported this article. The organization said they were removed “due to a marketing agency transition” in early April. 
In a statement, Kelly Donohue, a spokesperson for the agency, confirmed that data was sent to LinkedIn as part of an advertising campaign. Since  being informed of the tracking, “all active advertising-related tags across our website have been turned off out of an abundance of caution, she added.” 
“Covered California has initiated a review of our websites and information security and privacy protocols to ensure that no analytics tools are impermissibly sharing sensitive consumer information,” Donohue said, adding that they would “share additional findings as they become available, taking any necessary steps to safeguard the security and privacy of consumer data.”
When an individual indicated they were pregnant, the information was sent to LinkedIn via the Insight Tag.
Visitors who filled out health information on the site may have had their data tracked for more than a year, according to Donohue, who said the LinkedIn campaign began in February 2024. 
CalMatters observed the trackers directly in February and March of this year. It confirmed most ad trackers, including the Meta “pixel” tracker, as well as all third-party cookies, have been removed from the site as of April 21. 
Since 2014, more than 50 million Americans have signed up for health insurance through state exchanges like Covered California. They were set up under the Affordable Care Act, signed into law by President Barack Obama 15 years ago. States can either operate their exchange websites in partnership with the federal government or independently, as California does. 
Covered California operates as an independent entity within the state government. Its board is appointed by the governor and Legislature. 
In March, Covered California announced that, after four years of increasing enrollment, a record of nearly 2 million people were covered by health insurance through the program. In all, the organization said, about one in six Californians were at one point enrolled through Covered California. Between 2014 and 2023, the uninsured rate fell from 17.2% to 6.4%, according to the organization, the largest drop of any state during that time period. This coincided with a series of eligibility expansions to Medi-Cal, the state’s health insurance program for lower-income households.
Experts expressed alarm at the idea that those millions of people could have had sensitive health data sent to a private company without their knowledge or consent. Sara Geoghegan, senior counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, said it was “concerning and invasive” for a health insurance website to be sending data that was “wholly irrelevant” to the uses of a for-profit company like LinkedIn.
“It’s unfortunate,” she said, “because people don’t expect that their health information will be collected and used in this way.”
The LinkedIn Insight Tag
CalMatters and The Markup in recent months scanned for trackers on hundreds of California state and county government websites that offer services for undocumented immigrants using Blacklight, an automated tool developed by The Markup for auditing website trackers. 
“People don’t expect that their health information will be collected and used in this way.”Sara Geoghegan, senior counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information Center
CalMatters found that Covered California had more than 60 trackers on its site. Out of more than 200 of the government sites, the average number of trackers on the sites was three. Covered California had dozens more than any other website we examined. 
On coveredca.com, trackers from well-known social media firms like Meta collected information on visitor page views, while lesser-known analytics and media campaign companies like email marketing company LiveIntent also followed users across the site. 
But by far the most sensitive information was transmitted to LinkedIn. 
While some of the data sent to LinkedIn was relatively innocuous, such as what pages were visited, Covered California also sent the company detailed information when visitors selected doctors to see if they were covered by a plan, including their specialization. The site also told LinkedIn if someone searched for a specific hospital.
When an individual selected a medical provider, the information was sent to LinkedIn via the Insight Tag.
In addition to demographic information including gender, the site also shared details with LinkedIn when visitors selected their ethnicity and marital status, and when they told coveredca.com how often they saw doctors for surgery or outpatient treatment. 
When an individual selected their ethnicity, the information was sent to LinkedIn via the Insight Tag.
LinkedIn, like other large social media firms, offers a way for websites to easily transmit data on their visitors through a tracking tool that the sites can place on their pages. In LinkedIn’s case, this tool is called the Insight Tag. By using the tag, businesses and other organizations can later target advertisements on LinkedIn to consumers that have already shown interest in their products or services. For an e-commerce site, a tracker on a page might be able to note when someone added a product to their cart, and the business can then send ads for that product to the same person on their social media feeds. 
A health care marketplace like Covered California might use the trackers to reach a group of people who might be interested in a reminder of a deadline for open health insurance enrollment, for example.
In its statement, Covered California noted the usefulness of these tools, saying the organization “leverages LinkedIn’s advertising platform tools to understand consumer behavior and deliver tailored messages to help them make informed decisions about their health care options.”
When an individual indicated they were a victim of domestic abuse or spousal abandonment, the information was sent to LinkedIn via the Insight Tag.
Trackers can also be valuable to the social media companies that offer them. In addition to driving ad sales, they provide an opportunity to gather information on visitors to websites other than their own.
On its informational page about the Insight Tag, LinkedIn places the burden on websites that employ the tag not to use it in risky situations. The tag “should not be installed on web pages that collect or contain Sensitive Data,” the page advises, including “pages offering specific health-related or financial services or products to consumers.”
LinkedIn spokesperson Brionna Ruff said in an emailed statement, “Our Ads Agreement and documentation expressly prohibit customers from installing the Insight Tag on web pages that collect or contain sensitive data, including pages offering health-related services.. We don’t allow advertisers to target ads based on sensitive data or categories.”
Legal recourse
Collection of sensitive information by social media trackers has in previous instances led to removal of the trackers, lawsuits, and scrutiny by state and federal lawmakers.
For example, after The Markup in 2022 revealed the Department of Education sent personal information to Facebook when students applied for college financial aid online, the department turned off the sharing, faced questions from two members of Congress, and was sued by two advocacy groups who sought more information about the sharing. Other stories in the same series about trackers, known as the Pixel Hunt, also led to changes and blowback, including a crackdown by the Federal Trade Commission on telehealth companies transmitting personal information to companies including Meta and Google without user consent and proposed class action lawsuits over information shared through trackers with drug stores, health providers, and tax prep companies.
LinkedIn is already facing multiple proposed class-action lawsuits related to the collection of medical information. In October, three new lawsuits in California courts alleged that LinkedIn violated users’ privacy by collecting information on medical appointment sites, including for a fertility clinic. 
Social media companies’ tracking practices have underpinned the tremendous growth of the tech industry, but few web users are aware of how far the tracking goes. “This absolutely contradicts the expectation of the average consumer,” Geoghegan said. 
In California, a law called the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act governs the privacy of medical information in the state. Under the act, consumers must give permission to some organizations before their medical information is disclosed to third parties. Companies have faced litigation under the law for using web tracking technologies, although those suits have not always been successful. 
Geoghegan said current protections like these don’t go far enough in helping consumers protect their sensitive data. 
“This is an exact example of why we need better protections,” she said of LinkedIn receiving the data. “This is sensitive health information that consumers expect to be protected and a lack of regulations is failing us.”

Police agencies — under scrutiny and worried about their own liability — increasingly won’t respond to someone in a mental health crisis unless that person is committing a crime. So who will transport people in psychosis to get help? And who will keep those around them safe? 


Susanna’s Sacramento County home bears the scars of her daughter’s mental illness. There is the lump on the wall near the entryway, patched after the girl, now 17, busted through the drywall. On a recent day, a double door in a bulky box awaited installation — to replace the splintered entry to the bedroom Susanna shares with her husband. 
The rages began when the girl was in fourth grade, said Susanna, whose last name CalMatters is withholding to protect her daughter’s identity. In recent years, the family has resorted to calling 911. Susanna said she has sustained a black eye and other minor injuries while fine-tuning her daughter’s medications, which include an antipsychotic. Mostly, she said, they’ve called in desperation for help when they had nowhere else to turn.  
“They have been able to assist, whether it be taking her to the hospital for a 5150 hold, or just de-escalating the situation,” said Susanna, using the Welfare and Institutions Code shorthand “5150” for an involuntary psychiatric evaluation, due to danger to self or others, or grave disability. 
Starting early last year, though, Susanna noticed that law enforcement “seemed more disinterested in those calls.” Then, as another crisis unfolded Feb. 7, the Sheriff’s Department made it clear they would not be coming out at all. 
The 911 audio and a summary log lay out the scene: Susanna’s husband was trying to sleep when the daughter, who was on probation, barged into the bedroom just before midnight, spit in his face, and “threatened to stab me and kill me.” A dispatcher asked if the daughter had “mental health issues;” the husband said she did.
What the couple didn’t realize: Due to a recent policy change, that detail kicked the call up to a supervisor — and ultimately left Susanna and her family to fend for themselves. 
Susanna said she saw her daughter heading back to the bedroom with a kitchen knife. She locked the door and was leaning against it to keep it from giving way under her daughter’s blows as her husband spoke to the dispatcher. The four-minute conversation ended when the dispatcher promised to “have someone out there.” 
Instead, a supervisor called the husband back. A call log states that they discussed the girl’s “extensive” mental health issues and history of assault as the screaming and pounding continued. The supervisor then suggested the couple stay in the locked bedroom. 
“No crime,” the call log concludes. Sacramento Sheriff’s Office “not responding.” 
Why a sheriff pulls deputies back on mental health calls
In early January, Sacramento County Sheriff Jim Cooper met with county behavioral health and emergency medical response partners and dropped a bomb. His department would no longer respond to mental health crisis calls unless a crime had occurred, was in progress, or someone other than the person in crisis was deemed to be in imminent danger.
While he’d been pondering the pullback for a year, he told them, what pushed him to act was a 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that he believes heightens his officers’ liability on non-criminal mental health calls.
“Law enforcement officers are not trained mental health professionals,” Cooper announced in a news conference a month later. “We wear the badge; we carry the gun. We deal with crime – not mental health crises.” When his department responds to calls that do involve crimes, he added, they will be treated as a “major event” — suggesting they might result in arrest rather than transport for care under the 5150 code. Cooper has called the change a “hard reset”  — one he knew would be controversial.

Yet these issues have challenged policymakers for more than half a century: Because mental illness isn’t a crime, when should law enforcement be involved, if at all? Who is best suited to safely de-escalate a mental health crisis and coax a person to accept care? And what if that person won’t — or due to the nature of their psychosis or substance use cannot — agree to go voluntarily? Who will transport them for involuntary psychiatric holds? 
Families of seriously ill loved ones say they’ve clamored for answers to that latter question for some time now. One desperate mother whose son recently needed to be taken to the hospital for urgent evaluation resorted to hiring a bounty hunter.
California under Gov. Gavin Newsom has taken bold steps  to broaden access to  care for people with untreated psychotic illnesses and substance use disorders— including expanding the legal definition of “grave disability” under the 5150 code. That law is expected to compel more people to receive treatment. Its success depends in part on transporting those in crisis for evaluations — even if they won’t go voluntarily. 
Just a week after Sacramento County implemented the new law, Sheriff Cooper informed his partners of his policy shift. Now, as he publicizes his position at a law enforcement conference and webinar and through his own podcast, some other agencies are following his lead. 
 Cooper cites his eight years in the state Assembly as instructive. There, he said in an interview, “We always heard, hey, we don’t want law enforcement responding to mental health calls. I come back as sheriff, and I’ve seen a lot of bad outcomes, in California and across the nation…Sometimes, introducing a badge and gun can really make it go sideways.”
Cooper was sworn in two months after a fatal deputy-involved shooting of a man in psychosis whose wife called for help as he threatened to hurt himself with a machete. He died 23 seconds after the lone deputy arrived. Last March, another such shooting took the life of a mentally ill man whose sister called 911 as he cut himself in the bathtub with a knife. Litigation is pending in both cases.

Susanna had seen Cooper’s announcement on TV. Three nights later, as she braced herself against the bedroom door, it didn’t cross her mind. Instead, she was shaken by the lack of response by law enforcement to what felt like a volatile and potentially dangerous situation.
“At that moment, you’re just thinking, ‘We need to get help here now, before this escalates further,’” she said. “Who is going to assist my family in these situations, and not only my family, but other families like mine, whose child might be more aggressive or might actually kill them or hurt them very badly? Who is going to step in and stop that before it’s too late?”
When medical workers want police to handle it
Like many jurisdictions, Sacramento County has been pushing to reduce the role of law enforcement in behavioral health crises and avoid traumatic hospitalizations — or arrests — when possible, instead helping people develop safety plans and plugging them into outpatient care. 
Still, county Behavioral Health Services Director Ryan Quist said law enforcement will always be critical to the “system level response.” His civilian crisis teams, made up of a clinician and a peer, cannot engage without backup in situations where people in crisis have weapons or are  particularly volatile — even if they are only threatening to harm themselves. And, he said, when clinicians determine an evaluation for a psychiatric hold under the 5150 code is necessary, they cannot detain or transport those too agitated or ill to consent to go. 
“Behavioral health doesn’t have that training skill set, or desire, to actually put hands on somebody and make them go somewhere,” said Quist. Beyond that, because they are not peace officers, “legally speaking, that’s assault.”
County leaders are scrambling to assess the damage. In emotional public testimony in February before the county’s Sheriff Community Review Commission — an advisory body that has no control over the elected official’s policies — Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District officials said Cooper’s department had denied 14 of their 21 requests from the field for backup over the previous 11 days.
“Put yourself in the shoes of the folks living next door. They were sound asleep at three in the morning….Their kids, their families could potentially have been in harm’s way.” Sacramento Fire Battalion Chief Parker Wilbourn
Each “presents a safety factor for the community that’s going to at some point either get somebody really hurt or killed,” Battalion Chief Parker Wilbourn told the commission, noting that close collaboration on such calls is the gold standard. “That’s why we heavily rely on our law enforcement brothers and sisters to have our backs like we have theirs.”
Dispatch records and incident reports shared in response to a CalMatters public records request show that, of those 14 cases, Metro Fire responders were able to get three people experiencing psychosis to agree to be taken to the hospital. In seven other cases, they were either unable to evaluate people in crisis due to safety concerns or unable to transport those who were uncooperative. 
Two calls involved a man wearing an ankle monitor and threatening his landlord’s son over an attempted eviction. Firefighters first came to the scene to evaluate the landlord for high blood pressure — and called for backup because the tenant’s threats, “confused speech, unsteady gait and erratic behavior” concerned them. “Situation becoming unstable,” the log notes. Yet a sheriff’s sergeant who waited nearby made it clear: “Won’t resp unless a crime occurs.”  
With no help on the way, the log continues, the landlord and two other residents “fled [the] scene” in fear.  Five hours later, the tenant  called 911 to say that he was bleeding from an injury, and planned to shoot himself and set the house on fire. Rancho Cordova Police, staffed by the Sheriff’s Department under a longstanding contract, declined to respond. Fire responders waited outside, checking for signs of smoke, but did not feel safe to  enter. 
“I want you to put yourself in the shoes of the folks living next door,” Wilbourn told the commission. “They were sound asleep at three in the morning when this was taking place. Their kids, their families could potentially have been in harm’s way.”
“Probably juvenile hall isn’t where she needs to be. She would be better off at a hospital, but (deputies) don’t take them anymore.”Susanna, whose daughter is facing charges of making terrorist threats
In Susanna’s case, neither her husband nor the Sheriff’s Department requested emergency medical personnel. Her daughter did calm down, eventually. Not long after the incident, she got off probation — something that would not have happened if she had been criminally charged for the spitting or threats that night. 
Sheriff Cooper has stressed that “being mentally ill should not be a crime. Someone shouldn’t have to be arrested and go to jail to get help.” But with no transport options for those who won’t or can’t consent to psychiatric evaluations that outcome can become inevitable.
Despite a follow-up with her psychiatrist, Susanna said, her daughter’s  mental health worsened, bringing deputies to the house three times earlier this month. All involved escalating disputes with a younger brother, the Sheriff’s Department confirmed. Once, a mail carrier dialed 911 as he heard yelling and furniture breaking. 
At the last call, on April 16, they took her into custody. Susanna had locked up the kitchen knives. But after assaulting her younger brother, she said, her daughter grabbed a fireplace poker and chased him with it, threatening to kill him. Her daughter is now in juvenile hall facing charges of making terrorist threats. 
“Probably juvenile hall isn’t where she needs to be,” said Susanna, who is pressing social workers to place her daughter in a treatment facility. “She would be better off at a hospital, but (deputies) don’t take them anymore. They no longer provide that service.”

An alternative to law enforcement is ideal, said Dominic Sisti, a bioethicist who directs the Scattergood Program for the Applied Ethics of Behavioral Health Care at the University of Pennsylvania. “But when you have somebody who is potentially violent towards themselves or others, I don’t see any way around having somebody there who has the training to manage that situation from a safety perspective, not just a health care perspective.” 
In the long term, he said, “these individuals are going to get sicker. They’re going to probably get more agitated. The families are going to suffer and we’re going to see worse outcomes.”
Among the most effective responses in volatile situations, experts say, are co-response teams, made up of a clinician who rides shotgun with law enforcement. In an interview, Sheriff Cooper described the two teams his department had been operating as “incredibly successful” — though they would not have been available at midnight, when Susanna’s family arguably needed them most. Now, given Cooper’s policy change, the behavioral health director has assigned those clinicians to other law enforcement agencies in Sacramento County. 
Cooper’s stance is nevertheless resonating with agencies who say they’ve been overly burdened with responsibility for the crisis of serious mental illness ever since California’s Lanterman-Petris-Short Act, which created the 5150 civil code, went into effect in 1969. All states now have similar laws.
“We’re not in the profession of white coats coming out to take somebody to the hospital,” said Orange County Sheriff Don Barnes, president of the California State Sheriffs Association. 
Barnes said he has long been committed to getting his department “out of social work.” Last year, his dispatchers began vetting non-criminal mental health calls, diverting 80 to other resources. Now, given his own heightened liability concerns, he’s taking it further. The 5150 code, he said, states that law enforcement “may” — not “shall” — initiate involuntary psychiatric holds, detain, and transport for evaluation those who appear to meet criteria. 
“We are going to be considering what is the best alternative approach,” Barnes said, “and some of that might be saying, ‘I’m sorry Mr. and Mrs. Jones, but you’re going have to deal with your son a new way.” 
The court ruling that set police on edge
The 9th Circuit ruling cited by Cooper, Scott v. Smith, resulted in the loss of “qualified immunity” for two Las Vegas police officers whose actions led to the death of an unarmed mentally ill man. The decision, which exposes the officers to personal liability, has without question troubled law enforcement. 
Roy Anthony Scott called Las Vegas police for help on the early morning of March 3, 2019, believing there were people inside his home plotting to harm him. The two responding officers persuaded him to come outside, where he obeyed commands and handed over two weapons. Bodycam footage reveals that Scott told the officers  he had schizophrenia, that he was too paranoid to turn around and face the wall. Twice, he asked, “Can you just put me in the car please?” 
When the officers grabbed Scott’s arms to restrain him on a mental health hold, court records show, he flailed and begged them to stop. Instead, they took him to the ground and placed him on his stomach. One applied bodyweight to Scott’s neck and chest “for about one to two minutes,” while the other held his legs. 
In keeping with U.S. Supreme Court precedent, the three-judge panel balanced the type and level of force used on Scott against the nature of his crime and threat he posed. Since Scott was mentally ill, not suspected of a crime, unarmed and posed no risk to officers or anyone else, “the government’s interest in applying force was limited,” they wrote, adding that any reasonable officer would have known that bodyweight compression to the neck and chest “created a serious risk of asphyxiating Scott.” 
Furthermore, they noted, the officers failed to attempt “less intrusive alternatives” such as “verbal de-escalation,” waiting for backup to execute a “safer ‘team takedown,’” or for emergency medical personnel “to execute a ‘soft restraint.’”
“Who would want to have a job where you’re doing what’s right, something happens, and you lose your house and everything you’ve ever earned?”Sacramento County Sheriff Jim Cooper
Las Vegas police have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review the case. 
Sheriff Cooper’s take is blunt: Any level of force on a non-criminal mental health call could lead an officer to ruin. “Someone doesn’t want to go, you’ve got to wrestle them on the ground, something happens, maybe they have a cardiac arrest. You lose qualified immunity,” he said. “Who would want to have a job where you’re doing what’s right, something happens, and you lose your house and everything you’ve ever earned?”
The law firm that provides legal advice to the California Police Chiefs Association and the California State Sheriffs Association disagrees. 
The court came to its conclusion by weighing all “facts and circumstances before it,” as they would in any Fourth Amendment excessive-force case, attorney James R. Touchstone of the firm Jones Mayer concluded in a Feb. 12 “client alert memorandum” addressed to “all Sheriffs and Chiefs of Police.” 
“Although many may disagree with the Court’s determination, including this author,” Touchstone wrote in the seven-page memo obtained by CalMatters, “it does not stand for the proposition that qualified immunity is unavailable to law enforcement officers” who are responding to non–criminal mental health calls and may need to be detained and transported to the hospital on an involuntary psychiatric hold.  
A commentary posted to Police1, a national online law enforcement resource, was more pointed. Given law enforcement’s longstanding role in psychiatric detention and transport, ample training opportunities, and best practices based on partnerships with clinicians and emergency medical responders, Cooper’s policy change, it states, “while well-intentioned, is simply wrong.” 
Desperate enough to hire a bounty hunter 
Patricia Wentzel, who serves on Sacramento County’s mental health board, has blasted Cooper’s stance as discriminatory, given that law enforcement responds to other non-criminal crises involving people with dementia or developmental disabilities. “I don’t think he feels a responsibility to this group of people,” she said. “That’s the impression conveyed by this decision.” 
Yet across the state, parents with severely mentally ill loved ones living at home aren’t exactly surprised. Katy Polony, a family advocate on an Alameda County mobile crisis team, said criminalization has often been the only option. 
“’Get a restraining order. Then we will forcibly go in. We’ll get that person out of there, and we’ll put them on the street,’” Polony said. “That’s what families have been told to do, forced to do.” 
Indeed, Susanna and her husband say that was the sheriff supervisor’s final suggestion to them on Feb. 7 before he hung up — that if they feared the daughter they should get a restraining order when she turns 18. 
While restraining orders are civil, violating them is a crime. 
“’Get a restraining order. Then we will forcibly go in’…That’s what families have been told to do, forced to do.” Katy Polony, a family advocate on an Alameda County mobile crisis team
Last year, Polony helped organize a group of parents from Fremont to press police to engage more on behavioral health crisis calls. After Cooper went public with his policy, she began hosting bimonthly Zoom calls to gather family input statewide. That’s where Mary Palafox first shared her story. 
For the past 14 years, Palafox has served as private conservator to her son, deemed gravely disabled by schizophrenia that took hold in his early 20s. Many parents don’t want the responsibility, or can’t afford to take it on. But Palafox has means. Her son, an artist who loves animals, thrives at the family’s Orange County home when he is stable. 
As her son’s conservator, Palafox has a standing court order to have her son evaluated at a hospital when she sees fit. When he has been too ill to consent to go voluntarily, law enforcement has helped coerce him onto an ambulance gurney. Until recently. 
Five years had passed since her son’s last hospitalization, but after stopping his medication, he retreated deep into his illness, she said. In early January, Palafox said, his doctor urged her to get him to the emergency room. Each serious bout of psychosis causes damage to the brain that can lead to neurocognitive deficits. As a nurse and longtime mental health advocate and educator, Palafox knew “it was a medical emergency.”

But, despite her legal paperwork, two law enforcement agencies declined to touch her son. Palafox first called 911 as he sat in florid psychosis in a Tustin restaurant. When he emerged, Tustin police officers “watched him walk away. They said that they cannot engage with him unless he’s committing a crime,” she said, “that they no longer help transport or ‘lay hands’ on anybody who has a mental illness.”
Palafox tried again a few days later as her son hid in a backyard shed at home, in psychosis. The Orange County Sheriff’s Department serves her unincorporated neighborhood, and deputies arrived along with a fire truck and ambulance, just as they had five years earlier. This time, she said, they told her they would not go into the backyard to evaluate her son for fear of escalation. They would only take him to the hospital if he climbed onto the gurney himself. 
“It would have had to be completely self-directed, and he was too symptomatic to understand that he needed to go,” Palafox said. “If he was capable of doing that, I would have taken him in my own car!”
Desperate, Palafox reached for her phone. “You just need a big guy to come in and help you,” mused one attorney who handles county conservatorships but had never heard of such law enforcement refusals for conservatees. Her second call, to a friend who runs a nonprofit for crime survivors, turned up a name. The man’s line of work: “Fugitive recovery.” 
The first image that popped into Palafox’s head was “Dog the Bounty Hunter,” the longhaired reality TV phenom. But the man who took her next call was professional and thorough. He reviewed her legal paperwork, and informed the sheriff’s department and UCI Medical Center security of his plans. When he showed up at Palafox’s place with a partner a few hours later, they went straight to the shed, where her son was still huddled. 
“He was kind of hanging on to things, not wanting to leave the shed,” said Palafox, who commended the men for their kindness, “but then they just picked him up.” With the aid of soft restraints, they “took him and put him in their truck.”
Palafox followed, informing the mental health liaison at the emergency room of their progress as she drove. They were directed to the ambulance bay – and, to the amazement of hospital staff who gathered to witness the unprecedented delivery, it was done. Palafox said her son was so ill he remained hospitalized for three months. 
Palafox paid $1,700 for the intervention, a fee she knows many families can’t afford. Neither do most have standing court orders to have their loved ones evaluated. But they share a problem.

“I’m not certain if that gap needs to be filled by our police and by our sheriff’s department,” she said. “I understand their scope of practice is people committing crime. It’s just that the transport need is still there.” 
When asked about Palafox’s experience, Orange County Sheriff Barnes returned to the distinction in the 5150 code — “may” versus “shall.” Just because she has a standing court order, he said “it does not by default mean we have to provide services. We are going to be taking a different review of our obligation to intervene — and in many cases there isn’t any.” 
The Del Norte County Sheriff and Crescent City Police Department have embraced more sweeping policies similar to Cooper’s, telling local media they will no longer respond to non-criminal mental health crisis calls. Barnes said he’s certain others will follow. 
Dial 911: Breaking “the habit that people got into”
There is little disagreement on the need to minimize the role of law enforcement in mental health crises. Alternatives that center dignity, self-directed care and lasting therapeutic relationships, while not widespread, are more available than ever. 
“The police were on the front lines for decades. And then the jails and the prisons were on the front lines. And now, in the last five years or so, we’re trying to move away from that,” said Yolo County Superior Court Judge Samuel McAdam, who teaches a course at UC Davis Law School on “mental health and the courts” that dives deep into the evolution of crisis response. “We’re trying to create a transformation in our society where everyone is taking responsibility, and the police are there for narrow important cases.” 
In many ways, Sacramento County is well-positioned to deliver. It was among the first in California to operate a  988 suicide and crisis lifeline — created by Congress in 2020 to reduce reliance on police. Cooper’s policy shift has now fast-tracked efforts to integrate 911 and 988 technologies, so dispatchers can make a smooth handoff and track that data. 
Last month, 988 counselors fielded 1,826 calls countywide, resolving more than 90% by phone, according to a spokesperson for WellSpace Health, which runs the service. In 16 cases, counselors determined there was an immediate threat to life so called out law enforcement or fire responders. They referred 154 calls to Sacramento County’s in-person “Community Wellness Response Teams.” Made up of a behavioral clinician and a peer with lived experience, they operate 24/7.
Due to critical Medi-Cal funding secured by California two years ago, similar teams are scaling up across the state. 
Meanwhile, two specialized teams run by the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District, which pair a nurse practitioner or physician’s assistant with a paramedic, have been ramping up service to people in behavioral health distress. And, though Cooper’s teams have been sidelined, Sacramento County social workers have been riding shotgun with a handful of police departments on those “co-response” teams.

Kaino Hopper is a mental health advocate and mother of a severely ill adult daughter, has helped develop the civilian crisis teams. She said she was appalled by the unilateral nature of Sheriff Cooper’s decision. Like others, she believes close collaboration among law enforcement, behavioral health and fire responders must be restored. Yet for “families like mine,” she told the Sheriff Review Commission in March, there’s a silver lining. 
“We’re not entirely disappointed. Why? Because it’s made people need to know who we are and what we are,” Hopper said of 988 and the all-hours crisis teams. “We’re getting the flyers out there, grassroots, one-on-one,” at Sacramento Kings games, concerts and other public gatherings.
Dialing 911 for every mental health crisis “was the habit people got into,” Hopper told the commission. Now, she said, “our response teams are able to do 90% of the de-escalation necessary. Families are happy, support people are happy, even the person in distress is happy to have a non-uniformed person come out with an open-ended time frame.” 
McAdam, the Yolo County Superior Court judge, said these types of innovations should reduce the number of calls on which police are asked to assist. But they’ll always be involved when serious crimes occur. They should also be counted on to respond when civilian partners believe they can’t safely handle a situation, or need help to safely evaluate and transport on 5150 holds. That’s why training is critical. 
Tag team tactics “when things are chaotic”
A 2015 state law mandates some crisis intervention training for law enforcement, to help them understand and identify mental illness and best communicate with those in crisis. A Sacramento County Sheriff’s spokesperson said the department is in compliance and then some. Others have taken their training much further.
San Francisco Police Lt. Donald Anderson instructs outside agencies across the country on tactics that reduce risk and liability. As the head of his department’s Crisis Intervention Team, he coordinates with emergency medical responders and public health social workers to triage cases of people in distress, among them those who generate multiple 911 calls per week or day. “Then we can work with one another to see what else can we offer to get them to the resources they need,” Anderson said in an interview. “We tag team it.”

More than three-fourths of the department’s patrol officers have received 40 hours of voluntary crisis training, co-taught by clinicians and mental health advocates, with input from peers. But the game changer, a change in field practices that drove use of force on crisis calls down by 68% over a four-year period, was a different type of training — a mandatory one that Anderson helped craft.
Anderson is stocky with an enthusiastic teaching style and a passion for jiu jitsu. A prominent tattoo on his forearm honors the traditional Japanese code of ethics and conduct followed by samurai warriors. On a recent early morning with fog settled on the city’s hilltop police academy, he welcomed a group of officers to his 10-hour class. For years, he told them, those who’d sought out voluntary trainings wound up on crisis calls with partners who hadn’t. That was a problem. Behind it was a bigger one:  “We weren’t talking about the actual tactics of law enforcement.”
“When things are chaotic and you have an individual running around in the middle of downtown, maybe with a knife, shouting and screaming, and you’re trying to control the public and trying to engage with this individual, tactically how does that look?” Anderson asked his students.
“Slow everything down and start evaluating the situation. ‘What’s the crime? Is there a crime'”? San Francisco Police Lt. Donald Anderson
In 2016, Anderson and his then-supervisor traveled to Seattle to learn about that city’s “team approach” — and modeled their new training accordingly. Unless violence is imminent, teams assemble at the scene, each member with a defined role. 
Containing the person in crisis is the critical first goal. It allows for distance, Anderson told the class, and containment plus distance buys time. “Slow everything down and start evaluating the situation,” he said. “What’s the crime? Is there a crime? Because, if there’s no crime, we have to ask, ‘what are we trying to accomplish here?”
The scope of allowable force, he told the class, is “very narrow,” so “you have to be very, very smart about what options you are going to use.” 
Liability is always a concern. But case law offers a road map to navigate risk. Anderson did discuss Scott v. Smith with his class. Yet when it comes to people experiencing a medical or psychiatric crises who have not committed crimes, aren’t resisting arrest and don’t pose direct threats to law enforcement, his department draws guidance from another ruling.

In 2017, the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a lower court decision to strip a Michigan sheriff’s deputy of qualified immunity. Instead it established a novel three-factor test to guide response: If the person’s emergency poses an immediate threat of harm to themselves or others, and “some degree of force” is reasonably necessary to get them needed care, there is no loss of qualified immunity – unless the force applied is excessive. 
While the decision is not binding outside the 6th Circuit, legal advisors have encouraged law enforcement nationwide to consider it.
To ensure minimal use of force, officers often must collaborate with emergency medical responders to plan the least traumatic way to get a person onto an ambulance gurney. And sometimes, Anderson said, the best option “is to walk away” and follow up later. 
A policy authored by Anderson also lays out a protocol to disengage from a barricaded and potentially armed person who is threatening only themselves. It requires that other options be exhausted and calls for police to notify the Crisis Intervention Team, so that Anderson’s team can plan a visit, he said, “and get them the resources they need.” 
A new push to change California law on mental health crises response
Back in Sacramento County, behavioral health and Metro Fire officials say they have begun talks with Sheriff Cooper’s department to map out a path forward. The review commission has empaneled a committee to examine the legal interpretations of Scott v. Smith, Cooper’s rollout of the policy, and the protocols regarding when his department will and won’t respond. 
The committee has also been digging into the February incident involving Susanna’s daughter. She had called into the commission meeting 11 days later, to describe her horror at the lack of response, given her daughter’s threats and the knife Susanna saw in her hand. But there is a dispute. In an interview, Susanna’s husband said he’s “pretty sure I said she went and grabbed a knife.” 
He said he was adamant about wanting to press charges. But, he said, the supervisor told him,“‘We don’t step in on mental calls.’ I said, ‘Well it’s assault.’ And he said she has to actually hit you guys for it to be assault.” 
While his 911 call to the dispatch center was recorded, the supervisor’s follow up calls were not. But the summary log of the incident, which the Sheriff’s Department provided to CalMatters, paints a different picture. “Not holding any knives or potential weapons,” it states. The husband, it concludes, “stated he does not wish to pursue charges.” 
“There’s no accountability. They can say the sky was green and we have to go with it.”Susanna, who wants supervisors’ calls on mental health crisis to be recorded
Susanna’s first idea for reform: that those calls from supervisors, who according to policy make the final decision on whether to respond to mental health crisis calls, be recorded. 
“There’s no accountability,” she said. “They can say the sky was green and we have to go with it.”
A sheriff’s spokesperson would only say that the family is no doubt “going through a lot.” He confirmed that calls made from outside the dispatch center are not recorded, but said it’s a practice they may explore down the road.  
Meanwhile, family advocates of those with serious mental illness, among them Polony, Hopper and Wentzel, have been meeting with state legislators to craft a potential bill that would allay law enforcement liability concerns and enable clinicians to more easily call for involuntary 5150 holds. A similar bill failed to advance last year. 
For his part, Sheriff Cooper described the policy as a “work in progress. 
“We’re open minded. We’re not totally entrenched,” he said. “At the end of the day, I want everybody to go home safe. I don’t want to ever have to take someone’s life or have one of my deputies do that. That’s the most important outcome for everybody. And it’s tough. It’s not the same old business as usual, and people are having a hard time swallowing it.”

Private developers are working with the Massachusetts Port Authority on a proposal to expand Hanscom’s private jet capacity with 17 new hangars, the accompanying fuel tanks, and other infrastructure. A coalition of neighbors and environmentalists had been working since at least 2023 to oppose the plan with petitions, meetings with representatives, and yard[...]","YOU MAY WONDER how a peaceful well-behaved middle-aged academic found himself handcuffed and arrested along with 20 others last year at Hanscom Airfield.  Hanscom sits about 20 miles northwest of Boston in Bedford, on 1,300 acres along the town’s borders with Concord, Lexington, and Lincoln. It abuts the 3,700-acre Great Meadows National Wildlife Refuge and is New England’s largest general aviation airfield for private jets, flying lessons, and the like.  Across a quiet country road from the airfield sits the birthplace of Henry David Thoreau. It seems an unlikely place for a ruckus.  Yet, quite a loud fight is brewing there. Private developers are working with the Massachusetts Port Authority (MassPort) on a proposal to expand Hanscom’s private jet capacity with 17 new hangars, the accompanying fuel tanks, and other infrastructure. A coalition of neighbors and environmentalists had been working since at least 2023 to oppose the plan with petitions, meetings with representatives, and yard signs, without success.  In April 2024, about 20 of us went to Hanscom Airfield, held signs, sang songs, and gave speeches explaining our purpose, first at three private jet companies and then, after we were arrested, while sitting on the roadside curb in handcuffs. The Hanscom expansion would reverse one important element of Massachusetts’s famously progressive environmental policy. Massachusetts rightly gets credit for making partial progress on the first two out of three well-known fundamental principles for a climate-friendly energy system, which I teach in my class on climate change in the Environmental Studies program at Tufts University: (1) electrify everything that can be electrified, (2) make the electric grid green, and (3) reduce demand in a few difficult-to-electrify sectors such as aviation. State law has a target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050, which requires a rapid reduction and eventually a nearly complete stop in burning the fossil fuels that generate climate-damaging greenhouse gas pollution. To meet this goal, Massachusetts invests in electricity from green solar and wind power, and in new electric heat pumps to replace fossil fuel systems for residences and businesses, and more. When the Commonwealth boasted of meeting its interim 2020 goal for reducing greenhouse gas emissions (25 percent below 1990 levels), 95 percent of the progress came just from the electric power and building sectors. Sadly, the expansion at Hanscom would undermine the third principle about reducing demand in difficult-to-electrify sectors such as aviation. The success in meeting the 2020 goal was 5 years ago. Meeting the Commonwealth’s next interim goal for 2030 (50 percent below 1990) will require progress in more sectors than just electricity and buildings. Converting to green electricity is challenging for transportation and effectively impossible for aviation. Jet fuel provides 20 to 50 times as much energy per pound as even the most advanced electric batteries, which remain too heavy to power full-sized airplanes. And the so-called sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) each have flaws. Some SAFs come from biofuels that compete with food production, contributing to food price inflation and world hunger. Other more advanced SAFs are expensive enough that adopting them would still require less flying overall. As an alternative to technological fantasies of battery-powered flight, reducing demand in the difficult-to-electrify aviation sector would be more feasible than many people realize. For example, in higher education, which is a major industry in Massachusetts, I am the co-organizer of an initiative encouraging universities to set goals and measure progress for reducing flying, as part of their annual environmental reporting. During the COVID pandemic, universities temporarily made excellent progress using remote communication technologies. As an experimental proof of concept, I stopped flying myself in 2014 and was delighted to discover new ways of traveling overland for work and for recreation. Zero is not the right amount of flying for everybody, but this experiment illustrates the potential for ambitious reductions proportional to the seriousness of the climate challenge. Far from helping, Massachusetts authorities actively make aviation pollution worse. For Logan International Airport in Boston, the largest airport in New England, MassPort is expanding infrastructure and underreporting greenhouse gas emissions. In Logan’s Environmental Status and Planning Report, the table on greenhouse gas pollution counts only jet fuel burned during takeoffs and landings, a small fraction of the total. An appendix to the same document reports the true amount of fossil jet fuel sold at Logan, 443 million gallons in 2022, which is enough to generate 4.26 million metric tons of greenhouse gases, more than 6 percent of all Massachusetts greenhouse gases. And that’s just the jet fuel. It doesn’t count the emissions from ground operations, manufacturing the airplanes, and the “radiative forcing” effect, which further enhances the climate damage. As a fraction of the state total, aviation emissions from Logan have recovered from their Covid-era slump and now are setting new records. In this context, it would be absurd for Massachusetts to double the capacity at Hanscom Airfield specifically for private planes serving a plutocratic elite. Greenhouse gas emissions per passenger mile are much higher for private jets than for commercial airlines, which are much higher in turn than for buses or electric trains. After the new infrastructure is built, private jets from Hanscom would produce enough greenhouse gas pollution to undo the benefit from 70% of the solar panels installed in Massachusetts. The project’s environmental impact statement failed to report the full extent of its greenhouse gas pollution and invented without evidence large purported savings from reduced “ferry” flights of empty private jets between nearby airports. The report was so fundamentally flawed that it was rejected by state officials and sent back for a complete resubmission. You can see why 20 friends and I felt obliged to object to expanding private jets at Hanscom Airfield. If there had been any alternative to public protest, I would have used it. I am a scholar, not a fighter. Before speaking up at Hanscom Airfield, I had never been arrested in my life. Now, at great expense in time and money, Massachusetts has scheduled individual trials in Concord District Court beginning May 13 and running through the summer. My own trial is scheduled for May 27.  So we have come to the point of decision. In this time of national crisis, will the Commonwealth of Massachusetts stand up for climate justice and meet its next interim climate goal for 2030? Or will it accelerate aviation pollution, understate the emissions, obey the billionaires, and prosecute the 21 good citizens who raised their voice and said, “This is wrong”? Parke Wilde is a professor at the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University. He will be on trial in Concord District Court May 27, on charges of trespassing and disorderly conduct related to a peaceful protest against the proposed expansion of private jet infrastructure at Hanscom Airfield in Eastern Massachusetts.The post Why We Were in Handcuffs at Hanscom Airfield appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Hanscom-protest.webp?fit=1024%2C752&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-28 09:08:44.284178

(Photo by Christine Condon/ Maryland Matters)This Chesapeake Bay wetland could be an environmental crystal ball.
With infrared lamps pointed down at marsh grasses — and heating cables placed beneath them — the environment is 5.1 degrees Celsius hotter than the surrounding area, simulating a future world warmed by climate change.
In nearby sections of marsh, carbon dioxide is pumped into structures that look like mini, open-air greenhouses.
“You’re never going to get a warmer world without also having higher CO2 in the atmosphere,” said Genevieve Noyce, a senior scientist at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center, which runs the wetland site.
The wetland is just a few miles from the Research Center’s headquarters in Edgewater, nestled in a crook of the Rhode River. And it has become a hotbed — pun intended — for several experiments that mimic global warming.
The latest research to emerge from the Global Change Research Wetland, or GCREW, was published last week in Science Advances, a peer-reviewed journal. That study captured data for five years, focused not on the wetland’s growth, but on its emissions.

But one of the experiments here has been ongoing since 1987, leading the center to pronounce that it’s likely the world’s longest-running field experiment simulating carbon dioxide elevation.
The researchers found that adding carbon dioxide stimulated the wetland’s growth by about 30% — and allowed its long grasses to start growing earlier in the springtime and stay green farther into the fall. Some years, the grasses can make it until December before they turn entirely brown, said Andrew Peresta, the site’s operations manager.
But nearly 40 years after the experiment’s beginning, Mother Nature is playing scientist, and adding new conditions to the simulation, Peresta said. Rising water levels, a handful of millimeters each year, have begun to change the story, slowing the rate of increased grass growth.
“All of these plants are adapted to grow with their roots in wet soil. But if it’s too wet — if the sea level comes up too fast — and they can’t keep up, then they start struggling,” Noyce said.
The study’s long time horizon has allowed scientists to document the marsh’s changes over time, including incursions by invasive phragmites, Peresta said.
“A lot of projects are only two to three years long,” Peresta said. “You might not learn as much as you do with this.”
Collectively, coastal wetland environments are among the world’s greatest carbon sinks. According to a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration webpage, they annually trap carbon at a rate 10 times greater than mature tropical forests, preventing the harmful gases from reaching the atmosphere, where they contribute to warming.
But wetlands also release methane, a greenhouse gas that is about 28 times more potent than carbon dioxide when it comes to trapping heat in the atmosphere, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.
  The Smithsonian Environmental Research Center’s experimental wetland includes plenty of heating lamps, and pods where carbon dioxide is also added to simulate the effects of climate change. (Photo by Christine Condon/ Maryland Matters)
Traditionally, wetlands have been considered minor producers of the gas. But the Smithsonian researchers have discovered that raising the temperature of the wetland, with the submerged heaters and overhead lamps, speeds up methane production by about four times, compared to the undisturbed wetlands close by, Noyce said.
The same was true when researchers added carbon dioxide to the equation, except the increase was less dramatic — about 1.5 times. In other words, if climate change gets worse, it could tip off a domino effect in the wetlands, yielding more emissions that further worsen global warming.
“We knew there was something with adding elevated CO2 to reduce the amount of methane coming out of the plots. But we didn’t really know why,” Noyce said.
So the researchers looked to the microbial community in the soil beneath the wetland. There, some microbes produce methane, but others consume it.
Climate change seems to change the fine balance between these two types of microbes, increasing the methane that is released, said Jaehyun Lee, who was the study’s lead author as a post-doctoral researcher at the Smithsonian Center.
When carbon dioxide was added to the plots, it stimulated root growth, increasing the amount of oxygen in the soil. This gave more fuel to the microbes that consume methane by oxidizing it, Lee said. Their activity canceled out some of the effect from hotter temperatures, which spurred the methane-producing microbes, causing methane emissions to spike.
Even with the increased methane emissions, it seems likely that wetlands will still store more globe-warming emissions than they release, Lee said. But the research proves that the balance is delicate, and could potentially flip in the other direction, said Lee, who is now a senior researcher at the Korea Institute of Science and Technology in South Korea.

Since 2016, experiments in Noyce’s section of the wetland, known as SMARTX, or the Salt Marsh Accretion Response to Temperature Experiment, have been funded by the U.S. Department of Energy. It remains unclear whether the funding will be impacted by recent Trump administration cuts to scientific research, particularly that which focuses on climate change.
The wetland receives three years of funding at a time, and is currently in its last year of the cycle, Noyce said. The team just applied for another three years, she said.
The 1987 project is funded by a National Science Foundation grant for long-term research in environmental biology, she said.
The new data could help improve the accuracy of climate change modeling, as researchers attempt to predict the amount of globe-warming gases that will be emitted, Lee said.
“When we set the the goal for carbon reduction in the future, to slow down the temperature rise, we also have to consider these types of changes in methane emissions,” Lee said. Otherwise, governments could struggle to reach their carbon reduction goals, he said.
The findings, released Wednesday, could also inform wetland plantings and restoration efforts, Noyce said.
“If you can start understanding which plant communities are going to respond in different ways under global change, then you can say: ‘Oh, maybe this plant community is going to be better. It might reduce the amount of methane coming out of this sort of ecosystem,’” Noyce said.

Just like that, Huertero and her adult son — whose medical issues prevent him from working — had to find a new place to live. She said she ended up homeless for the next six months, temporarily bunking with her daughter in Tooele. Also having been a domestic violence victim, she said she turned to South Valley Services for assistance, which eventually helped her obtain an Emergency Housing Voucher for rental assistance.

The Emergency Housing Voucher program, launched in 2021 by then-President Joe Biden as part of the American Rescue Plan Act, used $5 billion in federal funds to help house vulnerable people — those who are homeless, at risk of homelessness, or are trying to flee domestic violence or other dangerous situations, according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). 
Since then, Huertero said that voucher has helped keep a roof over her and her family’s head. Currently, she lives on a multiplex in Salt Lake City with her elderly aunt and her adult son, both of whom rely on her as a caretaker. She works at a local housing authority — where she helps people like herself get housing assistance, trying to “give back” in as many ways as she can.
But without the voucher, which she said pays for roughly half of their $2,200 rent, Huertero wouldn’t know what to do. 
“Oh my gosh, if we didn’t have that, we probably wouldn’t be able to make rent,” she said, adding that even with the rental assistance she at times struggles to make ends meet between the cost of utilities, groceries and gas for her commute.  
Huertero — who was born in San Diego and moved to Utah decades ago, in 1996, in search of a better life — is one of hundreds of Utahns who could lose their Emergency Housing Voucher assistance earlier than expected unless Congress acts. 
But the program, faced with rising housing costs, is quickly running out of money. Federal officials expect the funds to run dry by the end of 2026, according to a letter HUD sent to housing agencies across the country, including those in Utah. It advised housing authorities to “manage your EHV program with the expectation that no additional funding from HUD will be forthcoming.” 
How many vouchers are at risk in Utah?
At least 281 vouchers are currently being used in Utah, according to HUD’s website. That number is small compared to other states like California, where nearly 15,500 vouchers are at risk, according to the Associated Press. In total, roughly 60,000 people across the country could lose their rental assistance and face eviction at the end of next year unless Congress sets more money aside for the program. 
Janice Kimball, CEO of Housing Connect (Salt Lake County’s housing authority) received one of those letters from HUD. In Salt Lake County, Emergency Housing Vouchers are helping keep at least 97 people or families housed. 
“I think for this fiscal year, we’re probably OK,” she told Utah News Dispatch. “But we’re really worried about next fiscal year.”

Looking ahead to when the funds are set to expire in 2026, Kimball said “we’re trying to figure out how to keep those folks housed” by transitioning them or absorbing them into other programs, wherever possible. The vast majority of Utahns receiving assistance through Housing Connect do so with Section 8 vouchers, which Kimball said support about 3,000 households.
But without more federal dollars, she said Salt Lake County would not be able to sustain its 97 Emergency Housing Vouchers long term. 
Utah youth homeless shelters face funding uncertainty amid federal cuts, freezes

“We don’t have enough of our own funds to do that,” she said, adding that the average cost per unit the vouchers help fund cost about $1,110 per month, “so we’re spending just over $110,000 per month to keep those households housed.” 
The Housing Authority of Salt Lake City has also distributed a big chunk of Utah’s Emergency Housing Vouchers. Currently, 77 vouchers are being used, according to Britnee Dabb, deputy director of Salt Lake City’s housing authority. 
Though Dabb said the authority has been allocated funding for 98 vouchers, she said her team has moved some of the households to other long-term programs they qualify for instead of waiting for the funds to expire. 
But as for the other 77 still in use? 
“If we can’t find programs that the households qualify for and are open, these families will lose the rent subsidy and have a large probability of becoming homeless,” Dabb said. 
What now?
To not cause a panic, Kimball said Housing Connect hasn’t been notifying renters just yet of the program’s expiration date, given there’s still so much uncertainty around what federal officials and Congress could do next. 
In the meantime, she said “we’re hoping that we’ll get additional information from HUD, and we’re hoping that we’ll have an idea of future funding, because that gives us the tools to know what we can do and what we can’t do.” 




How many Emergency Housing Vouchers are at risk in Utah 
Ogden Housing Authority: 19
Salt Lake County Housing Authority: 97
Salt Lake City Housing Authority: 77
Provo Housing Authority: 27
Utah County Housing Authority: 32
Carbon County Housing Authority: 6
St. George Housing Authority: 17
Cedar City Housing Authority: 12




“The other thing that’s really frustrating is that Congress has not passed a budget for 2025, so we’re operating on information that we think is current based on last year,” she said. 
Since the program isn’t expected to end until around November 2026, Kimball added “we have a little bit of time to kind of think this through. So we’re hoping we can have the budget numbers in before we have to start making those calls.” 
Still, she worries the program’s expiration will cause a setback during a time when housing in Utah and across the country continues to be a painful issue for so many Utahns and Americans.
“Right now, there’s such a deficit of affordable housing that it’s really hard for low-income households to be able to find a stable place to live,” she said. “We should be adding to the mix to help families stay housed. And so, any resource that you remove from the community is detrimental.” 
Kimball said housing authorities are “going to do everything they can to keep people housed,” but she said now is a “good time” for Utahns to reach out to their congressional leaders and “let them know what the value of housing is for you and your family.” 
In the past, when voucher programs have been awarded and expire, they are usually extended, Kimball said, “and it’s because of this reason: once you get households or families entered into leases, it’s hard to unwind that. Usually it’s just been extended.” 
But under Trump’s administration and the GOP-controlled Congress, it’s unclear whether that will happen. 
Kimball said the Emergency Housing Voucher program has helped hundreds of Utahns move from unstable housing or homelessness, to a safe, affordable situation.










I can’t believe, honestly, that they would (stop) that funding. I mean, this population that I’m included in. We’re really vulnerable. We’ve been through a lot mentally.


– Juanita Huertero


“They have some choice in where they can live. It gives them breathing room. … They can start building from there,” she said. “Affordable housing is like the foundational game changer. It really keeps people stable and allows them to live.” 
Kimball said she “can’t even imagine having to tell these households that we can’t house them.” Though it hasn’t come to that, at least not yet, Kimball said she does worry it would be “devastating” to those renters. 
While Utah’s number of Emergency Housing Vouchers is small compared to other states, to Huertero, it would be life altering.

She said she’s been working hard to complete HUD’s five-year Family Self-Sufficiency Program — which helps teach budgeting, saving and other financial goals while setting aside money whenever Huertero gets a salary bump in an escrow account that she can later use to buy a home. But she said she probably has another four years before she could graduate from that program. 
If the Emergency Housing Voucher program expires, Huertero worries she’ll be forced to go back on affordable housing waitlists. 
“I’m going to get on any wait list I can, just in case,” she said. 
Thinking about thousands of others like her who are at risk losing their rental assistance, Huertero choked back tears. 
“I can’t believe, honestly, that they would (stop) that funding. I mean, this population that I’m included in. We’re really vulnerable. We’ve been through a lot mentally,” she said. “I’m really struggling to try to understand all this.”
She acknowledged that President Donald Trump’s administration is looking to reign in federal spending, but pointing to chaos and uncertainty around other frozen funds or cuts, Huertero said she wishes the approach could be more compassionate. 
“I get that, yeah, there are some things that really do need to change,” she said. “But it didn’t need to change all in one day, all in one month. You know, he has four years to make these changes.”

The Alabama Council of the Arts said earlier this month it is anticipating cuts at the federal level soon. They said that representatives from DOGE were scheduled to visit NEA offices.
“Any cuts to federal funding for state partnerships would directly impact our grant programs, reducing our available funds by up to $1 million annually,” Executive Director Elliot Knight said in a statement Wednesday.
According to the Council, the NEA makes up 15% of its budget with the rest coming from the Alabama Legislature through the Education Trust Fund (ETF). The 2026 ETF received approval from the House on Tuesday, which included an $85,000 increase from the current budget and Gov. Kay Ivey’s 2026 recommendation.
The Council awarded $14.7 million in grants over the last five years, according to the statement. Knight also said the Council uses 100% of its federal funds for grants.
“Public funding for arts and creativity is a high-return investment that ensures all Alabamians have access to arts programming,” Knight said.
The federal cuts would have to be approved by Congress. 
“Please help us make sure that all members of Alabama’s Congressional delegation understand how Alabama workers and communities will be negatively impacted by the cuts to NEH and IMLS grants and potential cuts to NEA grants,” Knight said.
According to the statement, Poetry Out Loud is one program funded with federal dollars. The national arts education program that encourages high school students to learn about great poetry through memorization, performance and competition. Knight said this is one of the programs that would be impacted by NEA cuts.

(Getty Images)As high summer temperatures start to creep across the state, about $1.4 million in federal funding meant to help low-income Nevadans pay utility bills is in limbo after the Trump administration fired every employee responsible for administering the funds.
Earlier this month, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) terminated the entire staff that allocates funds for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) as part of a broad effort by the White House to dramatically downsize the federal government. 
Federal funding for LIHEAP is approved by Congress and funneled through state programs which use the money to pay energy providers directly in order to help low-income families avoid shutoffs.
Consumer advocates warn that the layoffs could threaten or delay nearly $400 million in utility assistance funding that had not yet been distributed to states by the time the federal program was gutted. 
Nevada was awarded about $15 million in LIHEAP funding this year, but about $1.4 million of that funding is now in limbo after the program was essentially shuttered in early April. 
According to the Nevada Division of Welfare and Supportive Services — which administers the state’s LIHEAP funding —Nevada has not received the remaining 10% of its allocated funding as of Thursday. 
Earlier this month, Nevada Sen. Jacky Rosen and several other Democratic senators sent a letter to HHS urging the agency to disburse all of the LIHEAP funds that Congress has appropriated.
“By terminating all 23 employees tasked with overseeing LIHEAP, it is now unclear how these funds will be administered. In our view, that is unacceptable,” reads the letter. “Failure to disburse these funds constitutes an illegal impoundment of bipartisan, congressionally appropriated funds and will put the health and well-being of some of the most vulnerable people in America at risk.”
HHS did not respond to a request for comment on the fate of Nevada’s remaining funding.
Nevada’s Energy Assistance Program received more than half its funding from LIHEAP last year, making it a vital source of utility assistance funding for the state.
Last year, Nevada’s Energy Assistance Program paid out more than $31 million in benefits to help more than 17,000 households in the state keep their power on. A portion of those funds were also used to help low-income households pay for upgrades that improve energy efficiency and lower power bills in the long term.
Still, as temperatures rise there is a growing demand for utility assistance funding in the state. Nearly 32,000 Nevadans had their power disconnected by NV Energy for nonpayment in 2024, according to data from the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada.
In southern Nevada, where temperatures reached 100 degrees or higher for 64 consecutive days in 2024, air conditioning is a life-saving necessity.
Extreme heat exposure is a serious health hazard. It can cause heat rash, cramps, heat exhaustion, or heat stroke, which can be fatal or have lifelong consequences. Older people, people with disabilities, pregnant people, and children are at increased risk of adverse health impacts from heat.
Without the remaining 10% of Nevada’s LIHEAP funding, the state won’t be able to provide financial assistance to as many households struggling to pay their energy bills.
The state’s ability to provide energy assistance could be reduced even more in 2026, as the Trump administration has signaled it could end the program next year. A leaked draft budget request document from the HHS proposes allocating zero funding for the LIHEAP program in 2026, according to reporting by the Hill. 
The U.S. Constitution puts Congress, not the president, in charge of federal spending, but the Trump administration has been challenging congressional power of the purse, with little pushback from Republicans in control of the legislative branch.
The administration’s  termination of LIHEAP programs and staff is raising alarms for consumer advocates. 
Keriann Conroy, a research associate with the Energy and Policy Institute, a utility watchdog organization, said any reduction in LIHEAP funding could be especially devastating for Nevada.
“It’s the main source of energy assistance funding that exists both nationwide and in the state of Nevada,” Conroy said. 
“This is absolutely a program people depend on. I think you’ll see the most vulnerable people being disconnected and being put in life threatening circumstances,” Conroy said. “Since most Nevadans are already struggling to pay their utility bills you’d see that extend to a larger group of people.”
Reno and Las Vegas are the two fastest-warming cities in the country, according to climate scientists at Climate Central. Heat played a role in the deaths of 527 people last year in Southern Nevada alone, according to the Southern Nevada Health District.
Yet, Nevada’s customer protections against utility companies disconnecting consumers during extreme weather are limited.
Nevada is one of 19 states that does not require utilities to publicly disclose the number of customers they disconnect to utility regulators, leaving little transparency to understand the full extent of disconnections. However, Nevada lawmakers are currently considering a bill that would require utilities to report disconnections by month and zip code.
Nevada also does not have a blanket moratorium on utility disconnections during months of extreme weather, like many other states do, including neighboring Arizona. 
“If LIHEAP assistance disappears, it will add insult to injury in a state with limited consumer protections.

On Wednesday, the Alaska Senate voted 20-0 to change state law and require that Alaska’s Big Game Commercial Services Board have a permanent executive director.
The board is in charge of licensing commercial hunting guides, assistant guides and transporters. 
Since 2024, the state budget has included funding for a temporary executive director, but if Senate Bill 29 becomes law, the Alaska Department of Commerce, Community, and Economic Development would be required to have a permanent executive director for the big game board. 
Several other regulated industries already have boards with permanent executive directors, and the cost of the director would be paid for with fees, said Sen. Jesse Bjorkman, R-Nikiski and the sponsor of SB 29.
The bill was supported by Safari Club International, the Alaska Professional Hunters Association and other trade groups.
SB 29 is awaiting a hearing in the House Resources Committee.

In 1951, she opened the organization’s office in Birmingham to grow memberships in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi and Tennessee. 
When she arrived in Mississippi, there were only 800 NAACP members. After the governor made remarks she disagreed with, she wrote a letter to the editor that was published in a Mississippi newspaper. After that step in courage, membership grew to 4,000.

She helped Medgar Evers investigate the 1955 murder of Emmett Till and other violence against Black Americans. Despite threats, she pushed on. 
“When you’re in the middle of these situations, there’s no room for fear,” she said. “If you have fear in your heart or mind, you can’t do a good job.” 
After an all-white jury acquitted Till’s killers, she appeared on the front cover of Jet magazine with the headline, “Most Militant Negro Woman in the South.” 
Months later, she helped Autherine Lucy become the first Black student at the University of Alabama.

Over the last week, flags with three bars and seven stars have sprouted over some of the graves.
It’s my annual reminder that we still have Confederate Memorial Day, one of three state holidays honoring men who killed American soldiers in defense of white supremacy.

That’s what the Confederacy was about, and it’s never been a secret. Ulysses S. Grant wrote in his memoirs that the Southern cause was “one of the worst for which a people ever fought, and one for which there was the least excuse.”
He added that he did not question “the sincerity of the great mass of those who were opposed to us.”
Neither do I. These men were honest in their racism like a vulture is straightforward about its plans for a dying animal.
Some may consider that impolite. Many believe that the South’s profound inhumanity was a kind of trick pulled off by elites. In this telling, the people at the top invented or extended racism to keep poor whites, whose griefs came from the enslavers and not the enslaved, distracted and unable to form potentially powerful class-based alliances. Gaslit into confusion, lower-class whites became the unthinking tools of the aristocrat pulling strings from a secure perch.
If this was the whole tale, Reconstruction would have been as challenging as a home remodeling project.  Swap Slaveholder A for Public Servant B. Alabama’s myriad issues with education and public health — all of which have roots in slavery — would be far less dire.
The problem is that it treats racism as little more than a tool for rich whites and a fog around poor ones. With a little time and a bit of sunshine, the mists of hatred would evaporate and people would see the world clearly.
But nearly all whites, whether rich or poor, chose to drink from the same polluted well. The poison seeped into their blood and penetrated their bones. It left many white men convinced that their own roles leading their households depended on keeping Black Americans in bondage.
“The hidden assumptions and values that underlay their political choices were forged in the relationships that engaged them most directly,” the historian Stephanie McCurry wrote in “Masters of Small Worlds.” “With the few slaves they may have owned, but, just as importantly, with the women and other family dependents they presumed it their natural right to rule. Whether slaveholders or not, yeoman household heads were, as they proudly proclaimed, masters.”
Maybe the ordinary farmer didn’t like the slaveholder’s house or his allies shifting taxes to him. But when the rich man spoke of domination and order, he heard his own dark thoughts. He saw a peer.
And when those elites declared war on the federal government, he picked up a gun, grabbed starvation-level rations and killed American soldiers. And he sang all the way.
The brackish water of racism freed him from any concern about his position or any desire for something better. In his mind, liberty grew from the chain on a Black American. That was worth a bullet or a fatal illness in a filthy tent.
Lewis Parsons, the governor of Alabama, estimated after the war that 122,000 Alabamians — more than a fifth of the prewar white population — took up arms for racism. Somewhere between 27,000 and 35,000 of them died for it. (Perhaps 3,000 white Alabamians fought for the Union, while 5,000 Black Alabamians took on the blue.)
Tens of thousands more were injured. God knows how much undiagnosed trauma went home to their families, their children and future generations.
Given the choice, I would fire every single Confederate holiday into the sun. But if the state insists on having them, we may look at those men decaying beneath the Stars and Bars and reflect on where embracing authoritarianism leads.
Decades of family and children and love cleaved by hate and ended by a firearm, a shell or a virus.
Lives reduced to a flag without a country and a cause no decent person honors.
A pointless sacrifice to the fickle god of malice.
Today we see many people surrounding the poisoned well that fed that destruction, pushing and shoving to get a taste.
Drink from it, and almost everything else falls away. The economy burns, and the rule of law dies, but they have a sense of peace. They smile as corruption thrives and their savings evaporate. Nothing matters except their rapturous vision of a person with brown skin suffering.
In that hateful daze, they nod as the administration locks people up without trial. While scholars are hounded. And as the bright future down a more difficult path fades away.
What comes of that? What does it leave behind?
A graveyard. A field of faded tombstones in dead soil, acidic from the hatred leaching out of the buried bones.
And on this sterile ground, the Confederate flags bloom.

SB 101, sponsored by Sen. Larry Stutts, R-Tuscumbia, would require parental consent for medical, dental, and mental health services for minors under 16 and prohibit health care providers and governmental entities from denying parents access to a child’s health record.
“Since 1972, the age of consent for all medical care in Alabama, from dental health to general health to mental health, has been 14 years of age, and this bill seeks to raise it to 16,” said Rep. Susan DuBose, R-Hoover, who is handling the legislation in the House.

DuBose said that although the bill would have originally raised the age of consent to 18 years, she and Stutts worked with the medical community to arrive at the compromise.
 “I understand the concerns of all these medical professionals, and while I may not have wanted 16 to begin with, I wanted 18. We all did. This is far better than 14, and I think sometimes that’s what we end up doing on legislation, is working with everybody and coming to the best compromise that we can all live with,” DuBose said.
She added that a key part of the bill is ensuring that parents can access their minor child’s medical records.
“The good thing about this bill is it does provide parents with access to all medical records of their minor child, and so I’m very happy with that,” she said.
The bill provides several exemptions to the age of consent requirement. Minors under 16 who are pregnant or emancipated can make their own medical decisions. Minors under 16 can also consent to services related to sexually transmitted diseases and alcohol or drug misuse. Health care professionals would also be allowed to provide emergency services without parental consent under specific circumstances, including imminent threats to the minor’s health, suspected abuse, neglect or exploitation.
“We try to have common sense carve outs in this law,” DuBose said in a phone interview Friday.
The bill can now be considered by the full House.

(Photo illustration by Scott Olson/Getty Images)The Trump administration this month scrapped a Biden-era proposal that would have required state Medicaid programs and allowed federal Medicare to pay for some GLP-1s for obesity treatment. Instead, state Medicaid programs will retain the choice of whether to cover the high-priced medications for their residents.
The drugs, which have historically been prescribed to diabetic patients, also help patients lose weight and have grown in popularity among doctors and patients. But they are generally too expensive for most people to afford without insurance.
While doctors and patient advocates say these drugs are critical to helping patients struggling with obesity and can save money in the long run by reducing comorbidities such as heart disease, others say the medications are just too expensive for most states to afford. More than a dozen state Medicaid programs have opted to cover GLP-1s for obesity treatment, and the proposed Biden rule would have asked all states to figure out how to pay for them. But now, advocates fear these drugs may continue to be out of reach for many.
“It’s unfortunate that they’re excluding a whole class of medications that seem to have a tremendous number of health benefits to patients,” Dr. Nicholas Pennings, chair of family medicine at Campbell University in Buies Creek, North Carolina, said in an interview.
GLP-1s, which stand for glucagon-like peptide-1, are a class of drugs that balance blood sugar levels. They’ve long been prescribed to patients with Type 2 diabetes. But since the drugs also curb hunger signals, doctors may prescribe these drugs — including popular brands Wegovy and Ozempic — to help patients lose weight.
Doctor makes case for expanding Nevada Medicaid coverage of anti-obesity drugs

Medicaid is a joint federal-state funded program that mostly serves people with lower incomes under the age of 65 or who have a disability. The federal Medicare program focuses primarily on people above the age of 65, no matter their income.
How and whether to cover expensive treatments and drugs can be a significant deliberation for state Medicaid directors. In North Carolina, where 70% of people struggle with being overweight or obese, officials opted to begin covering the drugs for weight loss last year. That coverage has been a game changer, said Pennings, who continues to treat Medicaid patients.
“They are expensive, but there’s a lot of other medications that are expensive too. Why is it that obesity medications and diabetes medications are being selected out?” Pennings said. “I think that’s just part of the inherent bias towards the treatment of people with obesity, feeling like it’s cheating or not necessary.”
The list price for Wegovy is around $1,300 per month, and for Ozempic, around $1,000. Even so, the skyrocketing popularity of these drugs has prompted at least 14 state Medicaid departments to begin covering these drugs to treat obesity in the past decade.
In addition to North Carolina, those states include California, Delaware, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Virginia and Wisconsin.
An annual survey of Medicaid directors from health policy research group KFF recently found that half of the 47 responding states not already covering the drugs were considering doing so.
In January, the National Association of Medicaid Directors told the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services that state Medicaid departments had “significant concerns over the fiscal impacts” of the Biden proposal to require coverage of GLP-1s, and “strongly recommend that CMS maintain the current state option to cover or not cover anti-obesity medications.”
But others say covering the drugs will yield long-term savings.
John Cawley, a professor of economics and public policy at Cornell University who has studied the economic impacts of obesity, has found that obesity essentially doubles a person’s annual health care costs due to comorbidities such as heart disease, fatty liver disease and kidney disease.
He’s found that weight loss among those with extreme obesity, with a BMI of 40 or higher, can yield substantial reductions in medical care costs.
Cawley added that state Medicaid programs “have a lot of flexibility” in ensuring costs don’t get out of control, by, for example, covering a newly available generic version of GLP-1s, requiring prior authorization, and asking patients to try behavioral programs before getting a prescription.
North Carolina’s Medicaid department began covering GLP-1s for obesity in August. The state has been able to afford GLP-1 coverage by negotiating rebates, or discounts, with drug manufacturers, and by getting the federal government to cover some costs. Department leaders think lowering obesity will save the state money in the long run, said Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for North Carolina Medicaid.
He said that one of the benefits of Medicaid is that “we get to choose, as a state, where we want to make kind of those extra investments or not.” He added that covering the medications could be potentially financially feasible for other states.
“Each program is different and has its own pressures. It would be welcome to be able to come together with other states to be able to negotiate broader deals,” Ludlam said. “If North Carolina is able to get a good deal, I don’t know why other states wouldn’t be able to participate in that.”
In 2023, Connecticut enacted a law requiring Medicaid to cover obesity treatment services. The program began covering GLP-1s for weight loss, but costs were significant enough that the state told providers this year that it is now focusing on other obesity treatments instead.
Sean Scanlon, the Connecticut comptroller, said that not covering GLP-1s is “shortsighted, bad policy.” The state health plan, which takes care of teachers and other state employees, has been covering the drugs for weight loss since 2023. The plan controls costs by only prescribing GLP-1s after patients go through some online weight-loss counseling, said Scanlon.
“The most fiscally conservative thing we can do is give people tools that will save the taxpayers money in the long run,” he said in an interview. “And GLP-1 drugs are one of the best tools that we have to ensure that the taxpayers are not going to pay more money for the health care of hundreds of millions of people in the long run.”
It’s unclear whether the federal government will reverse course. In the past, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has recommended “three good meals a day” and behavioral changes rather than weight-loss medication.
But this month, Kennedy told CBS News he’s considering a regulatory framework to have Medicare and Medicaid cover these “extraordinary drugs” in the future, once their cost goes down.
“Ideally, over the long-term, we’d like to see those drugs available for people after they try other interventions,” Kennedy said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wegovy.jpg,,,2025-04-28 09:08:44.284178

Medicaid is the country’s biggest health plan, covering more than 70 million Americans. Known as HUSKY in Connecticut, Medicaid covers roughly 1 million people in the state, according to the Department of Social Services, which equals just about 25% of the population. 
States depend heavily on the federal government to pay for the program. The state’s Office of Policy and Management projects Connecticut will spend a total of $11.6 billion on Medicaid this fiscal year. The federal government contributed roughly $6.9 billion, or 59%, of that funding.
Democrats across the country are sounding the alarm that the Trump administration’s budget priorities will threaten the federal funding that’s critical to Medicaid. Both chambers of the U.S. Congress recently passed a measure crafted by Republicans that instructed the House Energy and Commerce Committee to cut $880 billion in spending. 
The resolution doesn’t direct the committee to cut Medicaid specifically, and President Donald J. Trump has insisted that his administration will not cut the program. But, based on the spending that the committee handles, Medicaid would likely need to be part of the equation, which could lead to reductions in access for enrollees. 
Here’s what you need to know.
What will the cuts mean for providers and patients?
Medicaid covers all types of services for its enrollees, including medical and behavioral health services, substance abuse treatment, as well as in-home and nursing home care for seniors and people with disabilities. It’s unlikely that we’ll know the full details of how Medicaid cuts will play out until the summer, when Congress is expected to vote on the final budget for fiscal year 2026. 
“There’s all kinds of ideas swirling around about how they would implement [cuts]. They’re all bad,” U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney, D-2nd District, said during a press conference in Hartford earlier this month.
Providers are already bracing for the changes, saying they may have to pare back services if cuts go through.
Glenn Connan, chief financial officer at Midwestern Connecticut Council on Alcoholism, a substance abuse treatment provider in Danbury, said he worries his organization would have to shutter some of its clinics, despite surging demand for services.
“Any further cuts to Medicaid [and] we’re gonna have to start closing some of those seven outpatient clinics and just having maybe three,” Connan told elected officials during an event earlier this month in Danbury focused on potential Medicaid cuts. “That’s gonna hurt the people in those communities.”
Jeffrey Shenberger, division head of neonatology at Connecticut Children’s Medical Center, said Medicaid cuts would impact some of his most vulnerable patients — babies in the neonatal intensive care unit. 
“Cuts would lead to fewer resources within the acute care process within the NICU. And it would impact all families and all children. It’s regardless of whether they’re private pay, self-pay or paid through Medicaid,” Shenberger told attendees during an April press conference at Connecticut Children’s in Hartford.
Medicaid covers roughly 40% of births in Connecticut, according to health policy organization KFF.
How would Medicaid cuts impact state finances?
Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration is modeling out what the cuts to Medicaid would mean for the state budget. While it’s unclear how the federal government would pare back spending, the impacts of all cuts Congress is considering would put enormous stress on the state’s finances. 
Right now, the federal government covers at least 50% of all the state’s Medicaid costs. But, Congress may decide to, instead, offer a fixed amount per Medicaid enrollee, regardless of how many or which types of services they use. Under this scenario, Connecticut would lose $1.35 billion over the next seven years, or an average of $193 million per year, according to the Department of Social Services.
The feds may also lower or abandon the current guarantee that Washington reimburses at least 50% of all states’ Medicaid costs. In that case, Connecticut stands to lose up to a staggering $3.5 billion in federal reimbursements, DSS estimates. The funding represents just over half of the projected federal reimbursements Connecticut received this fiscal year.
Officials have said it’s too early to focus on how the state might trim Medicaid under some nightmare scenario. But, there are benefits that Connecticut offers that aren’t required for states to participate in Medicaid. These include dental and pharmaceutical coverage, and home care for elderly patients.
Sen. Cathy Osten, D-Sprague, who co-chairs the General Assembly’s Appropriations Committee, told The Connecticut Mirror she isn’t ready to accept any cutbacks.
“We’re not pre-supposing …  in a program as important as Medicaid,” Osten said. “We’re not going to start off looking at cuts to programs that keep people alive — and that’s what Medicaid does.”

(Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Almost a year ago, I received news that no one ever wants to hear — that my colleague Parole and Probation Agent Davis Martinez had been killed during a home visit. He was the first agent to be killed in the line of duty in Maryland.
Brother Martinez was a beloved coworker, brother and son. He was an active member of his union, AFSCME Local 3661, which represents thousands of state employees who work in public safety and community corrections. For the last year, my fellow union members and I have been mourning his loss, and we are still deeply hurt and angry at the departmental and policy failures that led to this tragedy.
Sadly, Brother Martinez was not alone. In 2024, our union also lost Brother Ronald Silver II and Brother Timothy Cartwell. They were both sanitation workers for Baltimore City’s Department of Public Works, and both died from preventable incidents while on the job.

We know there are dangers that come with our professions, but the glaring truth is that for too long, Maryland’s public employers have failed to make the health and safety of their employees a priority. Public sector workers in Maryland consistently face more than double the rates of occupational injuries and illnesses of their private sector counterparts, 5.4 cases compared to 2.3 cases per 100 full-time workers, respectively.
But for the first time, my fellow union members and I have some hope.
This year, our union was successful in passing the Davis Martinez Public Employee Safety and Health Act, sponsored by Sen. Ben Kramer (D-Montgomery) and Del. Jared Solomon (D-Montgomery). This legislation marks a critical turning point in our fight for safe and healthy workplaces.
For years, Maryland law has failed to hold public sector employers accountable for violating workplace safety standards. While private sector employers can face financial penalties, public sector employers are simply given a slap on the wrist, even though our safety is entrusted to them from the moment we clock in. The Davis Martinez Act changes that.
This important legislation will hold all public employers accountable for the safety of their workers and add in financial consequences for failing to protect employees. With the Davis Martinez Act, Maryland will now become only the third state in the nation — joining New York and California — to require a Workplace Violence Prevention standard that covers the entire public sector.
On this Workers’ Memorial Day, a day where we remember those who have lost their lives or been injured or made sick on the job, I can’t help but reflect on the lives that could have been saved had our public sector employers been proactive in creating and enforcing policies and procedures to keep us safe on the job.
In honor of the legacies of our fallen union brothers, it’s up to us to make Maryland a state that truly values the lives, safety, and health of each and every worker. In honor of Brother Martinez, Brother Silver and Brother Cartwell, we expect every public sector employer to work collaboratively with us, the workers who keep Maryland running, to implement these key reforms in good faith, because everyone deserves to return home safely from work at the end of the day.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/DSC_0097-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-28 08:11:04.584635

Access to affordable child care is something that concerns all Vermonters, even those who do not have children.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Mirna Valerio: I Love Vermont for Its Mountains — and Its Commitment to Child Care.","This commentary is by Mirna Valerio. She is a Winooski-based ultrarunner, advocate for the outdoors and author of the book “A Beautiful Work in Progress.” As an athlete and advocate for the outdoors, I was attracted to Vermont’s incredible mountains, its stewardship of natural resources, its quirky downtowns with local bookstores and cafes, rural landscapes with farm stands and fresh zucchini…lots and lots of zucchini. But the primary reason for choosing to settle my family in the Green Mountain State was because of its values — including its commitment to progress on child care. Vermont is full of hardy folk who take action for the benefit of their community. Because of the hard work of over 40,000 Vermonters, our state has become a national leader on child care. Act 76 — the 2023 law that provides desperately-needed, long-term funding for accessible and affordable child care — has emerged as one of the most transformative actions on child care at the state-level. Access to affordable child care is something that concerns all Vermonters, even those who do not have children. My son is already a junior in college, and neither of us would be where we are today without having had access to affordable, quality child care.I taught in day and boarding schools for 18 years, working within 24/7 schedules. I often had to be at school very early and tended to students in the dorm until fairly late at night, all while attending graduate school and teaching privately on the weekends. Access to quality child care and a trusted professional educator who cared for and loved my son allowed me to focus on taking care of my family and my career. Miss Barbara, who ran a child care program in her home, had a background in early childhood education and used several different curricula to teach the children in her program. My son loved going to Miss Barbara’s — he enjoyed playing and learning with the other children, the guided walks outside, and her delicious homemade food! Meanwhile, with Ms. Barbara’s care and teachings, his language and communication improved vastly, as did his social skills and physical development.Early childhood educators (ECEs) are professionals with specialized knowledge and training. The only way to bolster a diverse, well-prepared, and well-supported ECE workforce is with professional compensation and respect for the essential work they do to help care for and educate our children. And there are many Vermont families with young children who would and could benefit from more robust child care options. Access to affordable and professional child care empowers parents to participate in the economy. It allows them to be fully present in their workplaces. And, when we are less worried and anxious about where our children will be during the day, we have more time to dream, to create businesses that contribute to the economy and livelihood of our state. Our children experience the benefits of having parents and caregivers who have the time and freedom to work. When we invest in common-sense solutions that support families and our economy, we keep people and businesses in our Green Mountain State. Public investment in child care does just that.The 2025 legislative session has big implications for child care. As lawmakers in Montpelier make critical state funding decisions, they need to hear from us that child care is an absolute priority for Vermonters. Our state representatives and senators have an opportunity to build on a solution that’s working. Doing so would increase access and lower costs for child care while supporting our workforce and preparing our youngest children for school.I love our state. I love that my job lets me experience so much of it and share it with others. Neither my son nor I would be where we are today without the luck we had in accessing quality early education. So, let’s build a Vermont where it’s not just about luck but, instead, about our values and creating a community where we can all thrive — and that all starts with access to quality, affordable child care.

Twelve states are suing President Donald Trump and officials in his administration over tariffs that have touched nearly all goods imported into the United States.
The suit, State of Oregon, et al., v. Trump, et al., was filed last week by Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield and 11 other Democratic state attorneys general in the Court of International Trade in New York. It names Trump, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and its leader, Kristi Noem, and U.S. Customs and Border Patrol and its leader, Peter Flores.
The attorneys general — from Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Oregon and Vermont — are challenging four of Trump’s executive orders that have added a 145% tariff on most imports from China, a 25% tariff on most imports from Canada and Mexico, and a 10% tariff on most all other goods imported to the U.S. The suit also preemptively challenges Trump’s plan to raise tariffs on imports from more than 40 other countries on July 9, according to a news release from the Oregon Attorney General’s Office.
“​​We cannot sit quietly while the president takes actions that are going to cost us jobs, increase the prices that we pay, and harm our economy,” Rayfield told reporters Wednesday at a news conference held at the Oregon Department of Justice in Portland.
Experts estimate tariffs could raise the cost of living for the average family nationwide by more than $3,800 a year, according to a report from the Budget Lab at Yale University.
Rayfield and the other attorneys general argue Trump is unlawfully using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose tariffs that are, under Article I of the U.S. Constitution, powers granted only to Congress, not the executive branch. The 1977 Emergency Economic Powers Act gives the president broad latitude on financial regulation and foreign policy if a national emergency, described as an “unusual and extraordinary threat,” is declared.
The attorneys general argue no such threat exists, and that no president before Trump has imposed tariffs based on the Emergency Economic Powers Act.
“Congress has the sole authority to set tariff policy,” Rayfield said. “Congress has enacted various laws that allow the president to implement tariffs under certain conditions, but most importantly, certain safeguards. And it’s these conditions and safeguards that the president doesn’t like.”
Employment fears
Rayfield was joined by state Rep. Daniel Nguyễn, D-Lake Oswego, and co-founder of Portland-based Bambuza Vietnam Kitchen; Pat Hubbell, owner of Brooklyn Pharmacy in Portland; Graham Trainor, president of Oregon AFL-CIO, a federation of more than 300,000 unionized Oregonians working in construction, education, health care and manufacturing; Todd Nelson, co-owner of Bountiful Farms in Woodburn; Cody Sullivan, the first person with Down syndrome to graduate with a four-year degree from an Oregon college, and Ann Donaca, Sullivan’s aide and a retired educator.
Nguyễn said Bambuza, like all businesses, is struggling to deal with the economic insecurity wrought by the tariffs. He said the business has stocked many of its Vietnamese imports, such as rice paper, rice noodles and coffee, but he knows they will not last long.
“This survival mentality might save an individual business in a pinch, but it can’t be sustained, and it can be devastating for our broader economy,” he said.
Trainor said Trump’s erratic use of tariffs lacks a clear strategy, making them detrimental rather than beneficial for workers. He said many union members are “wondering if their jobs will still exist tomorrow.”
“What we need is a comprehensive trade policy that puts workers first,” he said. “That means targeting unfair trade practices, investing in domestic industries and ensuring that tariffs are used strategically, not just as political weapons.”
Sullivan has been applying for jobs unsuccessfully for three years. Donaca said that’s only going to get harder in an economy where hiring slows altogether due to economic uncertainty.
Feeling the pain
Both Oregon Democratic Gov. Tina Kotek and Oregon U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat, held roundtables recently with small- and medium- business owners to discuss the impact of tariffs.
Business leaders told Kotek April 16 they were frustrated at the speed and inconsistency with which tariffs are being issued, and some said their businesses might not survive if tariffs continue for much longer.
“We believe manufacturers our size are going to go under,” Emma Mcilroy, CEO of Portland-based clothing company Wildfang, told Kotek.
Oregon’s state economist, Carl Riccadonna, joined Kotek’s roundtable discussion. He has encouraged business owners to take a survey from Business Oregon, the state’s economic development agency, so it can gather more information about tariff impacts.
Riccadonna said the full impact of tariffs on Oregon’s economy — measured by growth of new or existing businesses, increases in hiring and decreases in inflation — likely won’t be known until mid-summer.
At a roundtable with businesses held at the Port of Portland Monday, Wyden said he and Kentucky U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, a Republican, would introduce legislation to end Trump’s tariffs as early as this week.
Wyden described it as “one of the most important matters I’ve ever been involved with in my entire life.”
“I think the stakes are that high,” he said.

Photo by Madison McVan/Minnesota Reformer.Los Angeles pediatrician and urgent care specialist Dr. Ilan Shapiro worries for his chronically ill patients as he watches Congress weigh significant cuts to Medicaid.
He thinks of a boy who, before finding Shapiro’s clinic, was in and out of emergency rooms and intensive care units because of severe asthma attacks, instead of competing in soccer games and studying for exams. The boy’s parents were losing hours and pay at work with the frequent ER visits.
Shapiro, who is Latino, works at a federally qualified health care center, a clinic for low-income patients. Most of his patients are people of color on Medicaid, and roughly a quarter of them are children.
Research shows Latino and Black family physicians are more likely to see Medicaid patients compared with their white and Asian counterparts. Experts say the Medicaid cuts Congress is weighing would strap health care centers that rely on already-low Medicaid reimbursements, disproportionately affecting communities of color and the physicians they rely on.



It’s not just health insurance. It’s a lifeline for the entire family that could be severely impacted.


– Dr. Ilan Shapiro



Of the 72 million people covered by Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program for people with low incomes or disabilities, more than half are people of color, with Black and Hispanic people disproportionately represented on the rolls.
Black and Hispanic patients have a higher risk of conditions such as high blood pressure, kidney disease and certain cancers, making health care access crucial.
Congressional Republicans are considering $880 billion in cuts to federal Medicaid spending to offset trillions in tax cuts proposed by President Donald Trump. Conservatives have long argued that Medicaid is too expensive. They assert its expansion under the Affordable Care Act to more working adults has diverted too much money toward nondisabled people, taking resources away from vulnerable populations the program was originally intended to help.
But clinicians and policy analysts say the federal Medicaid cuts could have an especially detrimental impact on vulnerable enrollees, including children, older adults and people with disabilities or chronic illnesses, as states are forced to find savings to fill the gap.

One GOP proposal targeting Medicaid expansion could lead to reductions in children’s health insurance programs, according to a February report by the Urban Institute. The think tank estimates that proposed cuts to federal Medicaid expansion spending could increase the number of uninsured kids by 11.8%.
“I’m deeply afraid,” said Shapiro. “It’s not just health insurance. It’s a lifeline for the entire family that could be severely impacted.”
Bias and language barriers 
Just 6% of U.S. physicians are Latino and 5% are Black, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges.
Sustaining the relatively few medical practices with Black and Hispanic providers is important amid evidence that racial bias, lack of access to culturally competent care and language barriers lead to poorer health outcomes or access.
For example, analyses have shown Black patients are less likely to be prescribed pain medication, and some clinicians hold false ideas that Black patients have a higher pain tolerance. Nearly 1 in 3 Black, Hispanic and multiracial women reported mistreatment in medical settings during pregnancy and delivery, such as receiving no help when asking for it or being shouted at, according to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study.
Language barriers, which Latino communities are more likely to face, are also associated with poorer health or limited access to health care.

“We understand the language and cultural concordance and the improved outcomes,” said Dr. Linda Mirdamadi, an adjunct clinical assistant professor at the University of Southern California’s Keck School of Medicine who serves on the National Hispanic Medical Association’s board of directors. “There’s a sense of trust.”
Mirdamadi said federal cuts to Medicaid would lead to loss of preventive care for her large, diverse community.
“If they don’t have access to health care, they’re not going to have the access to chronic disease prevention, to vaccines, to cancer prevention screening,” she said. “It is going to just increase the disparity gaps that already exist.”
‘Ripple effect’ 
Dr. Roger Mitchell, president-elect of the National Medical Association, which represents Black physicians, said a widespread loss of Medicaid coverage would affect everybody, even people with private insurance. People without health coverage often don’t have primary doctors and forgo preventive care, resulting in more trips to the emergency room. That can lead to longer wait times at ERs for everyone, regardless of their health insurance.
Mitchell also pointed out that Medicaid reimbursements are a major funding stream for hospitals and clinics that see a lot of enrollees. Without that money, many of those providers might be forced to scale back their services or close.
“The ripple effect is enormous,” said Mitchell, who heads Howard University Hospital in Washington, D.C., where about 40% of patients are covered by Medicaid. “This is an issue that’s not just affecting one portion of the U.S. populace, but all of us, and has the potential to have huge harm.”

Dr. Zita Magloire is a family physician, but she also offers obstetric care along with two OB-GYNs at Cairo Medical Care in the south Georgia city of Cairo. The city is the county seat of Grady County, which has about 26,000 residents, almost 30% of whom are Black.
Her practice is one of the few in the area that takes Medicaid for obstetric care, she noted, and serves many Central American immigrant patients who drive from the surrounding rural areas to her clinic. When another practice in the area started cutting services, her center absorbed those patients.
“There’s not a lot of providers that accept Medicaid,” she said. “What does that look like? Well, they [patients] show up with no prenatal care — and then, you have very high-risk patients.”
Back in Los Angeles, the boy whose family found Shapiro’s clinic is now a teenager. He received stable asthma care there and got Medicaid coverage.
“He started having a medical home. Everything changed. The ER visits and the intensive care unit visits changed to soccer games,” Shapiro said. Having coverage, he continued, “makes a huge impact for the entire community.”

On Thursday, April 17, a 20-year-old boy, a student, walked around FSU’s sunny campus, firing a handgun. Two dead; six injured.
The response from our elected leaders? The usual: “Thoughts and prayers.”
The governor of the State of Florida said he was “praying,” adding, “We are all Seminoles today.”
First Lady Casey DeSantis: “Praying.”
Sen. Rick Scott: Also “praying.”
The president of the United States called the attack “terrible, a shame,” then blew off any suggestion of gun control reform, saying he’s a “big advocate of the Second Amendment.”
Maybe he missed the praying memo.
I teach at FSU; and that Thursday afternoon, I was locked down in my office.
It was frightening, yes; it was also horribly familiar. This is America: Sandy Hook, Virginia Tech, Columbine, Uvalde, Nashville, Parkland.
The Tallahassee Democrat reported that several survivors of the 2018 Marjorie Stoneman Douglas shooting were on campus that day.
Robbie Alhadeff’s sister Alyssa died at MSD: “Something has to change,” he said.
Graduate student Stephanie Horowitz saw people running and knew instantly what was happening.
Jason Leavy was a freshman at MSD when Nikolas Cruz murdered 17 people. He knew, too, and started barricading his classroom door.
 “It’s the least surprising thing in the world, honestly,” he said.
Every one of those kids has been through multiple active shooter drills. Many faculty have, too.
We are supposed to shove desks against our doors, turn off the lights, “harden” our schools and churches and college campuses and act as though we’re grateful when politicians express their insincere and frankly insulting “sympathy.”
Nobody wants their feeble prayers and, as for their thoughts, if the violence-loving reactionaries in charge of this state were actually capable of thoughts they’d realize things do not have to be this way.
 Priorities
From the state Capitol to the U.S. Capitol, politicians shrug: Guns matter more than people; children, high school students, college students — they don’t give the big money to political campaigns.
The Second Amendment trumps all the others.
We’re supposed to accept there’s nothing anyone can do: This is just the way things are.
As The Onion’s evergreen mass shooting headline goes, “‘No Way to Prevent This,’ Says Only Nation Where This Regularly Happens.”
But the kids ain’t all right; the kids are scared — and furious.

Last Tuesday, a group of FSU students braved the morally noxious fumes of the Capitol to demand sensible gun control, red flag laws, firearm storage legislation — commonsense stuff like that.
Madalyn Probst, president of the FSU College Democrats, said, “The fact that they are able to sit in this place and prioritize weapons over my life, my friends’ lives, and the lives of my community around me is deplorable.”
Problem is, the grown folks in charge don’t care.










“The fact that they are able to sit in this place and prioritize weapons over my life, my friends’ lives, and the lives of my community around me is deplorable.”


– Madalyn Probst, FSU College Democrats


The Florida House has approved a bill allowing 18-year-olds to buy guns, repealing a law they passed after the murders at Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School.
We don’t let them drink, but hell, they can get themselves a nice Taurus 9mm semi-automatic handgun — just like the one used to kill three and wound five at Michigan State University in 2023.
Here at FSU, you can still see the mountains of flowers and teddy bears where the wounded and dead fell. Yet the governor — who has the emotional intelligence of a poison dart frog —continues to push what he calls “Second Amendment Summer.”
If you’re buying a gun or ammo between Memorial Day and the Fourth of July, you don’t have to pay sales tax.
Because we want more people packing heat.
‘Protecting’ children
The FSU atrocity was Florida’s sixth mass shooting and the 27th school shooting in the nation.
This year. So far.
The grown folks in charge are obsessed with “protecting” children from fluoride and potentially life-saving vaccines.
No letting them near books like “And Tango Makes Three,” lest they want to become gay.
No letting them discover trans people and queer people are real and deserving of dignity.
They can’t stand the thought of high schoolers reading Toni Morrison’s “Beloved” or “The 1619 Project,” lest they learn about the horrors of slavery.
They are terrified college students might study sociology, delve into political theories suggesting organizational models for the state that don’t insist our version of rapacious capitalism is the best, or encounter books that challenge religious or cultural orthodoxies.
As for sex, they don’t even want to think about it — unless, of course, the teenaged daughter gets pregnant or the teenaged son gets an STD.
They insist on shielding kids from a slew of normal human realities, but not gun violence.
It’s OK for young people to grow up knowing how to barricade themselves inside a classroom or learn strategies for evading a mass shooter but not appreciate poetry or play a musical instrument or master a foreign language.
It’s OK for them to live scared of that loner kid or that angry-looking guy or some person they can’t see, someone who wants to spill as much blood as possible.
The freedom to get a gun any time for any reason is more important.
So, we have Sandy Hook, Virginia Tech, Columbine, Uvalde, Nashville, Parkland, and now FSU.

One of my students reminded me there was supposed to be a “United Against Hate” symposium in honor of Maura Binkley on April 17.
Maura Binkley was the student shot and killed at a yoga studio in 2018 along with another woman.
The symposium was to promote campus safety, but it had to be canceled.
The FSU building where it should have taken place was a crime scene.
Maura Binkley was murdered by a guy who hated women.
The young man who allegedly walked around campus shooting his classmates hates people of color — he’s a Trump supporter and a white supremacist.
He told a fellow student Black people were ruining his neighborhood.
The United States government manufactures hatred against anyone who’s not a white Christian, embracing violence against its citizens.
Nowhere is safe.

It’s hard to believe we might throw away hundreds of millions of dollars trying to salvage 100-year-old prisons in deep disrepair. These facilities are dangerous for the people living and working inside. The only safe and affordable option is to close them once and for all.
In February 2025, the Minnesota Office of the Ombuds for Corrections released an urgent update to its 2024 report on the state of Minnesota correctional facilities. Both reports paint a dire picture for two of the state’s prisons in Stillwater and St. Cloud, which together house around 2,300 individuals: these prisons are crumbling.
Moreover, as these prisons continue to deteriorate, our state’s prison population is growing. According to a recent report by the Crime and Justice Institute — a nonpartisan nonprofit organization that partners with jurisdictions nationwide to improve justice systems — Minnesota’s prison population has been rising faster than in other states since the pandemic. From 2021 to 2022, our incarceration rate grew by 8% compared to just 2% nationally, for instance. 
The human cost of the increasingly crowded prisons and their disrepair is devastating. In an op-ed last year, Maurice L. Ward—CEO of Justice Impacted Individuals Voting Effectively — described his experience in the Stillwater prison as “living in a coffin but not buried underground,” where the temperature inside felt like “120 degrees.” Folks inside have been moved to create powerful art, tell important stories and stage peaceful demonstrations to illustrate the inhumanity of such conditions. This alone should be enough to reconsider the future of these facilities.
But it gets worse. The old-fashioned layout of these facilities — with stacked cells — reduces corrections officers’ line of sight, creating additional safety risks in an already dangerous environment where lockdowns can, and do, emerge at a moment’s notice. 
Additionally, the financial cost of facility maintenance is massive: The Department of Corrections estimates operating the correctional facilities in both Stillwater and St. Cloud costs almost $100 million, while the cost of urgent repairs at just St. Cloud is an estimated $71 million. We’re talking about nearly $200 million just for business as usual, which still leaves the people living and working in these facilities in danger. 
Once you factor in the amount of work required to address the long-term infrastructure issues, this price tag skyrockets. Standing water, falling bricks, leaky roofs, plumbing problems, and excessive heat during the warmer months make living and working at these prisons inhumane. A 2014 study to replace the St. Cloud facility projected a cost that amounts to an estimated $730 million in today’s dollars. Should we spend this much to replace just one of these crumbling prisons? The DOC itself calls this “the epitome of throwing good money after bad.”
Minnesota lawmakers know the importance of an individual’s successful reentry after incarceration, as evidenced by the passage of recent laws that incentivize participation in prison programming for those in custody, like substance abuse disorder treatment, medical and mental health services, and vocational, career and education training. This programming is impossible in crumbling facilities lacking usable spaces.
We understand that breaking the law and causing significant harm to people, property and society requires accountability. We ask Minnesotans to imagine what accountability mechanisms will be possible if we invest in the human potential of those who live and work inside these facilities. 
As statewide decision-makers consider long-term solutions, the economic and human costs of addressing the issues in Stillwater and St. Cloud mount daily. We can spend hundreds of millions of dollars trying to fix or replace these unfixable prisons, or we can take that money and build a plan that keeps communities safe and uplifts the humanity of every resident. The Minnesota Justice Research Center joins the chorus of people urging the immediate decommissioning of these prisons.

We’ll view powerful pieces in the SEEN exhibit, hear from the Office of Ombuds for Corrections and CJI about their reports, discuss what we know, and work together to reimagine the future of these facilities — because we don’t have another option.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/barbed-wire.jpg,,,2025-04-28 07:05:32.612611

Ed Charbonneau talks to colleagues late Thursday, April 24, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Controversial language targeting homeless Hoosiers, regulating marijuana-like products and cracking down on illicit massage parlors perished late Thursday — even as Indiana lawmakers crammed changes to a new property tax reform package into an unrelated agency bill to end the session.
And despite big health care reform talk, few fixes survived a breakneck session marked by a dismal revenue forecast.
 Three things on our list that didn’t make the cut, and one that did

The time of death was 10:12 p.m.
That’s when House Speaker Todd Huston announced a package of technical corrections would be the last to make it through a critical procedural step.
Community advocates celebrated the defeat of shuffled-around language they maintained would have criminalized homelessness. Sleeping or sheltering on government property would’ve been a Class C misdemeanor.

One version would have required local law enforcement to consider emergency detention, offer transportation to temporary shelter and contact crisis intervention specialists before making an arrest — an attempt to connect homeless Hoosiers to help, supporters maintained.
But the original, long-dead bill only provided a legal defense: no nearby shelter. It was the work of the Cicero Institute, a Texas think tank pushing such policies around the country.
“In these times of economic volatility, the most vulnerable Hoosiers and the community organizations who serve them can sleep a little better knowing their elected officials chose not to force local law enforcement to fine and jail people just for not being able to afford a place to lay their heads,” Prosperity Indiana policy head Andrew Bradley wrote in an early Friday news release. His organization was among the proposal’s fiercest opponents. 
Some lawmakers joined in, too. 
“I worked hard to ensure this legislation never became law,” Sen. Ron Alting, R-Lafayette, said in an early Friday statement. “The solution to homelessness is not incarceration.”
The General Assembly also snuffed out a contentious set of regulations for marijuana-like products, after seven rounds of substantial edits failed to ease concerns.
Products with legally low concentrations of delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol have proliferated in Indiana, alongside those containing delta-8 THC and other isomers. Although lawmakers have repeatedly failed to regulate the nascent industry, they seemed poised to do so this session through Senate Bill 478.

But it never emerged from closed-door negotiations over a final version. Critics, including Indiana’s attorney general and anti-marijuana groups, maintained the language would expand existing loopholes instead of closing them.
“I just think we couldn’t get to a place of agreement, you know?” Huston told reporters early Friday. “… I just don’t think we were ready yet.”
Senate President Pro Tempore Rodric Bray said it was “tricky” to “get it absolutely right,” adding, “We just wanted to be certain that we didn’t move forward in a way that wasn’t in the state’s best interest.”
Lawmakers had hoped to “get some small piece of that across the line,” like a 21-plus age restriction, he told reporters, but “ran out of time.” He cited young children who may rely on cannabidiol, a non-psychoactive anticonvulsant, to treat seizures.
“We’ll come back, I can promise you, next year, and get something passed,” Bray said.
And one legislator’s attempt to fight human trafficking in massage parlors — following arrests in his district — was stripped out of an awareness measure.
Rep. Wendy McNamara, repeatedly dubbed the detailed regulations appended to House Enrolled Act 1416 overly “prescriptive” before cutting them. McNamara, R-Evansville, is an influential force in criminal matters and was among the co-authors.
  Sen. Mike Bohacek speaks with a colleague while the Senate is in session on Wednesday, April 23, 2025. He spent several days attempting to re-home language about massage parlors.(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
Sen. Mike Bohacek, R-Michiana Shores, vowed to find another place for it in comments to the Indiana Capital Chronicle. But he admitted defeat — for now.
“This is something I’m going to continue to work on through the summer and into the next session, so we get some good language around this,” Bohacek said on the Senate floor. “The practices that are happening there (in massage parlors) is something we need to address for human trafficking in the future.”
One concept that did cross the finish line? A ban of mysterious origin on government-supported “obscene performances.” And “any person” could seek injunctive relief.
Indiana already has detailed obscenity laws on the books, and no one gave any examples of problematic performances being paid for by government. 
It was first spliced into legislation cracking down on child sex abuse materials, with the lawsuit provision inserted on the House floor. Then, as the end of session loomed, it was wedged into House Enrolled Act 1014, which previously focused on misdemeanors.
“Your shoulders have to be really aching from all the water that you’re carrying on this bill,” Sen. Rodney Pol, D-Chesterton, told sponsor Sen. Sue Glick, R-LaGrange.
He and other opponents feared the language would have little practical effect, instead “chilling” activities some simply may “disagree with” and putting local governments at legal risk.
 Trailer language walks back pieces of property tax legislation

Republicans also made eleventh-hour changes to a Department of Local Government and Finance (DLGF) measure, baking in trailer language to a contentious property tax bill that passed — and was signed into law — a week prior.
The final version of House Enrolled Act 1427 approved by the House and Senate in the last hours of the session deletes an increase in the business personal property tax exemption for 2025 that was previously approved in Senate Enrolled Act 1. Instead of jumping to $1 million in 2025, the exemption will remain at the $80,000 in current law and rise to $2,000,000 starting with the 2026 assessment date and beyond.
“One of my biggest concerns with our initiatives this year was the movement with business personal property tax, and I know that the $2 million exemption is for the 2026 assessment,” said Rep. Chris Jeter, R-Fishers, hours before the end of session. He discussed the trailer language, briefly, in the House Rules Committee.
“What I’m hoping for, as we get closer to that point in time, is we’re going to take a real hard look and get some local runs to see what that looks like for our local communities,” he continued. “My district is very heavily reliant on business personal property. This is kicked down the road a little bit, so we can’t really see a lot of trouble in the runs now. But going forward, as we get closer … I would hope that we would be able to talk about what those runs look like as we narrow in on that time.”
Indiana Senate sends finalized local property, income tax plan to governor

The property tax legislation already sign by the governor also created an exception to allow certain new depreciable personal property placed in service after Jan. 1 to avoid the 30% minimum depreciation floor. The trailer bill walked that language back “if property tax revenue that is attributable to the depreciable personal property is pledged as payment for bonds ,leases, or other obligations.”
Under House Enrolled Act 1427, the agricultural base rate in Senate Enrolled Act 1 additionally will not apply for the January 2025 assessment date for land that is considered “inventory.”
Another part of the legislation deals with disabled veterans. Although Senate Enrolled Act 1 repealed traditional property tax deductions for veterans and replaced them with local credits, trailer language repeals those new local credits and reinstates the traditional veteran deductions that existed previously.
Huston maintained early Friday that post-passage changes to Senate Enrolled Act 1 weren’t the result of a rushed legislative process on property tax reforms.
“One of the reasons we wanted to move (Senate Enrolled Act 1) was to continue to get that feedback — and we’re glad we got the feedback around the business personal property tax. We still have the long-term vision of it. We just want to make sure in those areas where it’s being bonded against, those bonds are protected,” he said. “And then on the veterans credit, I think there’s a little miscommunication with what the policy is, and with the veterans organizations. We want to make sure we’re listening to their concerns and adjust to it, and we’ll have that conversation again next year. I imagine it was probably not the last time we’ll talk about that topic.”
But Senate Democrat leader Sen. Shelli Yoder, of Bloomington, said additions in House Enrolled Act 1427 were needed, in part, because lawmakers moved too quickly before the state’s April budget forecast was released.
“The Senate Democrat caucus has been saying to slow down. Let’s make sure we get this right. Let’s not get to a place, especially when we’ve had real concerns. But when we got that budget forecast — and all of a sudden, we’re having to do some serious back-stepping — no, this was no surprise,” she said.
“What we did quickly see is sort of wide-eyed like, ‘Oh gosh, what did we do? How are we going to fix this, and maybe slow down the rollout?'” Yoder added, referring to Senate Enrolled Act 1. “But again, no matter you know how you spin it, it was kind of a bait and switch. It was a shell game for Hoosiers. You know, here’s property tax relief that never really came as relief.”
 What about health care?

After years of targeting Indiana’s health care prices, Indiana lawmakers started the session by introducing several comprehensive reforms — but where did they end?
Many new laws will follow in the footsteps of their predecessors by requiring more reporting and transparency. Whether it’s the 340B drug program, the average cost of hospital services or disclosing ownership ties, health care providers across the spectrum will have more paperwork in their future. 
One of the biggest packages was reversed after the initial effort was criticized for setting “price caps” on five nonprofit hospital systems. Violators would lose their tax-exempt status with the state. 
Now, such a move wouldn’t occur until 2029 at the earliest, following a state-sponsored study to determine average prices. Numerous studies have already done such analysis only to be dismissed for being slanted to one side of the debate or another. Authors hope that having a state agency perform the calculations will bring clarity. 
 
A long-sought tax: 
For years, health care advocates have sought an increase to the state’s cigarette tax, notching a win this session after a grim financial forecast. Cigarettes will now be $2 more expensive, with proportional increases for other forms of tobacco. 
“We have to have a healthier Indiana. We have to have people that are healthier,” said House Speaker Todd Huston about the tax increase. “This is something that I think will have long, long-term impacts for helping people make positive choices.”


One particular disappointment for health advocates was the decision to slash funding for local public health departments from $100 million annually to $40 million. 
“Indiana has had abysmal health care rankings over the years … that was the whole idea of finally putting some money behind doing something,” said House Minority Leader Phil GiaQuinta. “ Now just to basically take the rug out is, I think, just not the way to go.”
But Bray rejected the notion that such a cut undid that previous work. 
“Absolutely, unequivocally, no,” he said. “If you look across the counties of the state, there was about 45% of those funds that went unspent. Not because they weren’t using it correctly or anything, but because they were … rolling out program and trying to develop them.
“Everybody’s left this budget wanting a little bit more,” he continued. “But this still continues to fund public health projects. And it is our hope that in a couple years, we’ll be able to fund that at a stronger level.”
Another big strike to the state’s overall health: curbing enrollment on Indiana’s Medicaid expansion program. The Healthy Indiana Plan serves low- to moderate-income Hoosiers and, like similar programs across the country, has increased access to preventative care services and decreased emergency department visits — though such progress could be derailed if a significant number of Hoosiers lose their health care coverage. 
Gov. Mike Braun indicated his support for many of the measures above, naming health care as one of his core targets ahead of the 2025 session.  But he said that there was more work to be done.
“I think we got a good start on it,” Braun told reporters on Thursday. “I think health care will be a big agenda item for next year.”

(Getty Images)April is National Reentry Month — a time to reflect on what it truly takes for someone to come home, rebuild their life, and thrive. Much attention has been given to immediate needs like employment and housing. But even beyond these basic services, the road to reintegration demands something deeper: attention to mental health and the space for personal healing.
I grew up in Louisiana, where digging in the dumpster for food wasn’t just a phrase — it was my reality. Watching my mother work miracles with what little we had shaped my worldview. From those beginnings through military service, a PhD at NYU, and medical school at Tulane, I’ve learned a powerful truth: transformation begins when opportunity meets mental resilience.
Now, as a Triple Board Resident specializing in Pediatrics, General Psychiatry, and Child and Adolescent Psychiatry — and as the leader of the Inner Words: Empowering Justice-Involved Individuals Through Identity-Based Mental Health Therapeutic Conversations program — I see daily how mental health support can rewrite futures. From juvenile detention centers to adult facilities across Indiana, we’re witnessing something powerful: when people are given the tools to understand their emotions and build resilience, they begin to reclaim control over their lives.
The evidence of transformation is clear. During our five-week program, we’ve seen individuals — some facing serious charges — develop emotional regulation skills and new perspectives on conflict resolution.
FSSA launches pilot mental health program in jails

One young girl, once quick to fight when tensions rose, had a moment of clarity. She said, “I used to fight other people because I had an issue with someone, but now I’m thinking, why do I do that? There’s no need for me to fight anyone anymore.” Her words are a testament to a simple truth: when young people are taught to pause and reflect, they discover new paths forward.
This transformation isn’t accidental. It results from creating psychological safety, encouraging deeper reflection, and establishing community guidelines—ones that include the grace to mess up, the introspection to apologize, and the respect to hear each other out. We teach that emotions like anger are normal. What matters is how we choose to respond.
Justice-involved individuals are no different from others in their potential, but the difference in their lived experiences is often stark. Many come from environments lacking access to healthy food, quality education, and safe spaces. The path to reducing recidivism must address these root causes while also building mental resilience.
Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield’s Road to Reentry program has stepped forward to support this vital work. Their investment allows us to expand Inner Words Empower to three adult correctional facilities in Indiana — Heritage Trail, Pendleton, and Plainfield — while continuing year-round sessions at the Public Advocates in Community re-Entry (PACE) Center.
Anthem also partners with organizations like Thomas Ridley’s 1 Like Me, which helps remove practical barriers to reentry, such as driver’s license reinstatement. Their Hope Hustler Outreach Program has helped more than 2,000 individuals regain their licenses removing this significant barrier to employment and independence.
These partnerships and investments recognize that successful reentry requires a comprehensive approach—meeting practical needs while nurturing mental health and personal development. This hope isn’t naive optimism—it’s grounded in evidence that trauma-informed, cognitively focused interventions work. By combining support services with emotional resilience building, we’re creating a framework for lasting change.
Whether it’s a young person in detention, an adult navigating Department of Correction systems, or someone rebuilding their life through reentry support at PACE, each story of transformation ripples outward. Each success brings us one step closer to a compassionate and just society we all deserve.

A few weeks after the birth, the two were temporarily separated. Hailey poses for a portrait after being temporarily reunited with her daughter on April 1 in Cuba. Asked what she misses most, Hailey replied: “Her smiling” (Anna Spoerre/Missouri Independent).CUBA, Mo. — Hailey cradled her cat like a baby and nuzzled his fur. It wasn’t long before he rejected the attention and leapt from her arms in the callous way cats do. She cursed him in the way hormonal teenagers do.
Ash, a gray stray Hailey took in against her great-aunt’s protesting, became the teen’s comfort through a pregnancy and postpartum that spanned 10 foster homes, hospitals and group homes across Missouri. 
Hailey entered the state foster system at 2 years old. She’s lost count of how many roofs she’s slept under. 
Last spring at 15 years old, Hailey learned she was pregnant.
When she asked the state for an abortion, Hailey was told the possibility wasn’t up for discussion. By the time her stomach started to bulge, Missourians voted to codify the right to abortion in the state Constitution, and Hailey decided she wanted to parent. 
But it wasn’t so simple. 
By then, Hailey was staying with her great-aunt, Jodi Spradley, but the state remained her legal guardian. Though Hailey took initiative to prepare for motherhood, caseworkers on several occasions during her pregnancy threatened to take the baby after she was born, rolling out examples from Hailey’s long history in the state’s care.
In late February, just a few weeks after Hailey turned 16, her daughter was born. The resemblance is unmistakable: vibrant red locks, pale skin and blue eyes. 
From the moment her baby girl entered the world, Hailey feared the state would take her. While that hasn’t happened permanently, the state did temporarily separate the young mother and child, moving them to different cities in different corners of the state. 
By eight weeks postpartum, Hailey had slept in two hospitals and four homes. 
Desperate to reunite her child with family as she was shuffled around the foster system, Hailey signed power of attorney of her daughter over to Spradley, to whom she also wanted to return.
In early April, after months of protesting the state’s push to move her into a faith-based maternity home, Hailey acquiesced. It allowed her to reunite with her daughter. 
A few weeks later, on the eve of a court hearing to discuss her permanent placement, Hailey ran away from the maternity home with her 6-week-old in her arms. Both were quickly found and returned to state custody. 
Hailey said she fled, in part, out of fear the state would officially declare she couldn’t live with Spradley. And she was terrified about where they might send her next. 
The family’s fate remains uncertain.










As a teen in such a vulnerable situation, she deserved to be held and surrounded by care, and instead, she was placed in this really precarious, uncertain situation.


– Stephanie Kraft Sheley, founder of Right By You


Missouri has long been one of the most anti-abortion states in the country, with elected officials and advocates preaching the virtue of supporting young mothers to ensure abortion isn’t their only option. 
But Hailey said this sentiment is a far cry from her experience. To her, it felt like the state first made the decision to continue the pregnancy for her, then actively worked to keep her from parenting her child. 
The Independent spent months following Hailey and reviewing communications between her, Spradley, their advocates and the state that spanned Hailey’s pregnancy and postpartum. 
The record of her struggles in the system illustrate what youth advocates and foster care experts say are repeated failures by the state to support Hailey, and later her daughter. 
“Hailey was saying she wanted to parent, so she should have been supported,” said Laura Sullivan, a licensed independent social worker in Ohio who has spent several months advocating for Hailey. “In these states where they’re forcing pregnancies, especially teen pregnancies, they have to be ready to help these moms to parent.”
A spokesperson for the Missouri Department of Social Services, which oversees the state foster care system, said she could not discuss the specifics of Hailey’s case, instead pointing to Missouri’s Child Welfare Manual.
 ‘Don’t get pregnant’

The Facebook message came from a stranger. 
“I have a child on my caseload who I believe is a relative to you,” an employee with a Missouri foster care agency wrote the morning of May 21, 2024. 
Within hours, the state cleared and authorized Spradley to take her niece in under a temporary arrangement. Hailey was on her doorstep by that evening.
A letter dated that same day stated that while Hailey remained in the custody of Children’s Division, she was being placed with Spradley for an “indeterminate period.” 
Though filled with gaps, the aunt and niece have a long history. Spradley used to take Hailey to the St. Louis Zoo, propping her up against the wooden railings to catch a glimpse of the animals. As Hailey got older, Spradley would take her driving around different corners of southeast Missouri to get ice cream or go to a park. 
At times they went years without seeing one another. Though another great-aunt of Hailey’s — Spradley’s sister — adopted Hailey when she was 4, Hailey spent much of her childhood shuffled between different foster homes and mental hospitals. 
 Hailey doesn’t remember her mother well, but she holds on to photos of them together in the first few years of Hailey’s life, before her mother died when she was 4 years old (Anna Spoerre/Missouri Independent).
She was a flight risk almost everywhere she went until she landed at Spradley’s.
“Don’t get pregnant,” Hailey recalled Spradley telling her when she moved in. 
A few weeks later, Hailey went to the doctor to confirm what she feared. Hailey, who only a few months earlier had turned 15, was pregnant. 
She wanted an abortion in the beginning. When Hailey asked her case worker if it was possible, she was told the state wasn’t allowed to discuss it with her. Abortion at the time remained illegal in Missouri with limited exceptions for medical emergencies.
Hailey couldn’t get up the nerve to tell Spradley she was pregnant, so she made a friend break the news instead. But Spradley didn’t kick her out. She doubled down on her desire to help.
Spradley searched the internet for answers. She sent a note to JustChoice — an agency based out of Ohio that helps people create abortion, adoption or parenting plans — saying her niece had been denied an abortion and now wanted to raise her child.
There was just one problem, Spradley said: Though months from her due date, the state was already threatening to take away Hailey’s baby. 
 ‘We’re going to remove that baby’

Sullivan, the licensed independent social worker at JustChoice, reached out to Spradley after her organization received her message in late 2024. With Spradley’s permission, she started communicating with Hailey’s case worker to talk about a parenting plan.
Sullivan recalls the case worker in their initial calls telling her: “I don’t think Hailey’s going to be able to parent. We’re going to remove that baby. Her and her aunt, this is not a stable situation; they have a long history with the agency.’” 
Most urgent, the case worker told Sullivan, was Spradley’s lack of adequate housing. If she wanted to maintain custody of Hailey through her pregnancy, she needed somewhere else to live. 
After staying with a friend in St. Louis, Spradley and Hailey moved into the home and church of a former pastor in Wright City. Some of Spradley’s friends had pointed them to the old building off a rural highway as emergency accommodations.
The house, which abutted woods and farmland, sat untouched after the pastor died months earlier.
In the main room, religious relics crowded the wall. Behind one closed door was what Hailey dubbed the “porn room,” after they found explicit images on an abandoned computer. Hailey slept upstairs beneath old posters of semi trucks plastered to the walls. 
The lack of heat became a growing concern as winter approached.
 Hailey sits on a couch across from her great-aunt, Jodi Spradley, on Jan. 2, 2025, at a house they temporarily occupied in Wright City (Anna Spoerre/Missouri Independent).
The state began talking of removing Hailey from Spradley’s care; a faith-based maternity home in the St. Louis suburbs that contracts with the state was suggested. Hailey remained adamant she didn’t want to go. When her case worker recommended she have bags packed and by the door the week of Christmas, she listened. 
But she also shut down, growing moodier as the looming threat of removal hung over the holidays.
The new year came and went. Hailey’s bags remained by the door. The state never stopped by.
Sullivan, searching for a solution, teamed up with Right By You, an “all options” nonprofit focused on helping pregnant youth, to raise money for Spradley to rent an upgraded apartment.
Within weeks, Right By You raised $5,000 — primarily through Missouri donors and abortion funds — to cover Spradley’s rent through May. Meanwhile, Sullivan worked the phones with Spradley, calling landlords in an attempt to find someone who would accept a pregnant teen, a 52-year-old on disability, two dogs and one cat.
She found a solution in Cuba, a town about 80 miles southwest of St. Louis. 
By mid-January, Hailey and Spradley were moved into a small, unadorned two-bedroom apartment.
Spradley reached out to her network of friends, asking if they could help furnish the apartment with baby essentials as a birthday surprise for Hailey, who turned 16 in late January. 
They came by the truck-load, dropping off strollers, onesies and a swing. Spradley used some of the disability back-pay she received to splurge on a crib and a bottle sanitizer.
In the end, it still wasn’t enough. 
 ‘Where are you going to live?’

Spradley didn’t take Hailey in sooner for many reasons. Poverty and poor health were the most prevailing. 
“So what’s your plan for where you are going to live?” Hailey’s case worker asked in a text to Spradley months earlier, shortly after Hailey learned she was pregnant. “Do you have any money saved?”
“I had absolutely no income when Hailey was brought to me,” Spradley replied. “Not a dime. I get SSI disability which is very little.” 
But once together, Hailey didn’t want to leave. Finally, someone understood her — a sarcastic and brash teen with a tendency to raise her voice.
“Some people would see what she’s doing and would freak out, but they don’t understand what she’s grown up and what she’s went through,” Spradley said. “That’s why I don’t judge her on that. That’s the big difference between me and other people.”
Unlike a foster parent, Spradley didn’t receive consistent financial benefits from the state for taking Hailey in. Though she attempted on several occasions to get certified as a foster parent through the state, she never received the final approval. 
Spradley suspects it’s because she’s poor and sick. 
She’s often seized by anxiety, which she said has only worsened since beginning to navigate the state’s hurdles in her attempts to help Hailey. She suffers from agoraphobia, Crohn’s disease, heart conditions and often uses a walker. 
Spradley attributed some of her ailments to growing up in Times Beach, Missouri. It’s now a ghost town, beset by a chemical contamination that came to light in the 1980s. The Environmental Protection Agency deemed it “one of the worst environmental disasters in our nation’s history.”

Hailey is as determined as her aunt. 
She enrolled in teen parenting classes through Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis as she started her second trimester. Between that and her prenatal appointments, she made weekly trips to St. Louis through her third trimester. 
Most weeks, she made the trip without Spradley, booking and boarding a van through MO HealthNet, the state’s Medicaid program. The vehicle usually picked up other patients along the way, stretching what was normally a 90-minute drive into multiple hours. 
The state on several occasions expressed concern with this arrangement, telling both Spradley and Sullivan that Hailey needed constant supervision. 
Instead, Spradley kept an eye on Hailey’s location from an app on her cell phone.
Every year, Missouri social services agencies seize millions of dollars in Social Security benefits from foster children. Hailey is among them. 
When Sullivan questioned how the state was using Hailey’s payments, which typically go toward funding foster care, she was told it was being used to pay for Medicaid expenses and the van rides.
She remains skeptical. That $400 a month could have gone a long way to help Spradley purchase furniture and buy groceries, both of which she said were held against her toward the end of Hailey’s pregnancy.
 Birth, ‘then I was out’

Days before Hailey went into labor, the state followed through on its threat. 
Hailey was removed from Spradley’s apartment in Cuba and sent to a private foster home near St. Louis. 
The foster mother, a stranger, drove her to the hospital. Once settled into a room, Hailey said the foster parent told her she was running down to the cafeteria.
Instead, she left Hailey at the hospital and never returned.
Hailey’s daughter was born two days later, on Feb. 26. The moment of joy was brief; within minutes, Hailey lost consciousness. 
“I had a whole asthma attack, then I ended up throwing up everything in my stomach, and then shaking so bad that my jaw was hurting,” she said. “Then I was out.” 
It took two blood transfusions to stem her postpartum hemorrhage.
Hailey ultimately stayed in the hospital for 12 days. Not because of her health, she said, but because the state didn’t know where else to send her.
This isn’t uncommon. In 2024, there were 314 Missouri foster children residing in hospitals. Others were held in hotels, offices and out-of-state residential treatment facilities. 
 Hailey carries her daughter into her great-aunt Jodi Spradley’s apartment on April 1 in Cuba during a day-long visit while Hailey was staying at a group home in southeast Missouri (Anna Spoerre/Missouri Independent).
While at the hospital, Hailey learned how to breastfeed. She believes her daughter shares her own lactose intolerance since she doesn’t take well to most formulas.
In many ways the two girls resemble Hailey’s mother, who was found dead in 2011, two years after Hailey had been removed from her custody. She was in the third trimester of pregnancy with a second daughter, who didn’t survive. The autopsy concluded a drug overdose. Spradley still believes it was something more nefarious.
A few months before Hailey gave birth, she asked Spradley if she could see the place where her mom died. They drove 60 miles to the apartment and asked the current tenant if they could look around. Hailey asked lots of questions. Spradley hoped it was healing.
She tries to tell Hailey stories of her mother often. Like the time Hailey’s mother, while pregnant with her, found a free mini fridge at a scrap sale and walked miles home with it. She later did the same with a kiddie pool.
Hailey doesn’t know her father. She hopes her daughter won’t, either.
The line for “father” on the birth certificate is blank, as Hailey intended. 
She says little about the 20-year-old other than that they first met at a foster home years earlier, that he beat her and that he was, for a time, homeless. 
Multiple warrants are out for his arrest, including for failure to appear in court on trespassing and theft charges.
Throughout Hailey’s pregnancy, one of Spradley’s closest friends, Brandie Coleman, was among her fiercest defenders. When Hailey gave birth, Coleman was by her side, Facetiming with Spradley, who feared the state might punish her for being there. 
As Hailey recovered from her hemorrhage, Coleman says a hospital social worker confided in her that a state case worker had been trying to convince her to report Hailey to child protective services so they could remove her baby. But Coleman says the hospital employee refused, not seeing any evidence of abuse or neglect. 
Stephanie Kraft Sheley, founder of Right By You, the Missouri-based reproductive rights group that helped fundraise for Hailey and Spradley, said the family’s self-advocacy was admirable. 
And in a way, she believes, they were punished for it.
She called Hailey’s case “such a blatant example of a pregnancy literally forced by the state, and then a very clear bias against this person and this notion that her child would be better off with a different family, and she was told that explicitly. And I just honestly was a little bit surprised how unveiled that was. There wasn’t really any pretense about it.” 
 Stephanie Kraft Sheley, founder of Right By You, called Hailey a “forceful self advocate,” adding: “It’s really admirable for someone so young, who’s in such a disempowered situation” (Anna Spoerre/Missouri Independent).
Kraft Sheley, who is also an attorney, said the fact that Hailey had a family member who wanted to take her in — who understood her — was huge. That Hailey was deprived of that support in the days leading up to and after her labor was “such inhumanity.”
“For any person to lose their home and be ripped away from their loved one within three days, four days of giving birth, one of the most formative, transformational experiences of a person’s life, she was treated with such a lack of care,” Kraft Sheley said. “… As a teen in such a vulnerable situation, she deserved to be held and surrounded by care, and instead, she was placed in this really precarious, uncertain situation.”
 Postpartum ‘disrupted’

When Hailey was finally discharged from the hospital, she and her baby were driven 200 miles southwest to Springfield. 
There, they were placed in a private foster home with other teen moms.
Less than a week later, Hailey called Spradley. She was being taken to a mental health hospital to be screened for postpartum depression. Hailey said she was told it was because the foster parent heard her yelling; Hailey said she was yelling at a friend on the phone, not at her baby.
“I never heard this kid cry like she did,” Spradley said of Hailey during the phone call. 
Her daughter was napping when they took Hailey away.
At the hospital, Hailey said she didn’t screen positive for postpartum depression but was diagnosed with adjustment disorder, meaning she has stronger emotional or behavioral responses to stress and trauma. 
Hailey said when she learned she was being admitted to the hospital without her daughter, she had to be sedated after she started “throwing hands” at staff. She remained there for six days. 
Spradley had little contact with Hailey in the hospital once her phone was taken away. When Hailey was released, she signed power of attorney for her daughter over to Spradley. 
As Spradley drove to pick up Hailey’s child, Hailey was taken to yet another location — this time a group home in southeast Missouri.
Hailey believes the separation from her daughter was intentional. Within the first month of her child’s life, the two had been apart nearly as much as they’d been together. 
She tried to continue pumping breast milk. At the start of her third trimester, Hailey had already started collecting small bottles of colostrum. But it didn’t take long after being separated from her daughter for her milk supply to diminish. 
 Hailey feeds her daughter while visiting her great-aunt Jodi Spradley on April 1 in Cuba (Anna Spoerre/Missouri Independent).
“For a teen mom, especially one with attachment issues like Hailey has, to be able to breastfeed successfully, that is beautiful and amazing, and could have been really healing,” Sullivan said. “But it was disrupted. So that caused both Hailey harm and (her daughter) harm.” 
Sullivan, who has also worked as a social worker in two states, said it’s easy to use a teen’s years-long history in the system against them unfairly. She doesn’t believe Missouri ever gave Hailey a fair chance. 
“Instead of being like, ‘This is a kid who we know has a lot of trauma and a lot of stuff, we should probably try to figure out how we’re going to help her parent and heal so she can be a good parent,’” Sullivan said. “‘It was just, ‘We’re on a mission to make her not be able to parent.’”
 ‘I’m not giving up on you’

On a sunny day in early April, Hailey returned to her aunt’s home in Cuba.
For the second time in a week, she held her daughter, who was one day shy of 5 weeks old.  
Hailey’s milk supply had mostly dried up. She considered attempting to breastfeed, but then opted to make a bottle instead. 
“Has she given you all the stink face yet?” Hailey asked as Spradley confirmed with a chuckle. 
“Good. That’s my child,” Hailey replied, smiling down at her daughter as she fed her.
She sat in her old room again, across from stickers adhered to the wall welcoming her baby home. She urged the dogs to be careful as they investigated her baby’s scent. She cuddled her cat.
It was all temporary.
 Hailey reunites with her daughter, then 5 weeks old, as her family’s dog, Belle, sniffs curiously, on April 1 at Hailey’s great-aunt Jodi Spradley’s apartment in Cuba (Anna Spoerre/Missouri Independent).
Hailey was back for just part of the day on an authorized off-site visit. A few hours later, Spradley would drive her 90 minutes back to the group home where Hailey would again kiss her baby goodbye.
Until then, she changed diapers, went through paperwork and sorted baby clothes, a sense of normalcy in a life that had been anything but.
As Hailey lounged on the couch with her daughter and Spradley rocked her small dog, named Baby, in the corner, Spradley’s cell phone rang. At the sight of the caller ID, an old friend of Spradley’s, Hailey perked up and grabbed for the phone to say hello.  
“You know what? I love the sound of your voice right now. You sound so happy,” Spradley’s friend said to Hailey before pausing. “Honestly, are you doing OK?” 
“Not for good, sadly,” Hailey said. “Jodi kidnapped me for the day though.” 
She outlined her plan to return permanently to her daughter. The first step was the maternity home she initially resisted. It was her only option she saw to parent.
Less than a week later she checked into the St. Louis area facility. Spradley met her in the lobby with the baby. 
The past several months have been hard on Spradley. Anxiety attacks bare themselves in the middle of the night. She worries over Hailey and her daughter. She worries over herself. When she first took in Hailey, there were days she wondered if the stress was too much and if she should send Hailey away. But now, the house feels devastatingly empty without her. 
When Hailey was 11 weeks pregnant, she snuck Ash, the cat, into the house against Spradley’s wishes. At the time it infuriated Spradley, who was already having a difficult time feeding two humans and two dogs, making frequent trips to the food pantry. Then she saw how much comfort the cat brought Hailey as she faced an unknown future.
When Hailey was taken away, Spradley started letting the cat sleep beside her at night. 
Over the years, Hailey ran from multiple family members and foster homes.
But she never ran from Spradley. It’s something Hailey’s social worker pointed out to Spradley in messages throughout Hailey’s pregnancy, and something Spradley continues to emphasize in her fight to bring Hailey and her daughter back under her roof. 
 Jodi Spradley holds Hailey’s cat, Ash, on April 1 at her apartment in Cuba (Anna Spoerre/Missouri Independent).
It’s why Spradley wasn’t shocked when she learned at Hailey’s most recent placement hearing in mid-April that she had run away from the maternity home just hours earlier. 
“I don’t believe what the system is doing to her… She is a child that’s been in that system for so long that they broke her,” Spradley said the next day, after police located Hailey and her daughter about 130 miles east, in south-central Illinois.
“Sometimes she makes me so mad,” Spradley continued, “but I just can’t blame her for what they did to her. I blame them. I blame the system.”
After Hailey and her daughter were located by the state, they were moved to another foster home, just outside St. Louis. 
A few days later, Hailey said her case worker showed up with police, insisting her daughter was underweight and needed to be evaluated at the hospital. Spradley rushed to St. Louis Children’s Hospital to meet them. There, she said doctors gave the baby a clean bill of health and noted she gained weight since the week prior.
Then on Friday, hours after the Missouri Department of Social Services responded to a request for comment on Hailey’s case from The Independent, her case worker called Spradley. The state would soon allow Hailey and her daughter to return to Spradley’s care, at least until a court made a more permanent placement decision, Spradley said.
Despite the sudden good news, nothing about the family’s situation is set in stone.
“I’m scared about what tomorrow’s going to bring,” Spradley said Sunday.
She often reflects on words she spoke to Hailey’s mother not long before she died. Hailey was in a private foster home at the time. 
“I promise you I’m going to bring Hailey home,” she said more than a decade ago.
It’s why Spradley didn’t hesitate when Hailey reached out for help. Though when asked about that decision, Hailey, who doesn’t tend toward sentimentality, said, “I knew she’d take my dumb ass.”
She flipped Spradley the bird. Spradley mirrored the motion. 
“Me and Hailey, our relationship, even when she has hardships, I’m like, ‘I’m not letting you go,’” Spradley said. “I’m not giving up on you.”
It’s why Hailey chose Spradley to help raise her daughter. 
She’s adamant her daughter won’t end up in the state’s care the way she did. 
“What they’re doing is f**ked,” Hailey said of her lifetime spent in the foster system. 
Spradley is ready to fight right there alongside her niece. 
“We want her to experience an actual caring family and have support rather than toss you aside whenever they can’t handle you,” Spradley said. “If they can’t handle you at your worst, then they don’t deserve you at your best, right?”

(Stock photo by Greenleaf123/Getty Images)A federal appeals court this week will finally hear the state’s appeal of a 2023 ruling that struck down a New Jersey law barring private companies from detaining immigrants.
Thursday’s hearing in front of the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia comes as the Trump administration carries out its mass deportation plan and prepares to open what will be the east coast’s largest immigration detention center in Newark.
Since Trump took office for his second term in January, roughly 23,000 people have been deported, according to NBC News.
In 2021, Gov. Phil Murphy signed a law that barred public and private entities from entering contracts to house immigrant detainees. The move came after years of protests by immigrant advocates who called on Democratic leaders in Bergen, Essex, and Hudson counties to sever their contracts with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which housed immigrant detainees in those counties’ jails.
CoreCivic filed a lawsuit challenging New Jersey’s law in February 2023. The company, which runs the Elizabeth Detention Center, which holds about 300 immigrant detainees, claimed the law unconstitutionally encroached on the federal government’s power. The Biden administration sided with CoreCivic, saying the law would be “catastrophic” to federal immigration efforts.
U.S. District Judge Robert Kirsch ruled partially against New Jersey, saying it can bar public entities from detaining immigrants but has no power to stop the federal government from entering contracts with private firms to house immigrant detainees. Attorneys for New Jersey appealed to the 3rd Circuit.
As the state waited for the federal panel to hear its appeal, President Donald Trump won reelection to the White House and began carrying out his mass deportation plan.
In February, private company Geo Group formally announced its plan to open a 1,000-bed immigrant detention jail in a Newark facility called Delaney Hall. The plans have faced opposition from immigrant advocates and some public officials (the city of Newark has gone to court in an attempt to halt or postpone its opening).
In March, the state Attorney General’s Office asked the 3rd Circuit to finally hear the state’s appeal, stressing that while the appeal is active, the state cannot enforce the 2021 law as it pertains to private companies. The hearing is scheduled for May 1 at 9:30 a.m.
Spokespeople for the Attorney General’s Office and for Geo Group and CoreCivic did not respond to requests for comment.

But Missouri’s situation would be genuinely strange.  Because, after all of those years spent resisting Medicaid expansion, Missouri now is unable to get rid of it (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Health insurance for impoverished adults has always been a tortuous endeavor for Missouri. 
The legislature fought for years over proposals to expand eligibility for Medicaid, the public health program financed by states and the federal government. Expansion was the subject of some of the legislature’s loudest shouting matches in the years following the 2010 passage of the federal Affordable Care Act.
Missourians finally got tired of watching other states extend health insurance to low-income residents and boast of economic benefits and better health outcomes. They went to the ballot in 2020 and got the job done with a constitutional amendment.
Cue the recriminations. All over again. 
After years of gaining public acceptance, Medicaid funding is now endangered in the U.S. Congress, where Republicans are under pressure to find big pots of money to raid in order to pay for President Donald Trump’s tax cut package.
Federal Medicaid cuts could leave Missouri with huge budget shortfall

Medicaid is a huge pot of money. And Republicans are eyeing the portion that is used to compensate the 40 states that took advantage of an Obamacare provision to expand eligibility guidelines for low-income adults. 
The federal government currently pays 90% of the expansion costs. 
Should Congress claw back that money, states in total stand to lose about $600 billion over a decade’s time, according to a recent analysis. 
Cuts like that would force all states into difficult corners. But Missouri’s situation would be genuinely strange.
Because, after all of those years spent resisting Medicaid expansion, Missouri now is unable to get rid of it.
At least not easily.
With their bickering and inaction, legislators in Missouri forfeited the chance to enact Medicaid expansion by statute, which could be amended or even repealed if the occasion demanded. 
Instead, advocates expanded Medicaid eligibility by amending the state Constitution. Their work can only be undone by passing another amendment, which would be a long, acrimonious process.
And so, for the time being, Missouri would be forced to provide coverage to working-age, low-income adults, even if the federal match shrinks or disappears.
“So you will see cuts in other places,” said Bridgett McCandless, a retired physician who ran a health clinic for uninsured patients and served as CEO of the Health Forward Foundation, which focuses on expanding healthcare access.
“The three groups that are at the greatest risk are pregnant women, children and seniors with disabilities, primarily in nursing homes,” she said. “All that will have profound generational effects.”
Other cuts that wouldn’t violate the constitutional amendment could be reimbursement costs for providers, dental care, mental health and substance use treatment and home health care. Missouri may also be forced to look at cuts outside of its Medicaid program.
Somewhere out there, a class of term-limited Republican Missouri lawmakers nods sagely and says, “told you so.”
Indeed, certain legislators did warn that the state would be on the hook if a capricious future Congress reneged on its commitment to the Medicaid expansion match. It was the most solid argument against broadening the program — much less tedious than the insinuations that the low-income Missourians who stood to gain health insurance were freeloaders and grifters.
Then-Gov. Jay Nixon, a Democrat who wanted to expand Medicaid, proposed including a safety valve in state law: If federal funding was ever cut, Missouri would roll back the expansion. 
But no law was passed, and so no safety valve. We are left to argue about whether that is good or bad.
For now, the prevailing strategy seems to be to hope we don’t have to find out.  
U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley has turned heads by declaring that he won’t support outright cuts to Medicaid, though he does favor work requirements, which would force some people out of the program.
Hawley, a former Republican Missouri attorney general, has spent all of his political career opposing Obamacare, which includes Medicaid expansion.
What swayed him, he said, was the vote on the constitutional amendment, which was 53% in favor and 46% opposed. Many supporters found that a bit close for comfort, but in an interview with RollCall, a Washington outlet, Hawley called it “a big margin.” He also said he expected Trump to oppose cuts to Medicaid.
Whether that will happen, or whether Hawley will stick to his opposition, is anyone’s guess.
What’s certain is that about 1.3 million Missourians use Medicaid or the federal Children’s Health Insurance Program. That’s about one-fifth of the state’s population. 
Of that number, about 300,000 adults have gained access to health insurance since voter-mandated expansion took effect in 2021. Medicaid has enabled them to get annual checkups, be treated for chronic conditions and undergo long-delayed surgical procedures like joint replacements.
“Once you’re on it, it works beautifully,” McCandless said.
This is the outcome that opponents most feared in the long, bitter expansion debate — that once passed, Medicaid expansion would be impossible to get rid of. 
Turns out, they may be right. Even an act of Congress may not be enough to shut it down.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/092623_mocapitol1-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-04-28 07:05:32.612611

(Ron Cogswell | used by permission of the photographer)With the 100th day of President Donald Trump’s second term in office approaching, University of Wisconsin-Madison professors and staff met Thursday to take stock of the growing threats to higher education and U.S. democracy and to discuss collective action to push back. 
UW-Madison professor Mark Copelevitch said the threats to higher education are “unprecedented because it’s happening in America” yet compared the current moment to a movie that historians and experts have seen “over and over again.” 
  Mark Copelovitch
Copelovitch described the current U.S. system of government as competitive authoritarianism. He said comparisons for what is happening today don’t have to go back to 1930s Germany — recent examples are  Viktor Orban in Hungary and Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Turkey. 
“Universities are centers of independent ideas and dissent. Professors are attacked by populist and nationalist leaders as being the radical elite,” Copelovitch said.
University of Wisconsin-Madison faculty, including Copelovitch and other professors were gathered for panels organized by the Public Representation Organization of the Faculty Senate (PROFS) and the Academic Staff Professionals Representation Organization (ASPRO) to discuss shared challenges and the prospects for collective action to defend higher education.
UW-Madison is facing an array of challenges to its operations due to the federal government as over $12 million in research grants to UW-Madison have been cut and caps on indirect cost reimbursements for research grants at 15% represent another significant cut to research funds, and dozens of students across UW campuses and other schools had their visas cancelled. Copelovitch said it is part of a greater attempt to exert influence over the shape of universities across the country.
“What’s happening at Madison [is] terrible and horrible and has real world consequences specifically here,” Copelovitch said. “But again, it is part of a broader pattern that is affecting all the universities across the country. So far, most universities have treated the problems as institution-specific symptoms… That is the big challenge right now. How do you get dozens, if not hundreds of institutions, to start acting collectively to push back against this?”
The panelists said one of the big challenges that universities face is explaining to the public how their budgets work and the impacts of potential cuts.
UW-Madison Veterinary Medicine Research Administration Director Jenny Dahlberg said one lost grant will be “much more broad reaching” than some imagine. “This is an entire generation of scientists that no longer will have opportunities to conduct research. That is alarming,” she said. 
Dahlberg said faculty and staff need to find a way to protect their ability to speak freely about research and to train the next generation. 
Copelovitch said universities will have to communicate to the public about their budgets and recent attacks on academic freedom, and explain that if those things continue it “ultimately means that the universities that people think they’re going to send their kids to eventually are just not going to exist in that format.”
Don Moynihan, a University of Michigan professor and previously a UW-Madison faculty member, said conversations about whether universities are too reliant on federal funding miss the point. He said that investments into research at universities were part of a deal between universities and the government created at the end of World War II. 
“If you will help us with our goals of building out research infrastructure, we will ensure a steady flow of resources into that research infrastructure,” Moynihan said. “Now, we have one of those partners basically withdrawing from the partnership and not just withdrawing from the partnership, but also trying to dictate what the other party does, even though they’re bringing less resources to the table and that activity violated that contract.” 
Moynihan said there’s no way to manage the budget holes that could be created by cuts and that it’s not really feasible that the private sector could fill to gap.
“You’re going to accept or live with a much smaller campus that does much less research…  and that story will be true across lots of other research areas,” Moynihan said. 
Moynihan said the Trump’s administration’s letter to Harvard University, which demanded changes to its administration, student admissions process and called for audits into “DEI” across the campus, lays out a “full menu” of administration priorities. The administration said it would also be cutting over $2 billion in federal grants to the school. 
Moynihan said that it’s clear that individual universities making side deals won’t be a viable strategy. 
“Without collective action, there is not going to be any effective pushback against this administration,” Moynihan said.
Copelovitch said that he has been “heartened” to see the pushback in the last few weeks. UW-Madison Chancellor Jennifer Mnookin signed a letter together with hundreds of other higher education leaders to speak against the “unprecedented government overreach” and the “political interference now endangering American higher education.”  
Copelovitch said discussions about universities banding together, including a recent proposal that  Big Ten schools form a NATO-like agreement, will also be key. 
“No chancellor or provost is going to stick their neck out and lead the fray. Harvard is doing it a little bit, and Harvard can afford to do it, but leaders of any individual public institution are not going to do that, so there’s a need to speak collectively,” Copelovitch said. 
“Fragility” of U.S. democracy
The upheaval in U.S. institutions has gone beyond higher education, and at a separate event, titled “The Fragility and Performance of Democracy in the U.S.” hosted by the Elections Research Center on Thursday afternoon, focused on analyzing Trump’s attacks on the U.S. administrative state and the consolidation of executive power .
UW-Madison professor and director of the Elections Research Center Barry Burden said he didn’t think “any of us imagined we would see the kind of chaos that we’ve experienced these first 100 days,” but said the second Trump administration “has been so massively disruptive” and is “pushing the limits of what a democratic system can handle.” 
“It is doing things that previously seemed illegal, impossible, unimaginable or unconstitutional, and they’re happening daily and often with people who are not really part of the government or part of his party — people like Elon Musk and others — being brought in to do the hatchet work on federal agencies,” Burden said. 
Burden said that Trump is showing warning signs of a “personalized” president, which is often a warning sign for democracies.

“We’ve seen in other countries where a fairly elected leader, and [Trump] is a fairly elected leader, can nonetheless abuse the government against their enemies and make it a kind of weapon — whether it’s using the IRS for political purposes, or threatening judges or intimidating universities or journalists,” Burden said. “All of those things are using his power as president to get parts of society to bow to him and serve his interests.” 
Burden said the protests being held across the country at state Capitols, in small cities and towns — including in Wisconsin — in recent weeks are a sign that civil society is starting to rise up in opposition. 
“We’ve seen the public come back out of its hiding,” Burden said. He added that unpopularity amongst the public and public resistance — along with accountability by the courts and the media — are what has been essential in resisting autocrats in eastern Europe and Latin America as well. “It’s all hands on deck, really, to stop a Democratic government from sliding away.”
Burden said that people need to understand their place in upholding democracy.
“Democracy needs people to keep it flourishing,” Burden said. “It doesn’t operate on its own. We often think of it as a kind of system. You write a constitution, and it exists, and it’s in place, and it will just continue. That’s not how it works. It has to be sustained and tended to and protected. It takes a whole bunch of different actors. It takes the public being vigilant. It takes journalists, media outlets holding government accountable, and transmitting what’s happening. … and it takes political parties to govern themselves and keep bad elements out of government.”

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — An Oklahoma lawsuit coming before the U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday could produce a landmark ruling on the role of religion in state-funded education.
At the center of the debate is St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School, a church-backed online charter school that was approved to open in Oklahoma until the state Supreme Court struck it down in June. It would be the first publicly funded charter school in the nation to adopt a religion.
The case questions whether charter schools, long considered public, are truly an arm of the government and whether states should be able to deny a school access to taxpayer funding because it is religious.
The Archdiocese of Oklahoma City and the Diocese of Tulsa sought to open the online school to students of all backgrounds and faiths in Oklahoma, especially in rural areas that have no brick-and-mortar Catholic schools. State dollars would be the school’s primary source of funding.
However, St. Isidore would be unapologetically religious, teaching Catholic beliefs, requiring students to attend Mass and operating according to church doctrine. The archbishop of Oklahoma City and the bishop of Tulsa would choose the members of the school’s governing board.
The Oklahoma Statewide Virtual Charter School Board, which has since dropped the word “virtual” from its name, approved St. Isidore in June 2023 to open as a state-funded entity. 
Attorney General Gentner Drummond asked the Oklahoma Supreme Court to block the school from opening. The state’s highest court ruled in Drummond’s favor, finding the concept of a religious charter school unconstitutional. 
The matter is now in the hands of the U.S. Supreme Court, which announced in January it would consider the case. The Court, whose justices have a conservative majority, will hear oral arguments on Wednesday. A decision is expected by the end of June.

Oklahoma’s educational outcomes are too poor to turn down an institution like the Catholic church that has a history of academic success, said Brian Shellem, who leads the Statewide Charter School Board.
National testing showed Oklahoma was among the lowest-performing states in the country in 2024.
In an interview with Oklahoma Voice, Shellem said the state should take an “all-hands-on-deck approach” to give students better options. The statewide board’s objective, he said, is to encourage innovative school models.
“When we have a tornado come through, we don’t ask for someone’s religious beliefs,” Shellem said. “You just hear the chain saws firing up, the wood starts cutting. People come give food and water and shelter. With this crisis of our education, we need everyone to be chipping in. And when someone raises their hand and says, ‘We are willing, and we are able,’ should we say, ‘There’s the door’? Or (do) we say, ‘You obviously have a (strong) track record. Thank you for helping.’”
Introducing religion into public education doesn’t solve Oklahoma’s poor outcomes, said Drummond, the attorney general.
Drummond, who is running for Oklahoma governor, said the Catholic charter school would be “a new, shiny thing” but a distraction from making genuine improvements to reading and math levels. He said it could draw public funds away from existing school districts and hurt their performance.
Gov. Kevin Stitt and the head of Oklahoma’s public schools system, Superintendent Ryan Walters, have advocated for opening St. Isidore to expand educational options in the state. Both filed friend-of-the-court briefs for the U.S. Supreme Court to consider as it weighs its decision.

Drummond has been the school’s leading opponent. Allowing a state-funded charter school to adopt a faith “eviscerates” the state and federal Constitution’s prohibition of government-established religion, he told the state Supreme Court during oral arguments last year.
A ruling in favor of the Catholic school could upend charter programs across the country and open the door to schools adopting faith systems that Oklahomans might find objectionable, Drummond said.
“It’s a recipe for chaos and confusion for millions of charter school students, and that is a tragedy,” he told Oklahoma Voice. “I think it would create a patchwork, truly. You would probably have large states like New York, Colorado, California, discontinuing its charter school program because those states probably won’t tolerate the funding of sectarian education. A ruling against me, the state, would subject religious institutions to state regulations of which they’re typically immune.”
The crux of the case, both sides say, is who creates and controls a charter school. 
A charter school is only established in partnership with the state and is subject to regulations that apply to all public schools, therefore making it inextricably tied to the government and subject to church-state separation, the attorney general said.
Attorneys representing St. Isidore and the statewide board say creation and control of a charter school lie with its independent governing board, not the state. They equated charter schools to private institutions that are paid taxpayer funds to provide public services, like a church-affiliated hospital or construction companies hired to build city roads.

Similarly, charter schools are privately run entities contracted with the state, said Phil Sechler, senior counsel at Alliance Defending Freedom, a national conservative Christian legal group representing the statewide board.
Those private entities have a right to religious liberty, he said, so excluding them from public funding is religious discrimination. 
Previous Supreme Court rulings found religious groups cannot be excluded from government grants and school voucher programs. Permitting a religious charter school, though, would set a new precedent.
“The Statewide Charter School Board is treating St. Isidore exactly as the Constitution demands — neutrally,” Sechler said. “It’s not promoting religion. It’s not disfavoring it or being hostile to it.
“St. Isidore is simply trying not to be discriminated against because of its faith.”
Alliance Defending Freedom has been involved in other landmark cases, including the Mississippi lawsuit that resulted in the nation’s highest court overturning Roe v. Wade.
The nonprofit group is representing the Statewide Charter School Board for free, Sechler and Shellem said. Its chief legal counsel, Jim Campbell, will present oral arguments to the Supreme Court.
Michael H. McGinley of Dechert LLP will represent St. Isidore.
The Attorney General’s Office hired Washington, D.C., attorney Gregory Garre to represent Drummond at a cost of $250,000, according to the AG’s contract with Garre’s law firm, Latham & Watkins LLP.
If approved, St. Isidore would be open to students of all backgrounds and faiths, Catholic officials have said. Its contract with the Statewide Charter School Board pledged it would not deny students admission based on their religion, lack of faith, sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression.
Guiding principles for Oklahoma Catholic schools disagree with the concept of a gender identity that doesn’t match a person’s biological sex, according to guidance the Oklahoma City archdiocese and the Tulsa diocese released in 2021.
However, Catholic schools must ensure “the immeasurable dignity of every child is protected and respected,” the principles state.
All Catholic school students, including those who are LGBTQ+, are treated with human dignity and respect, said Michael Scaperlanda, chancellor of the Oklahoma City archdiocese.

“I think because the Catholic Church believes in the dignity of every human person, we respect the dignity of whoever comes to our school, whoever chooses to come to our school, and respect their freedom to either accept or reject or be curious about the Catholic faith,” Scaperlanda said. “That’s up to them.”
St. Isidore received more than 225 expressions of interest from students wishing to enroll, even with multiple lawsuits hanging over the school, Scaperlanda said. The archdiocese has stated its goal is to enroll up to 500 students in St. Isidore’s first year of operation.
Most of the families expressing interest came from rural areas, and only two attend a Catholic school currently, Scaperlanda said.
The idea for a virtual school had its genesis during the COVID-19 pandemic, Scaperlanda said, when Oklahoma Catholic schools pivoted to online instruction in March 2020. Catholic officials discovered “we could do this sort of education and do it very quickly and very well.”
An online school could make Catholic education available across the state, he said, and as a charter school, it could do so at no cost to families. 
Scaperlanda said Catholic leaders saw other private groups accessing charter school funding and wondered, “Why should we be left out of that?”
“If the state wants to provide these opportunities, it’s discriminatory to say, ‘Chickasaws, you can do this. STEM-minded folks, you can do this. All kinds of other folks can participate in this educational space, but religious groups can’t,’” he said.
It’s no surprise a publicly funded religious school emerged from Oklahoma, considered one of the most predominantly Republican states in the country, said House Minority Leader Cyndi Munson, D-Oklahoma City.

In her 15 years in the state Legislature, Munson has seen the GOP supermajority enact a variety of policies inspired by lawmakers’ religious faith — from a near-total abortion ban to a recent House resolution proclaiming “Christ is King.” 
Walters, who leads the Oklahoma State Department of Education, has ordered schools to teach from the Bible and keep a copy of it in every classroom.
Republican lawmakers, afraid of being challenged in a primary election, are “very nervous about standing up and just having real conversations around the separation of church and state,” said Munson, a Democratic candidate for governor.
She said that mindset, along with gerrymandering and straight-party voting, has distanced conservative elected officials from the wishes of Oklahoma voters. Her constituents, despite choosing a private religious education for their children, told her these efforts are “not what we want our government leaders working on.”
“I represent a district that is predominantly Republican and, I would say, religious,” Munson said. “I have Catholics, churches in my district, pretty well-known affluent ones. And they say, ‘This is not what we want in our public schools.’”

(Getty Images)FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. — While biodegradable plastics currently account for a half percent of the hundreds of millions of tons of plastic produced annually, a growing demand for the alternative reflects consumer awareness and corporate response.
Researchers from Brazil, Germany and the United States document a multi-faceted global snapshot of the environmental aspects and trends surrounding single-use plastics in a review article titled “Rethinking single-use plastics: Innovations, policies, consumer awareness and market shaping biodegradable plastics in the packaging industry.” The piece was recently published in Trends in Food Science & Technology.
The researchers state that the largest area of application for biodegradable plastic materials is the packaging segment, which accounts for about half of single-use plastic production. The biodegradable packaging market was estimated to reach about $105 billion in 2024 with an expected annual growth rate of about 6 percent between 2024 and 2029, and 44 percent of patents filed worldwide for biodegradable polymers relate to packaging, the study noted.
About 474 million tons of plastics are produced globally each year, and about a third of it is used for packaging, including single-use plastic products for food and beverage containers. Of this, only about 25 percent gets recycled. Plastic production, the article adds, is expected to triple by 2060 following a trend of transitioning from durable plastics to single-use plastics.
Global plastic production increased from 369 million tons in 2016 to 404.5 million tons in 2020, partly due to materials used in the COVID-19 pandemic.
Citing a 2021 study from the same research group in Brazil, the review article noted the pandemic “exacerbated the use of single-use plastic and increased the demand for personal protective equipment and packaging, leading to remarkable growth in the plastics industry and generating more than 8 million tons of waste, mainly affecting Asia, Europe and America.” The same study mentions that the pandemic expanded food packaging due to a shift in eating habits and an increase in online purchases.
Despite the transition to single-use plastics, an increasing number of patents and successful research and development of biodegradable plastic materials has sparked the interest of industries to invest in large-scale production technologies for renewable monomers and polymers, the researchers added.
 Looking to corn


“There is a lot of opportunity with zein, which is a family of proteins in corn that forms a beautiful film to make biodegradable plastics, and it’s a little bit more expensive, but we hope that will be hitting the market soon as well,” said Sun Ferreira, a co-author of the study and an assistant professor in the food science department for University of Arkansas System Division of Agriculture and the Dale Bumpers College of Agricultural, Food and Life Sciences. Ferreira is part of both the research and extension arms of the Division of Agriculture, the Arkansas Agricultural Experiment Station and the Cooperative Extension Service.

Ferreira is a food scientist and food processing engineer who has worked with biopolymers for microencapsulation to protect flavors, vitamins and other ingredients during processing, storage and digestion. He collaborated with the study’s lead author, Andreza Salles Barone, a nutritionist and Ph.D. candidate with the Federal University of the State of Rio de Janeiro’s Food and Nutrition Graduate Program.

Barone is supervised by Ana Elizabeth Cavalcante Fai, corresponding author for the review article, a food engineer and associate professor in food science at Rio de Janeiro State University, where she coordinates the Laboratory of Multidisciplinary Practices for Sustainability at the Institute of Nutrition.
“Food packaging plays a vital role in ensuring food safety and quality,” Fai said. “However, it is increasingly unjustifiable to produce short-life cycle packaging using synthetic plastics that persist in the environment for up to 400 years. Even more concerning is the growing awareness that plastics don’t degrade completely — they fragment into micro- and nanoplastics, which are now recognized as widespread environmental pollutants and an emerging public health concern.”
Ferreira said that while biodegradable plastics are a promising long-term alternative solution, it is not where he expects to see the biggest short-term impact on the reduction of overall plastic use.
Fai and Barone said that plastic has undeniably transformed modern life since its mass production began in the 1950s. However, despite its versatility and usefulness, “plastic has often been misused and is frequently applied to single-use items which are discarded with little regard for environmental consequences.”
“Most of the plastic ever made still exists in some form today,” Fai said. “When people say, ‘just throw it away,’ we must remember — there is no ‘away.’ Everything remains within the boundaries of our shared environment. The planet simply cannot absorb this volume of waste indefinitely. If current trends continue, some projections estimate that by 2050, there could be more plastic than fish in our oceans. This is not just alarming — it’s a call to urgent action.”
A “circular economy,” Ferreira said, could have a larger long-term impact on single-use plastic reduction. A circular economy broadens the familiar slogan of “reduce, reuse, recycle” to “rethink, refuse, reduce, reuse, repair and recycle,” in that order.
Brazil has an extraordinary biodiversity, Fai said, and a significant agro-industrial biomass base, rich in polysaccharides such as starch, pectin, lignin, and others. These valuable raw materials can be transformed into bio-based and biodegradable packaging for the food industry, she added.
“Through international partnerships, where each research group contributes its unique expertise, we can join efforts to develop sustainable and innovative packaging solutions,” Fai said. “This collaborative approach is key to building a more sustainable future for food systems worldwide,” said Fai and Barone.
“We are part of the problem as consumers, but at the end of the day, as consumers we can be part of the solution,” Ferreira said.
Co-authors of the review article on single-use plastics include Carollyne Maragoni-Santos of Federal University of the State of Rio de Janeiro; Patricia Marques de Farias of the Sustainable Packaging Institute in Germany; Camila Marcolongo Gomes Cortat of the Laboratory of Multidisciplinary Practices of Sustainability, Institute of Nutrition at the State University of Rio de Janeiro; Bianca Chieregato Maniglia of the University of São Paulo; and Ricardo Schmitz Ongaratto in the chemistry school at Federal University of Rio de Janeiro.
 Plastics on the farm

Heather Friedrich, director of the Center for Arkansas Farms and Food, said while there are a lot of plastics used in agriculture, her team avoids single-use plastics as much as possible out of concern for the environment and to reduce consumption.

“In our transplant production, rather than using the single-use plastics that you see in a store when you get plants, we use extra sturdy plastic transplant trays,” Friedrich said. “We know farmers who have used these for 20-plus years and are still strong.”
Friedrich said the CAFF farm also uses a paper pot system adapted from Japan that uses a chain of paper strips to form cells in which they grow the transplants. The training farm also uses a landscape fabric instead of plastic mulch for weed control, which can be reused over many years.
However, use of single-use plastic is unavoidable at times. For its “tractor-scale” production, CAFF uses the black plastic seen on strawberry beds at u-pick operations.
“Plants respond well to plasticulture because it warms the soil early, creates a weed free zone and delivers water directly to the plant roots,” Friedrich said. “The current biodegradable options for this function can’t hold up over the long, hot season.”
A thick, clear plastic is used to cover high tunnels at the farm, but that material has a longer lifespan of four to six years. High tunnels differ from greenhouses by generally having less climate control but still allow protection of plants from the elements and extend the growing season from early spring to late fall.
Irrigation drip tape — a flat tubing that provides water directly to plant roots — can also be a source of plastic on the farm, Friedrich said, and they try to use theirs for multiple years to minimize landfill deposits.
“In other areas of the state, there are recycling options that farmers can off-load their irrigation plastic,” Friedrich said.
Polypipe is commonly used for irrigation in row crop operations. When the season has ended, farmers roll up the pipe and drop it off for recycling.
The Center for Arkansas Farms and Food was developed to strengthen and expand our food and farming system by providing new opportunities to shape our current and future farmers, food entrepreneurs and food system leaders. CAFF is a program of the Arkansas Agricultural Experiment Station through the University of Arkansas System Division of Agriculture.
Through experiential learning, the center’s programs train farmers and food entrepreneurs with the production and business skills and resources necessary to develop resilient businesses that sustain our ecosystem, our land and our communities.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)At a time when my classmates were learning the building blocks of reading, my first grade teacher was informing my mother that I’d be illiterate.
Let’s just say that learning my teacher had washed her hands of me solely because I wasn’t hooked on phonics went over like a lead balloon with my mother, a former classroom teacher whose education degree featured a speciality in reading.
Every day after school that year, my mother worked with me at home, teaching me how to read. Thanks to her tutelage, by the time I reached second grade I was reading at grade level. And by third grade, I was reading well above it. 
That lived experience of having a first-grade teacher who didn’t have the slightest idea how to teach a core foundational subject to a struggling student is one of the reasons I’m positively petrified by Oklahoma lawmakers’ absurd plan to put people without teaching experience — or even any college education — at the helm of our pre-K through third grade classrooms.
Supporters say hiring these so-called “adjuncts,” who must only have “distinguished qualifications in their field,” will help address our state’s ongoing teacher shortage. Opponents suspect hiring untrained teachers could cause long-term negative consequences for our youngest students.
Oklahoma lawmakers were the first in the nation to try this failed experiment with our older grades, and it’s worked so well that we still have some of the worst academic outcomes in the nation as trained teachers continue to leave the profession in droves. 
So, it is mindboggling that we’d now want to expand this concept to our youngest students who desperately need qualified teachers who know how to manage classrooms and teach foundational skills.
Because one thing I’ve learned from virtual school days is that it is not easy to teach my children, who are in their foundational grades, despite me theoretically having “distinguished qualifications” in reading and writing by way of winning journalism awards and leading a newsroom.
It terrifies me that our crippling teacher shortage has led us to a point where we think it’s prudent to use people with no formal education training to teach our youngest children the building blocks that they’ll need to be successful throughout life.
I could see allowing districts to temporarily hire people who are enrolled in college and maybe a few hours away from the completion of their education degree, but we’d have to be crazy — or desperate — to entrust someone untrained to teach reading just because they can read well.
In response to criticism, some Republicans now propose requiring adjuncts to complete training on how to teach children to read — by the end of their second year in the classroom.
What about the poor kids who are placed in that adjunct’s classroom that first year? Are they disposable? Why is it suddenly OK to allow some children to fall through the cracks and be victims of our adult leaders’ inability to keep qualified educators in their classroom?
I could have been one of the children who fell through the cracks had I not had a determined mother with an education degree at home.
Because while I arrived in second grade able to read, I discovered I lacked the basic math skills required because my first-grade teacher didn’t teach that subject at all. I suspect she didn’t know how, and as a result, I spent several weeks taking remedial courses to get caught up.
Years later, I still remember how miserable — and confusing — it was to be behind my peers. My class didn’t stop to wait for me to get caught up. My second-grade teacher continued to build on what I was supposed to have already learned.
We’re at a crossroads, and my question is do we want our classrooms to produce well-educated students? Or do we want our schools to be little more than a babysitting service?
If lawmakers want our schools to simply be low-paid babysitters, then be brave enough to admit it. But I suspect they don’t want to say the quiet part out loud because their constituents — and businesses — demand that we produce students who are literate in math and reading.
If we can’t get qualified people to teach, then lawmakers need to do some soul searching and figure out what’s fundamentally wrong with how they’re doing things. 
Every child should have someone in their life like my mother, who can fill the gaps, but they don’t. Our lawmakers should be moving mountains to ensure every child has the best teachers in their public school classrooms, not taking dangerous short cuts that put student outcomes at risk.

It's Workers Memorial Day. Yet Wyoming elected officials mostly silent in wake of yet another alarming report of workplace carnage, advocates say.
The post Labor advocates: Most lethal state in the nation for workers ignores blue-collar plight appeared first on WyoFile .","In 2023, a worker died after falling through a skylight on a construction job. Another died after being thrown from a front-end loader. Yet another was buried in a trench collapse and two were crushed by vehicles they were either inspecting or repairing at the time, according to the Wyoming Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s fatal accident alerts website.
The five “alerts” — limited to two sentences or less — belie the actual extent of occupational fatalities in Wyoming that year. Forty-five workers died on the job in 2023 — a 32.4% increase over the previous year and the deadliest since 2007, according to the state’s most recent annual report on workplace fatalities. 
Unless a local newsroom reports on a workplace fatality, or there’s civil litigation, most victims’ names disappear into the maw of multiple bureaucracies where extracting the type of information that might point to problem areas and potential solutions is frustratingly difficult, advocates and officials say.
“These aren’t just statistics — they’re our neighbors, family members and fellow Wyomingites,” Wyoming AFL-CIO Executive Director Marcie Kindred said in a prepared statement.

Today is Workers Memorial Day. Workers and their advocates will gather at the steps of the Capitol in Cheyenne beginning at 5:30 p.m. to commemorate the dozens of lives lost each year while on the job in Wyoming. The workplace tragedies are not only preventable but so frequent that Wyoming has ranked the worst or among the worst in the nation — on a per-capita basis — for decades, according to federal data.
The state doesn’t appear to be on track to shed its deadly distinction.
Last year was comparably deadly, though there’s no official tally yet, and at least four workers have died on the job so far this year, according to Wyoming OSHA. They include: David Wesley Moore, 58, of Douglas, killed in a natural gas compressor station fire in Converse County; Alexander Harsha, 22, of Rock Springs, hit by a door that was struck by a forklift in Sweetwater County; Liam Cobb, 19, of Casper, died by suicide, falling from a wind tower in Carbon County; and Denice Downing, 47, of Gillette, killed in a tanker-truck explosion in Campbell County.
“Year after year, we gather [on Workers Memorial Day] to honor those we’ve lost, yet we see no meaningful improvement in workplace safety,” Kindred said. “We need concrete action to protect Wyoming’s workers.”
Despite the state’s December report confirming yet another notch to Wyoming’s dishonor as the “deadliest,” it doesn’t appear that the carnage — including the hardships families face — is a priority among elected officials. Past state-level initiatives, along with some industry-led safety efforts, seem to have fallen by the wayside, advocates say. Rather than a call to action to understand how to make Wyoming workplaces safer, Kindred said, worker advocates had to fight this year to defeat a measure to reduce unemployment benefits.

Kindred said she recently told union members: “Your elected officials spent your taxpayer dollars arguing about pronouns and bathrooms. Meanwhile, we’re dying out here.”
Each year, the Wyoming AFL-CIO, along with the Wyoming Trial Lawyers Association, pleads with lawmakers to take on the worker fatality crisis as an interim topic, and each year, legislative leadership declines. 
“I don’t think we value workers in Wyoming like we should,” said Wyoming Trial Lawyers Association Executive Director Marcia Shanor, who has advocated for workplace safety for decades. “If we did, we would never tolerate 45 people being killed without asking about it.”
What’s driving the crisis?
The 45 occupational fatalities in 2023 made Wyoming the most lethal state in the nation for workers on a per-capita basis — by a long shot. 
Wyoming recorded 16 fatalities per 100,000 workers, according to the most recent federal data available. North Dakota was second at 9.8 deaths per 100,000 workers, and Mississippi followed at 6.9 deaths per 100,000 workers.

Agriculture, ranching and forestry were among the most deadly work sectors, according to the state’s annual report, followed by mining and oil and natural gas extraction. Across all industries, highway crashes and vehicular accidents accounted for 67% of all occupational fatalities in 2023.
At face value, workplace fatalities can appear to be “random” from year to year, according to Wyoming OSHA Program Manager Christian Graham. It’s tempting, he said, to point to Wyoming’s often-hazardous driving conditions, or unregulated ranch work, or employees shirking safety protocols. 
“There’s so many instances where sometimes these can be prevented if we just slow down and pay attention,” Graham said.
Yet, it’s difficult to derive from data what exactly is behind Wyoming’s worker fatality problem, Graham cautioned. The labor, safety and workforce regulatory world is full of reductive reports and databases that, individually, don’t reveal root causes or how to address them. To understand and effectively address what plagues workplace safety, Graham said, requires deep, ongoing analysis and interaction with employers and employees. Wyoming OSHA and the Wyoming Department of Workforce Services do have those conversations with both employers and employees, he said. The agencies also oversee multiple programs that go beyond inspections and enforcement to provide services such as safety training and voluntary consultations.

“One death is too many,” Graham said, adding that more resources are always welcome. “We do our best while we’re out there to present our programs, and we’re completing our inspections throughout the state.”
Though workplace inspections and training programs are vital, the state does not do enough to hold employers accountable, Kindred said. She bristles when people chalk up the state’s track record to vehicle accidents and on-the-job suicides and homicides — which are included in the state’s tally.
“We also have the highest rates of suicide in the nation, and that’s a workers’ issue,” Kindred said. “If they’re doing it on the job, these are deaths of despair because they’re at this job they hate that doesn’t pay enough and they can’t support their families.
“And if a lot of these [vehicle fatalities] are out-of-state truckers,” Kindred added, “we need to make sure they’re prepared. We need to be better neighbors. If people are sending their workers to Wyoming and they’re dying, that’s not the reputation we want.”
There’s always a desire to pin the blame on workers for taking short cuts or not following procedures without acknowledging the pressures they’re under and things they don’t have control over, like improperly maintained equipment or the right tools for the job, said Tyson Logan, a partner at the Spence Law Firm, which specializes in workers’ rights.

“We see it all the time,” Logan said. “Wyoming workers are going out to do their job and being killed because of corporate negligence or recklessness. And what we see again and again is that companies just aren’t making their workers’ safety a priority.”
Most employers provide proper training and equipment and encourage a culture of safety, Logan said, noting a slow cultural shift over decades.
“It’s daunting, though. The problem is it’s not every company or every job,” he said. “When the economy is not as strong, companies tend to take more risks. When there’s fewer people, there’s more expectations and trying to do more with less. That’s when people get hurt.”
There are myriad inherent on-the-job risks in Wyoming, including long commutes to remote locations and working around heavy equipment, said Rep. Lee Filer, a Republican from Cheyenne who owns a company that builds and operates data centers.
“Every bit of the equipment they’re running, none of it is forgiving,” Filer said. “If it’s a forklift or front-end loader, that’s thousands of pounds hitting you. So it doesn’t take much.”
Despite embracing safe workplace practices while serving in the military and as a union representative with the railroad, Filer admits he lost a fingertip to a saw blade due to his own recklessness.

“I did it myself,” he said. “But I do the best I can to make sure that my crew is safe. I always tell them, ‘Come let me know if you have a concern,’ because I don’t want anybody getting hurt. And I’ve been pretty successful with that.”
Too many workers, however, feel they’re under pressure and don’t speak up, he said. His biggest worry is worker fatigue and commuting to and from work.
“It could be mandatory overtime issues where people maybe work 12 hours, 16 hours, then have to drive home,” Filer said. “Wyoming is always going to have a bad rap on this because of our shift work. A lot of our industries — the coal mines and railroads — those places are 24/7 operations.”
What’s being done about it?
Beginning in the 2000s, a spike in fatalities and injuries that coincided with a coalbed methane and natural gas drilling boom spurred advocates like the Wyoming Trial Lawyers Association, Wyoming AFL-CIO and the Equality State Policy Center to increase pressure on leaders in Cheyenne.
The response wasn’t immediate. But eventually, the state organized special hearings and there was a genuine statewide discussion about how to make workplaces safer, according to Shanor, who played a key advocacy role. Industries responded, too, forming the Wyoming Oil and Gas Industry Safety Alliance, the Wyoming Transportation Safety Coalition and a new safety training center in Casper.

There were even modest reforms — which were hard-fought, Shanor said — such as an annual cost-of-living adjustment and an increase in death benefits under the Wyoming Workers’ Compensation program. The Legislature in 2014 considered increasing fines and penalties for egregious safety violations to dissuade what some referred to as a “disposable worker” attitude among some employers in the region. The state even created an occupational epidemiologist position at Wyoming Workforce Services to not only analyze workplace fatality and injury data, but to coordinate information among multiple, siloed agencies that investigate worker fatalities to help identify strategies to do something about it.
The drive to finally address Wyoming’s workplace fatality epidemic, however, petered out, Shanor said. 
The Wyoming Oil and Gas Industry Safety Alliance is no longer active, according to Wyoming OSHA, and the Wyoming Transportation Safety Coalition is trying to regain footing. The state recently reclassified the occupational epidemiologist post to an “OSHA compliance assistance position,” which means the state is no longer performing the deep analysis of root causes like it had in the past.
OSHA defended the changes as enhancing “our ability to support health and safety throughout the state by guiding rule and standard development, conducting outreach, and being an accessible resource.”
But Shanor, the workforce safety advocate, doesn’t see it that way. 
“That’s a huge loss,” she said. 
“I just think we lack leadership,” she added. “I worry that maybe we let them off the hook after COVID.”

Kindred, of the AFL-CIO, was more blunt.
“[Wyoming leaders] like to talk about our work ethic and how we love our workers; We get the job done and we don’t complain,” Kindred said. “But when it comes time to put our policies and our efforts where our mouth is, we just want workers to be our mascot. We don’t really want to support them in any way.”
It’s disheartening, Kindred added, because Wyoming really is the place where people will pull over to help a stranger broken down on the side of the road. “That’s why our continued inaction on workplace safety is so jarring. It contradicts our fundamental values.”
Filer, who served on the Labor, Health and Social Services Committee during his first stint in the House of Representatives from 2013 to 2014, said he’s seen a shift in the Legislature from solving Wyoming problems to adhering to ideology.
“Worker safety, to me, is not an ideology or political position,” Filer said. “It’s something that everybody can probably agree on — that everybody wants to come home to their family when they get off work.”

Filer said he’s in favor of asking for more detailed reports, analysis and ideas from Wyoming Workforce Services and Wyoming OSHA, and generally prioritizing the workplace fatality epidemic at the Legislature. While he’s adamantly opposed to regulations, some are necessary, like “OSHA laws,” Filer said. “There’s a reason those [laws] are on the books. It’s because they were written in blood.”
Transportation, Highways and Military Affairs Committee Co-Chair Rep. Landon Brown, a Republican from Cheyenne, said he wants the panel to take up the worker transportation safety issue this year.

Among the committee’s proposed topics this year, however, is to consider lowering — again — what employers pay into the workers’ compensation program to “promote a more business-friendly environment” and “random” drug and alcohol testing of employees at state-funded institutions.
“It is time to reenergize this conversation and return worker safety to the forefront where it belongs,” Shanor said. “This silence is not just troubling; it is unacceptable.”

The Biden administration proposed a rule that would have required state Medicaid programs to cover GLP-1s for obesity treatment, but the Trump administration said it will leave the option up to the states. (Photo illustration by Scott Olson/Getty Images)The Trump administration this month scrapped a Biden-era proposal that would have required state Medicaid programs and allowed federal Medicare to pay for some GLP-1s for obesity treatment. Instead, state Medicaid programs will retain the choice of whether to cover the high-priced medications for their residents.
The drugs, which have historically been prescribed to diabetic patients, also help patients lose weight and have grown in popularity among doctors and patients. But they are generally too expensive for most people to afford without insurance.
While doctors and patient advocates say these drugs are critical to helping patients struggling with obesity and can save money in the long run by reducing comorbidities such as heart disease, others say the medications are just too expensive for most states to afford. More than a dozen state Medicaid programs have opted to cover GLP-1s for obesity treatment, and the proposed Biden rule would have asked all states to figure out how to pay for them. But now, advocates fear these drugs may continue to be out of reach for many.
“It’s unfortunate that they’re excluding a whole class of medications that seem to have a tremendous number of health benefits to patients,” Dr. Nicholas Pennings, chair of family medicine at Campbell University in Buies Creek, North Carolina, said in an interview.










I think that’s just part of the inherent bias towards the treatment of people with obesity.


– Dr. Nicholas Pennings, chair of family medicine at Campbell University


GLP-1s, which stand for glucagon-like peptide-1, are a class of drugs that balance blood sugar levels. They’ve long been prescribed to patients with Type 2 diabetes. But since the drugs also curb hunger signals, doctors may prescribe these drugs — including popular brands Wegovy and Ozempic — to help patients lose weight.
Medicaid is a joint federal-state funded program that mostly serves people with lower incomes under the age of 65 or who have a disability. The federal Medicare program focuses primarily on people above the age of 65, no matter their income.
How and whether to cover expensive treatments and drugs can be a significant deliberation for state Medicaid directors. In North Carolina, where 70% of people struggle with being overweight or obese, officials opted to begin covering the drugs for weight loss last year. That coverage has been a game changer, said Pennings, who continues to treat Medicaid patients.
“They are expensive, but there’s a lot of other medications that are expensive too. Why is it that obesity medications and diabetes medications are being selected out?” Pennings said. “I think that’s just part of the inherent bias towards the treatment of people with obesity, feeling like it’s cheating or not necessary.”
The list price for Wegovy is around $1,300 per month, and for Ozempic, around $1,000. Even so, the skyrocketing popularity of these drugs has prompted at least 14 state Medicaid departments to begin covering these drugs to treat obesity in the past decade.
In addition to North Carolina, those states include California, Delaware, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Virginia and Wisconsin.
An annual survey of Medicaid directors from health policy research group KFF recently found that half of the 47 responding states not already covering the drugs were considering doing so.
In January, the National Association of Medicaid Directors told the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services that state Medicaid departments had “significant concerns over the fiscal impacts” of the Biden proposal to require coverage of GLP-1s, and “strongly recommend that CMS maintain the current state option to cover or not cover anti-obesity medications.”
But others say covering the drugs will yield long-term savings.
John Cawley, a professor of economics and public policy at Cornell University who has studied the economic impacts of obesity, has found that obesity essentially doubles a person’s annual health care costs due to comorbidities such as heart disease, fatty liver disease and kidney disease.
He’s found that weight loss among those with extreme obesity, with a BMI of 40 or higher, can yield substantial reductions in medical care costs.
Cawley added that state Medicaid programs “have a lot of flexibility” in ensuring costs don’t get out of control, by, for example, covering a newly available generic version of GLP-1s, requiring prior authorization, and asking patients to try behavioral programs before getting a prescription.
North Carolina’s Medicaid department began covering GLP-1s for obesity in August. The state has been able to afford GLP-1 coverage by negotiating rebates, or discounts, with drug manufacturers, and by getting the federal government to cover some costs. Department leaders think lowering obesity will save the state money in the long run, said Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for North Carolina Medicaid.
He said that one of the benefits of Medicaid is that “we get to choose, as a state, where we want to make kind of those extra investments or not.” He added that covering the medications could be potentially financially feasible for other states.
“Each program is different and has its own pressures. It would be welcome to be able to come together with other states to be able to negotiate broader deals,” Ludlam said. “If North Carolina is able to get a good deal, I don’t know why other states wouldn’t be able to participate in that.”
In 2023, Connecticut enacted a law requiring Medicaid to cover obesity treatment services. The program began covering GLP-1s for weight loss, but costs were significant enough that the state told providers this year that it is now focusing on other obesity treatments instead.
Sean Scanlon, the Connecticut comptroller, said that not covering GLP-1s is “shortsighted, bad policy.” The state health plan, which takes care of teachers and other state employees, has been covering the drugs for weight loss since 2023. The plan controls costs by only prescribing GLP-1s after patients go through some online weight-loss counseling, said Scanlon.
“The most fiscally conservative thing we can do is give people tools that will save the taxpayers money in the long run,” he said in an interview. “And GLP-1 drugs are one of the best tools that we have to ensure that the taxpayers are not going to pay more money for the health care of hundreds of millions of people in the long run.”
It’s unclear whether the federal government will reverse course. In the past, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has recommended “three good meals a day” and behavioral changes rather than weight-loss medication.
But this month, Kennedy told CBS News he’s considering a regulatory framework to have Medicare and Medicaid cover these “extraordinary drugs” in the future, once their cost goes down.
“Ideally, over the long-term, we’d like to see those drugs available for people after they try other interventions,” Kennedy said.

It took nearly two years and some international maneuvering, but now those protective jackets, pants, boots, helmets and air tanks are headed to the city of about 75,000 in the mountainous state of Michoacan, Mexico — to be used by a volunteer team Perez said relied on donations to build their station and a hodgepodge of items for body protection.
“This is about a good humanitarian act where we have equipment we have to dispose of that still has a lot of life in it and can be of use to people who need it,” said Perez, who has lived in Nebraska since age 8 when his family emigrated from Zacapu.
 Cultural pride

Perez joined Columbus Fire Chief Ryan Gray, the Omaha-based Mexican Consul and a few dozen others last week at a reception at Bellevue University that marked the donation — and a celebratory visit by the mayor of Zacapu, Mónica Valdez Pulido. 
While in Nebraska for four days, Valdez, who in Mexico is known as la presidente municipal de Zacapu, finalized details for the delivery, met with officials involved and visited local communities where many natives of Michoacan have settled.
At a time when many immigrants feel threatened and unwelcome by policies of the Trump administration, Nebraska Latino leaders embraced the cross-border collaboration and act of international goodwill as an occasion to spotlight cultural ties and pride.

“May this moment inspire us all to keep building bridges of collaboration, friendship, and brotherhood,” Yesenia Peck, of the Nebraska Hispanic Chamber Foundation, said at last week’s reception.
Peck called the occasion more than just a transfer of equipment. 
“It is a powerful reminder that when communities come together, even across borders, we can create lasting impact,” she said, and in this case, support those who risk their own well-being to help protect others.
Valdez — the first woman mayor of her city, in a nation led by its first female president — told the group that she looked forward to a continued alliance with Nebraska and Columbus, whose population of about 25,000 is now more than 26% Latino. 
 Saving lives, protecting their own  

Statewide, about 12% of Nebraska identifies as being Hispanic or Latino, according to the U.S. Census, with the bulk of those being of Mexican descent.

Valdez pointed out new partnerships built in the process with Omaha-based Mexican Consul Jorge Ernesto Espejel Montes, whose office represents the Mexican government in Nebraska and Iowa, and Karina Perez, executive director of Columbus-based Centro Hispano Comunitario de Nebraska, a nonprofit formed in 2009 to help connect the influx of immigrant families to their new communities. 
Columbus now has two Latinas on the City Council, both of whom were in the audience.
Also attending the Bellevue reception was Omaha’s first female fire chief, Kathy Bossman, and Sergio Robles, the Omaha Fire Department’s public education specialist.
Valdez called the gift and partnership a “historic” occasion and noted that the  Zacapu bomberos are volunteers who fight fires and do so with inferior protective gear.
“With the right equipment, they’ll be able to continue to save lives but also to protect their own lives,” she said. The Zacapu team was arranging to pay to transport the gear from Columbus to Mexico.
 Remembering his roots

Valdez offered a particular shoutout to Aaron Perez, noting that despite having grown up mostly in Nebraska, “he has not forgotten his roots.”
Perez, in an interview, recalled nearly two years ago when his Columbus Fire Department was preparing to get rid of the outdated equipment. Age put the gear outside acceptable U.S. safety standards, but Perez said it was still useful. 
He recalled photos and conversations from his parents’ recent visit to Zacapu. He said the city’s volunteer firefighting gear appeared to be “pieced together” from other places. What Columbus had to offer included an ensemble for about 40 firefighters, including bunker jackets, pants, boots, helmets, hoods, masks and breathing packs.

Gray, the Columbus fire chief, said his current force includes 32 paid firefighters and eight reserves, who get paid an hourly rate when activated. Because of U.S. firefighting standards, options for expired equipment are limited, he said.
“Even though we may not be able to use it here, it doesn’t mean other places can’t use it to help fulfill their duties,” said Gray. “It really came down to the message of humanity and helping other communities.”
He said the City of Columbus views the donation of its taxpayer-funded equipment as an extension of its investment.
The effort was accelerated when Valdez took office about seven months ago, said Perez, who said she was more enthused about the idea than her predecessor. 
“I feel really thankful that our city, our department, and everybody else here was willing and able to do this,” said Perez, 34, who is hoping to return to his hometown soon to see the safety gear in action. 



 Mexican heritage runs deep in Husker state 

Asked to speak about the Mexican settlement in Nebraska, Omahan Cesar Garcia offered full disclosure: He is a native of Colombia.
He smiled, saying many assume he is from Mexico, which has the oldest and still largest share of the state’s Latino population. “And that is a big honor, an amazing thing,” he said, noting that he’s come to know Mexican culture and history better in the 27 years he’s lived in the state.

Garcia, as executive director of nonprofit Canopy South, is based in South Omaha, where Garcia said his team works to build up housing, jobs and other opportunities in a community largely composed of immigrants, refugees and families of Mexican descent.
He spoke at an event last week marking the visit of a Mexican contingent led by the mayor of Zacapu, Mónica Valdez Pulido. That a Colombia-born Latino leader was describing the area’s Mexican immigration patterns provides insight into the expanding population in Nebraska.
The diversity was noticeable among organizers and attendees of the reception at Bellevue University. Speakers included Yesenia Peck, originally of Peru, and Karina Perez, whose parents emigrated from El Salvador originally to California.
Those in the audience included a representative of the local Guatemalan Consulate, along with a team from the Mexican Consulate, both based in Omaha. 
Later generations of Spanish-speaking immigrants were represented in the audience, part of the 12% of Nebraskans who, according to the latest Census data, identified as Hispanic or Latino.
A further breakdown of 2022 Census estimates, by the Office of Latin American Studies at the University of Nebraska at Omaha, showed that Latin Americans make up about half of the 7.5% of the state’s population born in a foreign country.
Among those native born in Latin America: 62% are from Mexico; 14% from Guatemala; 7% from El Salvador; nearly 5% from Cuba; nearly 4% from Honduras and 8% from other countries in Latin America.
Garcia told the group that Nebraska’s Mexican population swelled in the early 1900s, as immigrants were lured largely by jobs picking beets in western Nebraska and in South Omaha’s meatpacking industry.
South Omaha was known as a landing point for European and Latin American newcomers as far back as the late 1800s. Garcia said many European families have moved to western and suburban areas, while many old and new Latino families remain. 
He told the group that Mexican and Latino culture is an economic driver in areas such as South Omaha and has become mainstream in various ways throughout the state. 
“There is no corner in the state of Nebraska where you won’t find a Mexican restaurant,” Garcia said. “It’s part of American culture.”

Wilderness stewards patrol the Sawtooth Wilderness, Hemingway-Boulders Wilderness, Cecil D. Andrus-White Clouds Wilderness, Craters of the Moon National Monument, Jim McClure-Jerry Peak Wilderness and recommended wilderness areas in the Sawtooth and Salmon-Challis national forests.
The Wilderness Stewards Program began in 2016. 
Since the program launched, wilderness stewards have packed 200 pounds of trash out of Idaho wilderness areas, cleared or naturalized 761 illegal fire rings and removed 182 human waste issues, according to the Idaho Conservation League.
Wilderness stewards also share Leave No Trace principles with other trail users they meet. Since 2016, wilderness stewards have engaged with 120,775 other trail users, the Idaho Conservation League reported. 
Founded in 1973, the Idaho Conservation League is a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization with offices in Boise, Sandpoint, Ketchum and McCall that works to protect air, water, land and wildlife.

(Photo courtesy of Jon Bahr/MilkShake Factory)The number of births in some Western states that are adding new housing rose last year, reversing losses the year before in many cases, according to new federal statistics released Wednesday.
Increases from 2023 to 2024 were highest in Colorado (4.5%), Idaho (3.8%), Utah (3.6%), Washington state and Nebraska (each 2.6%). Births increased around 2% in West Virginia, South Dakota, North Carolina, Montana, Rhode Island and South Carolina.
Almost all those states had decreases in births the previous year, and many have been building housing rapidly since 2023. Idaho, North Carolina and Utah have issued enough building permits in 2023 and 2024 to add about 4% to their housing stock, the highest in the nation.
Melissa Kearney, an economics professor at the University of Maryland who specializes in families and fertility, said there could be a link between homebuilding and more babies.
“It is quite possible that increased access to home ownership, coming from a reduction in the price of houses in places that are building more houses, could meaningfully increase birth rates,” Kearney told Stateline in an email.
Many of the other states with increases in births are also seeing building booms: Colorado, Nebraska, South Carolina, South Dakota and Washington state are all set to add more than 2% to housing stock based on permits issued in 2023 and 2024, according to a Stateline analysis of U.S. Census Bureau Building Permits Survey data.

Building permits can take up to two years to translate into finished houses and apartments, but they indicate which states are most willing to allow new housing that can boost population, tax receipts and the workforce. In Colorado, Denver County is set to add almost 10,000 housing units and in Idaho, Ada County, which includes Boise, could add 11,200 units based on building permits.
Nationally births were slightly higher in 2024 than the year before, by about 1%, according to provisional federal numbers from the National Vital Statistics System within the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The fertility rate also increased slightly, but it remains below the “replacement level” needed to keep the population stable — 2.1 children for each woman over her lifetime.
All the increase nationally was in births to Hispanic and Asian mothers, with births continuing to decline for Black, American Indian and white mothers. Births to teenagers and women ages 20-24, in sharp decline since 2007, continued to drop last year, while births increased for women 25 and older.
The number of births dropped most in states struggling with stagnant population: falling about 4% in Louisiana, 3% in Mississippi, and 2% in New Mexico and New Hampshire. All those states had little or no population growth between mid-2023 and mid-2024, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates.

(Johnathan Cohen/Getty Images)It was a stunning loss for Idaho’s agricultural community: On April 16 the U.S. Department of Agriculture withdrew a $59 million grant from the University of Idaho’s College of Agriculture and Life Sciences.
The Partnerships for Climate-Smart Communities grant was designed to help state agriculture producers develop more sustainable business practices as part of the Farmers First initiative. Before the termination, 201 Idaho producers representing 34 counties had already signed up for the program.
Federal government terminates University of Idaho climate grant for farmers

A University of Idaho press release said many of the producers had completed all the paperwork and were enrolled, others were in the final stages of enrollment.
In Idaho, agribusiness is 20 percent of the state’s industrial backbone. Agribusiness includes crops, seed, dairy, livestock, wine and beer cultivation and sales. This makes agriculture the state’s number one industry, followed by lumber, chemicals and paper, mining and tourism.
Overall, Idaho is the seventh largest agribusiness state in the country, led by livestock and dairy sales at more than 50 percent of all agribusiness sales. Any assistance to this large industry can only help the state grow.
Historically, this was the largest grant to UI in school history. When the new administration drew up new guidelines, the USDA withdrew the grant because Idaho’s plan fell short of the requirements.
How short? The new guidelines would require the program, titled the UI Innovative Agriculture and Marketing Program, to allocate at least 65 percent of the money to go to producers. Under the withdrawn grant, UI allocated more than 50 percent of the funds to go directly to state producers. The remaining nearly 50 percent was allocated for grant management and providing technical and marketing services to the enrolled producers.
UI can reapply, but there is no guarantee one will be awarded or that the school will receive same amount of money as the original grant. The deadline for the new Advanced Markets for Producers initiative is June 20.
Innovative Agriculture and Marketing Program co-director Sanford Eigenbrode said while disappointed, the UI is in a good position to re-apply for the grant by reconfiguring the numbers to meet the new guidelines.
Why was the Partnerships for Climate-Smart Communities grant eliminated? According to the federal government, it was because it was a Biden-era program. Under the current administration, just about anything that came from the previous administration is being labeled “bad” and being removed.
The grants were designed to help any state’s agribusinesses better compete in the world marketplace. Under the Innovative Agriculture and Marketing Program, information gathered by UI faculty, staff and students provided technical support and guidance to Idaho producers, helping them make better informed decisions about their financial bottom line. Overall, the program was designed to help reduce risks to agribusinesses and help them engage in new practices.
Granted, many people say the administrative costs of such programs can be high when run through a university. Often, depending on the university and the grant, administrative costs can run as high as 50 percent or more.
To better help Idaho’s agribusiness community, UI and other state universities need to adjust their administrative costs so more money can flow to the intended targets, in this case, the farmers and ranchers.
But even more needs to be done. As indicated, there is no guarantee that the grant will be re-issued to Idaho. This should now be priority work for the state’s congressional delegation. In Washington, D.C., Idaho’s U.S. senators and House members need to engage with their staff members and the USDA to regain at least part of, if not all, the grant money.
Failing to do so would mean the congressional delegation will be unsuccessfully representing their primary constituents: Idaho’s very large rural and agribusiness communities.
Anyone who has lived here knows Idaho is much more than potatoes. The state’s agribusinesses are vital to the state’s economic well-being.
To help improve especially small agribusinesses, it is time for schools to adjust their overhead expenses and for those elected officials to truly help their constituents by fighting for a reinstatement of the Farmers First philosophy grant.

(Photo: Getty Images)Legislation to guarantee teen victims of sexual assault the right to a forensic rape exam without parental consent failed in the Tennessee Legislature last week, despite drawing strong bipartisan support.
The legislation was brought as a technical fix to the 2024 “Families’ Rights and Responsibilities Act,” which established a parent’s right to “make all physical and mental healthcare decisions for the child and consent to all physical and mental health care on the child’s behalf.”
The legislation was among the most recent brought in reaction to the lingering impacts of COVID-era vaccine and testing mandates. Tennessee lawmakers have already passed legislation requiring parental consent for all vaccines.
But forensic rape exams, which include collecting evidence for law enforcement and providing medical care and support to victims, were not explicitly made an exception to the 2024 parental consent law, which adds hefty penalties for healthcare providers who fail to comply: parents have the right to sue doctors and nurses who fail to get their consent, and healthcare providers may face professional discipline, including the loss of their licenses.
As a result, some sexual assault centers in Tennessee are interpreting the law as tying their hands in serving teens without a parent’s permission and have turned young victims away to avoid legal repercussions, victim advocates in Tennessee said this week.
TBI makes progress in reducing rape kit backlog

“We have ended up with programs across the state interpreting this law differently,” said Jennifer Escue, CEO of the Tennessee Coalition to End Domestic & Sexual Violence. At least one sexual assault center in East Tennessee has told her it has been unable to serve teen victims on the advice of its attorneys, she said. 
“The consequences of this are potentially devastating,” Escue said. “It takes so much courage, so much bravery, to seek out an exam. To be denied that…they could very well decide they don’t want to go through with reporting the crime. It denies an opportunity for collecting evidence, and it might be that someone who is sexually assaulting a minor goes free.”
Most teenagers do inform their parents, Escue said. But others may feel reluctant or afraid. 
Teens are far more likely to have been victimized by someone inside their home or within their family circle, including a parent. A 2024 Tennessee law allowing the death penalty for child rape convictions may add to the reluctance by even nonoffending adults to consent to a teen’s rape exam if the perpetrator is known to them, she noted. 
The Sexual Assault Center in Nashville continues to provide forensic exams to teens 14 and older, a practice it has opted not to change with the passage of the 2024 law, said Rachel Freeman, president of the Sexual Assault Center in Nashville.
Facing criticism for turning away victims, Murfreesboro hospital to ‘rebuild’ sex assault program

“We’ve had legal counsel saying they can interpret this either way,” she said. “We’ve decided it’s worth the risk, and the right thing to do is provide exams to minors who need them.”
“This is time sensitive,” Freeman said. “It cannot be done after 96 hours. That’s a very short period of time to try and convince, let’s say a mother, to try and get a rape kit.” 
The bill by Sen. Heidi Campbell and Rep. Bob Freeman, both Nashville Democrats, would have explicitly ensured that the “consent of a parent or guardian is not required for the victim to receive a forensic medical examination” for minors who are victims of sex crimes. 
The measure easily sailed through legislative committees and received a rare unanimous vote on the House floor. 
Then it stalled on the Senate floor last week after Sen. Adam Lowe, a Republican from Calhoun, raised the spectre of children as young as his elementary school-aged daughter undergoing a rape exam over allegations that did not involve a parent as perpetrator.
“Someone could take my daughter for an examination without notifying me,” Lowe said. “That would be a very potent and traumatizing experience.”
Sen. Brent Taylor, a Memphis Republican who previously voted in favor of the bill in committee, then moved to send the bill back for further committee debate, citing “serious concerns” raised by Lowe and effectively killing the measure for the year. 
Victim advocates said Lowe’s concerns are based on a misunderstanding of systems in place to address child rape and sexual abuse. 
  “The reality is a five-year-old is not going to get a medical legal rape kit,” said Rep. Bob Freeman, a Nashville Democrat. (Photo: John Partpilo/Tennessee Lookout)
The Sexual Assault Center in Nashville does not provide rape exams to elementary-school-aged children. The agency serves victims starting at age 16, Freeman said. 
Child sex abuse victims 13 and younger are typically referred to Child Advocacy Centers and undergo a separate pediatric forensic process, Law enforcement and the Department of Children’s Services are notified. 
“The reality is a five year old is not going to get a medical legal rape kit,” Freeman said. 
Like all sexual assault centers, Freeman’s agency is a mandatory reporter of child abuse: the assault on any victim under the age of 18 who visits the center is reported to the Department of Children’s Services and law enforcement, which, in turn, contact non-offending parents.
“They certainly pull in parents when that happens,” Freeman said. “The reality is that the people who need to know will end up knowing.
Freeman worries that teens in Tennessee will be discouraged from seeking out help after being sexually assaulted but stressed that sexual assault centers will help them. 
A statewide crisis line can direct teens and other victims to available services and resources. The Tennessee Statewide Sexual Assault Hotline is available 24/7 to provide support and information to sexual assault survivors: 866-811-7473.

When the Trump administration cut more than $11 billion in COVID-era funds to states in late March, addiction recovery programs suffered swift losses.
An Indiana organization that employs people in recovery to help peers with substance use disorders and mental illness was forced to lay off three workers. A Texas digital support service for people with addiction and mental illness prepared to shutter its 24/7 call line within a week. A Minnesota program focused on addiction in the East African community curtailed its outreach to vulnerable people on the street.
Although the federal assistance was awarded during the COVID-19 pandemic and some of the funds supported activities related to infectious disease, a sizable chunk went to programs on mental health and addiction. The latter are both chronic concerns in the U.S. that were exacerbated during the pandemic and continue to affect millions of Americans. Colorado, for example, received more than $30 million for such programs and Minnesota received nearly $28 million, according to health and human services agencies in those states.

In many cases, this money flowed to addiction recovery services, which go beyond traditional treatment to help people with substance use disorders rebuild their lives. These programs do things that insurers often don’t reimburse, such as driving people to medical appointments and court hearings, crafting résumés and training them for new jobs, finding them housing, and helping them build social connections unrelated to drugs.
A federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration’s cuts, allowing the programs to continue — for now — receiving federal funding. But many of the affected programs say they can’t easily rehire people they laid off or resurrect services they curtailed. And they’re unsure they can survive long-term amid an environment of uncertainty and fear, not knowing when the judge’s ruling might be lifted or another funding source cut.
The week it slashed the funding, the Trump administration also announced a massive reorganization of the Department of Health and Human Services, including the consolidation of the main federal agency focused on addiction recovery services. Without a stand-alone office like the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, many advocates worry, recovery work — and the funding to support it — will no longer be a priority. Although private foundations and state governments may step in, it’s unlikely they could match the tranches of federal funding.
“Recovery support is treated as optional,” said Racquel Garcia, founder of HardBeauty, a Colorado-based addiction recovery organization.
The federal cuts put at risk a roughly $75,000 grant her team had received to care for pregnant women with substance use disorders in two rural counties in Colorado.
“It’s very easy to make sweeping decisions from the top in the name of money, when you don’t have to be the one to tell the mom, ‘We can’t show up today,’” Garcia said. “When you never have to sit in front of the mama who really needed us to be there.”
Mental health conditions, including substance use disorders, are a leading cause of maternal mortality in the U.S. And although national overdose deaths have decreased recently, rates have risen in many Black and Native American communities. Many people in the addiction field worry these funding rollbacks could reverse hard-earned progress.










You can’t have manufacturing if people can’t pass a urine drug test or continue to suffer from addiction or relapse.


– Rahul Gupta


U.S. Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson Emily Hilliard told KFF Health News that the department is reorganizing to improve efficiency, foster a more coordinated approach to addiction, and prioritize funding projects that align with the president’s Make America Healthy Again initiative.
“We aim to streamline resources and eliminate redundancies, ensuring that essential mental health and substance use disorder services are delivered more effectively,” she said in a statement.
But to Garcia, it doesn’t feel like streamlining. It feels like abandoning moms in need.
Between the time the cuts were announced and when the federal judge paused them, two women served by Garcia’s program gave birth, she said. Though her grant funding was in limbo, Garcia told her employee to show up at the bedside for both moms. The employee followed up with daily check-ins for the new moms, connected them to treatment or housing services when needed, and helped them navigate the child services system.
“I just can’t leave moms” without services, Garcia said. “I just can’t do it.”
Nor can she abandon that employee, she said. Although the federal funding provided half of that employee’s salary, Garcia has continued to keep her on full time.
Garcia said she primarily employs women in recovery, many of whom spent years trapped in abusive situations, relying on welfare benefits. Now they’re sober and have found meaningful work that allows them to provide for their families, she said. “We created our own workforce of mamas who help other mamas.”
This type of recovery workforce development seems to align with the Republican Party’s goals of getting more people to work and reducing reliance on welfare benefits. The Trump administration’s drug policy priorities, released in early April, identified creating “a skilled, recovery-ready workforce” and strengthening peer recovery support services as crucial efforts to help people “find recovery and lead productive, healthy lives.” Many recovery programs train people for blue-collar jobs, which could support Trump’s goal of reviving the manufacturing industry.
But the administration’s actions appear to conflict with its stated goals, said Rahul Gupta, the nation’s drug czar during the Biden administration.
“You can’t have manufacturing if people can’t pass a urine drug test or continue to suffer from addiction or relapse,” said Gupta, who is now president of GATC Health, a company using artificial intelligence for drug development.
Even if jobs return to rural America, cutting funding for recovery services and the main federal office overseeing such efforts could mean fewer people are employable, Gupta said.
Research on recovery programs, particularly those run by people with personal addiction experience, suggests they can increase engagement in court-ordered treatment, reduce the prevalence of rearrest, bolster attendance at treatment appointments, and improve the likelihood of families reunifying and stabilizing.
Billy O’Bryan sees these benefits daily. As a state director for the national nonprofit Young People in Recovery, O’Bryan oversees about a dozen chapters in Kentucky that teach people in recovery life skills, such as balancing a checkbook and interviewing for jobs, and show them how to have fun in sobriety, through group hikes and glow-in-the-dark Ultimate Frisbee games.
Providing recovery services “is when we really invest in their future,” said O’Bryan, who is in recovery too.
Six of his chapters were affected by the federal funding cuts. That has meant dipping into his organization’s rainy day fund to pay staff and cutting back on community events, including cleanup days in which chapter members gather used syringes off the street, pass out the overdose reversal medication naloxone, and talk to people using drugs about the possibility of recovery.
He’s exploring fundraising efforts now, but not all his chapters have the same ability.
“In a city like Louisville, fundraising is not a problem,” O’Bryan said, “but when you get out into Grayson, Kentucky” — a rural area in the Appalachian Mountains — “there’s not a lot of opportunities.”

In Minnesota, Kaleab Woldegiorgis and his colleagues at Niyyah Recovery Initiative used to spend hours a day at soup kitchens, community events, mosques, and on the streets of East African and Muslim neighborhoods, trying to connect with people using drugs. They spoke Somali, Amharic, and Swahili, among other languages.
Those outreach efforts allowed them to “find individuals in need of recovery services” who “weren’t seeking it out themselves,” said Woldegiorgis, who previously attended Niyyah’s support groups when he was dealing with addiction.
After building relationships with people, Woldegiorgis could help them connect with formal recovery services that bill their insurance, he said. But help couldn’t always wait for a contract.
One afternoon shortly before the federal funding cuts, Woldegiorgis and his colleagues spoke with a man who began weeping, recounting how he had wanted to get treatment a few days earlier but had lost his belongings, returned to using drugs, and ended up on the street. Woldegiorgis said he helped the man reconnect with a sister and begin exploring treatment options.
With the federal funding cuts, Niyyah may no longer be able to support this type of outreach work. Woldegiorgis fears it means people won’t receive the message of hope that can come from interacting with role models in recovery.
“People don’t pick up pamphlets to receive these messages. And people don’t read emails and people don’t look at billboards and find inspiration,” he said. “People need people.”

(Mathieu Lewis-Rolland/Getty Images)ISSAQUAH, Wash. — In the wake of recent natural disasters, state leaders across the country are finding that emergency support from the federal government is no longer a given.
Under President Donald Trump, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has denied federal assistance for tornadoes in Arkansas, flooding in West Virginia and a windstorm in Washington state. It also has refused North Carolina’s request for extended relief funding in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.
While it’s not uncommon for the feds to turn down some requests for disaster declarations, which unlock federal aid, state leaders say the Trump administration’s denials have taken them by surprise. White House officials are signaling a new approach to federal emergency response, even as Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem threaten to shut down FEMA altogether.
“The Federal Government focuses its support on truly catastrophic disasters—massive hurricanes, devastating earthquakes, or wide-scale attacks on the homeland,” Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the National Security Council, which advises the president on issues of national security, said in a statement to Stateline.
Hughes said state and local governments “often remain an impediment to their own community’s resilience.” He called on states to take on a more extensive role.
“States must have adequate emergency management staff, adoption and enforcement of modern building codes, responsible planning and strategic investment to reduce future risk, commonsense policies that prioritize preparedness over politics, disaster reserve funds to handle what should be routine emergencies, pre-negotiated mutual aid and contingency contracts that speed up recovery, and above all, an appetite to own the problem,” the statement said.
State emergency management leaders say the federal retreat from disaster response has upended a long-established system.
“This is very unusual,” said Karina Shagren, communications director with the Washington Military Department, which oversees the state’s emergency management division. “This is the first time in recent memory that we have hit all the indicators to get FEMA’s public assistance program and we’ve been denied.”
Michael Coen, who served as chief of staff at FEMA during the Obama and Biden administrations, said the president has “broad discretion” to approve or deny disaster requests, regardless of whether they meet specified conditions. If Trump intends to curtail federal support, Coen said, he should give states clear guidelines.
“They should have a dialogue with the states, so the states aren’t spinning their wheels making requests that are going to get denied,” Coen said.
He added that states need guidance if they’re expected to build emergency management programs to take on what the feds once handled. Not all states, Coen said, have the capacity to replicate those functions. And disasters are expected to increase in frequency and severity because of climate change.
“Having that capability in every single state instead of having one FEMA is not the best use of tax dollars to prepare for the worst day,” he said.
Historically, FEMA has coordinated the federal response during emergency situations. In the National Security Council statement, Hughes said Trump has promptly authorized “life-saving emergency support to states during and in the immediate aftermath of disasters.”
But the agency’s larger role has focused on recovery after disasters, assessing damage and distributing funding to help communities rebuild. Now, some communities are finding that support is no longer a sure thing.










They should have a dialogue with the states, so the states aren't spinning their wheels making requests that are going to get denied.


– Michael Coen, former chief of staff at FEMA


Issaquah, Washington, was among the cities hit hard by the “bomb cyclone” that ripped through the state last November. Severe winds killed two people in the state, knocked out power for hundreds of thousands of residents and caused millions in damage, state officials said.
A city of about 40,000 residents in the Cascade foothills, Issaquah’s costs from the storm totaled $3.8 million — covering road repairs, removal of 800 tons of tree debris and overtime pay for first responders. Mayor Mary Lou Pauly said the city has seen four events since 2020 that qualified for federal disaster aid, with no previous denials. If Washington is unable to win its appeal with FEMA, she said, Issaquah will take a financial hit to its reserves, leaving it more vulnerable to future storms.
“We put a lot of investment in being resilient,” Pauly said. “When you get to a number like $3.8 million, that is too big of a number for us to be able to rebuild without assistance. Our residents pay federal taxes, and this is what they think they pay them for, this is what they expect their national government to do. They do not want me to set property taxes 100% higher.”
Pauly echoed Coen’s view that FEMA should give states a clear outline of the role it will play.
“What we all want to know is what are the rules of the game?” she said. “If the criteria has changed, then why aren’t we getting told about it?”
Washington state leaders said they were shocked when FEMA denied their request for $34 million to help repair roads, utilities and power systems. Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson said the state’s application met all of the “very clear criteria to qualify.” He has vowed to appeal the decision.
“We were really relying on that funding,” said Shagren, of the Washington Military Department. “If the appeal is denied, our local jurisdictions will have to prioritize which projects they can move forward with and which they don’t. They’re going to be impacted greatly. This wasn’t some small storm.”
Other states also have been surprised by FEMA denials. Arkansas suffered 14 tornadoes last month, triggering a request for a disaster declaration from Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders. But the feds told state leaders to handle it on their own.
“[I]t has been determined that the damage from this event was not of such severity and magnitude as to be beyond the capabilities of the state, affected local governments, and voluntary agencies,” the federal government’s denial read, according to Arkansas Times.
Sanders has appealed that decision, saying the disaster caused “widespread destruction” that requires federal help.
In West Virginia, state leaders asked for disaster aid to cover 14 counties that were struck by flooding in February. But FEMA denied individual assistance to seven of those counties. Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey said in a statement that he is looking at options to appeal, but praised the Trump administration for its “strong support” following the floods.
Democratic leaders in the state have called on Morrisey to demand more help from the feds, WOWK reported.
Meanwhile, FEMA has said it will no longer match 100% of North Carolina’s spending to recover from September’s Hurricane Helene. Democratic Gov. Josh Stein said the cost share was crucial to the state’s efforts to rebuild.
“The need in western North Carolina remains immense — people need debris removed, homes rebuilt, and roads restored,” Stein said in a statement this month, according to NC Newsline. “I am extremely disappointed and urge the President to reconsider FEMA’s bad decision, even for 90 days.”

Kennedy Jr. speaks at the Rx and Illicit Drug Summit at the Gaylord Opryland Resort & Convention Center in Nashville, Tennessee, on April 24, 2025. (John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s push to “Make America Healthy Again” is making some North Dakota farmers queasy. 
Kennedy’s MAHA movement shuns highly processed foods and dyes. But it also includes an attack on oils made from seeds such as sunflowers and canola, with North Dakota being a leading producer of those specialty crops.
These oils are among what has become known as the “Hateful Eight,” oils from canola, corn, cottonseed, grapeseed, soy, rice bran, sunflower and safflower targeted by the MAHA movement. 
During a roundtable discussion last week in Fargo with Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, representatives of crops such as sunflowers, canola, soybeans and lentils said the MAHA movement is troubling for their members.  
Rollins is part of a MAHA Commission, created by President Donald Trump, with Kennedy as the chair.

John Sandbakken is executive director of the National Sunflower Association, headquartered in North Dakota but representing growers around the country. He said he has heard from farmers in multiple states concerned about the Rollins’ role on the MAHA Commission, led by Kennedy. 
“There’s a lot of misinformation out on the internet about seed oils, and we are hoping, as groups, that you will be a strong advocate for seed oils and the healthy benefits that they do bring to our consumers,” Sandbakken said.
Rollins responded that Kennedy is a “unique voice.” 
“My commitment is to be a vigorous and persistent advocate for all agriculture, including the great people that you represent,” Rollins said. 
The American Heart Institute is among the groups siding with seed oils advocates that they are healthy. 
Kennedy is backing beef tallow, a cooking oil that fell out of favor for being high in saturated fat.

An oil that is low in saturated fat is canola oil.  
Tim Mickelson, a Rolla farmer who is president of the U.S. Canola Association, encouraged Rollins to “follow the science” on health and ag research.
Mickelson said he fears the anti-seed oil movement is gaining momentum among consumers, which is just one of the problems facing canola growers. 
Mickelson farms near the U.S. border with Canada, where most canola is grown. 
He said canola prices in the U.S. follow the prices on Winnipeg Commodity Exchange and prices are also affected by the Canadian dollar.

“So if you’re pushing ideas of a tariff on Canada, and it’s hitting canola, you’re going to hit the futures price negatively. You’re also going to hit the Canadian dollar negatively,” Mickelson said. “So canola is getting a double whammy.” 
He said even the rumors of tariffs hurt the canola market. “Anytime somebody would sneeze on the Winnipeg Commodity Exchange about a tariff, canola would just be plummeting down,” Mickelson said. 
He said the market fell about 20% in March as tariffs with Canada were making headlines. 
“Anything that disrupts the flow of canola between the United States and Canada is detrimental to the entire industry,” Mickelson said. 
While the canola market has rebounded, he said the tariff talk and market drop was happening as farmers were making final decisions about what to plant in the 2025 growing season. 
The United States had a record year for canola production in 2024, most of it coming from North Dakota, according to the U.S. Canola Association. There were 2.7 million acres planted to canola in 30 states last year, led by North Dakota with more than 2.1 million acres.
Mickelson said with farmers concerned about changing consumer demand for canola oil and the timing of the tariff talk, canola acres could be down by 20% this year. 
Mickelson said he was grateful that Rollins came to North Dakota. 
“I think she has very good intentions on taking what we talked about today and trying to implement the things that need to be changed,” Mickelson said, but acknowledged that she has less influence on the MAHA movement than the health secretary. 
“That’s a big challenge,” Mickelson said.

(Photo: John Partipilo/John Partipilo)The city of Nashville has sued the federal government over the abrupt halt of federal public health grants to vaccinate children, test for infectious disease, operate community clinics and conduct outreach to unhoused individuals.
The lawsuit, filed Thursday in a Washington, D.C. federal court, alleges the Centers for Disease Control and Infection (CDC) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) illegally terminated $11.4 billion in federal public health funding across the nation last month. The lawsuit claims the action usurped the authority of Congress, which appropriated the funding during the COVID era for current and future pandemic preparedness. 
The grants to Nashville and other local governments were terminated “for cause,” a term that applies to wrongdoing on the recipients’ part. The federal government, however, said the “end of the [COVID] pandemic constituted its cause.” Being terminated from a federal grant for cause can impact the ability to get new grants.
“The COVID-19 pandemic is over, and HHS will no longer waste billions of taxpayer dollars responding to a non-existent pandemic that Americans moved on from years ago,” a March HHS statement about the funding cuts quoted in the lawsuit said. “HHS is prioritizing funding projects that will deliver on President Trump’s mandate to address our chronic disease epidemic and Make America Health Again.”










It could delay investigation and follow up to vaccine preventable diseases, such as Hep A (Hepatitis A) and B, measles, pertussis (whooping cough), among many others, unless we find other sources of funding which could lead to increased instances and more acute cases of vaccine preventable diseases.


– Dr. Sammi Areola, Metro Nashville Pubic Health


An HHS spokesperson on Friday declined to comment further on the litigation.
Nashville joined Harris County, Texas, Columbus, Ohio, Kansas City, Missouri and the American Federation of County and Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO in filing the suit, which also names HHS chief Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and CDC acting director Susan Monarez. The CDC is overseen by HHS.
The lawsuit said the funding to public health departments reflected Congress’ intent to address the “longer term challenges it knew the country would face in Covid-19’s wake, including gaps in the public health system and the need for investment in critical public health infrastructure.”
Metro Nashville Public Health Director Sanmi Areola said Friday he was “concerned about the impacts of the funding losses on the health of our residents.” 
Among the Nashville health services impacted are efforts to ensure children are up-to-date on vaccines, oversight of daycare immunization compliance, providing back-to-school physicals and delays in receiving immunization records, he said. 
Areola said the cuts could lead to more acute cases of vaccine-preventable diseases.
“It could delay investigation and follow up to vaccine preventable diseases, such as Hep A (Hepatitis A) and B, measles, pertussis (whooping cough), among many others, unless we find other sources of funding which could lead to increased instances and more acute cases of vaccine preventable diseases,” Dr. Areola said via email. 
Dr. Areola said health officials are working to minimize impacts on services. 
Nashville received word March 25 that it had lost the funding effective the prior day, March 24. 
The public health department has had to cut 16 full time staff in a division that conducted health and resource barrier screenings. The public health department can also no longer move forward with six already-advertised positions to do outreach to homeless individuals, the lawsuit said.
Plans to purchase a mobile medical unit have been shelved, too.
The lawsuit is seeking the restoration of funding and a declaration that the actions by the Trump administration were unlawful. The federal government has not yet filed a formal legal response to the lawsuit, and no court dates have yet been set.

(Courtesy of Jon Bahr/MilkShake Factory)The number of births in some Western states that are adding new housing rose last year, reversing losses the year before in many cases, according to new federal statistics released Wednesday.
Increases from 2023 to 2024 were highest in Colorado (4.5%), Idaho (3.8%), Utah (3.6%), Washington state and Nebraska (each 2.6%). Births increased around 2% in West Virginia, South Dakota, North Carolina, Montana, Rhode Island and South Carolina.
Almost all those states had decreases in births the previous year, and many have been building housing rapidly since 2023. Idaho, North Carolina and Utah have issued enough building permits in 2023 and 2024 to add about 4% to their housing stock, the highest in the nation.
Melissa Kearney, an economics professor at the University of Maryland who specializes in families and fertility, said there could be a link between homebuilding and more babies.
“It is quite possible that increased access to home ownership, coming from a reduction in the price of houses in places that are building more houses, could meaningfully increase birth rates,” Kearney told Stateline in an e-mail.
Many of the other states with increases in births are also seeing building booms: Colorado, Nebraska, South Carolina, South Dakota and Washington state are all set to add more than 2% to housing stock based on permits issued in 2023 and 2024, according to a Stateline analysis of U.S. Census Bureau Building Permits Survey data.

Building permits can take up to two years to translate into finished houses and apartments, but they indicate which states are most willing to allow new housing that can boost population, tax receipts and the workforce. In Colorado, Denver County is set to add almost 10,000 housing units and in Idaho, Ada County, which includes Boise, could add 11,200 units based on building permits.
Nationally births were slightly higher in 2024 than the year before, by about 1%, according to provisional federal numbers from the National Vital Statistics System within the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The fertility rate also increased slightly, but it remains below the “replacement level” needed to keep the population stable — 2.1 children for each woman over her lifetime.
All the increase nationally was in births to Hispanic and Asian mothers, with births continuing to decline for Black, American Indian and white mothers. Births to teenagers and women ages 20-24, in sharp decline since 2007, continued to drop last year, while births increased for women 25 and older.
The number of births dropped most in states struggling with stagnant population: falling about 4% in Louisiana, 3% in Mississippi, and 2% in New Mexico and New Hampshire. All those states had little or no population growth between mid-2023 and mid-2024, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates.

(Mathieu Lewis-Rolland | Getty Images)ISSAQUAH, Wash. — In the wake of recent natural disasters, state leaders across the country are finding that emergency support from the federal government is no longer a given.
Under President Donald Trump, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has denied federal assistance for tornadoes in Arkansas, flooding in West Virginia and a windstorm in Washington state. It also has refused North Carolina’s request for extended relief funding in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.
While it’s not uncommon for the feds to turn down some requests for disaster declarations, which unlock federal aid, state leaders say the Trump administration’s denials have taken them by surprise. White House officials are signaling a new approach to federal emergency response, even as Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem threaten to shut down FEMA altogether.
“The Federal Government focuses its support on truly catastrophic disasters—massive hurricanes, devastating earthquakes, or wide-scale attacks on the homeland,” Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the National Security Council, which advises the president on issues of national security, said in a statement to Stateline.
Hughes said state and local governments “often remain an impediment to their own community’s resilience.” He called on states to take on a more extensive role.
“States must have adequate emergency management staff, adoption and enforcement of modern building codes, responsible planning and strategic investment to reduce future risk, commonsense policies that prioritize preparedness over politics, disaster reserve funds to handle what should be routine emergencies, pre-negotiated mutual aid and contingency contracts that speed up recovery, and above all, an appetite to own the problem,” the statement said.
Trump wants states to handle disasters without FEMA. They say they can’t.

State emergency management leaders say the federal retreat from disaster response has upended a long-established system.
“This is very unusual,” said Karina Shagren, communications director with the Washington Military Department, which oversees the state’s emergency management division. “This is the first time in recent memory that we have hit all the indicators to get FEMA’s public assistance program and we’ve been denied.”
Michael Coen, who served as chief of staff at FEMA during the Obama and Biden administrations, said the president has “broad discretion” to approve or deny disaster requests, regardless of whether they meet specified conditions. If Trump intends to curtail federal support, Coen said, he should give states clear guidelines.
“They should have a dialogue with the states, so the states aren’t spinning their wheels making requests that are going to get denied,” Coen said.
He added that states need guidance if they’re expected to build emergency management programs to take on what the feds once handled. Not all states, Coen said, have the capacity to replicate those functions. And disasters are expected to increase in frequency and severity because of climate change.
“Having that capability in every single state instead of having one FEMA is not the best use of tax dollars to prepare for the worst day,” he said.
Historically, FEMA has coordinated the federal response during emergency situations. In the National Security Council statement, Hughes said Trump has promptly authorized “life-saving emergency support to states during and in the immediate aftermath of disasters.”
But the agency’s larger role has focused on recovery after disasters, assessing damage and distributing funding to help communities rebuild. Now, some communities are finding that support is no longer a sure thing.











They should have a dialogue with the states, so the states aren't spinning their wheels making requests that are going to get denied.


– Michael Coen, former chief of staff at the Federal Emergency Management Agency



Issaquah, Washington, was among the cities hit hard by the “bomb cyclone” that ripped through the state last November. Severe winds killed two people in the state, knocked out power for hundreds of thousands of residents and caused millions in damage, state officials said.

(Photo by Coady Media) Beyond Kentucky’s borders, horse racing is a sport in steep decline. Within the commonwealth, however, wealth is common.
Though no fewer than 48 American racetracks have closed since 2000, Kentucky operators continue to invest hundreds of millions in their facilities and are reaping an outsized return, and not only on the first Saturday in May. 
For instance:
Churchill Downs Inc. reported record net revenue ($2.7 billion) and net income ($427 million) for 2024. 
Keeneland’s September Yearling Sale netted a record $427.9 million. 
The 2006 races run in Kentucky in 2024 paid an average purse of $112,648, 20% higher than the second most lucrative state (Arkansas). 
September’s seven-day all-grass meet at Kentucky Downs in Franklin paid out $490,789 per race, easily the highest total ever recorded at a North American track. 
“Retreat to Kentucky if you want a future in racing,” California horseplayer Andy Asaro tweeted on April 15. “Things are moving fast.”

Beyond the Bluegrass, things are moving mostly in reverse. Jockey Club data shows the number of Thoroughbred races run in the United States has dropped by more than 50% since 1995, and the size of the national foal crop has been falling even faster, from 34,358 in 2007 to an estimated 16,675 last year. The Sonoma County Fair recently announced it will forego live racing for the first time since 1936 because of a shrinking supply of horses in Northern California. Last month, the Louisiana Supreme Court ruled the state’s historical horse racing machines unconstitutional, prompting Churchill Downs Inc. to project a 25% cut in purses at its Fair Grounds racetrack.
Slots-lite a double-edged sword 
Meanwhile, “decoupling” legislation that could free Florida gaming operators of the obligation to stage live racing as a condition of their licenses has been stalled, but may only represent a temporary reprieve from redevelopment of major tracks. The Stronach Group’s 1/ST Racing, which owns Gulfstream and Santa Anita, has threatened to sell both tracks while showing a pronounced inclination to divest rather than invest in its properties. Last year, the company closed Golden Gate Fields near San Francisco and cut a deal that turned over Baltimore’s Pimlico, the home of the Preakness Stakes, to the state of Maryland. 
Against this gloomy backdrop, and in contrast to its own contentious closure of Arlington Park near Chicago, Churchill Downs Inc. continues to spend aggressively on its flagship track. Plans for new capital projects with a projected cost of $920 million were put on pause last Wednesday, ostensibly in response to the uncertainty surrounding tariffs and trade disputes,  but recent improvements to the paddock and the addition of Homestretch Club and Turn One Experience cost in excess of $300 million and speak to management’s long-term bullishness. 
While these investments are largely attributable to the singular appeal of the Kentucky Derby, they also reflect the thoroughbred industry’s political influence in Frankfort and, in turn, the gushing revenue stream historical horse racing (HHR) terminals have unleashed. 
Since their 2011 introduction at Kentucky Downs, the slot-like historical horse racing terminals have reinvigorated racing in the state. Programmed to pay out based on the results of races previously run, Kentucky’s HHR machines generated more than $9.6 billion in handle during the 2024 fiscal year, accounting for $99 in bets for every $1 wagered live at the state’s thoroughbred and standardbred tracks. 
They contributed $55.5 million to Kentucky’s Thoroughbred Development Fund during that 12-month period, fueling the growth of purses that have more than doubled since 2017. Consequently, Eric Hamelback, CEO of the National Horsemen’s Benevolent and Protective Association, refers to HHR’s proliferation as racing’s “golden ticket.”

When HHR’s legality was challenged in 2018, Ellis Park General Manager Jeffery Inman said the loss of that revenue would “likely threaten the very survival of one of Kentucky’s iconic racing venues.” Though opposition was vocal, it was handily outvoted. Attorney Ryan Roark, in an article published in the Kentucky Law Journal, wrote that the legislature settled on a definition of pari-mutuel wagering “not shared by anyone outside Kentucky … to allow for the powerful horse industry to exclusively run their slot-like gaming systems.” 
The result, says Churchill Downs CEO Bill Carstanjen, has been a “juggernaut.” According to the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission, gross HHR commissions for Churchill Downs’ two Derby City Gaming locations exceeded $224 million for the 2024 fiscal year, nearly 12 times the total commissions from on-track wagering at all of the state’s racetracks. 
To the extent this disparity underscores the industry’s reliance on revenue sources that require no physical horses, it inevitably raises questions about racing’s sustainability and the best use of its real estate.

“Racing is on life support in Southern California, Florida, Delaware, Pennsylvania etc. and exists almost everywhere else only with the support of non-racing revenues from slots, casinos and state supplements,” Kenwood Racing founder H. Robb Levinsky wrote in a January letter to Thoroughbred Daily News. “Instead of embracing innovative ideas to make the sport more attractive to a new generation of racing fans and owners, the focus continues to be on protecting those non-racing revenues. An industry where 80-90% of purse money comes from slots instead of wagering on the core product is simply not viable in the long run.”
Signs of progress in New York, Maryland
In the short run, at least, the growth of Kentucky’s purses has led to a higher quality of horses competing in the state, more interest among bettors and a breeding boom running contrary to national trends. As Ed DeRosa documented for Horse Racing Nation, Kentucky passed both California and Florida in total handle in 2024 after trailing both states annually since 2007. 
“We’re the only jurisdiction (among the top four states) that has grown since 2020,” said Chauncey Morris, executive director of the Kentucky Thoroughbred Association. “The rest have contracted.”
And as cash incentives for Kentucky-breds have increased, so has the state’s share of registered foals. When HHR was introduced at Kentucky Downs in 2011, Kentucky produced 29.2% of the national foal crop. In 2023, the most recent year for which statistics are available, it was 42.2%.

“In states where racing has a good relationship with state legislators, racing is in good shape,” said consultant Damon Thayer, formerly the Kentucky Senate’s majority floor leader. “In states where they have not cultivated a long-term relationship with the legislature, horse racing is either in a declining state, a crisis state or a questionable state.”
In addition to Kentucky, there are pockets of progress. New York and Maryland have committed nearly a billion dollars to renovations at Belmont Park and Pimlico. Multiple industry executives cited developments in Wyoming, the nation’s last populous state, as a basis for bullishness. Yet their optimism is tempered by unsolved problems in larger locales, including the most populous state, California. 
Without supplemental income from other forms of gambling, California’s racing and breeding businesses have been contracting for decades. Efforts to enhance purses through HHR remain at the discussion stage in view of Native American tribes’ virtual monopoly on the state’s casino gaming. Unless some accommodation can be reached, racing columnist Ray Paulick warns, “racing in California is history.”
“You can put 1,000 HHRs in at Santa Anita and it would change California racing overnight,” Thayer said. “They’d be wildly popular. You’d direct the money to purses and breeders reward programs and it would be a huge success. It seems like some sort of attempt should be made to cut a deal with the Indians and convince them that 1,000 HHRs at Santa Anita is not going to damage their land-based casinos. . .
“Like Cyndi Lauper used to say, money changes everything.”

(Ben Wasserstein)In a parking lot across from the governor’s residence filled with construction trucks and contractor vans, a crowd of around 200 gathered and listened to prayers, songs and speeches from members of different faiths — Jewish, Christian, Sufi and Baha’i. They had marched nearly a mile from Temple Beth El, a conservative synagogue on the Susquehanna River, for a vigil organized by the Jewish Federation of Greater Harrisburg.
Only days earlier, Gov. Josh Shapiro and his family were evacuated from the residence just before 2 a.m., hours after their Seder celebrating the first night of Passover. Someone had thrown Molotov cocktails into the room downstairs that was prepared for their next Seder, engulfing it in flames.
“We say in our Seder ‘Let all who are hungry come and eat’ and we open the door,” Rabbi Melody Davis, one of the attendees, told the Capital-Star. She added the attack evoked a history of pogroms against Jewish people on the Passover holiday. 
“For this to happen, [it] affects all of us,” she said.

Details of what happened in the early morning hours of April 13 trickled out over the following few days. A man, Cody Balmer of Harrisburg, was arrested after turning himself in to state police. Images of the destruction — a burnt Haggadah, a Jewish prayer book recited at Passover Seders, melted tables and blackened plates — were shown in news stories about the incident around the world
Balmer told authorities he would have attacked Shapiro with a hammer had he come across him, and acted because he did not want to “take part in his plans for what he wants to do to the Palestinian people.”
It is not known if Balmer targeted Shapiro explicitly because of his Jewish faith, or intentionally acted on Passover, but the circumstances of the attack, the images that have emerged, and what is publicly known of his motive have raised fears in Pennsylvania’s Jewish community at a time when many already already feel vulnerable.
Since the beginning of the conflict in Gaza that began with Hamas’ attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, and the emergence of a protest movement opposing Israel’s campaign that’s estimated to have killed more than 50,000 Palestinians, debates over what constitutes antisemitism and how institutions and governments should respond have been thrust into the center of American politics. And the Trump administration has used the specter of antisemitism to justify some of its most divisive policies.
In the state that bore witness to the deadliest antisemitic attack in American history in 2018 at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh’s Squirrel Hill neighborhood, the spotlight on Jews has left many feeling vulnerable. That sense was exacerbated following the attack on Pennsylvania’s highest-ranking Jewish official.
“A lot of the conversations I’ve been having are with people saying, ‘This is our worst fear confirmed,’” said Laura Cherner, the director of the community relations council at the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh. 
Cherner’s job, as she describes it, involves keeping a finger on the pulse of how Jews are responding to a reported rise in antisemitism incidents that accelerated following the outbreak of war in Gaza. Since the attack on Shapiro, Cherner has received dozens of calls.
“Often, Jews feel like a political football,” she added. “I think, ultimately, many feel like this is almost a confirmation of what we’ve been talking about. We’ve been trying to raise awareness and screaming from the rooftops of the increase in antisemitism.”

Urging caution
The state’s Jewish community has different views on whether the attack on Shapiro can be called antisemitic, but the imagery that emerged from it left an indelible mark.
“I don’t know a single Jewish family that wasn’t talking about it on the second night Seder,” said Andrew Goretsky, regional director for the ADL-Philadelphia. “What happened at Governor Shapiro’s residence, this has an impact,” 
For the members of the Tree of Life congregation in Pittsburgh, the photos from earlier this month of the burnt room triggered memories from the 2018 mass shooting that killed 11 people. 
“We’ve been in that room. Some of us have been there multiple times,” said Alan Hausman, the president of the Tree of Life Congregation, referring to the reception room in the governor’s residence. “No matter what the motivation is, it’s a difficult thing to look at.”
Following news of the attack, members of the congregation began writing a letter to express solidarity and support for Shapiro. But drafting it proved difficult, and Hausman had concerns with an early iteration.
Initially, he said, it focused too much on the circumstances and timing of the attack on Passover.
“I don’t think that’s important,” Hausman said. “What’s important is to tell him, ‘We’re here. We’re gonna help you get through this. We’re going to help you rebuild.’”
It’s part of a broader message he wants to get across: Don’t jump to conclusions about Balmer’s motive when so much remains unclear.
“There are people that immediately go to, ‘This is 100% antisemitic,’” Hausman said. “But we want to caution against that.”
Members of Hausman’s synagogue know better than most what an investigation into an attacker’s motivation can look like, and how to sit with both the knowns and unknowns. And Hausman worries that prematurely ascribing an antisemitic motive to the attack could cause undue panic and fear.
Shapiro has urged similar caution, refusing in interviews and press conferences to weigh in on whether Balmer should be charged with a hate crime until investigations play out.
But not all Jewish faith leaders share that perspective.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
At a synagogue only a mile-and-a-half from Tree of Life, Rabbi Daniel Fellman wrestled with the same questions over how to address the matter with his congregation.
He first heard about the arson attack when he got an alert on his smart watch during a service on the first morning of Passover. During that day’s prayer for healing, he said words for Shapiro and his family, and left it at that
But as more details emerged, he felt the timing of the attack, and the decision to target a vocally Jewish elected leader over an international conflict he has no control over, led to a clear conclusion.
So on the Friday after the attack, Fellman dedicated the majority of his sermon to calling out what he saw as an explicitly antisemitic attack.
“If you ask me personally, if Governor Shapiro was a good Lutheran, that firebombing wouldn’t have occurred in Harrisburg at the governor’s (residence). It just wouldn’t have happened, and we have to acknowledge that,” Fellman said. “People need to understand that was an attack not just on the governor and his family, but an attack on all of us here. And it was certainly an attack on the people of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.”

‘Outside Pressures’
For Fellman, the violence can’t be viewed in a vacuum. 
Since Hamas attacked Israel in the fall of 2023, and Israel responded by waging a war on occupied Gaza that has killed tens of thousands, Fellman has felt a need to speak out, including criticizing what he saw as Israel’s mistreatment of Palestinians.
His congregation includes both fierce critics and defenders of Israel. Most, he noted, are somewhere in the middle, which he defines roughly as believing in the country’s right to exist, while disagreeing with many of its actions. He is encouraging dialogue, even teaching a class on modern Israel that addresses history and politics.
“Jews are raised and nurtured on arguing for the sake of Heaven. We believe in discussion. We believe in debate,” Fellman said. “The difference here is the outside pressures that this has released … That has made this much more complicated for the folks in my community.”
Those outside pressures, he said, include people who he sees as conflating the actions of the state of Israel with a reflection of the desires of the Jewish community writ large.
Fellman, who describes himself as a moderate, says he sees that in the actions of pro-Palestinian protesters who have targeted Jewish students and businesses. And he sees it on the political right, where politicians have cheered on the punishment and deportation of critics of Israel in the name of opposing antisemitism.
“I think for most American Jews, we’re feeling the confusion and the unsettledness of it all,” Fellman said. “And the governor’s mansion being firebombed is just adding to that.”

‘Red herring’
In its 2024 audit, the Anti-Defamation League noted that around half of the more than 5,000 anti-Israel rallies contained antisemitic rhetoric. The ADL included justification of antisemitic violence, equating Judaism with Nazism and celebration of the October 7 attacks as antisemitic rhetoric or activity.
The ADL has been under scrutiny after its CEO, Jonathan Greenblatt, made comments conflating anti-zionism and antisemitism. But the group said its audit conforms with the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of antisemitism, which includes holding the Jewish people as a whole accountable for the actions of the Israeli government.

Ten days into his second term, President Donald Trump signed an executive order taking steps to combat antisemitism.
But for some Jewish people, those bring their own concerns.

Sen. Judy Schwank (D-Berks), co-chair of the Pennsylvania Jewish Legislative Caucus,  worries about what these measures will mean for the Jewish people in the future.
“Are we going to face the brunt of the anger of people about what the administration is doing?” she said.
Since the executive order, the federal government has arrested students who spoke out against Israel on the grounds that they were participating in antisemitic activities or even endorsing terrorism. 

This includes Rümeysa Öztürk, a Tufts University student from Turkey who was in the U.S. on a visa. Her apparent crime was co-writing an 2024 op-ed in her student newspaper urging her school to divest from companies with ties to Israel. 
Öztürk was approached and arrested by six plainclothes federal agents on a street near her home in Massachusetts and placed in an unmarked car.  Now, she’s in a detention center in Louisiana fighting her potential deportation in court. 
A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said that Öztürk engaged in activities supporting Hamas, the militant group that governs the Gaza strip and is deemed a terrorist organization by the U.S.. But an internal memo from the U.S. Department of State, reported by the Washington Post, said they found no evidence linking her to Hamas or engaging in antisemitic activities.

Security camera footage of Öztürk’s arrest went viral, and became a rallying call for critics of the Trump administration’s aggressive efforts to snatch and deport student visa holders for their roles in anti-Israel protests.
“I believe that agents within the federal government representing the Trump administration are calling out antisemitism, but it’s really just a red herring, an excuse to forcibly and maybe illegally remove people from this country,” Schwank said.
Following multiple lawsuits, the Trump administration reversed course and restored thousands of revoked student visas, but a federal lawyer told one judge that U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement is developing a policy for future revocations.
Rabbi Linda Holtzman, a member of Jewish Voice for Peace, argued that reports of antisemitism at pro-Palestinian protests have been drastically overemphasized, and that the narrative is being used to punish those protesting.
“What’s clear to me is that the Trump administration uses antisemitism in order to punish Palestinian rights activists who are trying to stop a United States-backed genocide … that’s where I see antisemitism being used in a way that’s illegitimate and inappropriate,” she said.
She worries that what she believes are false accusations of antisemitism obscure people’s ability to address legitimate concerns. 
Jonathan Goldman, chair of the Pennsylvania Jewish Coalition, does see a link between anti-Israel protests and rising reports of antisemitism.
“I believe it’s intellectually possible to have views that are anti-Israel — anti the state of Israel — and not be antisemitic,” Goldman said. “But man, is that slice of cake thin.”
Still, he opposes policies punishing foreign students who participated in protests without offering them due process, and of threatening universities where protests took place.
For him, the images of Öztürk’s arrest, and the crackdown on perceived political enemies more broadly, evoke darker times of Jewish history.
“I watched that video before bed, and then I watched it again the next day,” Goldman said. “Those are not Jewish Values … Historically speaking, Jews do well where a society is more free and democratic politically.”
But Goldman has spoken to some Jewish people who support the administration’s efforts to combat alleged antisemitism, but as he sees it, those tools can be turned on other perceived enemies.
“The Jewish institutions are scared, even the ones I’m representing,” Goldman said.
“What’s happening in the broader political environment is insane, and it’s affecting the way people are feeling with regard to this firebombing and the way people are acting and speaking with regard to it.”

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)No one complained when state regulators quietly allowed hemp-derived THC beverages to be sold in Rhode Island’s liquor stores late last summer. 
But now that state lawmakers are considering codifying the rules, the state’s cannabis cultivators and retailers are speaking out, saying the liquor industry is circumventing stringent guidelines they’ve had to follow to get their psychoactive products to market
A bill sponsored by Rep. Jacquelyn Baginski, a Cranston Democrat, would declare it legal for licensed distributors to sell beverages containing up to 5mg of delta-9 THC at liquor stores, bars, and restaurants. The bill would also increase the fee liquor wholesalers pay for the right to sell these products. Companion legislation is sponsored in the Senate by Robert Britto, an East Providence Democrat.
“The goal of my legislation is to get our arms around the sale of beverages that are already being sold,” Baginski said in an interview. “For every good actor and retailer who goes out and goes through the trouble of requiring that license, there are potentially one or two who have not done that.’”
Existing hemp rules allow the sale of delta-9 THC products such as gummies, lozenges, packaged baked goods, and beverages at licensed retailers. The state now has 120 hemp retailers and distributors, which include businesses headquartered in Colorado, Connecticut, and Massachusetts. 
Connecticut last July mandated THC-infused drinks only be available at state-licensed liquor stores and cannabis retailers. Massachusetts regulators, meanwhile, declared last May that intoxicating hemp-based products cannot be sold outside of cannabis retail stores.
Under Baginski’s and Britto’s bills, the annual fee paid by liquor wholesalers would increase from $500 to $1,500 to distribute delta-9 THC drinks under rules crafted by the state’s Department of Business Regulation. Bars and restaurants would have to pay $250 a year. 
Rhode Island’s seven cannabis dispensaries, meanwhile, pay a yearly $30,000 licensing fee to sell THC products. Those rules are based on regulations crafted by the state’s Cannabis Control Commission.
“Why is one held to all this high regulation, while the other is not?” Magnus Thorsson, a professor at Johnson & Wales University’s Cannabis Entrepreneurship Program, told Rhode Island Current. “It’s not fair and balanced.”
Mike Simpson, co-founder of Lovewell farms in Hopkinton, said he’s fine with liquor stores being allowed to sell hemp products in Rhode Island. He just wishes that hemp growers like himself had a say in the initial legislation.
“They completely left out the existing hemp industry, as if we don’t exist,” Simpson said in an interview Thursday. “This kind of not only feels superfluous, but also feels like they didn’t actually engage with the industry — I hope they’re open to hearing.”
Baginski acknowledged that she has not met with hemp industry leaders but said she is always willing to connect with them.
“I don’t claim to know everything, and I am happy to take all the feedback out there for me to absorb,” she said. 
Baginiski’s bill received its initial hearing before the House Corporations Committee on April 8, where it was held for further study as is standard practice during a first vetting by a legislative panel.
The state’s liquor industry is backing the proposal.










Why is one held to all this high regulation, while the other is not? It’s not fair and balanced.


–  Magnus Thorsson, a professor at Johnson & Wales University’s Cannabis Entrepreneurship Program


Rhode Island Liquor Operators Collaborative Executive Director Nicholas Fede Jr. said alcohol retailers are well-positioned to be part of the hemp-derived THC market. He told Rhode Island Current that store owners and staff are already trained to recognize the effects of intoxicating substances when interacting with customers.
“We have a long history of high product integrity,” Fede said. “We are the gatekeepers for public safety.”
Alex Nendza, director of marketing for Bottles Fine Wine on Providence’s East Side, understands the sense of resentment coming from cannabis dispensaries and cultivators but said he believes having more retail outlets will help the industry grow.
THC drinks already account for 10% of Bottles’ revenue. 
“It’s difficult to keep them in stock at times,” Nendza said in an interview. “Our shelves empty out pretty fast.”
Getting THC from CBD
Hemp has been legal at the federal level since 2018. Hemp-derived THC drinks were technically illegal in Rhode Island — at least until last August when the state’s Office of Cannabis Regulation began allowing the sale of products containing low levels of delta-9 THC at licensed retailers, which includes vape shops and liquor stores.
Beverages derived from cannabis continue to only be sold at licensed cannabis retailers. Hemp by itself produces little to no THC content and is typically non-psychoactive when first harvested, unlike other cannabis plants.
“It’s a molecule, and your body doesn’t make any discretion at all to where it comes from,” Stuart Procter, co-founder and lab director for cannabis testing facility PureVita Labs in West Warwick, said
The main difference is how the psychoactive compound is derived. 
Delta-9 is a naturally-occurring cannabinoid within cannabis plants. With hemp, it takes a little chemical magic to convert non-psychoactive CBD into THC. Methods include soaking the hemp material in a liquid like butane or ethanol, applying enough pressure and heat to extract THC compounds, or exposing the plant to acid.
“If all of the processes are done properly by chemists and people who know what they’re doing, you probably end up with a nice safe product which is absolutely identical to the delta-9 taken from marijuana plants,” said Procter, who chairs the Cannabis Advisory Board’s Public Health Subcommittee.
But because hemp testing rules vary from state to state, Procter said safety isn’t always guaranteed.
“There are very limited to no testing standards guiding hemp-related products,” he said. “If you were to bring hemp into the same regulatory protocols that would make sense — if they want to play in the same market, they should abide by the same regulations.”

Conflicting rules?
During the bill’s April 8 hearing, Baginski told lawmakers she was surprised to see hemp-based THC products available on the marketplace “and largely sold unregulated.”
“The intent of this legislation is not to make any changes to the existing structure of sales of marijuana-based THC, but to create a new safe marketplace for hemp THC beverages.”
But state regulators argue Baginski’s proposal could conflict with existing cannabis rules. 
Cannabis Control Commission Chairperson Kimberly Ahern wrote to the committee that the existing bill would revoke several existing hemp licenses and contradicts the state’s commitment to “building a robust cannabis economy.”
Hemp-derived THC products under Baginski’s bill would not be subject to the same testing, labeling restrictions, and additional safety protocols required under existing rules and upcoming regulations required for recreational cannabis.
“The absence of clear requirements for psychoactive hemp-derived products increases the risk of accidental overconsumption and potential exposure to vulnerable populations, including youth,” Ahern warned.
Ahern asked that the General Assembly hold the bill until regulators and industry leaders could discuss “alignment with the state’s broader cannabis and hemp regulatory strategy.”
Baginski said she’s open to making any necessary changes to the bill to ensure it aligns with existing regulations, adding that the goal of any legislation is to spark conversation and let the democratic process unfold.
“I do think it’s worth having a conversation about who we’re selling these things to and what exactly they are,” she told Rhode Island Current.

ISSAQUAH, Wash. — In the wake of recent natural disasters, state leaders across the country are finding that emergency support from the federal government is no longer a given.
Under President Donald Trump, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has denied federal assistance for tornadoes in Arkansas, flooding in West Virginia and a windstorm in Washington state. It also has refused North Carolina’s request for extended relief funding in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.
While it’s not uncommon for the feds to turn down some requests for disaster declarations, which unlock federal aid, state leaders say the Trump administration’s denials have taken them by surprise. White House officials are signaling a new approach to federal emergency response, even as Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem threaten to shut down FEMA altogether.

Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear says the state will appeal FEMA’s denial last week of assistance to some Kentucky counties affected by flooding in February.
The agency determined the severity and magnitude in those counties did not warrant assistance, says a letter from an acting assistant administrator in the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
FEMA denied public assistance for the February flooding to local governments in Simpson and Woodford counties, and individual assistance to six counties: Butler, Franklin, Knox, Laurel, Lawrence and Whitley.
In a news release, Beshear said 68 counties have been approved for public assistance and 16 counties for assistance to individuals. 
Meanwhile, Beshear announced that President Donald Trump has approved part of Kentucky’s April 11 request for a major disaster declaration stemming, which includes individual assistance for Kentuckians in 13 of the counties affected by the most recent flooding. 
The state’s requests for public assistance for 33 counties and hazard mitigation for the entire state are still pending.
Individual assistance has been approved for Anderson, Butler, Carroll, Christian, Clark, Franklin, Hardin, Hopkins, Jessamine, McCracken, Mercer, Owen and Woodford counties. The governor will request that additional counties be added to the declaration through an amendment once ongoing assessments are complete. 


“The Federal Government focuses its support on truly catastrophic disasters—massive hurricanes, devastating earthquakes, or wide-scale attacks on the homeland,” Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the National Security Council, which advises the president on issues of national security, said in a statement to Stateline.
Hughes said state and local governments “often remain an impediment to their own community’s resilience.” He called on states to take on a more extensive role.
“States must have adequate emergency management staff, adoption and enforcement of modern building codes, responsible planning and strategic investment to reduce future risk, commonsense policies that prioritize preparedness over politics, disaster reserve funds to handle what should be routine emergencies, pre-negotiated mutual aid and contingency contracts that speed up recovery, and above all, an appetite to own the problem,” the statement said.
Beshear says dismantling FEMA would be ‘disastrous’ though improvements need to continue

State emergency management leaders say the federal retreat from disaster response has upended a long-established system.
“This is very unusual,” said Karina Shagren, communications director with the Washington Military Department, which oversees the state’s emergency management division. “This is the first time in recent memory that we have hit all the indicators to get FEMA’s public assistance program and we’ve been denied.”
Michael Coen, who served as chief of staff at FEMA during the Obama and Biden administrations, said the president has “broad discretion” to approve or deny disaster requests, regardless of whether they meet specified conditions. If Trump intends to curtail federal support, Coen said, he should give states clear guidelines.
“They should have a dialogue with the states, so the states aren’t spinning their wheels making requests that are going to get denied,” Coen said.
He added that states need guidance if they’re expected to build emergency management programs to take on what the feds once handled. Not all states, Coen said, have the capacity to replicate those functions. And disasters are expected to increase in frequency and severity because of climate change.
“Having that capability in every single state instead of having one FEMA is not the best use of tax dollars to prepare for the worst day,” he said.
Historically, FEMA has coordinated the federal response during emergency situations. In the National Security Council statement, Hughes said Trump has promptly authorized “life-saving emergency support to states during and in the immediate aftermath of disasters.”
Some Kentucky Republicans echo Trump’s complaints about FEMA after latest flood

But the agency’s larger role has focused on recovery after disasters, assessing damage and distributing funding to help communities rebuild. Now, some communities are finding that support is no longer a sure thing.
Issaquah, Washington, was among the cities hit hard by the “bomb cyclone” that ripped through the state last November. Severe winds killed two people in the state, knocked out power for hundreds of thousands of residents and caused millions in damage, state officials said.
A city of about 40,000 residents in the Cascade foothills, Issaquah’s costs from the storm totaled $3.8 million — covering road repairs, removal of 800 tons of tree debris and overtime pay for first responders. Mayor Mary Lou Pauly said the city has seen four events since 2020 that qualified for federal disaster aid, with no previous denials. If Washington is unable to win its appeal with FEMA, she said, Issaquah will take a financial hit to its reserves, leaving it more vulnerable to future storms.
“We put a lot of investment in being resilient,” Pauly said. “When you get to a number like $3.8 million, that is too big of a number for us to be able to rebuild without assistance. Our residents pay federal taxes, and this is what they think they pay them for, this is what they expect their national government to do. They do not want me to set property taxes 100% higher.”
Pauly echoed Coen’s view that FEMA should give states a clear outline of the role it will play.
“What we all want to know is what are the rules of the game?” she said. “If the criteria has changed, then why aren’t we getting told about it?”
Washington state leaders said they were shocked when FEMA denied their request for $34 million to help repair roads, utilities and power systems. Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson said the state’s application met all of the “very clear criteria to qualify.” He has vowed to appeal the decision.
“We were really relying on that funding,” said Shagren, of the Washington Military Department. “If the appeal is denied, our local jurisdictions will have to prioritize which projects they can move forward with and which they don’t. They’re going to be impacted greatly. This wasn’t some small storm.”
Other states also have been surprised by FEMA denials. Arkansas suffered 14 tornadoes last month, triggering a request for a disaster declaration from Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders. But the feds told state leaders to handle it on their own.
“[I]t has been determined that the damage from this event was not of such severity and magnitude as to be beyond the capabilities of the state, affected local governments, and voluntary agencies,” the federal government’s denial read, according to Arkansas Times.
Sanders has appealed that decision, saying the disaster caused “widespread destruction” that requires federal help.
In West Virginia, state leaders asked for disaster aid to cover 14 counties that were struck by flooding in February. But FEMA denied individual assistance to seven of those counties. Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey said in a statement that he is looking at options to appeal, but praised the Trump administration for its “strong support” following the floods.
Democratic leaders in the state have called on Morrisey to demand more help from the feds, WOWK reported.
Meanwhile, FEMA has said it will no longer match 100% of North Carolina’s spending to recover from September’s Hurricane Helene. Democratic Gov. Josh Stein said the cost share was crucial to the state’s efforts to rebuild.
“The need in western North Carolina remains immense — people need debris removed, homes rebuilt, and roads restored,” Stein said in a statement this month, according to NC Newsline. “I am extremely disappointed and urge the President to reconsider FEMA’s bad decision, even for 90 days.”

(Photo by Melissa Sue Gerrits/Getty Images)As she briefed contractors about their upcoming bids to rebuild housing in western North Carolina last week, a state official laid out a candid assessment of the mission ahead.
“We need you, desperately, to build those homes and get people home,” said Angie Dunaway, the director of contracting for the NC Department of Commerce’s new team leading Hurricane Helene recovery efforts.
In early May, the state will begin fielding offers from companies to demolish, repair and rebuild homes destroyed by the deadliest storm in North Carolina history.
It is a monumental task in both scope and logistics. The western mountains will require “some special type of building,” Dunaway told contractors. And the capital involved will be immense — including more than $1.4 billion in federal money from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
At every turn, the process will be closely scrutinized. Mismanagement and accounting errors plagued the state’s home rebuilding program after Hurricanes Matthew and Florence. Years later, some of those homes are still incomplete. Furious state lawmakers have made it clear they have little patience this time around.
Gov. Josh Stein has taken a different route than his predecessor, former Gov. Roy Cooper, and spun up new teams to spearhead recovery for Helene. He and his top lieutenants have said they intend for those teams to be smaller and leaner — making private sector contracts all the more critical.
When contractors are selected and get to work, day-to-day operations will look different than they have in the east. State officials do not intend to pay to put up survivors in hotels except in “extreme” circumstances; newly-built homes will follow strict floor plans and timelines; and every interaction between homeowners and builders must be thoroughly documented.
HUD approved the state’s plan to spend its $1.4 billion on Friday — taking another step toward repairing and rebuilding more than 73,000 total damaged homes, and around 8,800 that are significantly damaged or totally destroyed.

Jonathan Krebs, Stein’s advisory for western North Carolina, told contractors they are aiming to be “swinging hammers at the first homes in July.”
State is leaning on contractors for rebuild. Here’s what they’re asking of them
Instead of hiring dozens of new state workers to oversee rebuilding efforts, Stein’s administration is bringing on a contractor to manage the day-to-day operations.
Bidding has been open for that role, referred to as the “implementation vendor,” since mid-April. That company, once selected, will open intake centers, identify projects and source them out to construction vendors.
State officials are aiming to contract around 25 companies for home demolition, repair and rebuild (hundreds of bids are expected). Those contracts will be for at least three years, but up to six, with one-year renewal options.
The constructors must be licensed in North Carolina, and will be selected based on a wide swath of criteria — but foremost, their ability to do “quality work, fast.”
“We want you out there building homes, as quickly as possible,” Dunaway told contractors.
Companies will indicate which types of projects they want to handle — new builds or repairs. They’ll be paid, through the state’s management vendor, based on a project’s phases being completed. Dunaway said it was the state’s intent “that all vendors will be paid the same thing for each project.”
After the contractor receives a “notice to proceed” — an OK to begin construction — they will have up to 150 days to complete the project. Unless they receive a state-approved delay, they’ll be charged $100 per day they go over that deadline. The deadline for each project will depend on its scale: some could include repairs to private roads or bridges on the property, which the state is also contracting for separately.
Newly-built homes will have a two-year warranty. The state needs companies to document that they’re financially sound to ensure they’re around for the duration of that warranty.
In eastern North Carolina, rebuilding dragged on in part because of customizable homes with various layouts. That won’t be an option for homeowners this time. The state is planning to have a limited set of layouts — two-, three- and four-bedroom floor plans, all with two bathrooms — that will be provided by contractors and reused throughout the program.
The administration is also doing away with long-term hotel stays that racked up costs and infuriated legislators during rebuild efforts in the east.
“Unlike previous programs, we are expecting the homeowners to figure it out in most instances,” Krebs told contractors. “Not every homeowner in every instance is going to be relocated at the state’s expense.”
Relocation will happen as a “last resort” and only in “extreme” circumstances.
The state is also requiring construction vendors to have office space on-site in western North Carolina. Dunaway cited state lawmakers’ request that there be a “visual presence” in the region.
“Some of my kinfolk even complained about y’all’s accent,” Rep. Karl Gillespie (R-Cherokee) told state officials in January, as he relayed frustrations from locals about Raleigh. “But if you’re on the ground, we’ll make allowances for your accent.”
The state wants contractors to be able to hold in-person meetings with homeowners if needed, and to thoroughly document every interaction with them. The managing company will plan to set up three offices across 39 counties — and all contractors are expected to provide “extraordinary customer service.”
“When you engage with those applicants, those homeowners, we are looking for it to be positive,” Dunaway said.
FEMA denied North Carolina’s request for permanent housing earlier this year
Earlier this year, North Carolina sought another avenue for rebuilding homes in the mountains — FEMA.
The agency’s housing assistance program offers permanent repairs or new construction for households after disasters, depending on specific circumstances and eligibility. North Carolina applied for that construction, but the request was denied by FEMA.
“[Permanent housing construction] would not be an appropriate form of direct housing as alternative housing options in North Carolina exist,” FEMA disaster recovery manager Brett Howard wrote in an internal memo sent to administrators Feb. 26 and obtained by NC Newsline.
FEMA identified 269 North Carolina homeowners eligible for direct housing assistance as of late February, according to the memo. Twenty-seven of those homeowners would have been eligible for permanent housing aid, but the agency found 85 available resources, including 47 FEMA-contracted properties, that the homeowners could use.

Stein’s communications director, Kate Frauenfelder, confirmed that the governor’s office had requested the program in January. FEMA told them they no longer had the authority to issue permanent housing construction “except in extreme circumstances.”
As of April 22, 5,298 North Carolina households are receiving rental assistance, according to joint state and federal data. Another 216 are in mobile homes or trailers; 31 are in FEMA-leased properties, and 18 are in hotels or transitional shelter.
FEMA did not respond to a request for comment on its denial of the program, which has not been previously reported. In a news release last week, the agency touted its grants sent to North Carolina and its communities since January.
The agency recently denied a request from the state to extend its 100% reimbursement rate for debris removal and emergency services. Those rates now stand at 90%. North Carolina is appealing that decision.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/mobilehome-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-28 06:04:15.832011

Community connection can also make a difference by reducing stress, isolation and feelings of judgment or shame. (Getty Images)In a moment, so much can change in a family’s life. 
A last-minute work schedule change that leads to relying on an unsafe babysitter. An unsupportive reaction from a bystander that could have been a connection point for support and kindness rather than further shame and frustration. A busy morning with medications left unattended and the toddler reaches up on the counter. A job loss that led to a relapse for a parent who struggles with substance use. 
Or a knock on the door from child protective services following up on an accusation of maltreatment.
Kentucky families face these real-life moments every day. And, the reality is, that last-minute change, that split-second decision, that dismissive reaction can be the key to safety or harm.
The latest national Child Maltreatment report cites that Kentucky has nearly double the national rate of child victims of maltreatment, with babies and young children remaining as the most vulnerable. It’s our tendency to think of those tragic child abuse cases featured on the news — but, when you further break down the numbers, over half of those substantiated cases were categorized as neglect. 
These families face substance misuse, domestic violence and economic stressors – all leading to deepened parental stress, mental health concerns and unstable living conditions. 
Kentucky’s Child Fatality and Near Fatality External Review Panel’s latest report further extrapolates the state of child safety. The most common cause of child deaths or near deaths in Kentucky: neglect due to access to deadly means or supervisory neglect, such as unsafe storage of firearms or of medications or illicit substances that then led to a tragedy. 
In nearly three-quarters of the cases reviewed, the family faced financial issues, and over half had substance misuse present in the home and two-thirds had a history of DCBS involvement. 
As business and faith leaders, elected officials, health providers, educators and just as good neighbors, we can play a role in supporting families in those moments of need and in all of those moments that lead to it.
What does that look like in practice? 
Most clearly, direct support, such as food and child care assistance, are proven to make a big difference in promoting well-being. When a family’s basic needs are met, parental stress goes down and child safety goes up — bottom line. 
If we know this and have a commitment to preventing child maltreatment in Kentucky, we must not jeopardize access to these critical supports for working parents struggling to make ends meet while juggling child rearing. For example, support in accessing safe child care is a “moment” that can prevent an incident of preventable abuse with an unsafe babysitter.
Next, when looking at the child maltreatment and fatality data, we can pull out some key moments in which a family is most vulnerable to their stress and frustration going too far — mainly in those critical first years of a child’s life. 
Babies are most likely to be victims, so let’s better equip new parents with tips on sleep safety and how to soothe a crying baby. Potty training can be a frustrating moment (or many, many moments) for parents and their toddler — let’s promote best practices in achieving that milestone. The HANDS home-visiting program and other voluntary parenting education courses can be a helping hand for parents to strengthen their skills and knowledge on developmentally appropriate expectations for their young children. 
Finally, when faced with challenging moments or even in those moments of joy that should be celebrated, community connection can make the world of difference in a family’s well-being. Parenting is tough, but everyday connections can reduce stress, isolation and feelings of judgment or shame. 
Connection is a small investment in time that can have a big impact. Consider helping a parent with their hands full of groceries and buckling seatbelts by returning their cart to the corral. Try sharing words of encouragement, not advice, to a parent at a park who is keeping their patience as their toddler tantrums. 
A simple “you’ve got this” to a parent can turn a stressful moment into a moment of connection and relief. 
As Child Abuse Prevention Month comes to a close, the Kosair for Kids Face It Movement encourages each of us to find those moments to offer support and connection so when those tough moments arise, families have resources, skills and community to lean on. 
Imagine how that can change a family’s life.

(Photo courtesy of Virginia DMV)Come May 7, your old Virginia driver’s license might not get you past airport security.
That’s the day the federal government will begin enforcing the long-delayed Real ID Act, requiring all domestic air travelers who use a driver’s license at TSA checkpoints to present a Real ID-compliant credential — or be turned away. If you don’t have one, and you’re planning to fly after that date, it’s time to act.
The Real ID Act was passed by Congress in 2005 in response to the 9/11 Commission’s call for tougher security standards on state-issued identification. Its goal is to prevent terrorists from using fake or low-security IDs to board planes or access sensitive government facilities. 
Initially, states were supposed to comply within three years. But privacy concerns, funding issues and political resistance caused years of delays. Even after all 50 states and Washington, D.C. became compliant by 2020, the Department of Homeland Security pushed back full enforcement — most recently citing a pandemic-era backlog of applications at state DMV offices.
Now, after multiple extensions, the Transportation Security Administration has set May 7, 2025, as the final deadline.
“With summer travel just around the corner, I would encourage all Virginians to take a quick look at their driver’s licenses and check for that star on the right-hand side,” U.S. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., said in an email. 
“The government has been clear that folks will need a compliant license to board an airline or enter a federal facility, so don’t delay – apply for a Real ID today.”
 Virginia: A mixed bag

While more than 4.1 million Virginians have already gotten a Real ID as of early April, that still leaves over 40% of license and ID holders in the commonwealth without one, according to the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles. 
In contrast, nearby states like Maryland and the District of Columbia boast a 99% Real ID compliance rate — among the highest in the nation, Axios reported earlier this month.
Virginia DMV officials say demand has surged in recent months, with thousands of Real IDs being issued each week. But they also warn that appointments and service centers are busier than usual, and that anyone considering travel after the enforcement deadline should not wait.
“Are you flying soon? You still have time to get your REAL ID!” the agency said in a recent social media post. 
 What it means — and doesn’t

Real ID is optional in Virginia. You’re not required to have one to drive, vote, or access public benefits. But starting May 7, it will be mandatory for boarding domestic flights and entering certain federal buildings, unless you have another form of federally accepted ID, like a passport, military ID, or DHS Trusted Traveler card.
That includes military bases, which may already be rejecting licenses marked with “Federal limits apply.” Requirements vary by installation, and base visitors are encouraged to confirm what ID is accepted before showing up.
Children under 18 don’t need ID when flying domestically with an adult, but adults without a compliant license or alternative ID won’t make it past TSA.
 Getting your Real ID

The process starts online, but you’ll need to visit a DMV customer service center in person to finish the job. The fee is $10 if you’re upgrading before your license expires.
You’ll need to bring original documents — no copies allowed — proving your identity and legal presence in the U.S. That could be a birth certificate or a valid passport. You also need your full Social Security number, either on a Social Security card or a W-2 form, and two documents proving your current Virginia residency. These can include a mortgage statement, utility bill, or rental agreement.
If your legal name differs from the one on your identity documents — due to marriage or divorce, for instance — you’ll also need to bring an official name change document, such as a marriage certificate or divorce decree.
DMV officials urge residents to check their current license’s expiration date. You can renew up to one year in advance, and if your license doesn’t expire for several years, you can still come in to get a Real ID replacement.
 Why the long wait?

The Real ID rollout has taken nearly two decades to reach full enforcement. Initially set to take effect in 2008, it faced pushback over cost, state-federal tensions and fears of government overreach. 
Later, the COVID-19 pandemic created long delays and service interruptions at DMVs across the country, causing a backlog that the Department of Homeland Security cited when it postponed the May 2023 deadline to 2025.
Real ID-compliant licenses and IDs are marked with a star in the upper right-hand corner — the visual cue TSA officers will be checking for starting this spring.
 Don’t panic, but don’t delay

Travelers who don’t have a Real ID can still use a valid passport, U.S. military ID, permanent resident card, or other federally approved form of ID. A full list is available on the Virginia DMV’s Real ID FAQ page.
But DMV officials stress that getting a Real ID is the most straightforward solution for anyone who flies domestically and wants to avoid last-minute surprises at the airport.
So if you’re planning to board a plane after May 7 and your current driver’s license isn’t Real ID-compliant, the time to fix that is now. Otherwise, you may find yourself grounded — before you even get through security.

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)With the 69th North Dakota Legislative Assembly finishing its business in the coming days, lawmakers elected members to the Legislative Management Committee to prepare for the next session and deal with any unfinished business.
The Legislative Management Committee has three primary roles during the interim before the 70th Legislative Assembly meets in January 2027. 
The committee decides which studies will be completed before the next legislative session and assigns them to the appropriate committees. They will appoint lawmakers to at least eight mandatory interim committees and additional committees, such as the committee tasked with being the North Dakota version of the Department of Government Efficiency, that were approved during the session. Lastly, the committee will accept the reports compiled during the interim.
John Bjornson, director of the Legislative Council, said up to 60 discretionary legislative studies and up to 15 mandatory studies are approved during each legislative session, and it will be up to the committee to whittle that down to a more manageable 45 studies in total and assign them.
“Then, they might not meet again for months,” Bjornson said.
The Legislative Management Committee also has the power to reconvene the Legislature with a majority vote, using any unused days remaining from their 80-day allotment. If Gov. Kelly Armstrong calls for a special session, the Legislature would not need to use the remaining legislative days. It’s anticipated that lawmakers may need to reconvene to address impacts from federal funding cuts.
Speaker of the House Rep. Robin Weisz, R-Hurdsfield, said the committee also elects its own chairperson that would have additional responsibilities during the interim, such as approving requests from lawmakers to attend meetings requiring travel reimbursement and working with the Legislative Council.
“Legislative Management doesn’t have any role in funding,” Weisz said. “We have an Emergency Commission, a Budget Section that will deal with funding issues outside of session.”
Bjornson said the Legislative Management Committee is expected to meet in June to decide which studies to pursue and make interim committee appointments.

At the time, none of the three New Hampshire residents had turned 18.
But each will be legally old enough to vote by 2026. And they say a new state law requiring them to provide hard documentary evidence that they are citizens, such as with a passport or birth certificate, is going to “burden” their “ability to register to vote.”
Now, lawyers for the three hope a judge will agree. 
They are part of a lawsuit against the recent state law, joining a diverse group of plaintiffs that includes the Coalition for Open Democracy, the League of Women Voters of New Hampshire, the Forward Foundation, and several individuals.
The lawsuit, brought by the American Civil Liberties Union of New Hampshire, alleges that House Bill 1569 is unconstitutional because it places an undue burden on voting by requiring documents that not all residents can easily access, risking disenfranchisement.
But as voting rights groups and the state of New Hampshire gird for potentially years of litigation, the plaintiffs face a more immediate question: Can they sue the state over a law that has not yet stopped them from voting?
Lawyers for the Attorney General’s Office, which is defending the law, say none of the plaintiffs — neither the prospective voters nor the organizations that say they are affected by it — are qualified to sue the state, a determination known as standing.
“Where is the direct impediment here?” Assistant Attorney General Michael DeGrandis asked in court. 
The new law took effect Nov. 11 last year, a week after the Nov. 5 presidential election, and has not yet affected any statewide elections. It was in place during the town meeting season this spring, and advocates say at least 96 people were turned away from voting as a result of not possessing the proper documentation. But so far, none of those 96 people has joined the lawsuit. 
Attorneys for the plaintiffs said under previous case law, the individuals and groups do not need to be directly disenfranchised to be harmed by the new statute.
“Those folks were injured as soon as the law was passed, as soon as the law came into effect,” Jacob van Leer, a staff attorney at the ACLU Voting Rights Project who is helping represent the plaintiffs, said at a press conference. “The urgency, I think, could not be more present here with the 2026 elections coming up.”
The arguments came to a head during a lengthy stretch of oral arguments in the U.S. District Court of New Hampshire last week. Judge Samantha Elliott is considering a motion by the state to dismiss the lawsuit entirely. Part of that motion is an argument that the law has not sufficiently harmed the people suing.
The fight over the new state law, which imposes the most stringent voter registration requirements in the country, comes as Republicans are pushing similar legislation on the national stage. On April 10, the U.S. House passed the SAVE Act, which would in part require hard documentary proof of U.S. citizenship for federal elections nationwide, but the bill is likely to struggle to overcome the 60-vote requirement in the Senate to escape a filibuster. 
Meanwhile, President Donald Trump issued an executive order on March 25 that directed the U.S. Election Assistance Commission to require proof of U.S. citizenship. On Thursday, Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly of the U.S. District Court of Washington, D.C., granted a preliminary injunction to temporarily halt that order. 
In the New Hampshire lawsuit, the plaintiffs say the state law will affect them in multiple ways.
McKenzie Taylor, the New Hampshire state director of America Votes, an advocacy organization, got married in 2024 and changed her last name; the name on her birth certificate is St. Germain, her maiden name. As of September, when the lawsuit was filed, Taylor had not updated her name on her passport or state driver’s license. In the lawsuit, she argues the new law would require her to do so in order to vote, a financial burden.
December Rust is an unhoused man living in Littleton without a passport or access to his birth certificate, who has argued he would not be able to easily obtain it. He has also argued that because the law eliminated challenged voter affidavits — which allowed people to cast a ballot even when an election observer challenged their citizenship or other qualification at the polls — he could be targeted by a challenge with no ability to defend himself. 
Each advocacy organization involved says the new law impairs their ability to carry out their missions, which include helping residents register to vote. 
DeGrandis argued each of the people or organizations suing is flawed. He argued the organizations have not sufficiently shown that HB 1569 is a threat to their missions.
“Open Democracy isn’t turning anyone away,” he said. “They’re providing this information. And if someone doesn’t have documentation, they’re saying you need that documentation. That’s not turning someone away, that’s advising.”
And he said the individual plaintiffs have not suffered injury from the law, and especially not injury with “actual or imminent concrete and particularized harm.”
“There’s a difference between preference and injury,” DeGrandis said. “That’s why the youth plaintiffs don’t have standing. They’re engaging in speculation regarding how the remedy would operate to remedy the harm that they allege.”
Elliott appeared skeptical of that critique. 
“I’m confused as to your confusion,” she said. “They complained that they would have to bring documentation, and with the remedy, they would not need to bring documentation.”
And van Leer said the organizations faced an immediate impediment in understanding the law. “We still have no idea what it means to need other reasonable documentation proving citizenship. It makes it impossible for these organizations to provide clear voter registration services to voters when they themselves don’t know what that means.” 
Lawyers for the ACLU filed the lawsuit early, in September, in order to secure an injunction against the new law before the next statewide elections in September 2026. The timing meant that none of the plaintiffs had been directly affected by the law when it was filed. But in court, they emphasized that a law can be blocked as unconstitutional even before it has disenfranchised someone, and noted that the lawsuit could proceed even if Elliott rejects some or even most of the plaintiffs, as long as she finds that at least one has standing. 
Elliott at times appeared to agree with the argument that at least some of the plaintiffs had shown a burden. 
“The issue is: What barrier does this law impose on voting?” Elliott asked. “In this case, the barrier that it imposes is this requirement to produce the identification.”
If the SAVE Act passes the Senate and is signed by Trump, or if Trump’s executive order survives a court challenge, New Hampshire could be required to participate in a national scheme very similar to HB 1569 — and one that would supersede that law and any block on it by a court. For now, attorneys for the plaintiffs say they are pushing the attempt to stop the state law from moving ahead.
“It seems like HB 1569 is a solution in search of a problem in ways that ultimately will require individuals to scrounge together very limited forms of documentation that many folks don’t have at all, and, even more, don’t have immediate access to in order to exercise their fundamental rights,” van Leer said at the press conference.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/voteridnh-1024x819.jpg,,,2025-04-28 05:03:22.975135

(Photo illustration by Scott Olson/Getty Images)  The Trump administration this month scrapped a Biden-era proposal that would have required state Medicaid programs and allowed federal Medicare to pay for some GLP-1s for obesity treatment. Instead, state Medicaid programs will retain the choice of whether to cover the high-priced medications for their residents.
The drugs, which have historically been prescribed to diabetic patients, also help patients lose weight and have grown in popularity among doctors and patients. But they are generally too expensive for most people to afford without insurance.
While doctors and patient advocates say these drugs are critical to helping patients struggling with obesity and can save money in the long run by reducing comorbidities such as heart disease, others say the medications are just too expensive for most states to afford. More than a dozen state Medicaid programs have opted to cover GLP-1s for obesity treatment, and the proposed Biden rule would have asked all states to figure out how to pay for them. But now, advocates fear these drugs may continue to be out of reach for many.
“It’s unfortunate that they’re excluding a whole class of medications that seem to have a tremendous number of health benefits to patients,” Dr. Nicholas Pennings, chair of family medicine at Campbell University in Buies Creek, North Carolina, said in an interview.











I think that’s just part of the inherent bias towards the treatment of people with obesity.


– Dr. Nicholas Pennings, chair of family medicine at Campbell University



GLP-1s, which stand for glucagon-like peptide-1, are a class of drugs that balance blood sugar levels. They’ve long been prescribed to patients with Type 2 diabetes. But since the drugs also curb hunger signals, doctors may prescribe these drugs — including popular brands Wegovy and Ozempic — to help patients lose weight.
Medicaid is a joint federal-state funded program that mostly serves people with lower incomes under the age of 65 or who have a disability. The federal Medicare program focuses primarily on people above the age of 65, no matter their income.
How and whether to cover expensive treatments and drugs can be a significant deliberation for state Medicaid directors. In North Carolina, where 70% of people struggle with being overweight or obese, officials opted to begin covering the drugs for weight loss last year. That coverage has been a game changer, said Pennings, who continues to treat Medicaid patients.
“They are expensive, but there’s a lot of other medications that are expensive too. Why is it that obesity medications and diabetes medications are being selected out?” Pennings said. “I think that’s just part of the inherent bias towards the treatment of people with obesity, feeling like it’s cheating or not necessary.”
The list price for Wegovy is around $1,300 per month, and for Ozempic, around $1,000. Even so, the skyrocketing popularity of these drugs has prompted at least 14 state Medicaid departments to begin covering these drugs to treat obesity in the past decade.
In addition to North Carolina, those states include California, Delaware, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Virginia and Wisconsin.
An annual survey of Medicaid directors from health policy research group KFF recently found that half of the 47 responding states not already covering the drugs were considering doing so.
As demand for weight-loss drugs rises, states grapple with Medicaid coverage

In January, the National Association of Medicaid Directors told the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services that state Medicaid departments had “significant concerns over the fiscal impacts” of the Biden proposal to require coverage of GLP-1s, and “strongly recommend that CMS maintain the current state option to cover or not cover anti-obesity medications.”
But others say covering the drugs will yield long-term savings.
John Cawley, a professor of economics and public policy at Cornell University who has studied the economic impacts of obesity, has found that obesity essentially doubles a person’s annual health care costs due to comorbidities such as heart disease, fatty liver disease and kidney disease.
He’s found that weight loss among those with extreme obesity, with a BMI of 40 or higher, can yield substantial reductions in medical care costs.
Cawley added that state Medicaid programs “have a lot of flexibility” in ensuring costs don’t get out of control, by, for example, covering a newly available generic version of GLP-1s, requiring prior authorization, and asking patients to try behavioral programs before getting a prescription.
North Carolina’s Medicaid department began covering GLP-1s for obesity in August. The state has been able to afford GLP-1 coverage by negotiating rebates, or discounts, with drug manufacturers, and by getting the federal government to cover some costs. Department leaders think lowering obesity will save the state money in the long run, said Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for North Carolina Medicaid.
He said that one of the benefits of Medicaid is that “we get to choose, as a state, where we want to make kind of those extra investments or not.” He added that covering the medications could be potentially financially feasible for other states.
“Each program is different and has its own pressures. It would be welcome to be able to come together with other states to be able to negotiate broader deals,” Ludlam said. “If North Carolina is able to get a good deal, I don’t know why other states wouldn’t be able to participate in that.”
States consider high costs, possible savings of covering weight-loss drugs for their workers

In 2023, Connecticut enacted a law requiring Medicaid to cover obesity treatment services. The program began covering GLP-1s for weight loss, but costs were significant enough that the state told providers this year that it is now focusing on other obesity treatments instead.
Sean Scanlon, the Connecticut comptroller, said that not covering GLP-1s is “shortsighted, bad policy.” The state health plan, which takes care of teachers and other state employees, has been covering the drugs for weight loss since 2023. The plan controls costs by only prescribing GLP-1s after patients go through some online weight-loss counseling, said Scanlon.
“The most fiscally conservative thing we can do is give people tools that will save the taxpayers money in the long run,” he said in an interview. “And GLP-1 drugs are one of the best tools that we have to ensure that the taxpayers are not going to pay more money for the health care of hundreds of millions of people in the long run.”
It’s unclear whether the federal government will reverse course. In the past, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has recommended “three good meals a day” and behavioral changes rather than weight-loss medication.
But this month, Kennedy told CBS News he’s considering a regulatory framework to have Medicare and Medicaid cover these “extraordinary drugs” in the future, once their cost goes down.
“Ideally, over the long-term, we’d like to see those drugs available for people after they try other interventions,” Kennedy said.

(Getty Images)A Louisiana lawmaker says he wants to avoid the scenario that unfolded last year in Alabama, where clinics offering in vitro fertilization closed their doors rather than risk legal liability based on a new interpretation of a 19th century law.
The matter has pitted some conservative Republicans, who normally take the same side on reproductive health issues, against one another. It also provides a glimpse into the national debate over IVF, which proponents fear could be threatened under Trump administration policy.
Sen. Thomas Pressly, R-Shreveport, received committee approval Tuesday for Senate Bill 156, which he said “is essential for IVF to continue in Louisiana.” But the proposal’s language had to be massaged to get the backing of one staunch anti-abortion lawmaker. Even then, the measure is still opposed by the state’s top two anti-abortion groups.
Senate Health and Welfare Committee member Rick Edmonds, R-Baton Rouge, stood firm on making a change to the definition of embryo in Pressly’s proposal. As a state representative, he authored a 2016 law to prohibit abortions for genetic abnormalities.
Originally, Pressly’s bill referred to an “in vitro fertilized human embryo” as one that “has certain rights granted by law … and organized that it may develop in utero into an unborn child.” Edmonds amended the proposal to define an embryo as “biologically human,” removing any reference to whether it actually develops into a child.
These seemingly subtle differences in language could become critical if its final version creates a situation similar to what happened last year in Alabama. Its state Supreme Court ruled in February that frozen embryos outside the womb are considered children under the law, citing an 1872 statute that allows lawsuits for the wrongful death of a child. Fearing potential legal consequences from embryos that become nonviable – even through no fault of their own – IVF clinics in Alabama shut down.
The Alabama Legislature then scrambled to approve civil and criminal protections for IVF providers, leading clinics to reopen. There remain concerns, however, over whether long-term access will remain available.
The Trump administration’s cuts to federal health care programs have served to reinforce such worries about the future of IVF. Staff reductions at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will curtail research into IVF and other fertility treatments, experts say.
The changes have unfolded rapidly, even though Trump referred to himself as the “fertilization president” after signing an executive order last month to expand fertility treatment access. A separate order from Trump in February sought policy direction on IVF, yet Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency went ahead with the CDC attrition plans.

Anti-abortion groups back status quo
Louisiana Right to Life and Louisiana Family Forum oppose Pressly’s bill. Both groups were at the forefront of creating one of the nation’s strictest abortion bans three years ago after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade. The landmark 1973 opinion declared women have a constitutional right to an abortion, but it also said states could regulate when the procedure is allowed. With the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision in June 2022, justices removed the federal right to an abortion and opened doors to outright state bans.
During Tuesday’s committee hearing, Pressly insisted his proposal was essential to ensure IVF remains available to 1 in 6 families that struggle with infertility, citing numbers the World Health Organization has used. It has been nearly 40 years since Louisiana has updated its IVF statute, and health technology improvements in the interim need to be reflected in the law, the senator said.
Kathleen Benfield, legislative director with Louisiana Family Forum, told the committee the Pressly proposal is unnecessary because the state’s IVF law has never been challenged.
“Not one example has been given where the practice of in vitro fertilization or any other artificial reproduction technology has been threatened (in Louisiana), and I don’t think it will be threatened,” Benfield said.
Even with Edmonds’ amendment, the bill’s language was still problematic for Benfield. She took issue with describing a “viable in vitro fertilized embryo” as a “juridical person,” or an entity that has the same rights in law as a person but is not a human being.
Put another way, Pressly’s bill doesn’t go nearly far enough to treat embryos as children, according to Benfield. A juridical person is “not the same thing as a natural person,” she said.
Last year, anti-abortion forces pushed to change to an IVF protection bill Rep. Paula Davis, R-Baton Rouge, sponsored. She shelved her bill when rather than include the term “biological human beings” in it, fearing it could lead to criminal consequences for reproductive care providers.
Davis has authored another version of her bill this year, but it has yet to be scheduled for a House committee hearing in the lawmaking session that ends June 12.
Erica Inzina, policy director for Louisiana Right to Life, said the state’s current IVF law has room for improvement, but it still offers the most protection for human embryos of any state. Pressly’s bill would weaken those safeguards, she said.
“It leaves the embryo looking a lot more like a thing rather than a person,” Inzina told the committee.
‘We’re quibbling’
The proposed changes are the product of a rather unusual partnership: Pressly, who gained approval for a first-of-its-kind abortion drug restriction; and Katie Bliss, an attorney whose firm specializes in in vitro fertilization contracts.
Pressly, who joined the Senate last year after four years as a state representative, authored a law in 2024 that treats mifepristone and misoprostol as Schedule IV controlled dangerous substances. Both medications are used in abortions but have other applications, including lifesaving ones. The Schedule IV status puts them on par with drugs that have addiction and abuse potential, meaning hospitals have to keep them under lock and key.
Some health care providers have said the added layers of security for controlled dangerous substances put women’s lives at risk when, for example, misoprostol is needed immediately to stop postpartum hemorrhaging.
Bliss has two children conceived through IVF. She said the revisions to existing law are needed to protect patients and physicians while also ensuring care for embryos.
Louisiana is the only state that’s made the destruction of embryos illegal, and conservative lawmakers have tried unsuccessfully in the past to stop patients from shipping embryos out of state for disposal. Such measures are unconstitutional, Bliss said, because one state can’t tell another state how to conduct business.
Sen. Alan Seabaugh, R-Shreveport, attempted last year to end embryo transports across state lines, but the amendment he tried to attach to another lawmaker’s bill was ruled irrelevant to the original proposal and therefore was not allowed.
Pressly said his bill covers this scenario because it would make any IVF contract null and void if it includes a provision for the intentional destruction of an embryo.
Edmonds also objected to the removal of the terms “married couple” and “parental” from a section of existing IVF law that deals with embryo donations. Instead, “person” is used to describe an embryo donor and recipient.
Pressly told Edmonds keeping “couple” in the law could create constitutional issues, implying it conveys bias against single people who want to start a family through IVF.
“It would be hypocritical for me to vote for a bill that would eliminate parental rights,” Edmonds said, though Pressly assured him his proposal doesn’t pose that threat.
Sen. Beth Mizell, R-Franklinton, shared with other committee members that she personally had a “horrible history of miscarriages” and feared her children would have the same difficulty. Through IVF, her son and daughter-in-law have given her three of her eight grandchildren.
Mizell said she had “a hard time finding obstacles” in a bill that gives more people the opportunity to start and grow families.
“I’m listening to pro-life people argue with pro-life people,” Mizell said, who then recounted efforts during her nine years in the Senate to put strict abortion laws in place. As a result, she said Louisiana has the strongest anti-abortion laws in the nation.
“… We’re there and we’re quibbling” over language to protect IVF, she said.

For the second time in recent weeks, a North Carolina Republican judge has courageously put the constitution ahead of their political party.
First, it was Supreme Court Justice Richard Dietz who rightfully dissented when his four Republican colleagues okayed a GOP effort to change election rules after the election in last fall’s disputed Supreme Court contest.
And last week, Superior Court Judge Lori Hamilton helped strike down a law passed by the Republican-dominated legislature last fall to seize powers from Gov. Josh Stein.
The law would have placed the auditor – in effect, the state’s accountant – in charge of appointing the state Board of Elections.
In rejecting the scheme, Hamilton wrote that the duty to faithfully execute the laws has been exclusively assigned to the governor and cannot be reassigned without violating the constitution.
Good for her.
The bottom line: In this time in which a handful of politicians are trying to seize and monopolize more and more power, courageous judges are a bulwark against despotism. North Carolina is fortunate to have two of them.

Santiago/Getty Images) Ripple effects of potential federal funding cuts have been spotlighted by advocates in essentially every sector, from the overall economy to school lunches and infectious diseases. But one such potential cut, and a proposal in the Ohio House’s version of the state budget, could directly impact an issue the state has been struggling to improve for decades: infant and maternal mortality.
Ohio has been near the bottom of rankings for infant mortality rates in the country, and has seen significant maternal mortality rates as well. With children making up one-third of national Medicaid enrollment and 40% of all births in the country covered by Medicaid, cuts to that program could mean even more struggles for the state’s children and mothers.
Part of the problem that already exists within the Medicaid system, specifically in Ohio, is a low reimbursement rate that results in some physicians refusing to accept Medicaid patients, and other facilities, like Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio, relying on donor support to compensate for the low reimbursement rates.
“Even when we talk about infant mortality, this Medicaid reimbursement rate is a huge factor in why the infant mortality rate is so abysmal,” said Erica Wilson-Domer, president and CEO of the greater Ohio arm of Planned Parenthood.
Of the patients who seek care from the facility, 43% are covered by Medicaid, which includes coverage for wellness exams, vaccines and cancer screenings, among other services, according to Planned Parenthood.
“I am deeply concerned about the potential cuts to Medicaid and what it will to do the overall health of Ohioans,” Wilson-Domer said.
She also pointed to rising rates of sexually transmitted diseases like syphilis as a timely reason to avoid cutting public health funding. A report from the Cleveland Department of Public Health showed an increase in syphilis case rates “across all age groups,” but individuals age 30-39 had the highest case rate from 2019 to 2020.
Male Cleveland residents saw a case rate of more than 150 per 100,000 residents in 2021, and cases in women, which had previously been “stable” from 2017 to 2020 nearly doubled in 2021, according to the Cleveland report.
Loss of care
Cuts in health funding, particularly Medicaid funding could not only impact those who are covered under the program, but also medical facilities across the state, even those who may not accept Medicaid.
“If there’s lost access to preventive care, that moves care to emergency rooms,” Wilson-Domer said. “Remember, it’s more expensive to go to the ER, and these patients don’t have the ability to pay, so the burden is on the hospital.”
Those who may have commercial insurance will see impacts too, if ERs are now filled with those who no longer have Medicaid coverage. Wait times could increase for everyone, even those who go to emergency rooms for truly emergent issues, Wilson-Domer said.

State funding decisions in the Ohio House budget proposal could add to the uncertainty, as the House absorbed a proposal from Gov. Mike DeWine’s executive budget to cut Group VIII, or the Ohioans who are part of the Medicaid expansion program, if the federal contribution to Medicaid drops below 90%.
Advocates have said that will leave around 770,000 Ohioans without health insurance, leaving them with few options for care.
As discussions pop up on the federal side about encouraging women to have children through one-time funds, lowering of funding in the Medicaid program could result in more women delaying care and impacting their pregnancy because of a lack of access to the health care they need.
With the reimbursement rate low, and the potential for cuts to the state program if federal Medicaid contributions are lowered, pregnant individuals and their children could face an uncertain future.
“What ends up happening, there’s a newly pregnant person on Medicaid, but they can’t find a provider who will see them, and so they don’t end up being seen until later in the pregnancy,” Wilson-Domer said.
If the pregnant individual develops conditions like gestational diabetes or other treatable conditions, a delay in care could mean it’s too late to treat those conditions.
“If we want to really impact the maternal mortality and the infant mortality rate … what we need to do is increase the reimbursement rate so people will want to see these patients,” according to Wilson-Domer.
Reproductive health
The GOP fight over reproductive health has led to a slashing of “family planning” grants at the federal level impacting Title X funds, talk of national abortion bans, government websites on reproductive health being taken down and threats of defunding Planned Parenthood all together, which all tie in to discussions about reducing medical care for low-income families through Medicaid, according to advocates.
A study by the Gender Equity Policy Institute found that those living in states with abortion bans were nearly 2 times as likely to die during pregnancy, child birth or shortly following birth, compared to states that allow abortion.
The maternal mortality rate worsens for Black mothers in states with bans, with the GEPI finding those mothers were 3.3 times more likely to die compared with White mothers in the state.
“Even before abortion was outlawed, the states that subsequently banned abortion had worse outcomes on key indicators of reproductive health,” the GEPI stated.
Ohio couldn’t enforce the six-week ban that was put in place in 2019 because of court challenges, but once Roe v. Wade, the U.S. Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion nationwide, was overturned, Attorney General Dave Yost quickly sought for a court to break the ban of its court challenges, which a federal court did.
The six-week abortion ban was in effect for a short time before abortion rights advocates sued to get the ban struck down. Enforcement is currently stopped once again, after a Hamilton County Court sided with abortion clinics and advocates that the new constitutional amendment passed in November of 2023 gave abortion rights to Ohioans.
The court’s decision is currently under appeal with the First District Court of Appeals, but Yost has said he’s not appealing the decision to strike down the abortion ban, but instead argues other parts of the court decision overreach to the state laws that regulate reproductive health and abortion services.
Other provisions in Ohio law that impact abortion services have been overturned in court, like a 24-hour waiting period required before abortion services could be conducted, and another rule against virtual visits to provide medication abortion services.
Wilson-Domer said Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio and their supporters “continue to bang our heads against the wall with legislators” to inform them that the health and Medicaid services dollars are “critical,” that the loss of those funds would impact all Ohioans, and that current laws that regulate such services at health clinics that also provide abortions are not only unconstitutional, but unhelpful.
“What we seek to do is provide a safe space for people to get good medical care that they need,” Wilson-Domer said.

An advocate for immigrants said it’s a bad idea to house them in facilities built for people accused of committing crimes.
Trump ran on false claims that migrants commit high rates of crime and on promises that he would deport millions. 
But mass deportations are a lot harder than Trump made it sound. And his administration is reclassifying people who came legally and asking help from local law enforcement as it tries to live up to his promises.
One way it’s done that is by signing contracts with sheriffs to house detainees in county jails. 
So far in Ohio, ICE has contracted with Seneca, Mahoning, Butler, and Geauga counties, said Lynn Tramonte of the Ohio Immigrant Alliance. It has also contracted with Corrections Center of Northwest Ohio, a multi-county jail, and Northeast Ohio Correctional Center, a private prison in Youngstown, she said.
Trump might act as if it’s a crime to be in the United States without documents, but it’s not, according to the American Civil Liberties Union.
“The act of being present in the United States in violation of the immigration laws is not, standing alone, a crime,” it said in an issue brief.  “While federal immigration law does criminalize some actions that may be related to undocumented presence in the United States, undocumented presence alone is not a violation of federal criminal law. Thus, many believe that the term ‘illegal alien,’ which may suggest a criminal violation, is inaccurate or misleading.”
What is a crime is illegal entry — coming into the country without declaring it to authorities.
“Entering the United States without being inspected and admitted, i.e., illegal entry, is a misdemeanor or can be a felony, depending on the circumstances,” the ACLU said. “But many undocumented immigrants do not enter the United States illegally. They enter legally but overstay, work without authorization, drop out of school or violate the conditions of their visas in some other way. Current estimates are that approximately 45% of undocumented immigrants did not enter illegally.”
Trump is trying to deport many of those people, in addition to trying to revoke protections of those who came legally under temporary protected status, or by using the CBP 1 app. 
Tramonte said county slammers are not the place to hold migrants.
“We are literally putting people who are not charged with crimes in a criminal jail,” she said in an email. 
She listed what she believes are some of the harms: “Taking them away from their families, jobs, and communities, making them rot in jail, while their immigration cases are pending. Making it harder for them to work with lawyers and win their cases. In the United States, you can be eligible for deportation and legal status at the same time. It’s up to the courts to figure out which way to go.”
Several Ohio counties contracted with ICE to house migrants during the first Trump administration. There were some problems.
Detainees complained of mistreatment by jail staff. And at one point, the jail in Morrow County had a 100% covid infection rate.
Tramonte warned that taxpayers were on the hook to defend the lawsuits that were filed during the first Trump administration and likely would be again.

(Getty Images)Let me tell you the story of the sex raft.
Back in 1973, anthropologist Santiago Genovés conducted an astonishing social experiment. He picked a crew of men and women to pilot a custom-built raft through the Atlantic Ocean for months, beginning in Spain’s Canary Islands and ending in Mexico. Genovés sought nothing less than an understanding of fundamental human conflict, with the hopes of advancing world peace.
And goodness gracious, did he have hypotheses about what would happen.
The Guardian newspaper reported an array of his deranged thoughts: “Most conflicts are about sexual access to ovulating females.” “I believe that in a dangerous situation people will act on their instincts, and I will be able to study them.” “Maybe men will become more frustrated when women are in charge, and try to take over power.”
Genovés approached the mission with all the misguided confidence of politicos in the Kansas Statehouse and Washington, D.C. Like him, these power-hungry men believe they can manipulate and persuade members of the public into being their willing dupes. Like him, they believe they can avoid negative consequences while reaping personal benefits. Also like him, I believe they’re going to end up sorely disappointed.
To make a dramatic story short, none of Genovés’ predictions proved correct. Those on the raft, which was actually named the Acali, got along perfectly well. Crew members did have some sex, but they generally focused on survival and working together. This infuriated the researcher, who regularly tried to stir up drama on board, at one point firing the woman he had chosen as captain.
He wrote in a journal: “I can tell that violence is present deep down in their unconscious, but so far it is resting under the surface.”
Eventually, the crew rebelled. They reinstated the previous captain and Genovés fell into a deep depression, exiling himself below decks and musing about how his own desire for control had led to such a colossal failure. (He also hated the “sex raft” nickname given to the expedition by sarcastic journalists.)
What he didn’t understand was that the sex raft expedition had been a success — just not in the way he imagined. The surviving crew members told a documentarian in 2019 that they found a common cause and mission through the voyage. Some had escaped domestic violence and racism. The barely controlled environment actually gave them a supportive community. Some members apparently even considered offing Genovés together.
I’ve been thinking about the sex raft a lot lately, because I’m a sucker for hope and we’re living through less-than-hopeful times.
Maybe Kansans and Americans will fight among themselves while the country burns, not taking a moment to step back and assess the situation. Maybe elected officials and fundraisers and consultants and messaging gurus have all the information they need to perfectly manipulate us one way or another.
But perhaps not. Take property taxes. Republicans expanded their supermajorities in the House and Senate with promises to lower the sales tax burden on Kansans. What did they end up doing during the session? Next to nothing.
Members might think that Kansans weren’t watching. I can tell them firsthand that the crewmates on raft Sunflower noticed. On Thursday, Kansas Reflector staff appeared at the Trails That Connect Us event in Lawrence. The gathering featured beer, entertainment and various community organizations. I spoke at length to one reader who definitely had noticed the lack of action on property taxes.
He saw. He understood. He felt frustrated.
Likewise, Kansas politicians sent a constitutional amendment to voters that would change the selection process for Kansas Supreme Court justices. They clearly hope to reverse rulings on abortion and school finance that have forced the state to respect reproductive rights and fully fund education.
Leaders didn’t talk about the amendment that way during the session, though. They hailed voice of the people — never mind the fact that people already had their say and supported abortion access. Do they expect the crew of our Sunflower raft to sit back and listen to spin from only one side?
“We all know elections are not for sale,” Rep. Susan Humphries, R-Wichita, said during the amendment, echoing some of Genovés’ weirder proclamations.
People are smarter than officials believe. Just like the folks who navigated the Atlantic more than a half-century ago, we look out for one another. We don’t seek conflict. We want to work together.
We may disagree on matters big and small. But I like to think that if you threw us all aboard a raft, we would find a way to cooperate. We would support people who knew what they were doing. We would contribute what we could, because that’s how you survive.
And we would steer through the tumultuous waves together.

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)I was born with Muscular Dystrophy, I’ve always been in a wheelchair, and I’ve always held a job. Medicaid Buy-In supports my healthcare needs and enables me to remain employed. 
Many think Medicaid is simply government-subsidized health insurance, but for me, and millions of others like me, it is so much more. It allows me to live independently in a home that I own. It pays for modifications like a ramp and roll-in shower that make life’s routines easier.   
Most importantly, Medicaid pays the wages of my caregivers who support my personal care needs and household tasks. As a 59-year old, it enables me to stay employed, leave the house, and live a fulfilling life. Without it, these things would be impossible because I would be stuck in bed with no one to care for me.   
Congress is currently considering significant cuts to Medicaid. The House and Senate have passed a joint budget resolution, calling for the House Energy and Commerce Committee to make $880 billion in cuts and the Senate Finance Committee to make $1.5 trillion in cuts to its programs – requiring large cuts to Medicaid. 
Currently, House and Senate committees are working to decide where and how much to cut. Any cuts or barriers to enrollment will have cascading impacts across the United States, putting the health and independence of Medicaid beneficiaries at risk.  
For those of us living with neuromuscular diseases, Medicaid allows us to plan for long-term care.
 If Medicaid suffers funding cuts, the consequences will be significant. We will likely face delayed treatments, be unable to afford life-saving medication, and have increased difficulty affording the homecare assistance that we need to be healthy and fulfilled. 
Medicaid is a pathway to better health outcomes, financial stability, and an overall higher quality of life. Preexisting health care issues, like lengthy home care waitlists, nursing shortages, and hospital closures are likely to follow as well, compounding the negative impacts.  
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Affordable and adequate health care is not a luxury; it’s a necessity. As the single-largest source of health insurance for Americans, it covers 72 million Americans. 
I am one of nearly 3 million Ohioans who rely on Medicaid daily. In Columbus and across Ohio’s 3rd Congressional District, where I live, 23.9% of our residents are enrolled in Medicaid — compared to the national average of 22.7%. This increased vulnerability puts many beneficiaries at risk of life-altering consequences.  
I deeply fear for the outcomes of others who depend on the service. It covers 2 in 5 adults with a disability, 2 in 5 births, and 2 in 5 children. Whether or not you are on Medicaid, chances are that someone you love needs it. 
Potential cuts will directly or indirectly impact nearly every single Ohioan. As Congress moves forward deciding what pieces of the federal budget get cut, I hope that Medicaid remains safe.  
For many Ohioans, there are no other opportunities to receive the health benefits, services, and treatments that we need besides Medicaid. If cuts are made, we will have to make difficult decisions about how to pay for the healthcare we need. 
I need Ohio U.S. Sens. Moreno and Husted to know that the lives of real Americans like me and so many others are in real danger if Medicaid budget cuts are enacted. Ohioans rely on Medicaid to live fulfilling and free lives. Please act in the best interest of those you represent.

ISSAQUAH, Wash. — In the wake of recent natural disasters, state leaders across the country are finding that emergency support from the federal government is no longer a given.
Under President Donald Trump, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has denied federal assistance for tornadoes in Arkansas, flooding in West Virginia and a windstorm in Washington state. It also has refused North Carolina’s request for extended relief funding in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.
While it’s not uncommon for the feds to turn down some requests for disaster declarations, which unlock federal aid, state leaders say the Trump administration’s denials have taken them by surprise. White House officials are signaling a new approach to federal emergency response, even as Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem threaten to shut down FEMA altogether.
“The Federal Government focuses its support on truly catastrophic disasters—massive hurricanes, devastating earthquakes, or wide-scale attacks on the homeland,” Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the National Security Council, which advises the president on issues of national security, said in a statement to Stateline.
Hughes said state and local governments “often remain an impediment to their own community’s resilience.” He called on states to take on a more extensive role.
“States must have adequate emergency management staff, adoption and enforcement of modern building codes, responsible planning and strategic investment to reduce future risk, commonsense policies that prioritize preparedness over politics, disaster reserve funds to handle what should be routine emergencies, pre-negotiated mutual aid and contingency contracts that speed up recovery, and above all, an appetite to own the problem,” the statement said.
Trump wants states to handle disasters without FEMA. They say they can’t.

State emergency management leaders say the federal retreat from disaster response has upended a long-established system.
“This is very unusual,” said Karina Shagren, communications director with the Washington Military Department, which oversees the state’s emergency management division. “This is the first time in recent memory that we have hit all the indicators to get FEMA’s public assistance program and we’ve been denied.”
Michael Coen, who served as chief of staff at FEMA during the Obama and Biden administrations, said the president has “broad discretion” to approve or deny disaster requests, regardless of whether they meet specified conditions. If Trump intends to curtail federal support, Coen said, he should give states clear guidelines.
“They should have a dialogue with the states, so the states aren’t spinning their wheels making requests that are going to get denied,” Coen said.
He added that states need guidance if they’re expected to build emergency management programs to take on what the feds once handled. Not all states, Coen said, have the capacity to replicate those functions. And disasters are expected to increase in frequency and severity because of climate change.
“Having that capability in every single state instead of having one FEMA is not the best use of tax dollars to prepare for the worst day,” he said.
Historically, FEMA has coordinated the federal response during emergency situations. In the National Security Council statement, Hughes said Trump has promptly authorized “life-saving emergency support to states during and in the immediate aftermath of disasters.”
But the agency’s larger role has focused on recovery after disasters, assessing damage and distributing funding to help communities rebuild. Now, some communities are finding that support is no longer a sure thing.










They should have a dialogue with the states, so the states aren't spinning their wheels making requests that are going to get denied.


– Michael Coen, former chief of staff at the Federal Emergency Management Agency


Issaquah, Washington, was among the cities hit hard by the “bomb cyclone” that ripped through the state last November. Severe winds killed two people in the state, knocked out power for hundreds of thousands of residents and caused millions in damage, state officials said.
A city of about 40,000 residents in the Cascade foothills, Issaquah’s costs from the storm totaled $3.8 million — covering road repairs, removal of 800 tons of tree debris and overtime pay for first responders. Mayor Mary Lou Pauly said the city has seen four events since 2020 that qualified for federal disaster aid, with no previous denials. If Washington is unable to win its appeal with FEMA, she said, Issaquah will take a financial hit to its reserves, leaving it more vulnerable to future storms.
“We put a lot of investment in being resilient,” Pauly said. “When you get to a number like $3.8 million, that is too big of a number for us to be able to rebuild without assistance. Our residents pay federal taxes, and this is what they think they pay them for, this is what they expect their national government to do. They do not want me to set property taxes 100% higher.”
Pauly echoed Coen’s view that FEMA should give states a clear outline of the role it will play.
“What we all want to know is what are the rules of the game?” she said. “If the criteria has changed, then why aren’t we getting told about it?”
Washington state leaders said they were shocked when FEMA denied their request for $34 million to help repair roads, utilities and power systems. Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson said the state’s application met all of the “very clear criteria to qualify.” He has vowed to appeal the decision.
“We were really relying on that funding,” said Shagren, of the Washington Military Department. “If the appeal is denied, our local jurisdictions will have to prioritize which projects they can move forward with and which they don’t. They’re going to be impacted greatly. This wasn’t some small storm.”
Get rid of FEMA? Trump-appointed group to look at shifting disaster response to states.

Other states also have been surprised by FEMA denials. Arkansas suffered 14 tornadoes last month, triggering a request for a disaster declaration from Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders. But the feds told state leaders to handle it on their own.
“[I]t has been determined that the damage from this event was not of such severity and magnitude as to be beyond the capabilities of the state, affected local governments, and voluntary agencies,” the federal government’s denial read, according to Arkansas Times.
Sanders has appealed that decision, saying the disaster caused “widespread destruction” that requires federal help.
In West Virginia, state leaders asked for disaster aid to cover 14 counties that were struck by flooding in February. But FEMA denied individual assistance to seven of those counties. Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey said in a statement that he is looking at options to appeal, but praised the Trump administration for its “strong support” following the floods.
Democratic leaders in the state have called on Morrisey to demand more help from the feds, WOWK reported.
Meanwhile, FEMA has said it will no longer match 100% of North Carolina’s spending to recover from September’s Hurricane Helene. Democratic Gov. Josh Stein said the cost share was crucial to the state’s efforts to rebuild.
“The need in western North Carolina remains immense — people need debris removed, homes rebuilt, and roads restored,” Stein said in a statement this month, according to NC Newsline. “I am extremely disappointed and urge the President to reconsider FEMA’s bad decision, even for 90 days.”

(Photo via U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement)Republican legislators are attempting to prevent local and state government and law enforcement agencies from adopting policies that would restrict them from assisting in the enforcement of federal immigration law.
When Rep. Michael Soboleski of Phillips presented LD 1656, which is co-sponsored by nine other Republicans, to the Judiciary Committee on Friday, he described the measure as sending “a clear message that Maine values the safety of its citizens and the partnerships that make that safety possible.” 
Those opposed to the bill argued it would subvert the balance of powers between federal and state governments and run afoul of existing state laws and the U.S. Constitution. 
If passed, government and law enforcement entities would not be able to “adopt or maintain a law, ordinance, resolution, rule, regulation, policy, directive, order, practice or procedure, formal or informal, written or unwritten” that prohibits or “materially restricts” the entity from complying with or assisting in the enforcement of immigration law. 
First Maine police department joins ICE partnership

Immigration law is defined in the bill as both state or federal law relating to immigrants or immigration, including but not limited to the federal Immigration and Nationality Act. 
Among the prohibited restrictions listed in the bill are preventing participation in any program authorized under the federal Immigration and Nationality Act, which includes U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s 287(g) program. 
The Wells Police Department in York County is the only department in Maine so far to enter into an agreement for that program, which allows its officers to arrest people on immigration violations in the course of routine work, an authority previously reserved for federal agents. Some in the community are calling for the contract to be terminated. 
While the Monmouth Winthrop Police Department, a combination of departments that serve central Maine communities, had also initially applied, the department withdrew its application due to community pushback.  
This restriction in LD 1656 appears to be in direct conflict with another bill, LD 1259, proposed by Democrats to prohibit state and local law enforcement agencies from entering into contracts with federal immigration enforcement authorities.
Soboleski said inconsistent policies regarding the sharing and use of information can undermine the overarching goal of enforcing the rule of law, as an example pointing to the benefits of cooperation between state and federal agencies in combating drug trafficking along the border.
Alicia Rea, policy fellow with the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine, said undermining state and local governments’ power to exercise discretion about law enforcement priorities in their communities would undermine the 10th Amendment, which enshrined the principle of federalism.
Rea also argued the bill could lead to violations of the Fourth Amendment, which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures, and the 14th Amendment, which addresses due process, by exposing state and local agencies to expensive litigation and potential civil liability. 
Community members request Wells Police terminate contract with ICE

Beyond official partnerships, LD 1656 would prevent state and local government and law enforcement from generally refusing to assist with immigration enforcement, preventing federal immigration officers from conducting enforcement activities in local jails and sharing information about a person’s immigration status. 
Those entities also couldn’t refuse to cooperate with an immigration detainer, defined in the bill as a “facially sufficient” request from a federal immigration agency. 
Facially sufficient, according to the bill, means either a completed, official form that indicates on its face that the agency has probable cause to believe a person is a “a removable alien” under federal immigration law, or an incomplete form that does not indicate probable cause but is supported by an administrative warrant that does. 
Unlike judicial warrants issued by a court, an administrative warrant is issued by a federal agency and does not permit authorities to enter a place where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy without consent. 
The top concern among Wells residents calling for the termination of the ICE contract is entangling their local police with the agency’s recent illegitimate enforcement. Rea pointed out to the committee on Friday that, according to ICE’s own records, the agency’s enforcement has not always been exact. For example, between 2008 and 2012, the agency issued detainers against 834 U.S. citizens and 28,489 legal permanent residents, or “green card” holders. 
LD 1656 would also establish a complaint process for members of the public to report any government or law enforcement entity to the state Attorney General for violating the restrictions set out in the legislation. 
If the Attorney General determines an entity is in violation, the officer would be required to issue an opinion and the entity would then have 30 days to appeal. If the Superior Court agrees with the Attorney General, it must issue an injunction and the entity would face a $500 daily fine for each day its practice remains in effect. 
The only person to testify in support of the bill on Friday, former Republican state representative Lawrence Lockman from Bradley, urged the committee to increase that penalty to $10,000 per day. 
While not opining on the immigration policy behind the bill, Julie Finn, analyst for Maine’s Judicial Branch, said the branch opposes the bill because of what she characterized as the  problematic legal process it proposes. 
It lacks an adjudicatory process, which would involve a neutral third party, Finn said. The Attorney General can only issue opinions on a question of law not on a question of fact, and only final agency action is generally appealable.  
Finn also raised concern about the bill’s ambiguity as to whether judicial marshals are included in the definition of law enforcement agency. 
She requested these positions be excluded, as their primary purpose is to provide protection and security for judicial branch employees and members of the public in a courthouse, not to investigate, apprehend people or enforce criminal violations. 
Immigration arrests in courthouses elsewhere in the country have led to growing concern that the work of local justice systems is being undermined by making immigrants fearful of coming to court. On Friday in Wisconsin, FBI agents arrested a Milwaukee County Judge, accusing her of obstructing an immigration enforcement action.
The co-sponsors of LD 1656 are Sens. Scott Cyrway and Dick Bradstreet, both representing parts of Kennebec County, and Reps. Richard Campbell of Orrington, Abigail Griffin of Levant, Gary Drinkwater of Milford, James Thorne of Carmel, Jeffrey Sean Adams of Lebanon, Katrina Smith of Palermo and Reagan Paul of Winterport.

(Stock photo by Birute/Getty Images Plus)Over 360,000 Catholics call Nebraska home. As a cradle, conflicted and often non-practicing version of that theology, I may have been part of that number. Suffice to say being contrary and asking questions is part of my DNA, a trait journalists find helpful. Perhaps not so much for those on a spiritual journey. 
Neither the current condition of my “lapseness” nor my contrarian ways matter much, however, when it’s clear that in a world awash in a rising tide of tough guys (and women) — whose dispassionate search of even greater power teems with toxicity — Pope Francis was a blessed bulwark against the further coarsening and dividing of humanity.
Most important was that he did so with grace, dignity and a sense of humor. Others may have formidable armies, the obedience of others borne of fear or the means and motives to take what they want. 
Life of service
Pope Francis had more: A true “power,” a spirit steeped in service, compassion and gentleness, a massive dose of which the world could use.
He walked the walk of gospel — perhaps his own brand of “wokeness” — focusing his servant ministry on those living on the margins of life, those with the least power, the smallest voices and the fewest options. Among them are the poorest of the poor, refugees and migrants and vulnerable members of the LGBTQ community. He preached the imperative that we must care for and restore the earth.
He famously skipped much of the papal pomp, which many of his more conservative and traditional predecessors preferred. He was also fearless in poking some of the church’s billion-plus members in their very Catholic ribs. His modern, progressive views never sat well with a number of bishops and cardinals. Nor was he averse to standing against the aforementioned world’s most powerful.
The scandal involving priests sexually abusing children changed him. By his admission, Francis said he was wrong when, on a visit to Chile, he defended an accused bishop. He apologized to the victims he slighted, set in motion an investigation, the result of which toppled the entire Chilean church leadership. Still, even though Pope Francis convened a summit of clergy in Rome to address the scandal, many believe he didn’t go far enough.
Willing to criticize
As a critic of the war in Gaza, Pope Francis’ death was barely acknowledged in official Israel, where the government offered condolences on social media, but later deleted them. Aside from being critical of Israel’s prosecution of the war, Francis suggested an investigation into Israel’s treatment of Palestinians as the war dragged on. The pope had spoken with a small community of Catholics in Gaza every evening since the war began. 
Francis also reached out to Muslim leaders, a prickly bridge too far for some among the faithful. He challenged the church’s views on the death penalty and in 2018 officially changed Catholic teaching, calling capital punishment ​“an attack on the inviolability and dignity of the person,” and ​“inadmissible” in all cases. He also altered the church’s stance on nuclear weapons, deeming them immoral, yet was often silent on Russia’s invasion of and war on Ukraine.
Other detractors have argued that while he promoted women in the church, he didn’t go far enough, elevating them to leadership roles at the Vatican but stopping short of calling for their admission into the priesthood.
Surely, for some, his legacy will be mixed.
Immigration was where he was most outspoken, admonishing world leaders — including the current U.S. administration — to find solutions to the massive displacement of people around the globe consistent with not only the gospel, but more broadly simple humanity. 
Where some see migrants as parasites and pariahs, Francis saw them as human beings. During what would be his last message, he said, “How much contempt is stirred up at times towards the vulnerable, the marginalized, and migrants! … I would like all of us to hope anew and to revive our trust in others, including those who are different than ourselves, or who come from distant lands, bringing unfamiliar customs, ways of life and ideas! For all of us are children of God!” 
I read a condolence for Pope Francis in the vast, ecumenical ethos of social media, followed immediately by a wish that his successor be anything but the aforementioned “woke.” Yes, God forbid the Vatican continue to challenge injustice, minister to outcasts and value the planet.
All of which makes me miss him already.

These are students with the most significant needs, students who deserve every opportunity to thrive, and who often rely on specialized supports to access a free and appropriate public education. Yet for years, the state and federal governments have underfunded this grant, shifting the financial burden onto local school districts and municipalities and leaving many communities struggling to meet both student needs and budget demands.
This year, the Connecticut General Assembly’s Appropriations Committee took an important step forward. The Connecticut Association of Public School Superintendents (CAPSS) extends sincere thanks to Sen. Catherine A. Osten, Rep. Toni E. Walker, and members of the Appropriations Committee for voting to approve an additional $124 million in each year of the biennium for the Excess Cost Grant. If enacted by the full General Assembly, this funding would, for the first time ever, fully fund the Excess Cost Grant for the 2025 – 2026 school year.
This is not just a budget decision; it’s a moral commitment. Fully funding the Excess Cost Grant ensures that every student, regardless of ability, can access the specialized instruction and services they need. It affirms our values as a state that prioritizes equity, inclusion, and educational opportunity for all.
It also provides tangible relief to local school districts and municipalities. Special education costs are unpredictable and, in some cases, extraordinary. When the state falls short in its obligation to share these costs, districts are forced to reallocate local resources, often at the expense of other programs or services. Full funding allows district leaders to stabilize their budgets, plan more effectively, and maintain the full range of supports their students and communities require.
This has long been a top legislative priority for CAPSS, as well as for Connecticut’s Special Education Task Force. We now urge the full General Assembly to act decisively to approve this investment. Doing so would demonstrate a powerful commitment to students with disabilities, to equity in public education, and to the fiscal health of our towns and cities.
Connecticut has the opportunity to correct a longstanding funding gap and to strengthen the foundation of support for our most vulnerable learners. Let’s seize this moment and fully fund the Excess Cost Grant.

Donald Trump’s executive orders and election have removed the sense of stability and security that many, but not all Americans had become accustomed to — much in the same way that a child relies on the safety provided by his or her parents in a home that feels safe and secure.

Howard Selinger, MD
Most Americans have lived for years, secure in the knowledge that our government by design, although not always in practice for all people, respects the rule of law and operates according to ethical principles of fairness and the pursuit of the common good.
That has now changed as this Trump administration embarks on reshaping the design of government checks and balances. 
There is undoubtedly a tremendous amount of stress being generated for millions of Americans who feel threatened financially, psychologically and societally. As a family physician, I have seen what stress can do to a person’s health. Stress  not only triggers flare-ups of underlying pre-existing conditions such as heart disease, emphysema, diabetes and other medical conditions but can also trigger serious episodes of mental illness including anxiety, depression, and even promote risks to oneself or others.
This is damaging governance. Job loss threatens healthcare affordability and sustainability for the individual and at great cost to the GDP of this country of lost productivity and output, certainly at odds with this administration’s purported claim to reduce the federal deficit. We must, as stated by Abraham Lincoln, preserve government “of the people, by the people, for the people.” Attacking diversity, equity and inclusion and gender affirming care is blatantly unethical and anti-democratic.
Estimates are that nearly 200, 000 individuals or four percent of the federal workforce will have their jobs terminated. Law allows for only 31 days of continued health coverage after job termination. Further maintenance of federal employee health benefits requires the individual to pay both the worker’s share and the government’s share  which would cost the employee for family coverage over $1,800 per month which is out of reach for most Americans.   
This federal behavior will inevitably harm our most vulnerable citizens.
Longer term, the threatened defunding of the Department of Education , the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the National Institutes of Health “indirect funding” support for critical healthcare research will degrade the health of our nation. Imagine handicapping the CDC’s ability to prepare for future pandemics, or to identify and prevent widespread food source contamination. State Medicaid programs have been targeted for significant funding reductions that will potentially cause millions of low-income and disabled Americans to lose their health coverage.
It is always the goal to deliver high-value healthcare and avoid unnecessary expenses. We teach this every day as we train future family physicians.
In the beloved story “A Christmas Carol” by Charles Dickens, Scrooge states that regarding the vulnerable population, “If they would rather die, they had better do it and decrease the surplus population.” This callousness is reflected in our present day presidential leadership. 
Diversity, equity, inclusion and the common good are the pillars of our democratic culture. We MUST raise our voices again and again to preserve these ideals. There is no other alternative.

Throughout the state, it is apparent that the ghosts of Connecticut’s industrial past remain. They loom over communities and are usually abandoned, dilapidated, and contaminated. The presence of these vacated sites creates environmental issues and safety hazards, and most importantly, they do not fix themselves. As Connecticut’s economy has shifted away from manufacturing textiles, firearms, clocks, and hardware, these crumbling structures are left behind.


These former factories, warehouses, and industrial properties are known as brownfields. A brownfield is a term for abandoned or underutilized sites that have yet to be redeveloped due to the presence or potential presence of pollution in the building, soil, and groundwater. These sites require investigation or remediation before development. 
In the past decade, Connecticut has focused more and more on brownfield redevelopment and understanding the importance of refurbishment. These sites, along with the effects they impose on communities across the state, create numerous issues. These issues range from environmental contamination problems of soil, groundwater, and pollutants to various social and economic issues like deterrence of investments, job creation, and reduced property values.

Jack Lambros
Connecticut’s initiative to redevelop brownfield properties is both an environmental plan and an innovative economic strategy. It aims to improve neglected urban spaces, attract businesses, create housing, and provide open spaces for the community.
This also revitalizes local economies and generates tax revenue, so why does this seem too good to be true? The cost.
The redevelopment of brownfields in Connecticut faces many obstacles because of cost. Most importantly, the environmental cleanup required to decontaminate these sites substantially heightens remediation costs. To ensure and prioritize safety, Connecticut enforces high regulatory standards even after a project’s completion, resulting in higher costs. The truth is, these buildings are so old that they remember when the term “environmentally friendly” meant we dumped it behind the factory, so significant cleanup is a prerequisite to development. 
A direct example of this issue is the setbacks in the plan for a new soccer stadium in Bridgeport. This plan envisions a brand-new 7,500-seat stadium and housing, a hotel, retail stores, and restaurant spaces. Due to the site’s former tenant, the AGI rubber factory, anticipation of soil contamination is expected, potentially requiring the soil to be removed entirely or rendered inaccessible. 
This is a challenging and costly project that will likely delay  the opening and projected spring 2026 kickoff for CT United FC.  
The Connecticut DECD is providing $8 million to expedite the process, and the 2025 session of the Connecticut General Assembly is working on the quest for an unspecified amount of state aid. The legislature aims to have a financial commitment by June, but will this be enough to make this vision a reality?
In December, Governor Ned Lamont announced state grants for brownfield remediation projects statewide under the Brownfield Municipal Grant Program. The Department of Economic and Community Development’s Office of Brownfield Remediation and Development supports the grant program, providing approximately $20 million in funding to redevelop 21 properties in 18 municipalities across the State.
State investments have leveraged roughly $530 million in private investments, facilitating the creation of 1,392 new housing units and new businesses. 
Successful examples of remediation include the Colt Armory in Hartford. The former firearms manufacturer from the 19th century was abandoned for decades in Hartford’s Charter Oak neighborhood. Over six years, between 2015 and 2021, the Colt Gateway Apartments demonstrated the successes of remediation. Developers combined historical charm and character with contemporary living and commercial space, revitalizing the neighborhood into a vibrant community through the support of DECD funding. 
The paramount issue for brownfield redevelopment remains the need for increased and consistent funding. Without a reliable and substantial flow of funding, municipalities and developers face many obstacles, stalling redevelopment projects. 
The Connecticut State Legislature introduced Senate Bill 1403, for addressing the cost issue of  remediation within the state. The bill’s objective is to gather data and insights that can be used to guide future policies and initiatives on brownfield sites. The bill appears to have gained support so far, but it still seems to face scrutiny because of flaws in the allocation of resources and the overall effectiveness of proposed solutions. In the end, this bill needs the public’s support to confront the challenges that brownfields create because it is a proactive and progressive step toward the future of Connecticut’s economic development. 
Brownfield redevelopment is needed to attract business, create housing, and revitalize communities in Connecticut’s post-pandemic world. This redevelopment initiative is an investment in the future of Connecticut, while solving environmental problems and eliminating community health hazards. By transforming liabilities into community assets, and economic growth, it is a creative initiative to rethink what is needed to incentivize businesses and residents of Connecticut.

(Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)This year’s 105-day Washington state legislative session was in many ways a trudge. 
There was a multibillion-dollar budget deficit to solve. Sharp debate on parental rights and capping rent increases. Clashes over tax policy. Tensions between the new Democratic governor and legislators in his own party. And the unexpected deaths of a sitting senator and a former House speaker.
“I’ll say certainly today, it feels like the toughest one that I’ve been through,” House Majority Leader Joe Fitzgibbon, D-West Seattle, said at a post-session news conference.
Washington lawmakers wrapped up around 6 p.m. Sunday. They spent their final day approving new two-year budgets for the state’s day-to-day operations, transportation system and capital construction.
They also put the finishing touches on two of the year’s most hotly debated pieces of legislation, one to cap residential rent increases and another delaying closure of the Rainier School, a rehabilitation center in Pierce County for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.
Gov. Bob Ferguson, who took office in January, applauded moves from state lawmakers to increase education funding, provide his demanded $100 million to hire more police, preserve the state’s rainy day fund, narrow their tax platform, and accept many of his proposed budget savings.
But Ferguson, who did not speak to reporters after the session adjourned, stopped short of a full-throated endorsement.
“I look forward to carefully reviewing the budgets line by line over the next few weeks,” the Democratic governor said in a statement late Sunday. “When that review is complete, I will share my thoughts with the public in greater detail.”
Budget troubles
The largest hurdle lawmakers faced entering the session was writing the next two-year budget. They knew months of lower-than-expected tax collections and an inflation-driven surge in costs were going to leave less money than needed to maintain existing levels of service.
What emerged, and cleared the House and Senate on partisan votes, is a two-year $77.8 billion budget that is balanced with spending cuts and billions of dollars in new and higher taxes.
“Reductions are hard. Revenue is hard. This budget is a combination of hard and difficult choices,” Fitzgibbon said ahead of its passage in the House.
The tax package Democrats assembled totals around $9.4 billion over four years. Much of that money — around $5.6 billion — will come from increases in the state’s main business tax. There’s also a higher rate added to the state’s capital gains tax for gains above $1 million.
Republicans in both chambers assailed the tax hikes and insisted Democrats could have written a balanced budget without them.
“When we started this session, all I heard about was making the wealthy pay their fair share,” said Rep. April Connors, R-Kennewick. “This budget spreads taxes across all working Washington residents in a manner that is going to make this state more and more and more unaffordable to live in. This budget does not fix Washington, it hurts Washington.”
A coalition of business groups also slammed Democrats over taxes, saying they were “deeply disappointed.”
“These costs simply can’t be absorbed by businesses — they will be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices for everyday goods and services,” said Kris Johnson, president and CEO of the Association of Washington Business. 
State employee unions scored wins, with lawmakers foregoing plans for furloughs floated earlier in the session and commitments in the budget to support new collective bargaining agreements that will provide 5% pay raises over two years.
Roads, rent and guns
On a bipartisan note, the House and Senate easily passed a $15.5 billion, two-year transportation funding plan, earmarking money for state ferries, highway megaprojects and much more. That plan hinges in part on a 6-cent increase in the state’s gas tax that would take effect July 1, and a raft of other tax and fee hikes. 
More than one-third of the overall sum is set aside for road improvements, allowing the state to finish some of its biggest undertakings, like the North Spokane Corridor and State Route 520. Another $895 million is set to pay for new state ferries, terminal improvements and existing vessel preservation. And the court-ordered removal of barriers to fish migration gets $1.1 billion.
“This budget keeps Washington’s roads, bridges and highways remaining safe and functional,” said House Transportation Committee Chair Jake Fey, D-Tacoma. “It supports the state ferry system and improves reliability. It makes commitments to repair culverts and protect Washington waterways.”
The funding plan is a leap from $13.2 billion for transportation in the current biennium set to end June 30.
In his statement, Ferguson applauded the transportation investments, but was silent on the new revenue that would help pay for them.
And in unanimous votes, lawmakers approved a separate $7.5 billion for infrastructure projects, including record investments in affordable housing as well as money for K-12 school construction, salmon recovery and behavioral health facilities.
Progressive Democrats scored some long-sought victories, pushing through the bill that will limit annual rent increases for many tenants across Washington, capping hikes at 7% plus inflation or 10%, whichever is lower. A bill to provide up to six weeks of unemployment insurance benefits for striking workers also made it through. 
Legislation to require a new state permit to buy guns is poised for action from the governor, too. The state would join about a dozen others with similar gun control laws.
One of the more fiery conflicts had to do with the rights of public school students and their parents. Democrats led an effort to overhaul a citizen initiative on parental rights the Legislature approved last year. They said this was needed to clarify language in the earlier measure and align it with other federal and state laws. Republicans said it was an attempt to gut the initiative.
Wealth tax gets a vote
Progressives in the Senate got their long-awaited opportunity to argue for and pass legislation to tax the financial assets of wealthy individuals — knowing full well the bill would not reach the governor, who is not a fan.
The legislation to establish a wealth tax passed on a 26-21 vote. The House did not debate the bill.
Sen. Noel Frame, D-Seattle, the bill’s sponsor, said taxing those with more than $50 million in certain assets like stocks and bonds “is constitutionally compliant and a sound policy,” a seeming swipe at Ferguson, who has questioned the novel tax’s ability to withstand a legal challenge.
Ferguson’s opposition forced Democrats to axe the wealth tax from their tax package.
“I think we have shown the people of Washington state what is possible,” Frame said. “I hope we will return to that soon.”
Solemn ending
This year’s session was enveloped in sadness.
Two political legends, former Secretary of State Ralph Munro, a Republican, and former House Speaker Frank Chopp, a Democrat, died days apart in late March.
Then, on April 19, Bill Ramos, a first-term Democratic state senator, died while on a run near his Issaquah home.
And Saturday afternoon, the wife of state Sen. Chris Gildon, R-Puyallup, died following a medical emergency at her workplace.
On Sunday, senators honored Ramos in an hourlong, emotion-packed tribute as House members watched from the gallery. Ramos had served in the House before winning his Senate seat in November.

(Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)A highly contested bill around the closure of a residential center for people with disabilities passed the Washington state House and Senate this weekend with mixed support from lawmakers and some major changes.  
Senate Bill 5393 intended to shutter Rainier School, a rehabilitation center in Pierce County for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, by June 30, 2027.
But a Republican amendment approved on the House floor, and agreed to by the Senate, will instead prohibit new long-term admissions starting July 27 this year and stop short-term admissions starting June 30, 2027.
Under the amended version, the center would close when there are no more long-term residents. Former long-term residents would have the ability to return within one year of transitioning out of the center. 
The rewrite gained some Republican support but lost some among Democrats. 
Rep. Travis Couture, R-Allyn, was one of the lawmakers concerned that the bill was rushing the closure and didn’t have enough safeguards. He and other GOP legislators walked out of a House committee hearing this week when the panel advanced the legislation. 
After the amendment, he felt better about the bill, even though he still voted against it.
“This is a pill I can swallow,” Couture said. 
The bill would also require the Department of Social and Health Services to provide regular reports to the Legislature until June 1, 2030, and offer residents the choice of alternative placements with careful planning. 
It now heads to Gov. Bob Ferguson’s desk. 
Debates around the closure of the Rainier School and the similar Yakima Valley School have been a hot topic in the Legislature this session.
Rainier School has faced scrutiny in recent years over incidents of abuse, neglect and safety lapses. Some disability rights advocates have pushed for its closure.
The facilities are also expensive, with a year of services for a patient at Rainier running around $775,000. Proponents of closing them said it could allow for resources to be shifted in a way that gives people improved options for services and reduces costs for the state.
“This isn’t about buildings or dollars, this is about the people who live at Rainier, people who have been hurt, forgotten, ignored, and betrayed,” said Rep. Darya Farivar, D-Seattle.
 “If home means fear, being silenced, bruised, and even death, we have an obligation to show some better options,” Farivar added.
But Republicans argued that centers like Rainier provide a crucial form of services and care and that people would be left with few nearby options if the center were to close. 
Workers at the facilities also opposed the closure plans.
In 2017, the Legislature passed a bill that would close the Yakima Valley School once the number of permanent residents had dwindled to eight people. There are roughly 36 long-term residents at the center, according to figures presented to lawmakers. 
A House bill that stalled this year proposed closing both the Rainier and Yakima Valley schools by June 30, 2027.

(Laurel Demkovich/Washington State Standard)Washington is poised to limit annual residential rent increases with legislation now headed to the governor’s desk.
The House and Senate on Sunday, the last day of the legislative session, passed the rent increase limit at 7% plus inflation or 10%, whichever is lower. Landlords could still set rent however they please when a tenancy begins.
Rent increases for manufactured homes are limited to 5% under House Bill 1217. While the rent cap policy on traditional homes would expire after 15 years, the manufactured home rule wouldn’t lapse.
The final version was a compromise after moderate Democrats in the Senate wouldn’t go along with the initial 7% cap, without inflation, the House had approved. 
Landlords also couldn’t raise rents in the first year of a tenancy under the proposed law. If a landlord violates the provisions, tenants or the state attorney general could bring litigation.
Buildings owned by nonprofits or public housing authorities would be exempt from the limits. The same goes for duplexes, triplexes or fourplexes if the owner lives in one of the units, as well as new construction for its first dozen years.
Republicans argue the bill will chill development and price landlords out of the business. Most Democrats say it’ll give renters a modicum of predictability as they deal with the high cost of living. 
The Senate approved the bill on a 27-20 vote, with Democratic Sens. Annette Cleveland and Sharon Shewmake joining Republicans in opposition. The House vote was 54-44. Five Democratic representatives opposed the final bill. 
It was a long and windy road to Sunday’s votes.
After stalling in the Senate last year, lawmakers came into 2025 energized to enshrine House Bill 1217 into law. But after passing the House, the Senate, in dramatic fashion, lifted the cap from the initial 7% to 10% plus inflation and exempted many single-family homes entirely, moves advocates said “gutted” the proposal.
In negotiations, Democrats in both chambers agreed to excise the carveout and find a middle ground on the limit.
But when the new iteration landed on the Senate floor Friday night, lawmakers were thwarted by a procedural snafu that delayed votes a couple more days.
The compromise frustrated advocates, but they said it was better than nothing.
“Even a 7% rent increase will force some people to move, disrupting their lives and their communities, and some will have no option but to move into cars, shelters, or tents,” said Michele Thomas, of the Washington Low Income Housing Alliance. “But this bill makes a first step towards sensible protections against egregious predatory rent increases.”
Gov. Bob Ferguson has repeatedly declined to weigh in on the legislation. 
He told reporters Friday that he recognizes “the different perspectives that different folks within the caucuses have, and so we’re trying to be helpful on that and I feel optimistic that they’re going to work something out,” but stopped short of saying what he hoped that resolution would be.
Once the bill reaches his desk, Ferguson has 20 days, excluding Sundays, to act on it. If he signs, the policy would go into effect immediately.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/IMG_4915-Large-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-04-27 17:02:29.820883

You can read more about the section here.

Each year, in a handful of states, public offices close, flags are lowered and official ceremonies commemorate “Confederate Memorial Day.”
Mississippi is among those handful of states that on Monday will celebrate the holiday intended to honor the soldiers who fought for the Confederacy during the Civil War.
But let me be clear: celebrating Confederate Memorial Day is not only racist but is bad policy, bad governance and a deep stain on the values we claim to uphold today.
First, there is no separating the Confederacy from the defense of slavery and white supremacy. The Confederacy was not about “states’ rights” in the abstract; it was about the right to own human beings. Confederate leaders themselves made that clear.
Confederate Vice President Alexander Stephens declared in his infamous “Cornerstone Speech” that the Confederacy was founded upon “the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man.” No amount of revisionist history can erase the fact that the Confederacy’s cause was fundamentally rooted in preserving racial subjugation.
To honor that cause with a state holiday is to glorify a rebellion against the United States fought to defend the indefensible. It is an insult to every citizen who believes in equality and freedom, and it is a cruel slap in the face to Black Americans, whose ancestors endured the horrors of slavery and generations of systemic discrimination that followed.
Beyond its moral bankruptcy, Confederate Memorial Day is simply bad public policy. Holidays are public statements of our values. They are moments when a state, through official sanction, tells its citizens: “This is what we believe is worthy of honor.” Keeping Confederate Memorial Day on the calendar sends a message that a government once committed to denying basic human rights should be celebrated.
That message is not just outdated — it is dangerous. It nurtures the roots of racism, fuels division and legitimizes extremist ideologies that threaten our democracy today.
Moreover, there are real economic and administrative costs to shutting down government offices for this purpose. In a time when states face budget constraints, workforce shortages and urgent civic challenges, it is absurd to prioritize paid time off to commemorate a failed and racist insurrection. Our taxpayer dollars should be used to advance justice, education, infrastructure and economic development — not to prop up a lost cause of hate.
If we truly believe in moving forward together as one people, we must stop clinging to symbols that represent treason, brutality and white supremacy. There is a legislative record that supports this move in a veto-proof majority changing the state Confederate flag in 2020. Taking Confederate Memorial Day off our official state holiday calendar is another necessary step toward a more inclusive and just society.
Mississippi had the largest population of enslaved individuals in 1865 and today has the highest percentage of Black residents in the United States. We should not honor the Confederacy or Confederate Memorial Day. We should replace it.
Replacing a racist holiday with one that celebrates emancipation underscores the state’s rich African American history and promotes a more inclusive understanding of its past. It would also align the state’s observances with national efforts to commemorate the end of slavery and the ongoing pursuit of equality.
I will continue my legislative efforts to replace Confederate Memorial Day as a state holiday with Juneteenth, which commemorates the freedom for America’s enslaved people.
It’s time to end Confederate Memorial Day once and for all.

As many parents will know, research points to several negative effects of screen time. As scholars who specialize in speech pathology and early childhood development, we are particularly interested in the recent finding that too much screen time is associated with less parent-child talk, such as fewer conversational turns between parents and children.
As a result, the American Academy of Pediatrics and World Health Organization suggest limiting screen time for children. 
Beyond quantity, they also emphasize the quality of a child’s engagement with digital media. Used in moderation, certain kinds of media can have educational and social benefits for children – and even contribute to language development.
These tips may help parents structure and manage screen time more effectively.
 No. 1: Choose high-quality content

Parents can enhance their children’s screen-time value by choosing high-quality media – that is, content with educational benefit. PBS Kids has many popular shows, from “Nature Cat” to “Sid the Science Kid,” that would qualify as educational.
Two other elements contribute to the quality of screen time.
First, screen content should be age-appropriate – that is, parents should choose shows, apps and games that are specifically designed for young children. Using a resource such as Common Sense Media allows parents to check recommended ages for television shows, movies and apps.
Second, parents can look for shows that use evidence-based educational techniques, such as participatory cues. That’s when characters in shows break the “third wall” by directly talking to their young audience to prompt reflection, action or response. Research shows that children learn new words better when a show has participatory cues – perhaps because it encourages active engagement rather than passive viewing.
Many classic, high-quality television shows for young children feature participatory cues, including “Mickey Mouse Clubhouse,” “Dora the Explorer,” “Go Diego Go!” and “Daniel Tiger’s Neighborhood.”
 No. 2: Join in on screen time

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that parents and children watch media together whenever possible.
This recommendation is based on the evidence that increased screen media use can reduce parent-child conversation. This, in turn, can affect language development. Intentionally discussing media content with children increases language exposure during screen time.
Parents may find the following joint media engagement strategies useful:

Press pause and ask questions.
Point out basic concepts, such as letters and colors.
Model more advanced language using a “think aloud” approach, such as, “That surprised me! I wonder what will happen next?”

 No. 3: Connect what’s on screen to real life

Learning from media is challenging for young children because their brains struggle to transfer information and ideas from screens to the real world. Children learn more from screen media, research shows, when the content connects to their real-life experiences.
To maximize the benefits of screen time, parents can help children connect what they are viewing with experiences they’ve had. For example, while watching content together, a parent might say, “They’re going to the zoo. Do you remember what we saw when we went to the zoo?”
This approach promotes language development and cognitive skills, including attention and memory. Children learn better with repeated exposure to words, so selecting media that relates to a child’s real-life experiences can help reinforce new vocabulary.
 No. 4: Enjoy screen-free times

Ensuring that a child’s day is filled with varied experiences, including periods that don’t involve screens, increases language exposure in children’s daily routines.
Two ideal screen-free times are mealtimes and bedtime. Mealtimes present opportunities for back-and-forth conversation with children, exposing them to a lot of language. Additionally, bedtime should be screen-free, as using screens near bedtime or having a TV in children’s bedrooms disrupts sleep.
Alternatively, devoting bedtime to reading children’s books accomplishes the dual goals of helping children wind down and creating a language-rich routine.
Having additional screen-free, one-on-one, parent-child play for at least 10 minutes at some other point in the day is good for young children. Parents can maximize the benefits of one-on-one play by letting their children decide what and how to play.
A parent’s role here is to follow their child’s lead, play along, give their child their full attention – so no phones for mom or dad, either – and provide language enrichment. They can do this by labeling toys, pointing out shapes, colors and sizes. It can also be done by describing activities – “You’re rolling the car across the floor” – and responding when their child speaks.
Parent-child playtime is also a great opportunity to extend interests from screen time. Including toys of your child’s favorite characters from the shows or movies they love in playtime transforms that enjoyment from screen time into learning.

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)Megan Cantone stumbled out of the hospital in tears from the pain.
She sought treatment for an infection from drug use. Medical professionals at the Denver hospital provided the treatment, but as Cantone recalls, it came with a heavy dose of judgment.
A doctor refused to numb her wound after recognizing it as being from illicit drug use, she said. The pain was supposed to convince her “never to shove a needle in your arm again,” Cantone said.

“I told my husband I feel like a complete failure, like a terrible person,” Cantone said. “That’s almost when a person could kill themselves because you’re at the lowest of your low and somebody treats you like that.”
Earlier that week, a nurse at a different hospital confronted her while treating another infection. The nurse told Cantone she’d end up killing herself and “pretty much told me I was disgusting,” Cantone remembers. 
Cantone began experimenting with drugs in high school, but her opioid use started when she attended cosmetology and esthiology school in the Twin Cities. Her use escalated to meth and heroin over the years.
A doctor stepped in to defend Cantone, scolding the nurse. The doctor suggested medication to help her stop opioid use; he said she suffered from a medical disorder that could be treated.
As the opioid epidemic continues in South Dakota, physicians can offer medications for opioid use disorder. But the practice — made possible by a change to federal law in 2022 — is held back in South Dakota because of stigmas attached to it, advocates say. Stigmas like Cantone experienced, and what she still experiences in South Dakota today.

Cantone didn’t accept the medication from the emergency room doctor. She grappled with self-loathing. But the doctor’s kindness and offer stuck with her.
Months later, after near-death experiences and the realization she was pregnant, Cantone accepted a prescription and delivered a healthy baby girl. The medication straightened a winding path toward recovery.
The 35-year-old mother and wife, who lives in Sioux Falls, credits her Christian faith and the medication for her recovery. She will celebrate six years of sobriety in May.
Training providers to ‘recognize bravery’
Buprenorphine prescriptions in South Dakota tripled in the last five years, increasing from about 2,500 at the start of 2019 to around 7,500 at the end of 2024. The drug reduces opioid withdrawal symptoms and cravings.
Naloxone is available in some public spaces throughout South Dakota, especially in Sioux Falls and Rapid City. It prevents opioid overdoses by blocking receptor cells.

Cantone took a Suboxone prescription for years, which is a drug that contains both buprenorphine and naloxone to treat opioid use disorder. Now she takes buprenorphine.
The increased access to both medications is heartening for Craig Uthe, a family physician at Sanford and local spokesman for the national Opioid Response Network. The Mainstreaming Addiction Treatment Act eliminated a federal waiver requirement for prescribing buprenorphine. But physicians need more education on the prescriptions, he said.
“We didn’t have that many people prescribing buprenorphine before, and we still don’t,” Uthe said. “We have a lot of people still prescribing opioids but not prescribing buprenorphine.”
Opioids are prescribed for pain management but can be addictive, especially for patients with chronic pain, Uthe said. South Dakota opioid prescription counts in 2024 stood at 437,431.
Of the top 10 controlled substances prescribed to South Dakota patients in 2024, opioids claimed three spots, according to the state’s prescription drug monitoring program data. Two of the three drugs — methylphenidate and oxycodone — moved up in the rankings to fourth and sixth most prescribed controlled substances. Hydrocodone retained its number one spot.
The state and health systems are gathering data to measure how much buprenorphine is prescribed.
“If we see a county with high overdose numbers, we’d like to see a higher amount of buprenorphine prescribed,” Uthe said. “How can we, as the state Health Department or as health care systems, try to place a resource where there is the greatest need?”

South Dakota Health Department Secretary Melissa Magstadt said medical providers should make it a “prescribing habit” to prescribe naloxone for each opioid prescription they write. Overdose victims do not always suffer from opioid use disorder, she said.
“I’ve seen very well-meaning patients who took one too many doses or maybe forgot they took a dose or didn’t realize they had two different medications that had opioids in them,” Magstadt said.
She said it’ll likely take years for prescriber behaviors to change.
In 2023, South Dakota reported the second lowest overdose death rate in the nation at 11.2 deaths per 100,000 residents, according to the latest data available.
Ninety-five South Dakotans in 2023 died from drug overdoses, 47 of which were from opioids. In 2024, 90 South Dakotans died from drug overdoses, 36 of which were from opioids, according to the state Health Department.
Although most overdose deaths are among white residents, Native Americans are disproportionately affected. Native Americans die from overdoses at a rate of 26.6 per 100,000 — more than four times the rate among white South Dakotans, according to the State Unintentional Drug Overdose Reporting System.
Sioux Falls nonprofit Emily’s Hope partners with emergency departments. Physicians connect patients with the nonprofit, which works to connect them to medication and other treatment services, said Angela Kennecke, founder and CEO. Kennecke’s daughter, Emily, died of a fentanyl overdose, laced in heroin she injected. Her family was planning to enroll her into a treatment program when she died in May 2018.

Medication is the “gold star” for treatment, Kennecke said. Treating opioid use disorder without medication can be more harmful than no treatment, according to a Yale study published in the Drug and Alcohol Dependence journal in 2024. 
“That is our first line of defense in getting people to feel better, to reduce cravings and get them the help they need,” Kennecke said.
Loretta Bryan, a registered nurse focused on clinical improvement within the South Dakota Association of Healthcare Organizations, educates medical providers on opioid use disorder, medications and how to engage with patients.
Her work focuses on “motivational interviewing techniques” to create authentic conversations with patients and improve screening.
“It takes a lot of bravery to walk through those doors and admit you’re struggling,” Bryan said. “Finding those words to recognize that bravery and having those in your back pocket is helpful.”
Expanding opioid use disorder treatment infrastructure
Access to medications for opioid use disorder is growing in clinics across the state, but not as fast as needed, Uthe said. The focus remains in emergency rooms and on harm reduction. Aside from clinics dedicated to behavioral health, Uthe said, family physicians and urgent care doctors should be comfortable prescribing the medications.
“We don’t have the infrastructure in place to address that need at the moment,” he said.
Lewis and Clark Behavioral Health Services in Yankton runs a telehealth behavioral health program focused on opioid use, with two outreach sites in Pierre and Huron. Rapid City-based Project Recovery is an addiction recovery clinic for opioids, alcohol and stimulant use with satellite clinics in Sioux Falls, Sisseton and Pine Ridge.

State funds to combat opioid use in the state support both programs.
Kendra Joswiak, clinical practice director at Project Recovery, said the organization treated 1,100 people for opioid use disorder in 2024. Of those treated without medication, about 90% will use again, she said, comparing medication for opioid use disorder to insulin for diabetes patients.
“If we had something as good for cancer as we do for opioid use disorder, we’d say we cured cancer,” Joswiak said.
Patients continue to face stigma after years of sobriety
Cantone continues to feel judged when she shares her history with medical professionals, pharmacists, friends and family.
She felt “icky” when she first ordered her prescription at a pharmacy when she moved back to South Dakota in 2020. Medication for opioid use disorder isn’t as common or well known in South Dakota as it is in Denver, she said.
“They looked at me like I was a drug addict or from Mars,” she recalled.
Friends and family have told her she’s switching one addiction for another. But medical professionals say the prescription drugs help restore balance to parts of the brain affected by addiction, allowing patients’ brains to heal without cravings or withdrawal symptoms.
The doubt and stigma undercut the pride and hard work it took to earn Cantone’s sobriety. But she knows people who struggle with substance use disorder are more than what others see.
“As much as we worry about what others think, what matters is you being healthy, getting your life together, staying alive and getting the help you need,” Cantone said. “Whether it’s medication or counseling or cutting cold turkey. You need to get yourself better and cancel out that noise.”",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/591A9544-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-27 13:08:37.307051

“I hated myself,” the 27-year-old Sioux Falls resident remembered.
He accepted medication from one of the nurses to stop the withdrawal symptoms. His head was clearer and he could fall asleep, but the shame remained.
Vanessa Needles entered the room after he woke up. She wasn’t a nurse, but a peer support specialist meant to connect Nielson to resources. His shame turned to embarrassment, but it soon became gratitude for the medical staff and Needles.
Needles spoke his language in a way the nurses and doctors surrounding him couldn’t. She overdosed once herself and struggled with alcohol use, eventually leading to a car crash that killed her coworker in 2017. Needles and Nielson started experimenting with drugs and alcohol around 14 years old. They’d both done things and treated their loved ones in ways they regret. He wasn’t alone.
Needles, who is seven years sober, offered Nielson grace. 
“When you’re trying to get off of it, the littlest thing makes the biggest difference,” Nielson told South Dakota Searchlight. “The most valuable thing is having someone understand what you’re going through.”

Needles is one of nine peer support specialists in eastern South Dakota with Sioux Falls-based nonprofit Emily’s Hope. Their work is part of a pilot program overseen by the state Department of Social Services and launched in January 2024 to reduce overdoses by providing “essential supports and strengthening connections” to local resources, according to a statement from the department. Rapid City-based Project Recovery piloted the program in western South Dakota.
The pilots are funded by national opioid settlement dollars, costing $346,445. The national opioid settlement was reached in 2021 to resolve opioid litigation against the country’s three largest pharmaceutical distributors and one manufacturer. More than $50 billion in settlement funds are being delivered to state and local governments from the companies accused of flooding communities with opioid painkillers even though they allegedly knew how addictive and deadly the drugs were. South Dakota is set to receive $54 million of settlement funding within the next two decades.
The department plans to continue funding the program with settlement dollars through 2029, based on a plan presented to the opioid advisory council in April.
What is the program?
The two organizations received a combined 34 referrals since the program’s launch and connected with 26 people to provide resources. Between 2016 and 2020, there were more than 2,400 drug-related hospitalizations and 684 drug-related deaths in South Dakota.
Angela Kennecke, founder and CEO of Emily’s Hope, said the organization works closely with emergency room departments for referrals. Sometimes the initial contact yields later results. One woman who ended communication with a peer support specialist last year picked communication back up this year to seek help.
“I always say a seed is planted,” Kennecke said. “Even if they don’t go into treatment immediately or they don’t go on medication and get the help they need, a seed has been planted that there is someone there to help them when they’re ready.”

Kennecke’s daughter, Emily, died of a fentanyl overdose, laced in heroin she injected. Her family was planning to enroll her into a treatment program when she died in May 2018.
Project Recovery has found most of its success working with Rapid City’s Fusion Center, which is a law enforcement task force. The clinic receives referrals based on overdose data collected by law enforcement. Kendra Joswiak, clinical practice director at Project Recovery, said her response team connected with 82% of activations, 56% of which continue to be engaged in addiction service treatments.
Needles, a 30-year-old mother of two — soon to be three — served as a peer support specialist for years in other capacities before working with Emily’s Hope to meet with overdose victims in the emergency room. She’s previously talked with people struggling with substance use on the street, and she’s shared her story with jail inmates.
The program bridges gaps in South Dakota’s behavioral health infrastructure, she said. It also destigmatizes substance use within the medical profession and in the community, and gives a sense of purpose to those in recovery.
“By helping someone stay sober, I stay sober another day,” Needles said. “I can stand in front of them and tell them that this is scary and sh—y, but that it’s going to get better.”
Peer support specialists with Emily’s Hope receive a group text when an overdose victim arrives at a Sioux Falls-area hospital. Whoever is available goes, Needles said.
Most of the time, people have already checked out of the hospital before a specialist arrives. She remembers when she overdosed a decade ago, and she left the hospital as soon as she could because she was scared. She needed to cope with her emotions, and the only way she knew how was to use again.
She and other peer support specialists will follow up with patients after they leave the hospital, dropping off bags of fentanyl test strips or medication to prevent overdose. She’ll hand them to the patient, parents or spouses — whoever she can find.
‘Everybody deserves a little bit of grace’
After Nielson was admitted to the hospital and into a treatment program through Avera Health, Needles joined him each Friday. She checks in on him to see how he’s feeling and has taken him to support meetings since he completed treatment. She sent him a coin and card when he reached three months of sobriety late last year.

Nielson is eight months sober. He’s taking a Suboxone prescription to eliminate cravings, and he feels more like himself, he said. He started reading again, hasn’t missed a day of work and spends time with his 3-year-old son each week. It’s something he couldn’t have dreamed of a decade ago.
Needles’ guidance and support reminds Nielson he’s not alone and what he’s capable of achieving.
“Besides Vanessa, I don’t have another person to talk to regularly who knows what I’m going through or is sober,” Nielson said. “It can kind of get lonely after you cut off every friend you had, since they were all part of my addiction.”
One relationship isn’t a lot, but it’s a start, Needles said. She hopes as others learn about medications for opioid use disorder and about efforts to curb overdose deaths in the state, overdose response teams will be able to reach more people.
“Everybody deserves a little bit of grace,” Needles said. “We’re all struggling one way or another.”

(Photo by Lance Cheung/USDA)U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins issued memorandums to state agencies urging them to enforce federal guidelines around work requirements and citizenship status when issuing food assistance. 
Food security advocates in Iowa say the measures do not change much for the agencies administering the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. 
Luke Elzinga, policy and advocacy director for Des Moines Area Religious Council and chair of Iowa Hunger Coalition, said the memos are more about sending a message than creating policy changes. 
“The implication is that people on SNAP are not working, and that we have a bunch of undocumented immigrants on SNAP, and neither of those are true,” Elzinga said. 
SNAP rules require that anyone ages 16-59 work at least 30 hours per week, unless they have a physical or mental limitation, are a caretaker, receiving unemployment, participating in addiction treatment or studying at a school or training program.

Failure to comply with the work requirements could result in loss of SNAP eligibility for one month or longer. 
Further, able-bodied adults without dependents, or ABAWD, aged 18-54, have to complete additional work requirements, or else risk losing access to SNAP benefits for more than three months every three years. 
States may request waivers from the ABAWD requirements, which Rollins, as the secretary of Agriculture, has the authority to approve or deny. 
Rollins’ memorandum to state agencies asked them to “be mindful” of the law that created ABAWD requirements and its intent to “reduce dependence on public assistance programs and to support self-sufficiency.” 
The memo asks states to ensure their waiver requests apply “only to those who truly need it so that those who can work, do.” 
Elzinga said Iowa does not have any ABAWD waivers in place, so the announcement doesn’t have much impact on the state. 
In a press release about the memorandum, Rollins said states have “abused” the system by requesting work requirement waivers. 
“Today marks the start of a new era for SNAP—prioritizing work, career and technical education, and volunteering rather than idleness, excess spending, and misapplication of the law,” Rollins said in the statement. 
“Since my confirmation, I have reiterated the states are our partners, and this includes ensuring our nutrition programs are tied to putting Americans back to work.” 
Elzinga said enforcing work requirements would be effective at getting individuals to stop using the SNAP program, but not because they would be improving their overall economic well-being. 
“We should be supporting people and helping them have access to those (job training) programs, but not necessarily making them a condition of receiving food and health care,” Elzinga said.
On a local level, the Iowa Legislature and Gov. Kim Reynolds are pushing for expanded work requirements for Iowans to receive Medicaid or SNAP benefits.
Citizen status
The other memorandum instructed states to “carefully examine” their practices for verifying identity and immigration status, to ensure that “ineligible aliens” do not receive SNAP benefits. 
The benefits are only available to U.S. citizens and certain eligible “non-citizen groups” including: refugees, individuals granted asylum, entrants from specific countries like Haiti, Cuba, Iraq, Afghanistan and Micronesian islands. Non-citizen children under 18 are also eligible, as are residents with green cards, battered non-citizens and conditional entrants after meeting certain criteria. 
Elzinga said memo is a bit of a “nothing burger,” because “undocumented immigrants don’t receive SNAP.” 
“It’s not allowed by the program,” he said. “And we also know that it can be really difficult for legal immigrants who qualify for SNAP to even be able to get benefits.” 
Elzinga said the effort might have an impact by dissuading eligible immigrant families from applying for SNAP benefits, which he said agencies saw during the first Trump administration. 
“I do think this announcement could instill fear among mixed status households or even legal immigrants who qualify for SNAP,” he said, noting that folks might withdraw from the program out of fear that it would impact their immigration status.
The memo outlines processes that state agencies should follow to verify immigration status and eligibility, including the use of the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, program which was recently made available to states at no cost. 
Elzinga said this would be the only real change to the state policy, because having access to the program for free could save agencies some money when running the service. 
The memo also encourages states to use other strategies, like surveys and in-person interviews to further verify identity and status of SNAP applicants. 
“We are stewards of taxpayer dollars, and it is our duty to ensure states confirm the identity and verify the immigration status of SNAP applicants,” Rollins said in a press release. “USDA’s nutrition programs are intended to support the most vulnerable Americans. To allow those who broke our laws by entering the United States illegally to receive these benefits is outrageous.”
The U.S. Department of Agriculture press release cites a report from the Government Accountability Office that found in 2023, USDA paid about $10.5 billion in “improper” SNAP benefits. GAO listed failure to verify citizenship, identity, education, employment, finances, household size and residency as the top causes for improper payments. 
U.S. congressional leaders from Iowa introduced a bill earlier this session to similarly address the problems outlined in GAO study. 
Processing time
Rollins also sent a letter to state governors in early April, calling for improvements to SNAP application processing times. 
The program guidelines stipulate that applications are to be processed in 30 days for normal applications, but the letter said more than 30 states fail to meet that deadline. 
Iowa’s application processing timeliness was rated at 77% in 2023. Elzinga said the letter appears to be “a good thing” to help improve processing rates in Iowa and other states.
The SNAP program is also expected to be impacted by the $230 billion in cuts congressional leaders are tasked with making to the federal House Agriculture budget. Several funding programs that helped food banks purchase food have already been cut at the federal level, despite the fact that food pantries, at least in Iowa, are only seeing an increase in need. 
“No time is really a good time to be talking about SNAP cuts, but especially right now when we’re seeing this historic need … it’s just a really, I think, a really concerning time,”  Elzinga said.

For nearly two weeks, Western New Mexico University’s website and digital systems have been held hostage by what officials in internal emails have called the efforts of a “foreign hacking group.” The university has not publicly addressed the severity of the attack, but documentation obtained by Searchlight New Mexico indicates that an infamous Russian-speaking hacking group is behind the attack and claims to have access to employee payroll data, Social Security numbers and driver’s licenses.

In an image of an employee’s computer shared with Searchlight, a note that threatens to leak the employee’s Social Security number, driver’s license and the university’s “complete network map” is signed by Qilin, a hacking group that the federal government has accused of running a “ransomware-as-a-service” operation. Qilin has earned a cutthroat reputation for being willing to go after anyone. Last year, it was accused of being involved in a cyberattack that forced a hospital system to cancel more than 1,000 appointments and operations. Earlier this year, it made headlines for its role in stealing the Social Security numbers and driver’s licenses of journalists who work for newspapers owned by Lee Enterprises.
Since April 13, the WNMU website has been inaccessible to the public. Faculty members told Searchlight that they and their students can use digital platforms like Canvas, which are hosted by a third party, but they’re unable to use classroom tools that connect to the internet, like printers or projectors.
In an image shared with Searchlight, one employee’s laptop screen displayed the same threatening ransomware message whenever they attempted to open a file on their work computer. The message was signed “Qilin,” and its contents bear the hallmark signs of ransomware, in which hackers hold sensitive data hostage until they receive a ransom payment. Even if they do receive a payment, groups like these may leak the sensitive information anyway.
A Western New Mexico employee’s laptop displayed several threatening ransomware messages, apparently signed by the foreign hacking group known as Qilin.
“We have downloaded compromising and sensitive data from your system/network. Our group cooperates with the mass media. If you refuse to communicate with us and we do not come to an agreement, your data will be reviewed and published on our blog,” the message says. “Data includes: Employees personal data, CVs, DL, SSN. Complete network map including credentials for local and remote services. Financial information including clients data, bills, budgets, annual reports.”
The note instructs recipients to download a Tor browser — commonly used to access the dark web — and visit a specific site to begin negotiations with the hackers. “You need cipher key/our decrypt software to restore your files … the police or authorities will not be able to help you get the cipher key. We encourage you to consider your decisions.”
 Payday delayed

On April 25 — a Friday, payday at WNMU — hourly and student employees said they had not yet received their direct deposits. In an email to employees reviewed by Searchlight, the university said the problem “stemmed from an unexpected complication during the file upload process to the bank” and said some employees might experience further delays in receiving the payments. “If this delay results in any overdraft fees, the university will reimburse those charges,” the email said.
The cyberattack comes at an inopportune time for university leaders, who are working to rebuild trust with the faculty senate, student body, state government and the surrounding Silver City community. Since December, when former university president Joseph Shepard resigned from his post and the governor demanded the resignations of the sitting regents, the campus has been without a permanent leader. New regents have only been on the job since late March, and now find themselves leading a university in disarray.
Threats like these have become common enough in local government that in 2022 the U.S. Department of Homeland Security launched the “State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program,” the first of its kind, to help upgrade and protect IT networks across the country. It awarded nearly $280 million in grant funding for fiscal year 2024 — nearly $4 million of which went to New Mexico — and anticipated awarding $1 billion over four years.
In an email to executive managers on April 14 — one day after the attack — Provost and Vice President of Academic Affairs Jack Crocker said WNMU “experienced a cyberattack from a foreign hacking group” and said the university had the “ongoing collective support and assistance” of the New Mexico Higher Education Department, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and “other university cyber experts to help us combat the attack.”
In an email to Searchlight, Higher Education Department spokesperson Auriella Ortiz said the agency was working closely with the state Department of Information Technology to “evaluate” the issue.
“WNMU is undertaking a formal investigation to identify the scope of the incident and to facilitate necessary remediation efforts,” she wrote. “Our primary objective as state agencies is to support the university in restoring and continuing normal business operations following this incident.”
Whether that collective firepower will be enough to combat the hacking group remains to be seen. Qilin has developed a reputation for wreaking havoc wherever it goes. Last year, it was accused of being involved with an attack on a healthcare provider in London that forced hospitals to immediately halt operations. Qilin has been operational since 2022 and operates “ransomware as a service,” according to a 2024 report from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. This allows independent hackers to use its digital tools in exchange for a 15 to 20 percent share of the ransom payments. The 2024 report says that the group’s typical demand for ransom is $50,000 to $800,000.
“Actors practice double extortion and operate a data leak site where victims are posted. Victims are directed to communicate with the attackers via dark web portals or encrypted messaging services, ensuring the attackers’ anonymity and complicating law enforcement efforts to track interactions,” the HHS report says. “Payments are demanded in cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin or Monero. However, even after payment, there is no guarantee that victims will receive the decryption tools required to recover their data.”
 System outage or cyberattack?

Meanwhile, the severity of the situation hasn’t come through in the school’s public messaging (“While select systems remain offline,” a recent WNMU Facebook post said, “key academic and communications platforms continue to be accessible.”) For nearly two weeks, WNMU’s website has been down and employees have had varying degrees of access to their emails. Everything on the university website — minutes and agendas for Board of Regents meetings, campus announcements and calendars of events — has been blocked from public view, and students have had to use alternative login methods to access online homework, lectures and exams.
In public social media posts and emails to students, the university has not blamed a cyberattack or other nefarious activity for leading to the outages. Instead it has simply said it is “working through technical issues.” Internal communications, however, show that the situation is more serious than the university’s public depictions.
The university has also enlisted the help of private cybersecurity companies. A number of Wi-Fi hotspots have been installed on campus and students have received instructions on alternative ways to access Canvas, an online coursework program used by universities around the nation.
“In the meantime, the plan is to keep campus open,” Crocker wrote in his email to managers. “Face-to-face classes will meet and alternative access to online/hybrid classes is being created. However, university internet, email, phones, and connections outside WNMU are inoperable at this time and must remain so until the issues are resolved. Scheduled events, such as the scholarship luncheon, softball games, Cultural Affairs lectures will continue.”
While faculty and hourly employees have received different communications from the top, students have seemingly been left in the dark as to the serious nature of the system outage.
In an email to students last week, the university made no mention of a cyberattack. Instead, it told students that WNMU “is currently addressing technical issues affecting access to several key web-based services.” It also told students that “protecting your personal data — including your student status — is a top priority.”
In a statement Friday, university spokesperson Mario Sanchez said “impacted individuals” would be notified if their personal information was involved in the attack.
“The university’s investigation into this incident is ongoing. If the investigation determines that personal information was involved, impacted individuals will be notified in accordance with applicable law. We understand there was an issue with payroll processing for the current pay period, but our bank has let us know that the issue has been corrected and payroll should be posted today.”

The number of births in some Western states that are adding new housing rose last year, reversing losses the year before in many cases, according to new federal statistics released Wednesday.
Increases from 2023 to 2024 were highest in Colorado (4.5%), Idaho (3.8%), Utah (3.6%), Washington state and Nebraska (each 2.6%). Births increased around 2% in West Virginia, South Dakota, North Carolina, Montana, Rhode Island and South Carolina.
Almost all those states had decreases in births the previous year, and many have been building housing rapidly since 2023. Idaho, North Carolina and Utah have issued enough building permits in 2023 and 2024 to add about 4% to their housing stock, the highest in the nation.

Melissa Kearney, an economics professor at the University of Maryland who specializes in families and fertility, said there could be a link between homebuilding and more babies.
“It is quite possible that increased access to home ownership, coming from a reduction in the price of houses in places that are building more houses, could meaningfully increase birth rates,” Kearney told Stateline in an e-mail.
Many of the other states with increases in births are also seeing building booms: Colorado, Nebraska, South Carolina, South Dakota and Washington state are all set to add more than 2% to housing stock based on permits issued in 2023 and 2024, according to a Stateline analysis of U.S. Census Bureau Building Permits Survey data.

Building permits can take up to two years to translate into finished houses and apartments, but they indicate which states are most willing to allow new housing that can boost population, tax receipts and the workforce. In Colorado, Denver County is set to add almost 10,000 housing units and in Idaho, Ada County, which includes Boise, could add 11,200 units based on building permits.
Nationally births were slightly higher in 2024 than the year before, by about 1%, according to provisional federal numbers from the National Vital Statistics System within the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The fertility rate also increased slightly, but it remains below the “replacement level” needed to keep the population stable — 2.1 children for each woman over her lifetime.
All the increase nationally was in births to Hispanic and Asian mothers, with births continuing to decline for Black, American Indian and white mothers. Births to teenagers and women ages 20-24, in sharp decline since 2007, continued to drop last year, while births increased for women 25 and older.
The number of births dropped most in states struggling with stagnant population: falling about 4% in Louisiana, 3% in Mississippi, and 2% in New Mexico and New Hampshire. All those states had little or no population growth between mid-2023 and mid-2024, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates.

Du Bois called active resistance to racist policies.","April 27,  1903

W.E.B. Du Bois,  in his book, “The Souls of Black Folk,” called for active resistance to racist policies: “We have no right to sit silently by while the inevitable seeds are sown for a harvest of disaster to our children, black and white.” 
He described the tension between being Black and being an American: “One ever feels his twoness, — an American, a Negro; two souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled strivings; two warring ideals in one dark body, whose strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder.” 
He criticized Washington’s “Atlanta Compromise” speech. Six years later, Du Bois helped found the NAACP and became the editor of its monthly magazine, The Crisis. He waged protests against the racist silent film “The Birth of a Nation” and against lynchings of Black Americans, detailing the 2,732 lynchings between 1884 and 1914. 
In 1921, he decried Harvard University’s decisions to ban Black students from the dormitories as an attempt to renew “the Anglo-Saxon cult, the worship of the Nordic totem, the disenfranchisement of Negro, Jew, Irishman, Italian, Hungarian, Asiatic and South Sea Islander — the world rule of Nordic white through brute force.” 
In 1929, he debated Lothrop Stoddard, a proponent of scientific racism, who also happened to belong to the Ku Klux Klan. The Chicago Defender’s front page headline read, “5,000 Cheer W.E.B. DuBois, Laugh at Lothrup Stoddard.” 
In 1949, the FBI began to investigate Du Bois as a “suspected Communist,” and he was indicted on trumped-up charges that he had acted as an agent of a foreign state and had failed to register. The government dropped the case after Albert Einstein volunteered to testify as a character witness. 
Despite the lack of conviction, the government confiscated his passport for eight years. In 1960, he recovered his passport and traveled to the newly created Republic of Ghana. Three years later, the U.S. government refused to renew his passport, so Du Bois became a citizen of Ghana. He died on Aug. 27, 1963, the eve of the March on Washington.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/06001414/April27-FeatImage-W.E.B._Du_Bois_by_James_E._Purdy_1907_cropped.jpg,,,2025-04-27 09:00:10.504609

When we encounter a setback or challenge, or even merely stagnation, it can be necessary to reflect on where our recent attentions and efforts have led us: toward a significant goal we have set, or away from it? Sometimes, we learn, we must make sacrifices for that aspiration, or discard it altogether for something that better aligns with our evolving values. But that spark that keeps us reaching skyward is ever-important – whatever our dream may be.

Addiction here is not some distant statistic; it's an unrelenting force that has a corrupting grip on neighbors, classmates and loved ones.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Benjamin Greenwood: Vermont’s drug crisis doesn’t stop at the city line.","This commentary is by Benjamin Greenwood, a third-year criminal justice student at Champlain College. He was born and raised in Richford, Vermont.I’m a Champlain College student born and raised in Richford, Vermont. Richford is a small town of approximately 2,000 people where, like most rural American towns, the opioid crisis has become a devastating part of everyday life. Addiction here is not some distant statistic; it’s an unrelenting force that has a corrupting grip on neighbors, classmates and loved ones. However, Vermont’s criminal justice policies somehow continue to view addiction as a moral failing or legal offense rather than what it is: a public health crisis. If we want to save towns like mine, we must stop criminalizing addiction and start prioritizing treatment and harm reduction. In 2022 alone, Vermont saw a record 243 opioid-related deaths. Although the drug problem in Burlington is great, we cannot continue to overlook the ever-present nightmare of drug abuse in small towns. Burlington and other urban areas continue to gain access to care and support, while in Richford, services are scarce, transportation is limited, and the stigma is deep. People who overdose here often do so alone, far from help.Despite this, Vermont leaders have continued to miss the chance to actually do something. In 2024, Gov. Phil Scott vetoed a bill that would have established an overdose prevention center in Burlington, calling it a “costly experiment.” The centers, which are successfully operating in New York City and other locations, provide controlled environments for substance use while medical staff monitor patients and provide safe equipment and emergency response during overdoses. These centers connect people to essential treatment and housing services while providing a vital link between the two. The veto was not just a setback for Burlington; it was a blow to every small town that might have benefited from the momentum. Vermont’s “Hub and Spoke” treatment system is often praised for combining medication-assisted treatment with counseling and primary care. It’s a strong foundation, but one that rural communities struggle to actually use. The system depends on physical access to hubs but in places like Richford, that often requires a car, gas money, and time off work, luxuries many residents simply can’t afford. If you live in rural Franklin County and need help, you’re likely facing long waitlists, overbooked providers or a long drive to the nearest clinic. All the while, the Vermont justice system still treats people with substance use issues as criminals who need to be punished by the full force of the law. In rural areas, we constantly rely on the police for drug-related issues because there is no one else around to call. The police are all we’ve got, and half of the time, it takes them way too long to respond. This reliance on the police leads to over-incarceration for things like drug possession or public intoxication; these actions solve nothing, and all they do is cause more harm.It doesn’t have to be this way, and it shouldn’t be this way; we have evidence-based alternatives. Harm reduction, including needle exchange programs, safe use spaces, and wide access to naloxone, has saved lives without enabling use. Drug courts and diversion programs have helped people get clean without the trauma of jail time. But these programs must be expanded equitably, so that rural residents have the same access as those in larger cities. Addiction is a health issue, and our response should reflect that. Towns like Richford don’t need more jail cells. We need mobile treatment vans, mental health providers, peer recovery coaches, and, most of all, funding not just in Burlington but in every small community hit hardest by this crisis.I’m not writing this because I have all the answers. I’m writing because I’ve seen what happens when nothing changes, when addiction is met with handcuffs instead of help. In Richford, we are tired, tired of being treated as statistics, tired of watching our town disappear one overdose at a time, and most of all, we are tired of losing people not just to drugs but to the silence that follows when the system refuses to care. We don’t need more punishment; we need someone to finally fight for us, someone to finally give a damn. That’s all I’m asking for. Not as a policy expert, but as someone from a forgotten town: Please, care enough to see us, to fight for us and to fight for something better.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Benjamin Greenwood: Vermont’s drug crisis doesn’t stop at the city line.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Commentaries_featured-image-25.png?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-27 07:59:10.165668

Sign up for Chalkbeat Detroit’s free newsletter to keep up with the city’s public school system and Michigan education policy.
In a slightly warm classroom on a sunny April afternoon, five fifth graders loudly clapped their hands together or on their desks as they read a sentence out loud.
“Did” Clap. “She” Clap. “Wink” Clap. “At” Clap. “Hank” Clap.
With each clap, the students at Mark Twain School for Scholars in Detroit were distinguishing between the different sounds they were hearing with each word in the sentence, a common exercise in literacy lessons on phonological awareness.
They quickly moved to the next sentence, and Kimberly Sommerville, the academic interventionist who works closely with them to improve their literacy skills, immediately spotted a problem.
One student read the sentence, then the other four students were expected to say, and clap, what they heard. But the students were clearly hearing “A lot of junk is in the sink.”
“Listen,” Sommerville interrupted, then enunciated each word loudly for the group, helping them hear that the last word was supposed to be “tank” and not “sink.”
Scenes like this happen across the Detroit Public Schools Community District and are led by academic interventionists like Sommerville, whose work is a vital part of the district’s effort to improve academic achievement and get struggling students like the five in this classroom back on track. She is one of 600 such interventionists that the district employs. Their role existed before the pandemic, but the district has invested even more in them to address the learning loss students experienced during the public health crisis.
It’s “the best program ever,” Sommerville said, because of its strong focus on phonics and its use of the Orton Gillingham method, a popular approach to teaching reading. But she worries about its future because it partly benefits from federal education funds that are at risk of being cut. (Money from the settlement of a literacy lawsuit and a grant from the MacKenzie Scott Foundation also cover the cost of the academic interventionists.)
Sommerville has reason to worry, as do educators across Michigan whose schools rely on federal funding. The Republican-controlled Congress has signaled that it plans to substantially cut federal dollars for public schools. The Trump administration has threatened to withhold federal funding from schools if they allow transgender girls to participate in girls’ athletics — already, it has moved to strip Maine of its funding for refusing to comply. The administration also has threatened to withhold federal funding from states that don’t eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion programs in schools. (Those efforts hit a legal roadblock Thursday.)
Republican proposals could affect Michigan students in myriad ways, from early childhood to tutoring to accessing school meals. Trump has proposed eliminating Head Start, a long-running early childhood program for children from low-income homes. Republican lawmakers have pitched changes to federal school meal programs that could leave hundreds of thousands of students in Michigan without crucial breakfasts and lunches. Deep cuts in the U.S. Department of Education, part of Trump’s efforts to eliminate the agency, have affected services for some of the most vulnerable children. Deep cuts in AmeriCorps could also be felt locally, particularly for a statewide tutoring program that helps students at about 80 schools in Michigan. And Trump’s tariffs could increase costs for school districts.
In Glen Lake Community Schools in northern Michigan’s Leelanau County, district officials fear the district could lose nearly $3.3 million in federal impact aid that it receives to offset the loss of property tax revenue from Sleeping Bear Dunes national lakeshore, which is located within the district’s boundaries. The impact aid provides operating funds for the district and makes up 20% of the district’s budget.
Glen Lake Superintendent Jason Misner said the proposed cut could be absorbed by the district’s healthy fund balance for the next school year. But there are limits to how far that rainy day money can go.
The uncertainty weighs on school district leaders who must build budgets for the 2025-26 school year by the end of June with little concrete information about how much federal funding they’ll receive, or if they’ll receive any. And teachers don’t know yet what potential cuts will mean for them in the classroom.
“Every day I’m scared,” said Janine Scott, a math lead teacher at Davis Aerospace Technical High School (and a member of Chalkbeat’s reader advisory board), during a recent panel discussion on teacher morale. “We have kids who rely on [federal funds].”
The unpredictability “creates anxiety, and anxiety within our school administration and support staff” creates more concern,” said Nick Ceglarek, superintendent of the Northwest Education Services, an intermediate school district that provides services to local schools in Antrim, Benzie, Grand Traverse, Kalkaska, and Leelanau counties. Many of those services, including some that provide direct instruction and help to students, rely on federal funding.
 There are few answers to anxious questions

On an evening in mid-March, more than 1,000 people logged into a virtual engagement session with DPSCD Superintendent Nikolai Vitti to hear about the potential cuts and their impact on the district. Those attending peppered Vitti with questions about whether nurses, central office staff, special education staff, and others would be affected. Some wondered if class sizes would rise, whether there would be funding for school lunches, and whether paraprofessionals could lose their jobs.
There were few concrete answers because so little is known about what might happen.
Federal funds touch many aspects of education. Among the most common: Title I funding helps schools provide support to students from low-income homes. Title II funding provides money for teacher training and other initiatives on effective instruction. Title III money invests in English language learners. Title IV supports programs that provide educational enrichment for students from low-income homes. Schools receive Medicaid reimbursements for some students’ special education services. And the federal school lunch program allows all students in a school with a large number of students from low-income homes to receive free school meals.
The stakes are particularly high for DPSCD, the state’s largest district, as about 32%, or $210 million, of its annual budget comes from federal funding. In the virtual session, Vitti shared how a 25% cut — which hasn’t been proposed but is something a national urban schools’ group has suggested might happen — would affect the district.
Whatever cuts happen, Vitti said the district might be OK for the next school year if it uses its fund balance and state funding increases at the level Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has proposed. Other strategies to address potential funding cuts include accelerating the closure of schools the district is currently phasing out, reducing discretionary funding, freezing vacant positions, decreasing operating costs, decreasing the frequency of technology refreshes, and reducing insurance coverage.
But he strongly urged those in attendance to reach out to state and federal lawmakers to share their concerns and ask them to fight back against the potential cuts.
“This current president and administration is not supportive of our children and our communities based on their budget. Budgets define your priorities, period,” Vitti told those in attendance.
The possibility of federal funding cuts was the talk of a recent superintendent’s meeting for the school districts that are part of the Northwest Education Services.
Like most intermediate school districts in Michigan, the agency provides a range of direct services to students. Ceglarek, the superintendent, said he’s particularly concerned about proposed cuts in Medicaid funding.
Ceglarek said schools rely heavily on Medicaid dollars to provide services to students from low-income households and students who have individualized education programs, or IEPs, which spell out what services schools are required by law to provide.
“When a student has an IEP, we are obligated as a district to ensure that plan is enacted and those services are provided, whether we get funding for it or not,” he said.
The ISD receives more than $2 million in Medicaid reimbursements, which is used to hire speech and language pathologists, psychologists, social workers, and physical therapists and then “deploy them into our local districts to provide these needed services.”
“It’s quite an efficient model,” Ceglarek said. “Many of our districts … don’t necessarily need a full-time speech pathologist. They may only need a half-time person.”
He has the same concern about any potential cuts to federal migrant student funding, because the ISD hires a specialist who travels among the districts and provides a range of services to English learners.
“Should those dollars be eliminated … That’s a scary proposition,” Ceglarek said.
 ‘You want your kids to do well in life

	.’
“Are you ready?” one girl standing at the front of the classroom at Detroit’s Mark Twain school said to her peers. When they all said yes, she began reading sounds such as “ing,” “sp,” “a,” and “wh.” With each sound, the students wrote what they were hearing onto a dry erase board then held it up when they were done.
After a few exercises led by Sommerville, she turned it over to her students to guide their peers. Having students lead an activity isn’t part of the academic intervention program, but it’s something Sommerville began doing because students expressed an interest.
“To me, they take ownership of the program,” Sommerville said. They do so well that when Sommerville’s coach visited her classroom two months ago, she joked that, “you’re not going to have a job.”
Sommerville is trying to remain hopeful that the Trump administration won’t make substantial cuts to education.
“I think he’s just being spiteful right now, but I don’t think he’ll do that. Because you want your kids to do very well in life. You really do, and that looks bad on him if you cut education. This is a representation of you, you know,” she said.

A little over a mile away from Mark Twain, at Ralph J. Bunche Elementary School in Ecorse Public Schools, similar literacy interventions were taking place as Marcie Gould, a tutor/interventionist, worked one-on-one with a struggling third grader.
After doing a warm up activity, Gould, who wore a black shirt with “literacy and justice for all” written in colorful letters, pulled out a set of small tiles and laid them out in front of the girl.
“We call these letter tiles so it helps the kids have a more hands-on experience,” Gould said of the tiles, each of which had different sounds that she moved around to create words and asked the student to read out loud.
The Ecorse district uses state early literacy grant dollars to pay for tutors like Gould from the Michigan Education Corps. But the program could still be affected by federal cuts. The Michigan Education Corps program is part of AmeriCorps, a federal initiative that has undergone significant cuts since Trump took office.
Ecorse Superintendent Josha Talison said that if any facet of the program had to be altered because of funding cuts, he would be concerned.
“Because the program has aided in the reading comprehension growth of our students since the program has been in place over the last five or six years,” he said.
Holly Windram, executive director of the Michigan program, said a continuing budget resolution Congress passed March 14 keeps their funding stable through the 2025-26 school year for the 80 or so schools that will use corps tutors. After that, there is uncertainty. Federal funding makes up 20% of its budget, and if that funding is cut for the 2026-27 school year, she’ll need to seek other sources of money.
“We financially have diversified funding. I’m concerned, but I’m not panicking financially at this point. My question is who are we going to get our money from,” Windram said.

,Mississippi Today,2025-04-27 11:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Jim Hood’s opinion provides a roadmap if lawmakers do the unthinkable and can’t pass a budget,Bobby Harrison,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/04/27/jim-hoods-opinion-provides-a-roadmap-if-lawmakers-do-the-unthinkable-and-cant-pass-a-budget/,"An official opinion of the office of Attorney General Jim Hood issued in 2009 said if there is no budget passed by the Legislature, those services mandated in the Mississippi Constitution, such as a public education system, will continue.","On June 30, 2009, Sam Cameron, the then-executive director of the Mississippi Hospital Association, held a news conference in the Capitol rotunda to publicly take his whipping and accept his defeat.
Cameron urged House Democrats, who had sided with the Hospital Association, to accept the demands of Republican Gov. Haley Barbour to place an additional $90 million tax on the state’s hospitals to help fund Medicaid and prevent the very real possibility of the program and indeed much of state government being shut down when the new budget year began in a few hours. The impasse over Medicaid and the hospital tax had stopped all budget negotiations.
Barbour watched from a floor above as Cameron publicly admitted defeat. Cameron’s decision to swallow his pride was based on a simple equation. He told news reporters, scores of lobbyists and health care advocates who had set up camp in the Capitol as midnight on July 1 approached that, while he believed the tax would hurt Mississippi hospitals, not having a Medicaid budget would be much more harmful.
Just as in 2009, the Legislature ended the 2025 regular session earlier this month without a budget agreement and will have to come back in special session to adopt a budget before the new fiscal year begins on July 1. It is unlikely that the current budget rift between the House and Senate will be as dramatic as the 2009 standoff when it appeared only hours before the July 1 deadline that there would be no budget. But who knows what will result from the current standoff? After all, the current standoff in many ways seems to be more about political egos than policy differences on the budget.
The fight centers around multiple factors, including:

Whether legislation will be passed to allow sports betting outside of casinos.
Whether the Senate will agree to a massive projects bill to fund local projects throughout the state.
Whether leaders will overcome hard feelings between the two chambers caused by the House’s hasty final passage of a Senate tax cut bill filled with typos that altered the intent of the bill without giving the Senate an opportunity to fix the mistakes.
Whether members would work on a weekend at the end of the session. The Senate wanted to, the House did not.

It is difficult to think any of those issues will rise to the ultimate level of preventing the final passage of a budget when push comes to shove.
But who knows? What we do know is that the impasse in 2009 created a guideline of what could happen if a budget is not passed.
It is likely that parts, though not all, of state government will shut down if the Legislature does the unthinkable and does not pass a budget for the new fiscal year beginning July 1.
An official opinion of the office of Attorney General Jim Hood issued in 2009 said if there is no budget passed by the Legislature, those services mandated in the Mississippi Constitution, such as a public education system, will continue.
According to the Hood opinion, other entities, such as the state’s debt, and court and federal mandates, also would be funded. But it is likely that there will not be funds for Medicaid and many other programs, such as transportation and aspects of public safety that are not specifically listed in the Mississippi Constitution.
The Hood opinion reasoned that the Mississippi Constitution is the ultimate law of the state and must be adhered to even in the absence of legislative action. Other states have reached similar conclusions when their legislatures have failed to act, the AG’s opinion said.
As is often pointed out, the opinion of the attorney general does not carry the weight of law. It serves only as a guideline, though Gov. Tate Reeves has relied on the 2009 opinion even though it was written by the staff of Hood, who was Reeves’ opponent in the contentious 2019 gubernatorial campaign.
But if the unthinkable ever occurs and the Legislature goes too far into a new fiscal year without adopting a budget, it most likely will be the courts — moreso than an AG’s opinion — that ultimately determine if and how state government operates.
In 2009 Sam Cameron did not want to see what would happen if a budget was not adopted. It also is likely that current political leaders do not want to see the results of not having a budget passed before July 1 of this year.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/07000813/MG_6720-scaled.jpg,,,2025-04-27 07:59:10.165668

“Not selling dope, selling hope,” says Justin Johnston, a Brattleboro police arrestee turned assistance team staffer who’s helping others escape the hard knocks of substance use and the streets.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Once drug dependent and desperate, this Vermonter had a problem. Now he’s part of the solution..","Justin Johnston, a recovery specialist with the Brattleboro Police Department, stands in front of a downtown mural. Photo by Kevin O’Connor/VTDiggerAsk Justin Johnston why he recently joined the support staff of the Brattleboro Police Department and he’ll rewind some quarter of a century to the day its officers took him into custody at age 11.Johnston was 3 when his father died, leaving his mother to juggle two jobs, two children and an unwanted yet unrelenting dependence on alcohol. Finding himself uprooted from Florida to Ohio to Vermont, the schoolboy arrived in Brattleboro to his first stirrings of adolescence — and, feeling lonely and lost, sparks of anger.“My mom had called the police because I was out of control,” the now 39-year-old recalls. “I picked up some object and went to throw it at the wall.”What he hurled he can’t remember. The fact it hit her he can’t forget.Johnston marked his 12th birthday in the first of several foster and group homes.“I started smoking weed,” he says today, “and eventually, you do it so much, you have to find a way and a means to get it.”Johnston befriended and began working with drug dealers. At 17, he was convicted and jailed for selling crack cocaine. He’d graduate high school at Southern State Correctional Facility in Springfield, then move in and out of prisons in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York and Kentucky. Arrested for dealing heroin just before turning 30, he finally landed in a federal penitentiary in Pennsylvania.Johnston can detail every moment of his descent into drugs and despair. But now sober for a decade, the newly hired recovery specialist for the police department’s Brattleboro Resource Assistance Team would rather share how he — and others — can rise above.‘What’s wrong with me?’Johnston never had an easy childhood, which went from bad to worse when, as an elementary schooler, he discovered the truth about his father.“For most of my life, I had thought he died in a car accident,” he recalls. “And then I found an article in my mom’s bedroom and learned that it was by suicide.”The resulting questions swarmed Johnston as if he had struck a hornet’s nest.“Why didn’t he love us enough to not do this?” he remembers thinking. “What’s wrong with me?”With his mother often away working a double shift, Johnston had few people other than his younger sister to ask. And so he sought validation from other boys in their rough-and-tumble neighborhood.“I might not have a car or a big house with a swimming pool or ever invite you on a family vacation, but I can show up at the party with alcohol, I can get you marijuana, I can get you mushrooms,” he recalls thinking. “I wanted to show that I had something to offer, that I could fit in, that I could run with the crowd.”And from himself.“It might have started with fun,” he says, “but it eventually became a way to numb myself, to just ignore the world, to be lazy, to ignore responsibilities and what my future might look like.”Justin Johnston as pictured in 2022 at his past job as a recovery counselor at Turning Point of Windham County. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger‘It never felt like a real punishment’At 17, Johnston was convicted of a felony drug charge and incarcerated a half-hour north of Brattleboro in Springfield.“It never felt like a real punishment that was deterring me from making bad decisions,” he says of his years in state prison, “because I was around all of my friends, hanging out, playing cards, eating food, watching sports.”Industrious, Johnston also sold tobacco and unnamed “illegal substances” and ran sports betting and gambling operations “to keep me surviving and sometimes living so well I was sending my mother money.”Returning home, Johnston met his partner, Deidre, who later became pregnant. He was at her last prenatal appointment when, on the run from probation and parole, he was seized and sent back to jail before his daughter’s birth in 2009.Johnston boomeranged in and out of prison, all while banking up to six figures dealing drugs. By 2011, someone invited him to try a few blueberries — not the fruit, but the street name for oxycodone pills. They melted his pain like hot cobbler with ice cream.Johnston began seeking and selling opioids locally, not knowing an aggressive marketing push by pharmaceutical companies was leading to a rise in substance use disorders and overdoses nationwide.‘I might as well do everything now’“I kept telling myself, ‘I’m not a junkie, I’m not an addict, I’m just having fun, hanging out, this isn’t a big deal,’” Johnston recalls.Then news of an “opioid crisis” — former Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin dedicated his entire 2014 State-of-the-State address to the topic — sparked a clampdown in prescriptions.“I got to a breaking point where I could not find them anymore,” Johnston says. “I remember vividly sitting in a car with somebody who happened to say, ‘Well, I do have these bags …’”Johnston opened one and inhaled the heroin powder inside.“Maybe I can just do this a day or two until I find more oxy,” he thought amid a rush of pleasure.The backdraft hit seconds later.“I said to myself, ‘You’re doing heroin — your life’s over. I might as well do everything now.’”Sniffing that initial half-bag grew into snorting up to 100 bags of the drug a day. In between, he smoked crack cocaine morning to night.“Over time, the money I had saved up just dwindled down,” he says. “I lost the apartment, I sold my motorcycle, I crashed all my cars into trees or signs.”It was just the beginning — the beginning of the end.Justin Johnston checks messages with the help of his new rescue dog, Chase. Photo by Kevin O’Connor/VTDigger‘A minnow in an ocean full of sharks’One evening in early 2014, Johnston was walking his dog when he passed out. Authorities, finding him and one of his drug stashes, sentenced him to 28 months at the Schuylkill Federal Correctional Institution in Pennsylvania.It was nothing like state detention.“I would have been known locally as one of the bigger dealers, so that can inflate your head and make you think you’re the man,” Johnston says. “Then I went to federal prison and realized I’m just a minnow in an ocean full of sharks.”One of his first Pennsylvania cellmates was a man with Mafia ties who was convicted under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, better known as RICO.“In for double life, plus 80 years,” Johnston recalls. “I’m meeting Mexican cartel members and blue-collar crime guys in a culture that forces people, out of survival, into being violent. That’s one thing I’m not. I desperately wanted to avoid prison politics and drugs so I didn’t end up in a maximum-security penitentiary. I thought, ‘How can I avoid going to the rec yard to fight a gang or race war?’” Johnston’s answer: Stop using drugs and stuff his day with classes. In a substance use course, he learned about post-acute withdrawal syndrome.“It started to make sense where all my emotions were coming from, why one day I just wanted to lash out and others I had a vision of a real future. My brain was healing. I said, ‘I’ve got to give myself some time to get through this.’”READ MORE





 


Addiction recovery centers ask for more state dollars as they face difficulty hiring, keeping workers

‘They had every reason to suspect’In the movies, a reformed inmate exits a dark cell into the blinding shine of promise and potential. But returning home in 2017, Johnston was enveloped by fear and cravings for a fix.Signing up for opioid dependence treatment at the Brattleboro Retreat, he met a volunteer peer coach who introduced him to the nearby Turning Point of Windham County recovery center.“I felt hope and safety and connection to people who understood me,” he says. “I could see a future. I could see brighter days.”Then that September, his sister died of an opiate overdose at age 28. “My mom and I sat with her as she took her last breath,” he recalls. “In that moment, I made a promise that I was going to do everything I possibly could to break this cycle. I didn’t know if I would really be able to keep it, but I knew every day I was going to try my hardest.”Johnston renewed the vow a year and a half later when his mother died of cancer at age 58. Going on to have a son with his partner, the father of two became a recovery counselor. He soon found himself working alongside the same police who once arrested him.“As a predicate felon who had no job history and had done very little positive at this point in my life, they had every reason to suspect I might go back to my old ways,” Johnston says.Instead, police hired him to serve as a community resource specialist under a new effort to put more social workers and unarmed support staff on the streets.“This young man has shown what can be accomplished by someone who can get their life together,” Brattleboro Police Chief Norma Hardy said at a recent town selectboard meeting.A decade clean from heroin, Johnston sums up his status: “Not selling dope, selling hope.” Justin Johnston leaves his business cards at emergency phones in Brattleboro. Photo by Kevin O’Connor/VTDigger‘We need to change the norm’Today, Johnston works in a town where county records show a statistically higher rate of hospital visits for opioid overdoses compared to the rest of the state, according to the Vermont Department of Health.Caught between calls for a police crackdown and pleas for public compassion, Johnston wants the community to find common ground in the concept of “compassionate accountability.”Johnston demonstrates this strategy through his job. He talks with people struggling with substance use about treatment options, transports them to rehabilitation centers and connects them to social services as part of the town’s Project C.A.R.E. (Community Approach to Recovery and Engagement) — all with the understanding that continued illegal activity could lead to police action.“I think it’s more harmful to sit back and watch people die slowly,” he says, “versus help them be accountable to themselves and others for the best shot at a happy and healthy life.”That’s not always easy. Johnston notes several dueling challenges: How can society respect people’s autonomy to make their own decisions and, at the same time, recognize the fact addiction hijacks a brain? How can a community aim to help everyone as well as afford sufficient resources for sober living and co-occurring substance use and mental health conditions?“I support all pathways to recovery, including harm reduction,” he says, “but it’s unrealistic to think a majority will live a long, happy, healthy, dignified life sustaining daily fentanyl use.”For all his firsthand knowledge, Johnston is still learning. Take his recent introduction to college courses. One social service teacher extolled the benefits of evaluating clients through a formal and formulaic survey of their biopsychosocial history.“I found myself always challenging what was being taught,” he recalls. “Why would I ask somebody 80 questions in a row when I could have a conversation and get what I need out of a real connection? For too long, someone has sat across a desk and made you feel like they’re only there to diagnose and fix you, not to understand you, not to really listen to you, not to meet on that very human level. We need to change the norm.”He’s starting with himself.“I view recovery not as just being sober, but working every single day to show up for myself, my family and community, to be honest, to have integrity, to challenge my irrational thoughts and form new ones, all while recognizing I’m not perfect,” he says. “I’m going to have bad days. And when I do, I’m going to give myself some grace. If I can be hired by police, somebody might see that and think, ‘Maybe my past isn’t going to hold me back forever.’”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Once drug dependent and desperate, this Vermonter had a problem.

The Trump administration paused access to more than $16 million sent to Vermont through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Despite funding freeze, demand for EV chargers remains at mountain resorts.","Photo courtesy of the Community News ServiceOwen Evans is a reporter with the Community News Service, a University of Vermont journalism internship.As the ski season comes to a close, something that continues to be on the minds of mountain resort operators is electric vehicle charging. Since 2021, the number of electric vehicles registered in Vermont has more than doubled. The same can be said for Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York and New Jersey — where the highest number of out-of-state skiers in Vermont come from.Many of Vermont’s ski resorts already offer EV charging in their parking lots, including Killington Mountain Resort, which offers 47 chargers for guests, a total which leads the industry in the U.S. But many resorts either have limited charging options or lack chargers entirely, detracting from the guest experience. “I have power anxiety if the resort doesn’t have chargers,” said Joanna Whitcomb, a New Hampshire resident and frequent Vermont skier. “They’re well maintained but generally in use. More chargers are needed.”Beyond charger availability, other issues have been felt. “General courtesy from users, including staying at a charger when not necessarily needed, and not properly rehanging the cord and plug” are some of the challenges at Sugarbush Resort, said Margo Wade, director of planning.That can prove a problem in the winter, she said, when loose cords can get caught by plow trucks and send a charger out of service for weeks. “If the plug is not properly rehung and gets wet from snow or rain, it can short out the unit, which requires resort staff to dry and reset the unit,” Wade added.Molly Mahar, president of the Vermont Ski Areas Association, believes EV charging is something resorts will have to invest in if they haven’t already — and that they need to continue to invest in what they already have. “Ski area guests are early adopters of technology like EVs, and ski areas have seen more EV traffic and growing demand for charging infrastructure in recent years. It’s important that ski areas provide charging infrastructure to accommodate how their guests travel and encourage use of clean transportation,” Mahar said. “Transportation is a major source of Vermont’s carbon emissions, and we want to support guests’ use of EVs to travel to Vermont and to the ski areas.”Sugarbush, which currently offers 24 chargers divided among the Mt. Ellen and Lincoln Peak parking lots and the Claybrook Hotel garage, is looking to add to its existing infrastructure. “We hope to expand our EV charger program at the resort in the future,” said Wade. “Current limits to expansion include cost to upgrade/upsize electric service at specific locations and cost to purchase and install electric vehicle supply equipment.” Mahar said upgrades require investment from the state, too. “They have done a decent job with charging infrastructure. Another project was about to get underway to add more charging infrastructure using federal dollars, but this is now on hold due to cuts in federal spending,” she said.In February, the Trump administration paused access to more than $16 million in federal funding sent to Vermont’s Agency of Transportation through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program. Andrew Wright, environmental policy manager for the agency, said one station already operating in Bradford will continue receiving funds. But in February, the agency suspended “four executed contracts and five awards” for additional charging installations, Wright said. The agency had directed funding to 11 charging station projects on the whole; the two contracted locations that were not suspended, in Randolph and Wilmington, will be paid for by state funds. The sidelined contracts and awards — as well as future ones — depend on moves at the federal level, Wright said.The ski industry is a significant part of Vermont’s economy. In 2023, the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis found outdoor recreation created $2.1 billion in value added for Vermont, accounting for 4.8% of Vermont’s gross domestic product. The highest economic contributor to Vermont’s outdoor sector was snow activities, including skiing and snowboarding, which contributed $220 million to Vermont’s GDP, up from $170 million in 2022. Across Vermont, there are over 490 charging stations with almost 1,300 total charging ports. A detailed map of every charger in the state can be found on the U.S. Department of Energy’s website. Read the story on VTDigger here:  Despite funding freeze, demand for EV chargers remains at mountain resorts.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ev-charger.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-27 06:59:17.924243

(Photo by Mathieu Lewis-Rolland/Getty Images)ISSAQUAH, Wash. — In the wake of recent natural disasters, state leaders across the country are finding that emergency support from the federal government is no longer a given.
Under President Donald Trump, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has denied federal assistance for tornadoes in Arkansas, flooding in West Virginia and a windstorm in Washington state. It also has refused North Carolina’s request for extended relief funding in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.
While it’s not uncommon for the feds to turn down some requests for disaster declarations, which unlock federal aid, state leaders say the Trump administration’s denials have taken them by surprise. White House officials are signaling a new approach to federal emergency response, even as Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem threaten to shut down FEMA altogether.
“The Federal Government focuses its support on truly catastrophic disasters—massive hurricanes, devastating earthquakes, or wide-scale attacks on the homeland,” Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the National Security Council, which advises the president on issues of national security, said in a statement to Stateline.
Hughes said state and local governments “often remain an impediment to their own community’s resilience.” He called on states to take on a more extensive role.
“States must have adequate emergency management staff, adoption and enforcement of modern building codes, responsible planning and strategic investment to reduce future risk, commonsense policies that prioritize preparedness over politics, disaster reserve funds to handle what should be routine emergencies, pre-negotiated mutual aid and contingency contracts that speed up recovery, and above all, an appetite to own the problem,” the statement said.

State emergency management leaders say the federal retreat from disaster response has upended a long-established system.
“This is very unusual,” said Karina Shagren, communications director with the Washington Military Department, which oversees the state’s emergency management division. “This is the first time in recent memory that we have hit all the indicators to get FEMA’s public assistance program and we’ve been denied.”
Michael Coen, who served as chief of staff at FEMA during the Obama and Biden administrations, said the president has “broad discretion” to approve or deny disaster requests, regardless of whether they meet specified conditions. If Trump intends to curtail federal support, Coen said, he should give states clear guidelines.
“They should have a dialogue with the states, so the states aren’t spinning their wheels making requests that are going to get denied,” Coen said.
He added that states need guidance if they’re expected to build emergency management programs to take on what the feds once handled. Not all states, Coen said, have the capacity to replicate those functions. And disasters are expected to increase in frequency and severity because of climate change.
“Having that capability in every single state instead of having one FEMA is not the best use of tax dollars to prepare for the worst day,” he said.
Historically, FEMA has coordinated the federal response during emergency situations. In the National Security Council statement, Hughes said Trump has promptly authorized “life-saving emergency support to states during and in the immediate aftermath of disasters.”
But the agency’s larger role has focused on recovery after disasters, assessing damage and distributing funding to help communities rebuild. Now, some communities are finding that support is no longer a sure thing.










They should have a dialogue with the states, so the states aren't spinning their wheels making requests that are going to get denied.

Issaquah, Washington, was among the cities hit hard by the “bomb cyclone” that ripped through the state last November. Severe winds killed two people in the state, knocked out power for hundreds of thousands of residents and caused millions in damage, state officials said.
A city of about 40,000 residents in the Cascade foothills, Issaquah’s costs from the storm totaled $3.8 million — covering road repairs, removal of 800 tons of tree debris and overtime pay for first responders. Mayor Mary Lou Pauly said the city has seen four events since 2020 that qualified for federal disaster aid, with no previous denials. If Washington is unable to win its appeal with FEMA, she said, Issaquah will take a financial hit to its reserves, leaving it more vulnerable to future storms.
“We put a lot of investment in being resilient,” Pauly said. “When you get to a number like $3.8 million, that is too big of a number for us to be able to rebuild without assistance. Our residents pay federal taxes, and this is what they think they pay them for, this is what they expect their national government to do. They do not want me to set property taxes 100% higher.”
Pauly echoed Coen’s view that FEMA should give states a clear outline of the role it will play.
“What we all want to know is what are the rules of the game?” she said. “If the criteria has changed, then why aren’t we getting told about it?”
Washington state leaders said they were shocked when FEMA denied their request for $34 million to help repair roads, utilities and power systems. Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson said the state’s application met all of the “very clear criteria to qualify.” He has vowed to appeal the decision.
“We were really relying on that funding,” said Shagren, of the Washington Military Department. “If the appeal is denied, our local jurisdictions will have to prioritize which projects they can move forward with and which they don’t. They’re going to be impacted greatly. This wasn’t some small storm.”

Other states also have been surprised by FEMA denials. Arkansas suffered 14 tornadoes last month, triggering a request for a disaster declaration from Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders. But the feds told state leaders to handle it on their own.
“[I]t has been determined that the damage from this event was not of such severity and magnitude as to be beyond the capabilities of the state, affected local governments, and voluntary agencies,” the federal government’s denial read, according to Arkansas Times.
Sanders has appealed that decision, saying the disaster caused “widespread destruction” that requires federal help.
In West Virginia, state leaders asked for disaster aid to cover 14 counties that were struck by flooding in February. But FEMA denied individual assistance to seven of those counties. Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey said in a statement that he is looking at options to appeal, but praised the Trump administration for its “strong support” following the floods.
Democratic leaders in the state have called on Morrisey to demand more help from the feds, WOWK reported.
Meanwhile, FEMA has said it will no longer match 100% of North Carolina’s spending to recover from September’s Hurricane Helene. Democratic Gov. Josh Stein said the cost share was crucial to the state’s efforts to rebuild.
“The need in western North Carolina remains immense — people need debris removed, homes rebuilt, and roads restored,” Stein said in a statement this month, according to NC Newsline. “I am extremely disappointed and urge the President to reconsider FEMA’s bad decision, even for 90 days.”

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)On July 25, 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt gave a radio address to 125 million Americans in which he coined the term “first 100 days.” Today the 100th day of a presidency is considered as a benchmark to measure the early success or failure of a president.
Mr. Trump’s 100th day of office lands on April 30 where the world has witnessed his 137 executive orders, 39 proclamations, 36 memoranda, a few Cabinet meetings and numerous press briefings. In summary, Trump’s cabinet appointments and arbitrary, capricious, ad-hoc and erratic actions have created turmoil in the stock market, utter confusion among our international trade partners and confounded unrest with consumers, workers, small business owners and corporate CEOs. Interestingly, an April 17 UMass/YouGov poll found that 26 percent of the people who voted for Trump have lost “at least some” of their confidence and appeal for our 47th president.
It appears The New York Times was the first media agency to report on just the 18th day of Trump’s 2.0 presidency that he was creating a constitutional crisis. That claim has been reported in multiple major news agencies, spoken in town-hall meetings and observed in thousands of public protests with demonstrators from all political persuasions requesting Congress and the Supreme Court to stop our democracy turning into an authoritarian dictatorship.
On March 25, I sent an e-mail to authoritarian scholar Barbara McQuade (Professor – Univ. Michigan Law School; U.S. Attorney Eastern Michigan – 2010-2017; author: “Attack from within: How disinformation is sabotaging America) seeking her expert opinion on what citizens would most likely witness when a constitutional crisis has occurred and recommended action citizens should take.
Two days later, McQuade replied to my inquiry: “1) If a president were to deliberately violate a court order, I think we could consider that a constitutional crisis. 2) Citizens can do many things to push back against abuse of power, such as vote, write to their member of Congress or participate in a protest, but I think the most effective thing a citizen can do is to talk to their friends and neighbors to explain their concerns and rally support.”
Peter Wehner, Republican, who served as the speechwriter for three GOP administrations (i.e., Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush) and senior fellow at Trinity Forum — an American faith-based non-profit Christian organization — feels Trump has created not one, not two, but three crisis situations. Wehner stated in an April 19-20 Wall Street Journal article “It seems as if we are moving at a rapid speed toward a genuine constitutional crisis, a genuine separation-of-powers crisis and a genuine checks-and-balanced crisis.”
You can decide if any of the following actions and published repercussions put America in a precarious dilemma:

Trump has openly defied federal court directives, refusing to halt deportation flights to El Salvador and return an illegally deported Maryland man.
Trump has eliminated and/or dismantled federal agencies – like USAID – by executive order, bypassing Congressional authority.
Trump has claimed the right to withhold or redirect federal funds appropriated by law, undermining Congress’s constitutional power of the purse.
Trump has fired civil service-protected employees, a violation of federal law.
Trump is attempting to end birthright citizenship by executive action, a constitutional right under the 14th
Trump has withheld funds from universities without legal justification.
Trump has revoked visas solely because of the holders’ expressed viewpoints, violating First Amendment protections.
Trump has attacked federal judges, questioning their legitimacy and authority, which erodes the independence of the judiciary.
Trump has created DOGE without Congressional approval, challenging the separation of powers.
Trump has set tariffs on our trading partners as opposed to Article 1, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution that grants Congress the explicit power to “lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises” and to “regulate Commerce with foreign Nations.”

Polling by the revered and non-political Reuters/Ispos found 83 percent of Americans feel “Trump must obey federal court rulings even if he doesn’t want to”. Wall Street Journal polling has shown, “voters want to keep constitutional guardrails in place that constrain a president’s power” (April 4).
Keep in mind, as of April 24 there have been 211 legal challenges to Trump administration actions (Just Security – New York Univ. School of Law). Additionally, a probable Trump-related contempt of court opinion was issued by U.S. District Court Judge James Boasberg which, if ordered, could lead to incarceration.
If you are concerned about Mr. Trump’s endeavors, consider the advice offered by law professor Barbara McQuade: participate in peaceful rallies, support political candidates committed to upholding constitutional democracy, communicate with your two Senators and Representative about your concerns and visit with friends about the trifecta crisis that is becoming more evident by political scientists, authoritarian scholars, constitutional law experts and registered voters like you and me.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/donaldtrumpfeb112025_0-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-27 06:59:17.924243

(Getty Images)A Louisiana lawmaker says he wants to avoid the scenario that unfolded last year in Alabama, where clinics offering in vitro fertilization closed their doors rather than risk legal liability based on a new interpretation of a 19th century law.
The matter has pitted some conservative Republicans, who normally take the same side on reproductive health issues, against one another. It also provides a glimpse into the national debate over IVF, which proponents fear could be threatened under Trump administration policy. 
Sen. Thomas Pressly, R-Shreveport, received committee approval Tuesday for Senate Bill 156, which he said “is essential for IVF to continue in Louisiana.” But the proposal’s language had to be massaged to get the backing of one staunch anti-abortion lawmaker. Even then, the measure is still opposed by the state’s top two anti-abortion groups. 
Senate Health and Welfare Committee member Rick Edmonds, R-Baton Rouge, stood firm on making a change to the definition of embryo in Pressly’s proposal. As a state representative, he authored a 2016 law to prohibit abortions for genetic abnormalities. 
Originally, Pressly’s bill referred to an “in vitro fertilized human embryo” as one that “has certain rights granted by law … and organized that it may develop in utero into an unborn child.” Edmonds amended the proposal to define an embryo as “biologically human,” removing any reference to whether it actually develops into a child.

These seemingly subtle differences in language could become critical if its final version creates a situation similar to what happened last year in Alabama. Its state Supreme Court ruled in February that frozen embryos outside the womb are considered children under the law, citing an 1872 statute that allows lawsuits for the wrongful death of a child. Fearing potential legal consequences from embryos that become nonviable – even through no fault of their own – IVF clinics in Alabama shut down.
The Alabama Legislature then scrambled to approve civil and criminal protections for IVF providers, leading clinics to reopen. There remain concerns, however, over whether long-term access will remain available. 
The Trump administration’s cuts to federal health care programs have served to reinforce such worries about the future of IVF. Staff reductions at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will curtail research into IVF and other fertility treatments, experts say. 
The changes have unfolded rapidly, even though Trump referred to himself as the “fertilization president” after signing an executive order last month to expand fertility treatment access. A separate order from Trump in February sought policy direction on IVF, yet Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency went ahead with the CDC attrition plans.

Anti-abortion groups back status quo
Louisiana Right to Life and Louisiana Family Forum oppose Pressly’s bill. Both groups were at the forefront of creating one of the nation’s strictest abortion bans three years ago after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade. The landmark 1973 opinion declared women have a constitutional right to an abortion, but it also said states could regulate when the procedure is allowed. With the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision in June 2022, justices removed the federal right to an abortion and opened doors to outright state bans. 
During Tuesday’s committee hearing, Pressly insisted his proposal was essential to ensure IVF remains available to 1 in 6 families that struggle with infertility, citing numbers the World Health Organization has used. It has been nearly 40 years since Louisiana has updated its IVF statute, and health technology improvements in the interim need to be reflected in the law, the senator said.
Kathleen Benfield, legislative director with Louisiana Family Forum, told the committee the Pressly proposal is unnecessary because the state’s IVF law has never been challenged.  
“Not one example has been given where the practice of in vitro fertilization or any other artificial reproduction technology has been threatened (in Louisiana), and I don’t think it will be threatened,” Benfield said.
Even with Edmonds’ amendment, the bill’s language was still problematic for Benfield. She took issue with describing a “viable in vitro fertilized embryo” as a “juridical person,” or an entity that has the same rights in law as a person but is not a human being. 
Put another way, Pressly’s bill doesn’t go nearly far enough to treat embryos as children, according to Benfield. A juridical person is “not the same thing as a natural person,” she said.
Last year, anti-abortion forces pushed to change to an IVF protection bill Rep. Paula Davis, R-Baton Rouge, sponsored. She shelved her bill when rather than include the term “biological human beings” in it, fearing it could lead to criminal consequences for reproductive care providers.
Davis has authored another version of her bill this year, but it has yet to be scheduled for a House committee hearing in the lawmaking session that ends June 12.
Erica Inzina, policy director for Louisiana Right to Life, said the state’s current IVF law has room for improvement, but it still offers the most protection for human embryos of any state. Pressly’s bill would weaken those safeguards, she said.
“It leaves the embryo looking a lot more like a thing rather than a person,” Inzina told the committee.
‘We’re quibbling’
The proposed changes are the product of a rather unusual partnership: Pressly, who gained approval for a first-of-its-kind abortion drug restriction; and Katie Bliss, an attorney whose firm specializes in in vitro fertilization contracts.   
Pressly, who joined the Senate last year after four years as a state representative, authored a law in 2024 that treats mifepristone and misoprostol as Schedule IV controlled dangerous substances. Both medications are used in abortions but have other applications, including lifesaving ones. The Schedule IV status puts them on par with drugs that have addiction and abuse potential, meaning hospitals have to keep them under lock and key. 
Some health care providers have said the added layers of security for controlled dangerous substances put women’s lives at risk when, for example, misoprostol is needed immediately to stop postpartum hemorrhaging.
Bliss has two children conceived through IVF. She said the revisions to existing law are needed to protect patients and physicians while also ensuring care for embryos.
Louisiana is the only state that’s made the destruction of embryos illegal, and conservative lawmakers have tried unsuccessfully in the past to stop patients from shipping embryos out of state for disposal. Such measures are unconstitutional, Bliss said, because one state can’t tell another state how to conduct business. 
Sen. Alan Seabaugh, R-Shreveport, attempted last year to end embryo transports across state lines, but the amendment he tried to attach to another lawmaker’s bill was ruled irrelevant to the original proposal and therefore was not allowed.
Pressly said his bill covers this scenario because it would make any IVF contract null and void if it includes a provision for the intentional destruction of an embryo.
Edmonds also objected to the removal of the terms “married couple” and “parental” from a section of existing IVF law that deals with embryo donations. Instead, “person” is used to describe an embryo donor and recipient. 
Pressly told Edmonds keeping “couple” in the law could create constitutional issues, implying it conveys bias against single people who want to start a family through IVF.
“It would be hypocritical for me to vote for a bill that would eliminate parental rights,” Edmonds said, though Pressly assured him his proposal doesn’t pose that threat.
Sen. Beth Mizell, R-Franklinton, shared with other committee members that she personally had a “horrible history of miscarriages” and feared her children would have the same difficulty. Through IVF, her son and daughter-in-law have given her three of her eight grandchildren.
Mizell said she had “a hard time finding obstacles” in a bill that gives more people the opportunity to start and grow families. 
“I’m listening to pro-life people argue with pro-life people,” Mizell said, who then recounted efforts during her nine years in the Senate to put strict abortion laws in place. As a result, she said Louisiana has the strongest anti-abortion laws in the nation. 
“… We’re there and we’re quibbling” over language to protect IVF, she said.

States worry that an executive order and federal funding cuts could weaken their cybersecurity efforts. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)For the first half of his career in law enforcement, working as a police officer in South Florida, Chase Fopiano did not think cyberattacks on police agencies were a serious threat.
Many of his law enforcement colleagues were under the same impression — that since they were the most likely to investigate the attacks, there was no way cybercriminals would go after them.
By about 2015, as technology advanced and hackers became more creative, that changed, Fopiano said. Now, from the U.S. Secret Service to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, there are thousands of attempts to compromise networks or organizations every day, he said.
“A lot of those [attempts] are toward government or even police, especially because they know that we’re not as prepared as we should be,” said Fopiano, who now oversees cybersecurity as part of a regional task force.
Spanning health care facilities to court systems, states and local communities are facing a rise in cyberthreats. They include threats to critical infrastructure, increased activity from foreign actors, continued ransomware attacks and more, according to a recent report from the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center.
But President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order shifting some of the responsibility from the federal government to states and localities to improve their infrastructure to address risks, including cybercrimes. And federal cuts have reduced resources for state and local officials, including a cybersecurity grant program and a key cybersecurity agency.
States and localities are taking steps to address the problems, such as establishing new penalties for tampering with critical infrastructure, centralizing state IT personnel and setting standards in areas from elections to health care.
But the Trump order and federal funding cuts, a shortage of IT experts at the local level and an overall lack of preparedness could weaken their efforts.
In December, a major cyberattack forced Rhode Island to take down its online portal used by residents to obtain Medicaid benefits and SNAP, commonly known as food stamps. The personal data stolen from Rhode Island’s public benefits network — including Social Security numbers and banking information — was later found on the dark web.
In February, a “sophisticated cyberattack” hit the office of Virginia Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares, which led agency officials to shut down computer systems and resort to paper court filings.
Earlier this month, hackers also breached the computer network of the Fall River School District in Massachusetts. The school district is working with third-party experts and law enforcement to determine if anyone’s personal information was targeted, according to MassLive.
In 2023, of the 48 states that participated in the Nationwide Cybersecurity Review, a voluntary self-assessment conducted by federal agencies that examines how well governments are prepared to respond to cyberattacks, only 22 states reached or surpassed the recommended levels of security in their systems.
Cybersecurity has become increasingly important over time because more government services and data are digitized, said Samir Jain, the vice president of policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology, a nonprofit that advocates for digital rights and freedom of expression.
But a national shortage of people with that expertise — especially at the local level — creates a challenge.
“The federal government has traditionally played at least some role in trying to fill some of those gaps,” Jain said. “And so the notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.”
Local governments and law enforcement agencies also have other priorities, Fopiano said. The police need cars, guns, shields and other resources that generally take precedence over cybersecurity.
Today, Fopiano is the cybersecurity chair of the Southeast Regional Domestic Security Task Force in Florida, overseeing cyber activity from South Florida to the Florida Keys. The attacks continue to rise, he said.
“Terrorist groups are getting into cybercrime, cartels are getting into cybercrime, you have kids just learning about hacking and just fooling around,” he said. “The audience of who’s doing it has definitely expanded and led to that rise in overall cybercrime.”
Cuts to federal resources
In 2022, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced a first-of-its-kind cybersecurity grant program, providing more than $1 billion in funding for states, localities, tribes and territories to address cybersecurity risks and threats.
The State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program, created under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, awarded $279 million to states and localities in fiscal year 2024. The Tribal Cybersecurity Grant Program awarded another $18 million for tribes in its first year.
But the grant program is set to expire in September, with no current plans to renew it. At a hearing this month, several state and local officials urged Congress to reauthorize the program. But U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who refused the federal aid during her tenure as governor of South Dakota, questioned the program’s efficacy.
The Trump administration is also cutting as many as 1,300 employees from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, which administers the grants alongside the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
The program has allowed states to assess the security of their networks, develop cybersecurity training, implement multi-factor authentication features — which requires users to provide more than one form of verification to access a site or service — and much more, said Alex Whitaker, the director of government affairs at the National Association of State Chief Information Officers.
“This has been a really great program because we’re seeing a lot of great evidence for how states and their counterparts in local government are improving their cyber defenses,” Whitaker said.
Counties also rely on a number of federal resources to strengthen their defenses, including services provided by CISA, said Rita Reynolds, the chief information officer at the National Association of Counties and managing director for County Tech Xchange. NACo is an organization that represents county governments across the United States.
The Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center, for instance — a key collaboration between CISA and the Center for Internet Security to help state and local governments with cybersecurity operations — lost some of its federal funding for certain programs last month, Reynolds said.
In trying to keep up with emerging threats, counties are still trying to find resources to help them implement multi-factor authentication, convert government pages to “.gov” domains and other methods of protecting their infrastructure, she said.
“Are counties prepared?” Reynolds asked. “I would say they’re not as prepared as they’d like to be. And in some cases, they are looking at how to strategically approach this now that resources are disappearing.”
In a statement, CISA spokesperson Jared Auchey said Trump’s executive order empowers state and local governments “to make risk-informed decisions and investments to improve their preparedness.” The agency will work with state and local officials to ensure they have the information and support they need, Auchey added.
Lawmakers step up
In 2024, 33 states adopted resolutions or enacted legislation regarding cybersecurity, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan public officials’ association.
Many of those measures sought to protect states’ critical infrastructure, including water systems, government services, health care and more. Florida, Louisiana, West Virginia and other states created new criminal and civil penalties for people who attempt to tamper with critical infrastructure.
In Minnesota and Washington state, lawmakers passed measures allowing or requiring state and local governments to invest in cybersecurity protections related to election administration. Connecticut and Florida also passed legislation to secure health care facilities from cyberattacks by having hospitals create plans or by supporting investments in new technologies.
Other states are looking for solutions from outside vendors. South Dakota has set aside $7 million for a company to examine local governments for vulnerabilities to hackers.
With attacks occurring at every level of government, New Mexico Democratic state Sen. Michael Padilla, the Senate majority whip, sponsored legislation in 2023 to create the state’s office of cybersecurity. As chair of the Senate Science, Technology and Telecommunications Committee for 10 years, he plays a significant role in most of the state’s cybersecurity legislation.
Through the committee’s work, Padilla says New Mexico is in good shape to fend off cyberattacks — and the state’s cities and counties are joining in.
“I think New Mexico is in a very good position because what we decided to do by creating that office is to ensure that any transactions that occur with state government here [in New Mexico] have to meet a minimum set of security standards,” he said.
In Indiana, Republican state Sen. Liz Brown filed legislation that would encourage state agencies and groups to develop cybersecurity policies. The bill was approved by both chambers, with the Senate agreeing to changes sent from the House.
“You have to protect your infrastructure,” Brown said. “We don’t want utility systems to be shut down. We don’t want wastewater or freshwater treatment plants or even the water supply being contaminated or harmed in some way. Our systems all have backups, but even so, we know there are bad actors.”
Some states are also preparing to reshuffle their offices or create new ones to centralize their cybersecurity efforts. Arkansas, for example, enacted legislation this month to create a new state cybersecurity office, which will monitor the state’s computer networks and respond to cyberthreats.
In Alabama, rather than having information technology people scattered throughout the government, Republican state Rep. Mike Shaw wants cybersecurity personnel centrally managed.
Shaw’s legislation, which passed the House and is currently in the Senate, would give the Alabama Office of Information Technology central authority to maintain the needs of all of the state’s departments.
The centralization would make it easier to pursue cybersecurity initiatives in the future, Shaw said.
“The federal government is really big, and it’s really hard to come up with a one-size-fits-all solution for things like cybersecurity, data privacy and technology in general,” Shaw said. “So, in some sense, it’s good that the states are coming up with their own.”

Collaborative processes structured to include the needs and expertise of citizens can lead to sustainable and effective outcomes when paired with clear policy goals, firm process constraints, and effective leadership. 
The post Abundance with input: We can build housing and energy systems without ignoring community concerns appeared first on CommonWealth Be[...]","In their new book Abundance, Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson make the case that laws and regulations designed to block the government and private sector from doing bad things have now made it far too expensive to do good things, especially to build what we need the most: housing and clean energy. They put the challenge starkly: “Changing the processes that make building and inventing so hard now requires confrontations with whether the systems liberals have built really reflect the ends they’ve sought.”   As public policy mediators, we share Klein and Thompson’s view that there is a need to reform unbalanced approaches to public input, requirements for many agencies to sign off on the same project with a myriad of permits, and legal challenges that focus on procedure rather than impacts.  But in our view, Klein and Thompson don’t spend enough time highlighting strategies that can work. We have been working for more than 30 years in Massachusetts and across the United States with government agencies, communities, and interest groups. We know that collaborative processes structured to include the concerns, needs, and expertise of citizens can lead to wise, sustainable, and effective outcomes when paired with clear policy goals, firm process constraints, and effective leadership.   Massachusetts is a case in point. It’s a blue state with plenty of obstacles to development. But state and local government, housing and energy developers, and environmental and community advocates have begun serious work on reforms that can make it easier to build while still providing for meaningful community input. Experience here offers three practical lessons on getting to more abundant housing and energy supply while ensuring public input and influence.  The first is to set clear goals in legislation and agency policy, and to constrain the opportunity for excessive procedural and legal challenges to those goals. Elected officials must set the “what” — what change in the world we are trying to make — while communities should have a say in the “how” — how that change can come about. In Massachusetts, Gov. Charlie Baker and the Legislature passed the MBTA Communities Act, with quantified multi-family zoning requirements for each of the 177 communities served by the greater Boston transit system. The act also allowed each community flexibility to decide where to put multi-family zoning districts, enabling residents to draw on their local knowledge and experience to help shape the future of their community. Most of the designated MBTA communities have responded positively, using their planning boards, town meetings, and citizen input to find good sites and avoid places where multifamily housing would not be viable or desired. At the same time, the courts have made it clear that creating these multi-family districts is a mandate that all towns must meet.      The Healey Administration has gone further with two recent multi-stakeholder groups. The Housing Advisory Council has just produced the first statewide housing plan with a target of 220,000 new units of housing by 2035, allocated across the state. The Unlocking Housing Production Commission (whose work our organization facilitated) has recommended additional, state-wide reforms of zoning and other regulations to remove barriers to housing development, while still giving local communities a significant voice in deciding where those developments are sited.  Both of these bodies represented diverse interests in housing and started with the premise that the need for more housing is not up for debate. Both have the backing of the governor. Now the Legislature needs to decide how much further it wants to go in addressing state and local barriers to housing production while continuing to allow communities a role in development decisions.  The second step is to reduce the number of veto points in new infrastructure development while providing better public processes. For many years, the conventional wisdom was to engage local communities early and deeply in big development projects, aiming to meet as many of their concerns as possible, and then secure the necessary public permits. That approach has reached a dead-end in the face of overwhelming, politicized “not-in-my-backyard” opposition to almost any new infrastructure project in most of the country. Instead, legislators can consolidate infrastructure permitting at the state level, provide funding for meaningful community input, and then decide on larger scale projects – without an option for opponents to mount legal challenges on issues already decided by the permitting authority. These authorities must still take and respond to input from individual citizens, local governments, interest groups, and state agencies. But they should ultimately make decisions on issues that the stakeholders cannot resolve.   Michigan, Illinois, Massachusetts, and other states are heading in this direction with new state energy siting legislation. While this approach does constrain avenues for participation, it provides far more clarity, predictability, and accountability than the typically convoluted multi-stage, multi-agency infrastructure permitting process. With a more consolidated siting approach, citizens actually know where to go to make their case, instead of chasing multiple authorities and jurisdictions.  In Massachusetts, the Commission on Energy Infrastructure Siting and Permitting brought together representatives from state agencies, municipalities, electric utilities, agriculture, labor, and others to hammer out an approach to energy siting that would expedite and streamline permitting. The approach would also constrain the ability of local interests to stop energy projects of a certain scale that would benefit the commonwealth as a whole, while providing more technical and financial support for affected parties to participate in the process. The commission’s recommendations, themselves a collaborative effort, led to the 2024 Climate Bill codifying these recommendations in law.  Finally, we must avoid over-representing those whose main goal is to oppose new housing or infrastructure efforts. We can do so by making sure that those who have something to gain also have a place at the table and support for being there. For example, we can find ways to give voice to young people who are not currently residents of a community but would wish to live there; those who grew up in the community but were displaced by high housing costs; or the policemen, teachers, and firemen unable to live in the communities where they work. We can bring representatives of these groups into local advisory bodies, to balance the voices of those who resist change to their neighborhoods. To enable working families to participate, we can use social media, surveys, games, hands-on tools, and online meetings. When we need in-person meetings, we can hold them where these residents live and provide childcare stipends or on-site day care for parents.    As Massachusetts’ experience has begun to show, communities and states across the country can overcome the obstacles making life less affordable and restricting opportunities for change. As mediators and facilitators, we have seen that people can and will get creative to solve problems if they’re given a mandate to work together and help to seek common ground. Diverse groups representing all the key interests at stake can produce broadly supported recommendations for the elected leaders who will make final decisions. We now need to apply that insight systematically in our municipalities and our state — and across the country — to create the abundant housing and energy supplies we need for the next generation.   David Fairman and Patrick Field are senior mediators with Consensus Building Institute, a nonprofit that helps leaders solve complex problems.The post Abundance with input: We can build housing and energy systems without ignoring community concerns appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Development.png?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-27 05:57:34.235030

Some lawmakers quibble with calling that a cut, and there’s a logic to their argument. The additional funding was a one-time supplement, approved in 2023, while the state was flush with federal COVID relief dollars. Now, some argue, the economy is back on its feet, there are plenty of job openings, and it’s time for the state to dial back assistance programs.
But the people maintaining that safety net say the need is greater than it’s ever been.
Gardens, pantries and food banks: How Ohio tries to keep pace with hunger

There’s an echo of the 2024 presidential election in that disconnect. The economy might look good on paper, but many are still struggling to make ends meet. Housing costs are rising. Wages aren’t keeping up. Inflation rates have come down. Grocery bills haven’t.
People who work in the food assistance system regularly point out that when money is tight, food is the first place families cut back. You can’t reduce your rent or electric bills, but you might be able to save some money leaning on canned goods or mac and cheese.
The state budget maintains food banks’ core appropriation of about $24.5 million year. But Mike Hochron from the Mid-Ohio Food Collective explained that’s the same funding they received in 2019. Back then his organization fed about 50,000 families in Franklin County each month. Now it’s 100,000.
“I don’t know how you’re supposed to serve twice as many people with the same amount of resources,” he said. “It means being really creative. It means being really efficient, and it also means figuring out how to make do with less.”

Faith Fellowship in Circleville 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
For a couple hours every Saturday, Pastor Susan Roark’s Faith Fellowship congregation runs a pop-up up food panty in an empty lot on Circleville’s Court Street. This is the front line of Ohio’s food assistance system. In communities all over the state, pantries provide households with groceries like meat, dairy, fruits, vegetables and grains.
An hour before they open, workers are lugging banana crates packed with food from a box truck and trailer. They’ve got a ring of folding tables steadily filling up with canned goods, produce and bread. A man pulls out a step stool to hang a large blue Faith Fellowship sign on the truck. Nearby a few workers are laying out used clothing.
There’s already a line of people waiting.
At one end of the lot there’s an old motor home. Inside Cecilia Seckman and Mary Martin are filling Styrofoam trays with food. This sets the Faith Fellowship pantry apart from many others. Visitors can pick up the typical panty basket, but they can also leave with a hot meal.
“We’re gonna have ham and potatoes, green beans, rolls, and cake,” Seckman says as she dips food out of a couple of crock pots. Tomorrow is Easter; a man from another church donated 17 hams.


The germ of Faith Fellowship’s pantry came from one of their congregants, William Michael Brown. He worked with a street ministry in nearby Chillicothe and wanted to bring the idea to Circleville.
“The Bible says you’re supposed to feed and clothe the needy,” Brown said matter of factly. “We all do what we’re supposed to do, it’s all trying to follow the Bible.”
He’s proud of how their effort has grown — “It’s just been a bloom,” he said — but the demand worries him a bit, too.

“I don’t know if it’s the wages, if it’s the cost of living, or what it is,” Brown said.
“They come from everywhere,” he added. “It’s a need.”
Eric and Ashley Wharton made the drive from Chillicothe. Eric said the pantry gives them some breathing room amid the rising cost of living. “I’m door dashing, but I’m barely surviving,” he said. Getting a hot meal on top of the pantry basket makes a huge impact for them.
“If you put the price on that, that’s $8-10 if we’re gonna go buy it,” he said. “So, I mean, that puts $10 back in my pocket that I can use for gas or use for something that’s a little bit more important.”
Talisha Myers said the extra meals take a lot of work off her plate.
“I have five kids, and then plus my father-in-law lives with us, so it’s like, it’s really hard,” she said. “We don’t qualify for food stamps or anything, because they say me and my husband make too much together.”
Roark’s congregation is only about 50 people, but they serve a couple hundred pantry visitors and give out about 250 meals each week. After only half an hour they’d given out 125 meals.
“I think the need is greater than our capacity to meet that,” she acknowledged. “And there are other organizations in town that are working to meet different needs, but all of us together still can’t meet the need.”

The Mid-Ohio Food Collective
Standing behind organizations like Faith Fellowship are the food banks. While pantries operate like a storefront, food banks serve as distribution centers. Ohio has regional 12 food banks, and with a 20-county footprint, the Mid-Ohio Food Collective is the largest.
“We’re sending food every day out as far as Steubenville — a three hour drive each direction,” Hochran explained. “So, whether that’s as far north as Marion, down south to Chillicothe and all the way out east to the West Virginia border, that’s all our territory.”
Mid-Ohio supplies food to more than 600 support organizations from a warehouse in Grove City. The building is the size of three football fields; think Costco but crawling with forklifts instead of shoppers looking for samples. Fully stocked, the warehouse can hold roughly 7 million pounds of food. But the goal, Hochran explained, is to move that stock out rapidly — sometimes the same day it arrives.
“Almost two thirds of what we distribute at Mid-Ohio is fresh food,” he said. To get produce out the door they proactively send out fresh food alongside the items pantries have ordered.
“We know you’re going to serve a couple hundred families today, that’s going to be about —make up a number — four pallets worth of fresh produce,” Hochran said. “We’ll pick from what we have and send out a good variety of it, because we don’t want this stuff sitting in our cooler for three days.”
A case in point is stacked up five feet tall on about twenty pallets.

“This is a good example of perfectly wholesome, delicious cabbage,” Ohio Association of Food Banks Executive Director Joree Novotny explained. “But it’s not going to have a retail market. It’s not up to size, up to snuff, in terms of what a retail customer is looking for and what our traditional grocers are looking for.”
That cabbage was purchased through an Ohio program helping farmers recoup their investment in produce that doesn’t quite make the grade for your local grocery store.
“So rather than see this all end up staying out in the fields or end up in a landfill, we’re able to bring it in at pennies on the pound,” Novotny added.
As she’s explaining that, forklifts are filing up and carrying away one pallet after another. While Hochron shows off a large display where they track delivery trucks in real time, more forklifts start unloading a new shipment. This time it’s pallets of yellow squash.

Statewide perspective
Novotny explains food banks around Ohio are getting squeezed in multiple ways. More people need their help, support programs are holding steady or rolling back and the money food banks have doesn’t go as far as it once did.
She points to seniors as an example. The Ohio Association of Food Banks estimates 70,000 Ohio seniors receive the minimum $23 benefit through SNAP, the federal food stamps program. But during the pandemic, the minimum SNAP benefit was more than $200. So where do they turn to make up the difference?
“Well, a good example, if you look right over here on these shelves,” Novotny said, “these are some of the raw products that come directly from the USDA for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program, which is a small but mighty program that food banks operate in Ohio.”
The problem is funding for that program has remained flat. The cost of groceries certainly has not.
“It’s a good sort of microcosm,” Novotny said, “of how that purchasing power that’s been more limited means less food for vulnerable people.”
Novotny said they’re seeing similar funding challenges at the state level. To explain their current circumstances, she reaches all the way back to the Great Recession. It took food banks a decade to settle at a “new normal” in 2019. At that point, she said, they were delivering take home groceries to about 850,000 times a quarter.
“Since then, putting all increases in need aside, if we were serving the same number of people today, we have significantly reduced purchasing power,” Novotny said. She noted the consumer price index for food has risen almost 24% in the last four years, and they’re not serving 850,000 households a quarter — they’re serving 1.4 million.
“We need some help,” she said, “to help adjust to that inflationary pressure.”
In their budget request, the Ohio Association of Food Banks asked for an inflation supplement of about $5 million on top of the $24.5 million they’ve been receiving since 2019. That request fell on deaf ears.
In February, House Finance chair, state Rep. Brian Stewart, R-Ashville, predicted that his caucus would keep historical funding in the budget but “maintaining a level of funding that we had at the worst economic times we’ve had is just probably not gonna be what we do.” That prediction held.
Novotny insisted “we will always have some food to provide,” but with government support at the state and federal level standing still while prices rise and more families seek out support, something’s got to give.
“We are already lightening the load significantly to each person who’s coming to us for help,” she said.

Nearly 1 in 5 Connecticut lawmakers are also landlords, far outweighing the number of renters in the General Assembly, according to an analysis by The Connecticut Mirror of the most recent financial disclosure reports.
While the majority of the 187 members of the state’s Legislature are property owners, the CT Mirror’s review shows that 35, or 18.7% of lawmakers, are also landlords. In the United States, closer to 7% of the population are landlords.
There are only 19 legislators who reported not owning any property, meaning they most likely rent. About a third of Connecticut residents are tenants.
The most recently available forms reflect last year’s legislature, although there are only 22 freshman lawmakers this session. Only four of those who left were landlords, and two were renters. It’s not clear which of the freshmen lawmakers are landlords because their financial disclosure reports won’t be available until May.

The landlord-tenant relationship has been one of the chief concerns of the Housing Committee for the past several legislative sessions. In 2023, adjustments that expanded renter protections accounted for most of the Democrats’ signature housing bill.
The issues have also drawn some of the fiercest debate and most-attended public hearings of the past three legislative sessions, with meetings lasting into early mornings. 
While lawmakers hold mixed opinions about whether and to what degree a legislator’s status as a landlord affects public policy, lawmakers from both parties have cited their experiences as landlords during discussion on bills that would alter the landlord-tenant relationship. 
Sen. Rob Sampson, R-Wolcott, a landlord and Housing Committee ranking member, said he considers his experience an asset.
“I’ve got significant amount of experience in this,” Sampson said. “My interest is completely on the side of making good public policy. I’m not picking a winner or loser in this situation. I want all sides to prevail, and that, in my view, is less government intervention.”
Sampson has historically opposed bills that are supported by tenant union members and tenants rights advocates, such as bills to reform eviction law and cap annual rent increases. 
Meanwhile, some lawmakers said their colleagues who are landlords are prioritizing personal income over Connecticut residents.
“I was taken back. I just didn’t think there would be so many landlords voting on issues, voting to put profits over people,” said Housing Committee co-chair Sen. Martha Marx, D-New London. Marx said she asked to be put on the committee because, in her experience as a home health care worker, she’s seen many people living in bad conditions.
“When I voted on housing issues, it’s through their lens. Those are the people that I’m thinking of,” she said, adding that she doesn’t believe many of her colleagues are thinking of renters.
Lawmakers rarely mention their experiences as renters during public debate on housing bills, according to longtime members of the Housing Committee and advocates.

Over the past couple of years, lawmakers have considered bills that would cap annual rent increases and another that would largely end no-fault evictions, which haven’t passed.
The evictions bill is back this session and passed the Housing Committee last month. It would end evictions that typically occur at the end of a lease for apartments with five or more units, if the renter has lived at the property for at least a year.
There is disagreement about whether this bill — and its amendments — is an example of pro-tenant or pro-landlord sentiment on the committee.
Committee ranking member Rep. Tony Scott, R-Monroe, pointed to the bill as a piece of pro-tenant legislation that has gotten attention over measures he thinks would be beneficial to landlords.
Marx said the fact that the bill also includes a caveat requiring a tenant to live at a property for a year before the protections kick in is an example of legislation that’s been watered down by landlords in the legislature.
Other lawmakers said the portions of the state’s tax code that benefit homeowners and a bill that would make it easier for police to quickly remove people from rental properties if they don’t have a lease are other examples of policies that prioritize property owners over renters. 
“If your financial interest depends on squeezing more rent out of the citizens of our state, then you’re not voting the way I think you should be voting,” Marx said. “Housing is a right. Everybody deserves stable housing, and everybody deserves a home.”
Financial disclosure forms
Lawmakers who own rental properties span across parties and chambers. Fourteen are Republicans, and 21 are Democrats. Nine are in the Senate, and 26 are in the House.
About 40% reported owning more than one property, including vacation homes and timeshares.
CT Mirror’s analysis classifies lawmakers who reported owning multiple properties and collecting rental income as landlords. CT Mirror also included lawmakers who report rental income, but their properties were listed as rentals on sites such as Zillow, and one who is a property manager.
Lawmakers who are involved in the real estate business or those who serve as attorneys for landlords are not classified as landlords in the CT Mirror analysis.
Lawmakers also varied widely in how thoroughly they filled out their financial disclosure forms. Some listed companies that own property but didn’t include the property on their forms, while others listed out each property and the income from that property individually. This could mean that there are rental properties that went unlisted on financial disclosure forms, in which case the CT Mirror’s analysis is an undercount.
Several lawmakers listed multiple properties in Connecticut but didn’t list rental income.

Advocates say the disproportionate number of landlords often means that tenants’ experiences don’t hold as much weight in public debate.
“There are so many conversations I’ve had with legislators where the first frame of reference is, ‘What I’m hearing from landlords,’ or, ‘My friend is a landlord,’ or ‘Myself as a landlord.’ Just anecdotally, that discourse is so often defaulting to a landlord perspective,” said Luke Melonakos-Harrison, vice president of the Connecticut Tenants Union.
State ethics rules require that lawmakers abstain from voting only if the legislation would disproportionately affect their business, compared to others in the industry. But advocates say public policy, particularly in the area of rental properties, is still shaped by the professional and financial goals of members of the General Assembly.
Advocacy groups that represent landlords and several legislators said they don’t think the impact is so obvious. They say state policy is usually more pro-tenant and that housing providers are best equipped as experts to craft policy.
The majority of landlords were also homeowners. For many legislators, it’s been years since they were last renters, and they might not know what it’s like to be a renter in today’s economy, advocates said.
“Much of the work that tenants have to do participating in the process is just providing a basic education of what it’s like to be a tenant,” Melonakos-Harrison said.

Shaped by personal experience
Connecticut has a part-time legislature, meaning the elected officials are typically either retired or hold other jobs because lawmakers only meet for part of the year. Several said they can’t help but be shaped by their experiences, and those experiences help color policy debate.
“I would love to see those folks take a little bit more of a step back and understand it from a holistic perspective,” said Housing Committee co-chair Rep. Antonio Felipe, D-Bridgeport. Felipe is one of few renters in the legislature. “But when you have personal experience, that personal experience is going to weigh in, and I think it might have overweighed itself in certain situations, but it’s kind of the name of the game.”
Felipe added that a lawmaker’s salary at a base of $40,000 annually makes it hard for people who work hourly jobs or don’t have passive income to run for office. He added that he hopes lawmakers understand that access to passive income isn’t the typical experience for Connecticut residents.
“You cannot support a family, or let alone yourself, on a legislator’s salary without some other income, whether it’s pension, retirement benefits, or a second job,” he said. “You have to figure out a way to pay the bills.”
Scott said he’d talked to many landlords in the legislature who have said they think the legislation is “going against them.”

Former Housing Committee co-chair Rep. Geoff Luxenberg, D-Manchester, said separating from personal experience often comes down to research. Lawmakers are barraged with sometimes hundreds of bills to consider and often don’t have time to research all the topics, he said.
That means they often lean on their own experiences, he said.
“When you’re lacking expertise in a certain area, as an elected official, I think there’s a tendency to rely on your values, your experiences, your life experiences, to shape how you might view a particular issue,” he said. “And that’s probably where it seeps in the most.” 
Luxenberg reported owning close to 60 properties — the most in the legislature — and draws rental income from most of them. He said his policy views have been shaped by the number of people who come to him desperate for housing.
“It’s like a harrowing front row seat to the most painful part of the housing crisis,” he said.
He added that it can go the other way — that lawmakers shape policy without an understanding of what it’s like to be a landlord. But he thinks it more frequently disadvantages tenants.
“It has been my experience, frequently, that policies that specifically help renters economically face a hurdle in the legislature, and I suspect part of that hurdle is a disconnect between the lived experience of legislators and the lived experience of extremely large number of people in Connecticut who are struggling to pay their rent,” he said.

Legislation proposed
Luxenberg said he’s proposed policy that would offer tax relief to renters, and the attempts have been shut down. Most housing-related tax relief programs for residents aim to encourage homeownership in an effort to help people build wealth.
But researchers have said this approach essentially rewards wealth, offering tax breaks on mortgage interest to people who are able to afford to purchase a home, while people who rent are left without much aid.
“All the benefits in the tax codes at every level of government are for ownership,” he said. “All the things we discuss expanding or increasing are about real estate ownership.”
Lawmakers and advocates also pointed to a bill from Rep. Minnie Gonzalez, D-Hartford, as one driven by her experience as a landlord. In her latest available financial disclosure form, Gonzalez, who is on the Housing Committee, reported that she owns three properties, including her own home.
She earned rental income from one, and her husband earned it from the other. During committee meetings, she’s talked frequently of an experience she described as a “nightmare.”
Gonzalez said she was driving by her rental home one night and saw that the lights were on, even though no one was supposed to be living there. She stopped by and found someone had moved in. 
It’s not clear why the person believed they had a right to be in the property, but Gonzalez says the person was squatting. It took her four hours to resolve it, and she’s since gotten out of the landlord business.
So, this session, she proposed a bill that would allow police to remove squatters from homes without going through a court eviction process.
“They’re not going to grow up, those people, they’re not going to have any responsibility at all,” Gonzalez said during a public hearing. “And it’s very hard to say, maybe very difficult for you to accept. Squatters are illegal, and it should be criminal, and they should be sent to jail.”
But attorneys, other Democrats and tenants rights advocates have raised concerns that the bill would violate due process. Some tenants say they have oral agreements with their landlords but nothing in writing, and it would be hard for police to decide who is telling the truth.
Rafie Podolsky, a longtime housing attorney, said the legal question isn’t whether breaking into a property is illegal but what to do in more complicated situations in which tenants don’t have a lease.
“There are also circumstances where people are living there on oral leases and do not have a single piece of paper that show that they are there with the landlord’s consent,” said Podolsky, during a public hearing. “And if a landlord says to the police, ‘I want this person out. I never agreed to this. Tell them to show you anything in writing,’ they may have nothing to show you, but it doesn’t resolve the question.”
The bill passed the Housing Committee 12-6, with several Democrats voting against it.
In response to the opposition, Gonzalez said in an interview that tenants should make sure they get written leases.
“We have to stop babysitting people,” she said in an interview. “We have to do what we’re supposed to do. Yes, let’s help people, if we have the way to help people, but allowing other people to go out there and take advantage? I don’t think it’s right.”

Eviction reform
Gonzalez also voted against the no-fault eviction bill and said in an interview that she doesn’t believe that there is a housing crisis. She often sees signs advertising apartments for rent or homes for sale, she said.
Data and research have shown that Connecticut lacks tens of thousands of units of housing that are affordable and available to its lowest-income renters and that thousands more across different socioeconomic lines are paying more than a third of their income to housing costs. Construction of new homes and availability of houses to purchase have also slowed.
Gonzalez said she thinks the issue isn’t related to supply but to rents that are too high. She favors capping annual rent increases, she said.
Marx said the no-fault eviction bill is an example of one that’s been watered down because of the perspective of landlords in the legislature.
“They watered down the affordable housing measures,” she said. “They watered down the tenants rights bills so that they don’t have any teeth, so that we really pass bills that just don’t do anything for the tenants, and life is just going to get harder for our lower and middle class citizens.”
The bill now includes a provision that says the protections against no-fault evictions don’t kick in until the tenant has lived at the property for a year. Marx says they should begin the moment a renter moves into a property.
The bill has been controversial, even within the Democratic party and among lawmakers who aren’t landlords.

Rep. Larry Butler, D-Waterbury, a former Housing Committee chair and current member, said he doesn’t think it’s a balanced bill that considers the needs of landlords. He voted against it in committee.
“The legislation is like using a hammer instead of using a scalpel, in my opinion,” Butler said. Butler owns his home but didn’t report any rental income or ownership of other properties. He said he was surprised to learn that so many of his colleagues are landlords because he hears about it infrequently.
Republicans have objected to the bill, saying it would violate landlords’ rights and could push people to leave the rental business, taking homes off the market. Sampson said in an interview that he’d heard from friends who are also landlords who say they’re considering giving up their business.
“It’s concerning to me that the Connecticut legislature and the majority seems to think that they have a right to tell people what to do with property that they own, that they worked for and paid for,” Sampson said.
Tenant rights advocates say the concerns are overblown and that the bill is simply an extension of rights that already exist for seniors and people with disabilities. Other states have similar laws and haven’t seen significant harms to their rental market, they say.
Melonakos-Harrison said he thinks the concerns of landlords are considered with more seriousness because lawmakers tend to interact more frequently with landlords than renters.
“People’s perspective on housing is very much shaped through the social networks that they’re in, by people who own property and make money off of property,” he said. “It’s rare to hear any lawmakers speak about the opposite perspective. Renter issues tend to be talked about as more of something that people are not personally familiar with in any meaningful way.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025_0108_SR_SessionFirstDay_402-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-27 05:00:55.227860

(Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)Find yourself a patch of land away from city lights just about anywhere in Kansas, and you will hear them. Sit down on a good rock and wrap yourself in the cold and dark, especially during a new moon in winter, and they will eventually begin to yip, yowl and yap. Their cries will grow in intensity until you might think yourself surrounded, subject to imminent attack, although you are likely as safe on the prairie as in your own bed.
What just sent a thrill down your spine is the cacophonous song of the coyote. These “song dogs” are among nature’s best survivors, an adaptable omnivore that has been with us since at least the last ice age. They are present in every state except Hawaii, are blamed for killing farm livestock and snacking on suburban house pets, and have been the target of unsuccessful eradication attempts for the past 200 years.
The latest campaign in the war on coyotes came April 24, when the Kansas Wildlife and Parks Commission voted 5-2 to extend the night-vision hunting season from the current three months to seven.
During the meeting, held at Fall River in southeast Kansas, the commissioners acknowledged various conflicts over extending the season but declined a request from Wildlife and Parks secretary Chris Kennedy for more time to study the coyote problem.
The new season would be Sept. 1 to March 31, excluding some firearm deer seasons. Currently, the season is limited to January, February and March. The extended season would not take effect until after the new regulation passes statutory and legal review and is officially adopted.
Night vision hunters typically spend thousands of dollars in rifles, scopes, and thermal optics. Their gear resembles tactical military gear, and that may be part of the appeal. We’ll get to this Zero Dark Coyote pretend combat presently, just as we will recount the story of a coyote named Rattlesnake.
In places like Kansas, where the myth of the frontier seethes just below the cultural surface, the coyote is not just a predator but a living symbol of the dichotomous desire to both hold the wild and to tame it. For First Peoples, Coyote often represents the Trickster, the entity who alternately brings creation and chaos. For ranchers, the coyote is a profit-eating pest to be eliminated by any means available. For romantics, the animal represents wildness, rebellion and cunning survival. We see ourselves in the clever and grinning countenance of these nocturnal ramblers.
Coyotes have been watchers on many of my outdoor adventures, but my best memory comes from a night some years ago sleeping on a sandbar on the Arkansas River far below Wichita. I had been kayaking the river for a book project and, retiring to my tent after miles of paddling, the coyote yips seemed like the voices of old friends. Their night song spanned the centuries, at least in my imagination, to a time before the plow broke the plains.
From the moment white settlers came to Kansas, coyotes were targeted for extinction because of real and suspected depredations. Rabbits and mice are the primary foods for coyotes, but just about anything can become a meal of opportunity — garbage, crops, livestock, the occasional toy poodle. Coyotes generally don’t attack human beings, although when cornered or trapped they can be dangerous, just as any wild animal can.
In 1916, the Kansas Supreme Court took up the case of a coyote in a Wichita zoo that bit a child.
Four-year-old Bessie Hibbard had been taken by her parents to the zoo at Riverside Park, where she put her hands in a cage containing a coyote on display. The animal bit and scratched her hand and arm. Bessie’s father sued the city for negligence. The state Supreme Court reversed a lower court ruling and found in favor of the city, saying officers and agents of the city were not liable for damages while performing official duties. A dissenting justice, Judson West, said the coyote cage was a “most malignant and excuseless” nuisance which afforded zoological specimens the opportunity to “dine upon the children” of visitors.
I’m with West.
For decades, beginning around 1900, the state attempted to eradicate coyotes by poison, firearms and paying bounties on their hides. When I was a kid, I remember some of my friends getting $2 per pair of coyote ears, paid by the county. I was a hunter in my youth, and always in need of money, but I never shot a coyote. I have since given up hunting, believing it immoral to kill wild things for money or sport. Your results may vary.
Perhaps the biggest change in the state’s approach to coyote management was the result of one man, F. Robert Henderson, a specialist who worked 27 years for the Kansas State Cooperative Extension Service. Henderson, hired in 1968, educated livestock producers across the state about the myths and realities of coyote predation.
“Not all coyotes kill livestock,” Henderson said in his memoir, published in 2016. “It is a learned thing on the part of the coyote. … I found out that generally ranchers hate coyotes.”
He also learned that most people who set out to kill coyotes end up thinking that killing indiscriminately is not the answer. Instead, you have to eliminate those animals that have learned to kill livestock, and the best way to do that is by trapping.
In the 1970s, Henderson set out to make an educational movie about coyote control. Lacking funds, he used a Super 8 movie camera and wrote his own script. The star of the film was Rattlesnake, a coyote the Henderson family had raised as a pet — something, the author cautioned, that “is not a good idea for you or the coyote.”
Rattlesnake became the film’s star because he would attack livestock when given the opportunity, a drama Henderson created with the help of a local rancher. It all seems a little bloody now, but I think the point of the staged scene was to show Rattlesnake running away when a pickup truck approached. When the film was shown, Henderson recalled, “Kids would first feel sorry for the calf, then cheer when the coyote got away.”
Like the kids, Henderson’s sympathy was with the coyote.
“Wild animals do get into situations where they create losses and cause people to have loss and worry,” Henderson wrote. “This is true, always has been and probably always will be.”
The actual number of cases is likely far fewer than generally believed.
Henderson’s memoir, appropriately called “Coyotes Go to Heaven,” is a sprawling and folksy account of his life, and that of his wife, Karen, from 1933 to 2016. Henderson recounts, among other things, hunting with Kansas Gov. Mike Hayden and the influence of environmental ethicist Aldo Leopold on wildlife conservation.
Henderson died in 2024. He was 91.
I was thinking about Henderson as I reviewed the video stream of the Wildlife and Parks Commission voting to extend the night vision hunting season for coyotes. I hadn’t known much about Henderson until a few weeks ago, when a friend suggested I check out his work. I’m glad I did, because Henderson seemed like somebody I could have been friends with.
I don’t presume to know what Henderson would have thought about the expanded coyote season, but I can tell you I find it disturbing. The kit — night scopes, thermal optics, and typically an AR-15 style rifle — seem more suited to urban warfare than recreational hunting. I suspect that playing war is the point for some. I don’t mean this mockingly, but hunting requires skills that are also useful in combat, something that novelist, soldier, and big-game hunter Ernest Hemingway knew well. But for all his faults, Hemingway did his hunting in the light.
Coyotes are officially treated as a non-game species, according to the Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks, but they are “regulated and managed” as furbearers. As a non-game species, they can be hunted during the day year-round, and there is no bag limit. In 2021, a three-month night vision hunting period was introduced, ending March 31. With a hunting license and a special $2.50 permit, hunters can use artificial light and thermal imaging equipment.
This year, 7,310 night vision permits were issued, according to Laura Rose Clawson, chief of public affairs for the Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks.
“Coyotes are an important recreational species in Kansas,” Clawson said in an email. “About 30,000 hunters spend about 200,000 days total hunting coyotes in the state. Most of this is the result of traditional (non-night-vision) hunters and methods.”
Clawson said there were alternatives to hunting for controlling losses to predation, including penning livestock at night, removing carrion, having guard animals, and fencing.
“However, coyotes do sometimes prey on livestock,” she said, “and in those cases, lethal removal of the offending animal is often the most effective solution.”
About 4% of cattle losses and 11% of lamb losses were due to coyotes, she said, citing figures from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Trapping is an option, but that is also lethal. The animals are destroyed after being trapped because relocation isn’t viable.
In public hearings on the night-vision season held last month in El Dorado, Junction City and Hays, a total of 58 individuals attended. Thirty-eight were in favor of an expanded coyote night-vision season, Clawson said, while 10 were opposed. Another 10 were neutral or did not complete the survey.
“I’m concerned I don’t have as much biological data on the coyote population as I’d like to have,” Kennedy, the Wildlife and Parks secretary, said during Thursday’s meeting. He also wanted “to make sure we’re not hunting any wildlife population in the state to extinction.”
Kennedy suggested postponing the vote on extending the night vision season, but the commission proceeded. There was, however, some concern. One member expressed worry about how hunting is perceived by the public. Another acknowledged that previously a wildlife biologist had told the commission that even a yearlong season would likely have no effect on the coyote population. The discussion preceding the vote was largely about conflicts with other hunting seasons, the added burden on game wardens and other law enforcement, the best month to hunt coyotes (January) and the importance of night-vision coyote hunting to the state economy.
Guided night-vision hunts are a big business in Kansas, with operators charging up to $1,800 per night. The coyotes are lured in by electronic rabbit distress calls. The operators, of course, claim they are doing landowners a favor by killing the animals.
Perhaps. But I doubt the accelerated killing of coyotes will do much to deter livestock predation because it doesn’t target the offending animals. The animals killed by the night-vision hunters are being promised rabbit for dinner, not lamb. You don’t kill all dogs because some have learned how to get into the chicken coop.
Nature is indeed “red in tooth and claw,” as Alfred, Lord Tennyson poetically observed in 1849. But we shouldn’t be. Night-vision coyote hunting seems offensive in the same way as buffalo slaughters in the 1870s or rabbit clubbing during the Great Depression.
There must be a better way to control coyotes than shooting them.
Coyotes have expanded their range and tripled their numbers since the 1980s, but it’s not the fault of the animals. Humans created the opportunity by destroying habitat and by reducing the coyote’s chief rival, the wolf. The harder coyotes are hunted, either in calling contests like the ones held in Kismet or by night-vision seasons, the larger their litters.
They have learned to exploit our trash, our livestock, and the habitats we create. They have become America’s most successful predator because we have helped them become so.
As author Dan Flores noted in 2016’s “Coyote America: A Natural and Supernatural History,” their strength is their uncanny adaptability.
“In one of the myriad ways humans and coyotes eerily mimic one another,” Flores wrote, “like us coyotes are a cosmopolitan species, able to live in a remarkable range of habitats.”
The current night-vision campaign to control the coyote population, like past hunting efforts, is doomed to fail. It may provide recreation for those who like military-grade kit, but it is ultimately a pseudo war against ourselves.
I’m rooting for the coyotes.

Enjoying the view from the train is one of the perks of being car-free, and some parts of the ride are especially beautiful.


Traveling along the coast, especially east of New Haven (on Shore Line East or Amtrak) the water views are spectacular.  Even on the wetlands side, there’s often wildlife to be seen… egrets, ospreys and such.
Crossing the soon-to-be-replaced, 125-year-old Walk Bridge in Norwalk, there’s a nice view out to the water or into downtown South Norwalk.  Westport’s Saugatuck River Bridge (known as Saga) is also a delight.  Same thing in Greenwich crossing the Mianus River where a glimpse to the north brings back memories of the collapse of the I-95 bridge in 1983 that took three lives.
But my favorite part of the ride into New York City on Metro-North is between Portchester and New Rochelle, that nine-mile straight section of track that engineers call “The Raceway.” Running right alongside I-95, the trains used to have a speed limit of 80 mph, and they’d do it.
Is there anything more satisfying than whipping past drivers on that busy interstate, showing them that the train is a faster choice?  I’ve even been known to wave as we hurtle past.
Just south of Westchester County, as trains enter The Bronx (near Woodlawn), is where the New Haven and Harlem lines converge, complete with a soaring rail overpass.  Again, a great view for a railfan such as myself. 
Another favorite of mine is crossing the Harlem River into Manhattan as the trains traverse the Park Avenue Bridge.  There’s a great view of the city skyline and brief views down the avenues.
Some stations are also memorable, even when passed at high speed.  Just who was Greens Farms named after?  And just why doesn’t the stylish new Fairfield Metro station have a waiting room?  But special mention goes to Milford where the usual advertising posters on the platform have been replaced with huge photos of the beautiful town itself.  Nice promotion.
As nice as those views are, there’s much of the ride which is far less scenic.
The seemingly bombed out factories of Bridgeport hold such memories… and promise.  And Portchester’s old Lifesaver building, complete with its terracotta candies as ornamentation, remind us of the whimsy of architecture.
Railroads are built around business, and looking into the backside of industrial sites along the right of way ain’t exactly pretty.  Even in corporate office buildings, it’s funny how landlords spend so much adorning their street-facing façade but forget that thousands see only the backs of the building, covered with graffiti and neglect.
And much of the trackside, strewn with debris, old rail ties and rusting equipment, could also use some TLC.

(Ryan Berry for Washington State Standard)Unemployment benefits for striking workers are close to becoming law in Washington after a compromise proposal cleared the state House and Senate. 
Striking workers could expect to receive the benefits for up to six weeks under the legislation.
Senate Bill 5041 now awaits a signature from Gov. Bob Ferguson, a Democrat, who has remained silent on his position on the bill. 
Earlier in the legislative session, the Senate approved a 12-week limit on striking workers receiving the benefits, and the House approved four weeks. Typically, unemployment insurance is available for up to 26 weeks a year. 
Both chambers approved the six-week proposal on Friday.
“I think really the only changes to this are that it went to six weeks and I think it’s a nice compromise,” said the bill’s prime sponsor, Sen. Marcus Riccelli, D-Spokane. 
Republicans still oppose the bill, arguing that it will encourage more workers to go on strike and ​​result in higher costs for businesses. 
“When you look at how this is going to work in a large, long-term strike, I think everybody’s going to pay at some level, and that just seems frankly unfair to me,” said Senate Minority Leader John Braun, R-Centralia. 
Workers would be eligible for unemployment benefits starting the second Sunday after a strike begins, plus a one-week waiting period. 
The benefits would also be extended to workers affected by an employer-initiated lockout, something labor advocates point to as a tactic businesses can use to put pressure on workers during contract negotiations.
Benefits would have to be repaid if a strike is determined to be prohibited by state or federal law. 
The bill would require the state’s Employment Security Department to submit annual reports to the Legislature with data on the prevalence of strikes in the state and the cost of benefits for striking workers for Washington’s unemployment insurance trust fund. 
If it becomes law, the bill would take effect on Jan. 1, 2026, and is set to expire Dec. 31, 2035. Washington would join New York and New Jersey, which already provide unemployment insurance for striking workers.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/striking-Boeing-machinists-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-26 22:04:15.362087

(Washington State Department of Transportation)Washington lawmakers announced Saturday a $15.5 billion plan to pay for a wide range of transportation needs, from highway megaprojects to state ferries. 
It’s backed by the first gas tax increase in nearly a decade. The package is a jump from what is now expected to be a $13.2 billion transportation budget for the current biennium. 
More than a third of the new budget will pay for road improvements, with another almost $1.6 billion to spend on highway maintenance and road preservation. 
The bipartisan framework for the next two-year budget cycle that starts July 1 includes $895 million for new ferries, terminal improvements and vessel preservation, $1.1 billion for the removal of obstacles to fish migration and $312 million in rail investments and port electrification. 
The total funding included in Senate Bill 5161 is more than what the House had initially proposed, and less than the Senate’s plan. 
No workers would face furloughs. Initially, the Senate proposed 13 furlough days in fiscal year 2026 for many state transportation workers. 
As in the original House version, some road projects not already contracted would be paused, but many of the biggest would continue. 
“We’re keeping our promises on the core projects,” said Sen. Marko Liias, D-Edmonds. “I think it’s been a very difficult process, but we’ve landed at a result that I think Washington is going to be proud of.”
A 6-cent boost to the gas tax will help the state keep its promises. This week, the state House and Senate approved raising or creating a bevy of taxes and fees, including the gas tax, shoveling an estimated $3.2 billion toward transportation over the next six years. The suite of new revenue now awaits action from Gov. Bob Ferguson, a first-term Democrat.
The revenue package received no Republican support in the House and five Republican votes in the Senate.
Funding transportation for the next biennium came with numerous challenges, including soaring costs for highway construction, state ferry replacements, and culvert removals. Languishing gas tax proceeds make up much of the state’s transportation revenue, and a warming planet is fueling moves toward more energy-efficient vehicles.
These problems left transportation with a $1 billion shortfall in the next two-year budget, growing to $8 billion over the next six years. Without new money, lawmakers warned of major projects left unfinished. 
Lawmakers have to balance the budget across four years.
“I don’t think there’s ever been a more challenging piece of legislation that we’ve worked through,” said Rep. Andrew Barkis, the top House Republican on transportation policy.
Negotiations between the House and Senate were made even more difficult by the gulf that separated their two initial proposals. For one, the Senate looked to eliminate half of the shortfall through a creative plan to move funding for the court-ordered removal of fish passage barriers to the construction budget. The House didn’t take up the idea.
The budget announcement comes on day 104 of the 105-day legislative session, so both chambers plan to pass it Sunday. 
The framework is dedicated to Sen. Bill Ramos, who worked on the transportation budget before his unexpected death last Saturday while on a trail run near his home in Issaquah.
“This has been a difficult process,” said Liias, the chair of the Senate Transportation Committee. “Losing our friend a week ago and trying to write a budget while we were all heartbroken made a very difficult task almost impossible.”
Highways
The proposed money will keep on track some of the state’s behemoth highway undertakings, like the North Spokane Corridor, Puget Sound Gateway spanning King and Pierce counties and improvements on State Route 520 between Seattle and Redmond.
And $580 million is included for the new Interstate 5 Columbia River Bridge spanning Washington and Oregon. Lawmakers this session also approved authorizing the sale of $2.5 billion in bonds to help pay for the replacement. The bond bill now sits on Ferguson’s desk.
The bridge replacement will cost an estimated $5 billion to $7.5 billion. Permits are anticipated by 2026, and construction is projected to last until 2032.
Ferries
One of the many needs looming over budget writers this session was the transition to a hybrid-electric ferry fleet.
Ferguson, though, announced last month that the state would postpone conversions of the state’s largest vessels as Washington has struggled to keep enough ferries in service. The first conversion fell well behind schedule and ballooned in price.
State officials will likely reconsider the conversions after the FIFA World Cup next summer. 
Meanwhile, bids for five brand new hybrid-electric vessels are due next month. 
The proposed budget for this biennium includes $274 million for new ferry construction, $221 million for preservation of existing ferries and $151 million for terminal electrification.
Proceeds from carbon auctions under the Climate Commitment Act make up almost $1.4 billion of the total budget. That money would pay for $461 million for public transit, $316 million in active transportation projects, $230 million for ferries and $225 million for work on electrification and alternative fuels. 
And speaking of the World Cup, the budget includes $9 million in grants for public transit agencies to provide increased service during the tournament.
Fish
Washington state officials last year acknowledged they couldn’t meet the goal of opening up 90% of the habitat that culverts have long blocked by 2030. 
That benchmark came after a judge found the state violated tribes’ treaty fishing rights by installing poorly designed and maintained culverts, which carry water under roadways. So the state has to pay to correct these barriers that impede salmon and steelhead migration in western Washington. 
But like other transportation projects, this work has skyrocketed in cost, with some remaining endeavors facing price tags upward of $100 million. 
The state and tribes are entering mediation to figure out a new path forward that recognizes the state’s fiscal reality and the upstream and downstream barriers that would still block fish passage even after state culverts are removed. 
The state Senate had pushed a plan to borrow up to $5 billion to address the culvert shortfall. But the bipartisan proposal ran into opposition that doomed its chances this year, including from the governor.
Liias hopes lawmakers can revive the legislation, Senate Bill 5804, next year.
But for now, he called the $1.1 billion for this work a “good-faith step to show our tribal leaders we’re serious” as the state enters mediation.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/sr-520-bridge-montlake-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-26 22:04:15.362087

(Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)Democrats in the Washington Legislature unveiled a budget deal Saturday that cuts spending and hikes taxes on thousands of businesses to maintain core public services and erase a projected multibillion-dollar shortfall.
The agreement hammered out by House and Senate budget writers does not tap the state’s emergency reserves or furlough state employees, as prior proposals this year suggested doing. It pays for new collective bargaining agreements for state workers and provides $100 million for law enforcement hiring sought by the governor.
Overall, it spends $77.8 billion in the two-year budget cycle that begins July 1, roughly 9% higher than the current biennium. When all the adding and subtracting is done, there’s $7.4 billion in new spending, officials said.
It will be teed up for votes in each chamber on Sunday, the last scheduled day of the 2025 session.
“We’ve worked diligently to write a budget that addresses the fiscal challenges that we have, and continues to fund the core services that the people of Washington expect us to fund, and they depend on,” said Sen. June Robinson, D-Everett, chair of the Senate Ways and Means Committee.
“There are many reductions throughout the budget that are harmful, are going to be hard for people, and for agencies to implement,” she continued. “We’re all eyes wide open about that.”
Robinson was one of four Democrats on the conference committee reconciling differences between the spending plans passed by the Senate and House. Two Republican lawmakers on the panel have not been at the table for negotiations.
One of them, Sen. Chris Gildon, R-Puyallup, the budget leader for Senate Republicans, criticized the process, then voted against adopting the final product 
“It’s been developed in the back halls of Olympia, out of view of the public,” he said. “I honestly believe it brings shame on the Legislature for doing it this way.”
Overall, there aren’t many surprises as the blueprint tracks with major contours of what Democrats pushed through in each chamber. 
To balance, it depends on $4.3 billion from a combination of transfers from other accounts, plus a slate of new and higher taxes on businesses and services that will start taking effect this fall. Transfers, targeted cuts, and a money-saving maneuver involving pension funds are also needed to make ends meet.
Gov. Bob Ferguson, who is completing his first session, fared well. 
In his inaugural address, he threatened to veto any budget that did not have $100 million to help local governments hire more police. There’s exactly that amount. He also wanted the state’s rainy day fund left untouched, and it was.
Ferguson did not respond to the Standard’s request for comments on the budget.
Robinson and Rep. Timm Ormsby, D-Spokane, chair of the House Appropriations Committee and a conferee, declined to say if they thought Ferguson would sign the budget.
“I can just say that the Legislature, pending approval of this conference report, will have fulfilled its constitutional and statutory obligation,” Ormsby said.
Robinson added: “The executive branch is its own branch of government. I cannot predict nor do I know what they will choose to do.”
The ledger sheet
By law, the Legislature must adopt a budget that is balanced over four fiscal years. Practically speaking, the immediate concern is the next two-year fiscal cycle that begins July 1.
Under the deal, the state will spend $77.8 billion in that period and end with $225 million in its cash reserves and $2 billion stashed in the rainy day fund.
It contains $4.4 billion to maintain levels of services required under current law. One of the largest chunks of new spending is for education, with another $682 million for elementary and secondary schools. Most of it will go to districts for providing special education services, buying materials and paying expenses like utilities and insurance.
There are cuts throughout. One of the most painful for Democrats: delayed expansions planned under the Fair Start for Kids Act. The 2021 law expands and guarantees access to state-paid early learning programs and subsidized child care for families with lower household incomes. 
Under the law, the Early Childhood Education and Assistance Program is supposed to become an entitlement next year. It won’t. There will also be delays to broadened eligibility for the Working Connections Child Care Program. Increased reimbursement rates for providers will be pushed off as well.
A reprieve for state workers
Ferguson proposed furloughing state employees one day a month in the next budget cycle to save $300 million. Senate Democrats proposed 13 unpaid days off to save half as much. Senate Republicans wanted to not fund the recently brokered labor contracts, which include a 5% pay raise over two years, and instead give each worker a $5,000 bonus.
None of that is happening. Nearly a billion dollars is penciled in to cover the contracts.
“The state needs to be a model employer,” Ormsby said. “We need to project outward to the rest of the state what it looks like to appreciate the work that people do, compensate them fairly and keep them employed.”
Taxing matters
Democrats had designs for raising up to $21 billion from new and higher taxes in the next four fiscal years. Ferguson shook his head no. 
They went back to the drawing board and came up with a different approach projected to net $4.3 billion for the coming budget and $4.4 billion in the one after that. 
It would permanently boost the primary business and occupation tax rates. Sales tax would be applied to more services. New surcharges are coming for Washington companies with more than $250 million in annual revenue. Higher tax rates are in store for financial institutions with more than $1 billion in earnings. A few tax breaks disappear. And an existing tax gets broadened to include nicotine pouches, like Zyn.
Two gimmicks gone, one added
Democrats put forth two eye-rolling, money-moving maneuvers with their earlier budget proposals. They’re put away now.
One required certain companies to prepay a month’s worth of sales tax. The thinking was to get those dollars paid into the final month of the next budget cycle that would’ve otherwise been due in the first month of the following one. It would have been like creating a 25th month of collections.
The other idea was to change the timing and amounts of apportionment payments to school districts to push hundreds of millions of dollars in spending into the 2027-29 budget.
A new move involving the state’s pension funds is in. Senate Bill 5357 lets budget writers assume a greater return on dollars invested through the state’s pension accounts – 7.25% up from the 7% set by the Pension Funding Council in 2023.
Assuming the higher rate of return means that the state can meet its funding obligations for the pensions while contributing less money to them. But jacking up the rate also raises the risk of investments not meeting higher targets, and the plans gradually becoming underfunded. Washington is generally known for having healthy public employee pension plans.
In the next four years, the shift will allow the state to save about a billion dollars by making lower payments into its pension system.
Last word
“Affordability” is one of the session buzzwords. 
Republicans have argued new and higher taxes for the operating budget will drive up costs for “hard-working Washingtonians.” Gildon said the tax increases will equate to about $2,000 a year for a family of four.
Democrats contend the steps they are taking will bolster public schools and preserve access to critical services for the state’s most vulnerable residents.
Robinson said the budget is not the one “we thought we’d be writing a year ago.

(Ian Stewart/Virginia Mercury)Roughly 150 people jammed a meeting room at the Twin Hickory Public Library in Henrico County Saturday, demanding U.S. Rep. Rob Wittman, R-Westmoreland, oppose sweeping federal spending cuts and immigration measures stemming from President Donald Trump’s administration. The event highlighted the scrutiny Wittman and other Virginia congressional representatives have faced for how they engage with people in their districts.
Wittman, who declined an invitation to the event, was represented by an empty chair at the front of the room. Many who spoke about their concerns addressed their comments to the chair.
Attendee Ericka Kopp pulled out a copy of the Constitution and read parts of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments that addressed her concerns about the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration reform policies.
Wittman, who has represented Virginia’s 1st Congressional District since 2007, supported executive orders Trump issued in January cracking down on illegal immigration to the United States and expanding federal agencies’ authority to identify and expel undocumented immigrants from the country. Wittman and other supporters framed the orders as a way to halt drugs and dangerous criminals from entering the country, while detractors said the policies unfairly target immigrants, limit due process and pull families apart.

Kopp said parts of the text do not refer to “citizens of this nation” but instead to “all people” as having a right to a fair trial for crimes, who can’t have their “life, liberty or property” deprived without due process of law. 
“Amendment Six, ‘the accused shall enjoy,’ again, not citizens – all ‘people,’” she said. “So Representative Wittman, I ask that you read the Constitution and apply it accordingly.”

Vietnam veteran Jim Kutz voiced his concerns about the administration’s recent arrest of a circuit court judge who was accused of helping a man evade immigration authorities. He addressed his question to the entire room.
“What other leader arrested judges?” he asked. “Hitler, Mussolini and other dictators arrested judges. I think we are all very concerned about the rule of law.” In pointed remarks directed at Wittman, Kutz said, “We want you to speak up on the floor and introduce resolutions supporting the rule of law and speak out about the appalling things that are happening in the White House.”
The event, dubbed “Where’s Wittman? A Town Hall In Absentia for Virginia’s First Congressional District,” was put on by Democracy Circle RVA, a group who started meeting after Trump’s second inauguration, said organizer Jenny Pribble. 
“We’re a group of friends and neighbors, a loose-knit organization,” she said. “A lot of us have experience in political organizing, but decided this time we wanted to be engaged very locally with our immediate neighbors. I think what unites us is a real concern about attacks on rule of law, attacks on democratic institutions, and challenges now with due process.”
The group also contrasted the administration’s action with the Fourteenth Amendment,  which identifies American citizens as “all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof,” and declares that states shouldn’t deny “any person” due process of law and “equal protection of the laws.” 
“His job is to represent his constituents, and his constituents are showing up, and they would like him to listen,” said Pribble.

In an email to the Virginia Mercury ahead of Saturday’s town hall, Wittman’s communications director Julianne Heberlein said the congressman wasn’t planning on attending the event because it wasn’t organized by his office and because he was “already committed to several other events in the district that day.” 
Wittman also directly addressed the town hall organizers in the email, defending his record of engaging with constituents and tackling important issues.
“I’ve consistently hosted live telephone town halls, and I’m proud that my most recent one reached approximately 9,000 constituents,” he wrote. “We covered a range of topics — from Social Security and veterans’ issues to the economy — and I always welcome tough questions, even from those who disagree with me.”
On March 26, Wittman held a telephone town hall via Facebook that his office says drew 9000 people. The video on Facebook has since been removed. Callers had to register on Wittman’s website in order to be a part of the conversation. According to Heberlein, Wittman has hosted from three to seven telephone town halls per year since about 2009.
Wittman said the telephone town halls allow him to connect to thousands of residents in the district, which spans from parts of Henrico, Hanover and Chesterfield Counties in Central Virginia to parts of the Northern Neck and Middle Peninsula. There are over 471,000 registered voters in the district, according to the Virginia Public Access Project. Though he values meeting with people in person, Wittman said, he encourages people to sign up on his website for the next telephone town hall.
Democracy Circle RVA did meet with Wittman on March 14, where they hand delivered an invitation signed by 79 people. 
“When we met with Rob Whitman in person, we discussed a range of issues, and on a number of issues he seemed to agree with us,” said Pribble. “But he insisted that he didn’t have a lot of power to change things beyond voting for a budget or voting against a budget. But we know that Article I gives Congress a lot of powers of oversight, of investigation.”
According to VoteSmart, a nonpartisan website compiling information on candidates and elected officials, Wittman’s recent voting record shows he voted in favor of Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act, a bill that requires individuals to provide documentary proof of U.S. citizenship when registering to vote in federal elections. He has also voted “yea” to several measures designed to enhance security as the country’s southern border. In his March video town hall, Wittman also supported sweeping federal spending cuts. 
“We have $1.7 trillion of a deficit this year, and $36 trillion of debt for the nation,” Wittman said. “That’s on the backs of our children and our children’s children,” the Daily Press reported.
Pribble said the town hall, where state Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg, D-Henrico, was also in attendance, was recorded and will be shared with Whittman’s office.
“He needs to hear from his constituents about how this moment is shaping families’ lives. We have a lot of federal workers in this district. They’ve been hit hard, and I think Whitman needs to show up and hear from us,” said Pribble.
