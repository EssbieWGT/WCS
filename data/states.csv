(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Alaska regulators have assessed a $49,000 fine against Hilcorp for lapses in Cook Inlet offshore well management.
The Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission said on Monday that Hilcorp, the dominant operator in the Cook Inlet basin, failed to meet an annual deadline to discuss its well plugging and abandonment activities. That annual meeting was to have taken place on Dec. 1, the AOGCC said in its order. The earliest date that Hilcorp offered for the meeting was Feb. 17, according to the order.
Hilcorp acknowledged missing the deadline but submitted some written information to address the commission’s concerns and “to ensure all conditions of approval are complied with in the future,” the order said.
The company has 20 days to contest the assessed penalty, the order said.
It was the first enforcement action taken by the AOGCC against Hilcorp this year, according to the commission’s records.
In 2024, however, Hilcorp was the subject of five separate AOGCC orders concerning violations on both the North Slope and in the Cook Inlet basin. The three North Slope cases resulted in penalties of $452,100, $260,477 and $55,000, while the two Cook Inlet cases resulted in fines of $86,000 and $50,000.
Hilcorp, a privately held independent based in Texas, has become one of the two biggest oil producers in Alaska. The company gained that position after taking over fields and assets previously held by BP Exploration (Alaska) Inc. BP left Alaska in 2020.
In comparison, ConocoPhillips Alaska Inc., the other major Alaska oil producer, has been the subject of far fewer AOGCC enforcement actions. There were none taken against ConocoPhillips in 2024.
In 2023, however, ConocoPhillips received one of the biggest fines ever assessed by the AOGCC. The commission ordered the company to pay $913,796.80 for numerous violations that led to a 2022 well blowout and release of natural gas in the Alpine oil field.

(iStock via Getty Images Plus photo)Here it is, torn from the battered and abused pages of the Bill of Rights:
“Congress shall make no law … abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.”
No question about it. We Alaskans are enthusiastic fans of the First Amendment right “peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.” Just the other day, April 19, over 3,000 people seeking “redress of grievances” demonstrated in downtown Anchorage carrying signs such as “Hands off the Constitution” and “Health Care is a Human Right.”
A couple months earlier, Feb. 17, Presidents Day, hundreds demonstrated all over Alaska seeking “redress of grievances.” Anchorage, Juneau, Palmer, Fairbanks, and Seward had sign-wavers galore redressing grievances. “Democracy is not a spectator sport,” “Resist,” and “No Kings” bobbed over the heads of spectators growing hoarse from chants and shouts while unabashedly assembling and making their grievances known. The democratic process is messy, dontcha know. 
And talking about “kings,” the right to assembly goes back that far. It has its roots in English history, evolving from the Magna Carta signed in 1215, to the English Bill of Rights, to the Founding Fathers and on to our Bill of Rights. We Alaskans have not been alone in the embrace of public demonstrations to pursue grievances. The Suffragettes, for example, who advocated the right of women to vote were not shy about public demonstrations. 
As the historian Mike Wallace has written:
“The twenty-third of October, 1915, was a crisp fall day, splashed with sunshine, perfect for a parade. In midafternoon tens of thousands of women clad in white dresses and yellow sashes stepped out of Washington Square. They strode up Fifth Avenue arrayed in delegations of assorted age and station — letter carriers’ wives from Queens, schoolgirls from Washington Irving High, ILGWU seamstresses, Henry Street settlement workers.”
Of course, later in the same century the Civil Rights Movement put even more feet on the pavement to air grievances about racism and inequality. On Aug. 28, 1963, Martin Luther King Jr. gave his famous “I Have a Dream” speech as part of the March on Washington. The speech was delivered to an estimated 250,000 people who came to Washington, D.C., to demonstrate for civil rights. 
So you get the idea. The principle of free speech, including the right to peaceful assembly, was so central to a successful democracy that it was the very first right in the Bill of Rights. We Americans have been using that right since the founding of this nation 248 years ago. But here in Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy would like to see an end to this First Amendment foolishness. 
Early this year, the governor introduced House Bill 71/Senate Bill 74, “An Act related to obstruction.” It appears to target large demonstrations and spontaneous demonstrations without a permit. In my view, the primary purpose of this bill is to strongly discourage Alaskans from exercising their right to peaceful assembly in the first place. Here are some of the “highlights,” so to speak:

If the protest “substantially interferes” with someone’s access to a government building, or “interferes” with an emergency responder, the offense would be a class C felony, punishable by up to five years in prison and $50,000.
A person “whose passage is obstructed” could sue a protester for $10,000 if their rights were infringed, $50,000 if their property was damaged, and $100,000 if they were personally injured — in addition to attorney’s fees and costs.

Draconian. Might be worth considering if there were a substantial history of these crimes by demonstrators in Alaska. Let’s take a look. The governor’s transmittal letter makes no mention of a history of these crimes. The bill itself makes no mention of a history of such crimes. A report submitted by the attorney general a year ago for very similar proposed legislation, House Bill 386, came up with cases in New York and Washington, D.C., where demonstrators blocked traffic, but did not report a single such case in Alaska. 
And to top it all off, an internal legal analysis conducted by the Legislative Affairs Agency for HB 386 found, among many other critical findings: 
“The bill raises issues under the First Amendment of the United States Constitution and art. I, secs. 5 and 6, of the Alaska Constitution.  In particular, if challenged, there is a risk that the new crime of obstruction of free passage in public places could be found unconstitutional both facially or if applied to the protected speech of protests or demonstrations.”
Finally, this is just the tip of the iceberg of Gov. Dunleavy’s attempts to subvert constitutional protections for Alaskans. See the ACLU analysis aptly titled, “Dunleavy is the anti-First Amendment governor.”

The short route is currently served by diesel ferries like the Tokitae, seen here approaching Whidbey Island. (Photo by Tom Banse)Ferry system managers and state budget writers in Washington took a cold wave over the bow Monday upon opening the bids to construct up to five new hybrid electric ferries.
“I don’t see how you get to five. There’s money for three on a good day,” said state House Transportation Committee Chair Jake Fey, D-Tacoma.
The Washington Legislature previously set aside about $1.3 billion to build new ferries and charging infrastructure over the next six to eight years. New vessels are overdue to stabilize the state’s aging and sometimes unreliable ferry fleet. Simultaneously, the ferry system and the state’s Democratic leadership want to reduce the ferries’ air pollution footprint by switching to battery propulsion as much as possible.
Eastern Shipbuilding Group of Panama City, Florida, submitted the low bid for the state’s desired plug-in hybrid, 160-car vessels, according to a summary of the bids posted by WSF late on Monday. The $251 million price tag for the first ferry in the series was roughly in line with the state engineer’s in-house estimate.
Nichols Brothers Boat Builders on Whidbey Island submitted a competing bid that was considerably higher, even after including a 13% bid credit authorized by the Legislature to incentivize home state construction. Neither bid includes the expensive hybrid electric powertrains for the new ferries, which the state plans to acquire separately.
A third shipbuilder, Philly Shipyard, was expected to submit a bid, but didn’t in the end. 
The Nichols Brothers and Eastern Shipbuilding Group bids both include escalator clauses that Fey predicted “will invariably make it (the price) go up.” The escalators allow the shipyards to charge more in case of unpredictable cost increases, such as on steel or from tariffs.
Washington State Ferries said in a mass email to interested parties that it will evaluate the bid documents in greater detail for the next few weeks before awarding a contract. The agency will undoubtedly also consult further with the governor’s office and key legislators about what is affordable.
The most recent date given for delivery of the first new ferry was 2029.
“First things first, I need to understand exactly what we’ve got with the bids,” Gov. Bob Ferguson said Monday after an initial, high-level briefing. Ferguson declined to speculate more before getting additional information.
Fey said he expects to discuss where more money could potentially be found. The veteran legislator said multiple currents in the bid environment drove up costs, including rising raw material prices, tariffs and limited shipyard competition – even though the ferry system’s request for bids was opened to shipyards nationwide.
A Democratic legislator from ferry-served Bainbridge Island, Rep. Greg Nance, said he was struck by how Washington’s procurement was affected by the hollowing out of the nation’s shipbuilding industry. He was pleased there was more than one bidder.
“Given the state of shipbuilding writ large, we knew that we were swimming upstream,” Nance said in an interview Monday. “We need to do more to support shipbuilding. We’ve lost our shipbuilding edge over the past 50 years.”
Cost roughly doubled over past seven years
The 144-car Suquamish was the most recent of the workhorse Olympic-class ferries upon which the new plug-in ferry design is based. The diesel-powered Suquamish was delivered to WSF in 2018 at a cost of about $122 million. Debate about how to proceed with further vessel acquisitions in that size class has stretched from then until now. 
During this dickering, the state pivoted to electrification, costs shot up and the reliability of the existing aging fleet went down.
The bid request published by WSF included the high-level design for a plug-in ferry capable of carrying up to 160 cars and 1,500 passengers. Drawings show boats that resemble a slightly elongated version of the diesel-powered Olympic class ferries delivered between 2014 and 2018. However, the new design has just one passenger deck stacked on top of the two auto decks.
The center of the ship’s hold will be packed with racks of water-cooled rechargeable batteries so the ferry can sail fully on electric power most of the time. The engine room will also feature twin diesel generators as a backup source of propulsion power. 
Assuming they use green electricity to charge, the new ferries should achieve a large reduction in fuel consumption and an associated reduction in global warming emissions.

WSF tentatively plans to deploy the new ferries to the Mukilteo-Clinton run first, probably followed by the Seattle-Bremerton route.
What about cheaper options?
Republicans, who are in the minority in the Legislature, have pushed for a cheaper diesel ferry option to be put back on the table. WSF leaders have been consistent in warning against reverting to conventional diesel power because that would necessitate a lengthy redesign and re-bid.
“If we were to switch now to go to diesel, we would have to stop what we’re doing with the hybrid, design a new diesel boat and lose the funding from the Climate Commitment Act,” deputy WSF boss John Vezina said under questioning from state Sen. Phil Fortunato, R-Pierce County, at a Senate hearing in March. “It would probably add two years to the acquisition of those new vessels.”
BC Ferries has also been in the market for new car ferries and has been able to acquire new vessels at far lower cost than its Seattle-based neighbors. Unlike Washington State Ferries, BC Ferries can solicit bids from shipyards worldwide. The newest additions to the province’s fleet were built in Romania.
Building ferries to serve domestic U.S. routes at a foreign shipyard is prohibited under a century-old federal law known as the Jones Act. 
Of late, the Trump administration and a bipartisan contingent of lawmakers in Congress have highlighted the need to make the American shipbuilding industry more competitive. But President Donald Trump’s recent statements on the matter make no mention of jettisoning the longstanding made-in-America requirements.
Washington State Ferries currently has 21 vessels of various sizes and ages in its fleet, making it the largest public ferry system in the nation. The WSF long-range plan contains a goal to grow to 26 ferries to provide reliable service on every route, with allowances for maintenance tie-ups and a vessel in reserve. 
The hefty bids come just as it seemed the agency was sailing into smoother waters. 
This summer, the ferry system will get nearly back to operating its full pre-pandemic schedule, missing only a second boat on the Port Townsend-Coupeville run during midweeks and the long-suspended international crossing to Sidney, B.C.
Last week’s generally celebratory blog post about the summer schedule cautioned that peak-season crewing will be stretched close to the limit. Blog author Bryn Hunter said it will be challenging to find a short-term replacement whenever an aging vessel breaks down.
“I wouldn’t let this be a Debbie Downer,” Rep. Fey concluded at the end of his initial construction bid analysis. “There’s been great progress made by the ferry system over the past four years.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/WSF-washington-state-ferries-ferry-boat-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-05-12 22:00:08.129496

It’s unlikely to be the last abortion debate in the Senate before the legislature adjourns for the year at 6 p.m. Friday. Republicans can bring the bill back to the Senate at any time in the next few days. 
Republicans spent the first hour of debate scorning Amendment 3, which voters approved in November to protect the right to reproductive health care including abortion up to the point of fetal viability. 
“Sometimes people get in, we can only describe it as horrible situations, but I don’t think taking the life of an innocent should be something that we can legally do,” said Senate President Pro Tem Cindy O’Laughlin, a Shelbina Republican. “I think it’s morally wrong and I think we need to support women who’ve had unintended pregnancies or other situations where they feel trapped and they don’t feel supported.”
 Senate President Pro Tem Cindy O’Laughlin, a Republican from Shelbina, is pictured on Jan. 8 (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
After Republicans spoke in favor of the bill, Democrats stood up to block it from coming up for a vote.
The proposed ban, which has been a top priority among Republicans this year, seeks to repeal the constitutional right to an abortion but allow exceptions for medical emergencies, fatal fetal anomalies and for survivors of rape and incest in the first 12 weeks of gestation. 
The 12 week deadline for survivors has raised concerns from Democrats, and from the GOP leader of the House.
“It’s just disgusting to put that torture and timeline on someone who’s a survivor of domestic violence,” state Rep. Patty Lewis, a Democrat from Kansas City, said Monday evening.
 State Sen. Patty Lewis, D-Kansas City, speaks on the Missouri Senate floor Monday as part of an effort to hold off anti-abortion legislation (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
The proposed ban, if approved by a simple majority of voters, would reinstate several targeted regulations on abortion providers, or TRAP laws, that were recently struck down as unconstitutional by a Missouri judge.
The language that could appear on each ballot does not mention the amendment would ban abortions, a detail that’s been highly-criticized by Democrats as deceiving. 
Missourians would be asked if they want to amend the Missouri constitution to: 

“Guarantee access to care for medical emergencies, ectopic pregnancies, and miscarriages; 
Ensure women’s safety during abortions; 
Ensure parental consent for minors; 
Allow abortions for medical emergencies, fetal anomalies, rape, and incest; 
Require physicians to provide medically accurate information; and 
Protect children from gender transition?”

Missourians could see the question on the November 2026 ballot, or as soon as this year if the governor chose to call a special election on the issue. 

On Monday, Senate Minority Leader Doug Beck, an Affton Democrat, pointed out that last session, Senate Republicans voted against an attempt to add rape and incest exceptions to what at the time was a near-total ban on abortion in the state. 
“It makes you wonder exactly what’s going on here,” Beck said of some Republicans changing course on the issue. “ … It’s very interesting to see the mental gymnastics that are taking place to be able to say that this is OK.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/051225_beck2-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-05-12 22:00:08.129496

(Photo by Kathie Obradovich/Iowa Capital Dispatch)A bill passed by the House Monday limiting local government’s ability to restrict fireworks use will help the state participate in President Donald Trump’s plans for major celebrations of the 250th anniversary of the U.S.’s founding in 2026, Rep. Bill Gustoff, R-Des Moines, said.
The House passed Senate File 303 with a vote of 51-39, sending it to Gov. Kim Reynolds. The bill prohibits county boards of supervisors and city councils from prohibiting or limiting the use of fireworks on July 3, 4 and Dec. 31, outside of existing regulations in Iowa Code.
State law sets certain constraints on fireworks — which are legal to use from June 1 through July 8 and Dec. 10 through Jan. 3 of each year — that outlaws the sale of fireworks to minors and the use of “display” fireworks by people or organizations outside of local approval, as well as sets certain time restrictions on fireworks.
If signed into law, it would remove ordinances or other regulations set by several Iowa localities that ban or restrict the use of fireworks, including Des Moines, Ames and Iowa City.
Gustoff, the bill’s floor manager, said lifting these local restrictions for three days a year will allow “the unwary, patriotic American in Iowa” to celebrate the nation’s founding without running the risk of breaking local law. He said this will be especially important as the country prepares to celebrate the country’s 250th anniversary. Trump has floated bringing these celebrations to the Iowa State Fairgrounds.
Trump has proposed a yearlong celebration that he said would begin at the Iowa State Fair for the “Great American State Fair” scheduled from Memorial Day 2025 to July 4, 2026.
“Mr. President, we welcome that idea in Iowa, and we’re ready, willing and able to host the party,” Gustoff said. “Iowans would want to join their fellow citizens from around the nation to celebrate the semi-quincentennial birthday of the greatest nation in history, in the world. … We need to enable Iowans to be part of that celebration.”
That includes being allowed to set off fireworks without violating local regulations, Gustoff said. However, Democrats have repeatedly expressed concerns about limiting local government’s ability to set rules on fireworks use, particularly when different communities may set these regulations to address public safety hazards.
“When I look at the list of who signed on as lobbyists, it’s striking to me that anyone concerned with public safety — firefighters, the fire marshals, the fire chiefs — are all against it, because they know what the challenges are in an urban environment,” Senate Minority Leader Janice Weiner said in March. “And it should be — in my view, it also should also be a local government issue.”
Rep. Eric Gjerde, D-Cedar Rapids, introduced an amendment Monday that would prohibit “consumer fireworks for personal use.” He said that in Cedar Rapids, which has a ban on fireworks within city limits, the Cedar Rapids Fire Department received 636 calls for service for fireworks between June 1 and July 8, 2024. These included some dumpster, grass and debris fires caused by fireworks, in addition to calls from people who think the sounds of fireworks are gunshots — calls that require multiple law enforcement officers to respond and investigate.
He also brought up issues people in Iowa communities have with fireworks, like veterans who suffer from PTSD having adverse responses to fireworks going off nearby.
“When we take away the local control of cities and counties to determine what works best for them and what works best for their individuals — to me, it’s just easier to say, let’s just get rid of consumer fireworks altogether and stick with the display fireworks by our cities and our counties,” Gjerde said. “… So I think that even though we all enjoy — I enjoy a good firework display — but I also think we need to be certain that’s what’s in the best interest for everybody.”
The amendment failed.
Gustoff said fireworks have been around for thousands of years, saying there’s “no denying that they have broad-based appeal, and they’re here to stay.” The measure goes to Reynolds for final approval.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/2016-07-05_032240084_1EDF3_iOS-1024x769.jpg,,,2025-05-12 22:00:08.129496

(Elise Plunk/Louisiana Illuminator)Supporters of the Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion project took to the State Capitol steps Monday afternoon, urging state leaders to advance the stalled coastal restoration project. 
The Mid-Barataria project, part of the Louisiana Coastal Master Plan to rebuild wetlands with diverted sediment and water from the Mississippi River, is often hailed as the cornerstone project in Louisiana’s fight to rebuild its rapidly sinking coastline. 
Gov. Jeff Landry has railed against the plan’s high cost and impact to fisheries, blaming a key Army Corps construction permitting loss on former Gov. John Be Edwards. The pause has prompted increasing uncertainty as to whether the massive coastal restoration plan will continue as originally designed. 
Advocates of the project worry any alternate plans will mean further delays or – worse yet – inactivity that could spell doom for Louisiana’s coast. 
“Now is the time for courage and action,” Simone Maloz, campaign director of Restore the Mississippi River Delta, said during a news conference in concert with the Capitol demonstration. Supporters held aloft signs with phrases promoting sediment diversions printed boldly across pictures of Louisiana’s coast as speakers took turns at the lectern to speak about the uncertain project. 
“Honor the legacy of our coastal program and recommit to the bold vision our coast demands, including resuming construction on the Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion,” Maloz added. 
“The river built the land, now we must let it help us heal it,” the Rev. Ernest Dison Sr., pastor at a church in the Lower 9th Ward of New Orleans, said during the rally. His neighborhood went underwater in 2005 when storm surge from Hurricane Katrina exposed design flaws in floodwalls along the Industrial Canal and Mississippi River Gulf Outlet. Decades of wetlands diminishment allowed the storm surge to reach the city largely unabated.      
Dison said his faith and environmental stewardship are closely entwined, and the risk storms pose to his community convinced him to speak out in support of the coastal master plan. 
“We need to protect our communities,” he said. “This Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion project gives us hope. We can’t afford to waste that opportunity to be good stewards of what we’ve been given.”   
 
Money problems
The Coastal Restoration and Protection Authority and Louisiana Senate has approved more than $500 million for Mid-Barataria construction to begin despite its status being in limbo. 
Opponents of the large-scale diversion, including those with fisheries interests, have floated the idea of using the money to build smaller sediment diversions. But whether funding can be redistributed that seamlessly is a question with no outright answer. 
Louisiana’s money for coastal restoration comes largely from a trust created with BP oil spill settlement dollars. A cohort of federal agencies, including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association, Environmental Protection Agency and Department of the Interior, oversee the funds
Maloz said in an interview she is concerned an alternate plan might not get the same financial approval Mid-Barataria did from the trust overseers. 
“[The Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion is] very tied to the damage that happened … that money is intended to mitigate and fix that problem,” she said. “That’s a huge question that is looming on the alternatives … is that the right project to mitigate for those injuries, for that natural resource damage that occurred from the oil spill?
 
Smaller scale diversions
Diversion advocates and scientists maintain smaller diversions aren’t as effective at rebuilding wetlands, still sending fresh water into Barataria Bay but with less benefit. 
Opponents fear the deluge of fresh water from the Mississippi River would alter the salt content of the brackish water, killing shrimp and oyster populations near shore and pushing other marine life away from the coast. 
Ehab Meselhe, a Tulane University professor and scientist who worked on hydrologic modeling for the Mid-Barataria plan, published a number of peer-reviewed studies modeling smaller Mississippi River diversions. They involved moving a fraction of the water Mid-Barataria currently proposes. His findings: Less water meant less wetland growth. 
“It’s not going to move as much sediment, build as much land,” Meselhe said, all while concerns over impacts to oysters and shrimp stick around. “There is no doubt… you will have the impacts, and definitely a lot less benefit.” 
Even still, he emphasised the need to find a solution that involves and supports the people who live in the area. 
“There is no silver bullet solution. Every time you touch the system, you will have benefits and you will have impacts,” Meselhe said. “Some strategies are better than others … I think we need to sit at the table and see what are the palatable options that are out there, and these are the ones we need to pursue.”
Anne Milling, founder of post-Katrina advocacy group Women of the Storm, said in an interview that mitigation dollars tied to Mid-Barataria gave the plan actionable ways to support fisheries. 
“Yes, it’s our culture of Louisiana, which I love and adore and respect,” Milling said. “You’ve got to remember that $375 million was set aside in the Mid-Barataria Diversion project to compensate and help the communities relocate from any disturbance from this diversion.”
“We cannot afford to take solutions off the table,” Maloz said, voicing her organization’s support for small-scale diversions in other areas while still standing in support of Mid-Barataria. 
“There was a really extensive process that said, ‘This is the solution that matches the loss in that basin. This is what it needs for that overall long term health,’” she added.
 
Permit drama increases uncertainty
Controversy over a pulled construction permit and a social media fight between Landry and his predecessor, Edwards, have heightened tensions and uncertainty over the Mid-Barataria Sediment Division even further. 
Landry delivered a harsh critique of Mid-Barataria last November, saying the threat it posed to the shrimp and oyster industry would “break” Louisiana culture. His administration then issued a 90-day pause on all work related to the project on April 4, saying the high cost called for a smaller-scale diversion. 
The Army Corps recently revoked a permit for the nearly $3 billion project, citing unreported documents, project uncertainty and lack of support from the current governor’s administration as reasons to reconsider. Landry accused Edwards of purposely hiding a 500-page study from Army Corps officials.  
Edwards countered Landry’s claims, saying accusations of a cover-up are unfounded, and stressed that the report in question didn’t change the science behind the Mid-Barataria plan, The Times-Picayune reported.  
Maloz said she believed the project had everything it needed for approval, wanting more answers from the Army Corps decision. 
“We feel like we went through this really extensive process that had science, that had people, that had communities all in mind to get us to a decision on both the permit and the funding,” she said. “And now it feels like we have been entirely cut out of that process.”",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_8633-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-12 22:00:08.129496

Surrounded by the whales, and the sounds of lively seals, sea otters, sea lions and countless seabirds, this annual harvest is a cherished sign of spring for people living in Southeast Alaska. After months of gray skies and cold weather, both people and wildlife eagerly embrace this moment. 
Steve Johnson, recognized by his Łingít name Ixt’Ik’Eesh, is a prominent community leader from Sitka.
“It’s like the first real taste of spring that we get here,” Ixt’Ik’Eesh said excitedly
Of the Kiks.adi Clan of Sitka, Ixt’Ik’Eesh has been harvesting herring fish eggs for most of his life. His earliest recollection of the harvest dates back to his childhood, a memory he cherishes deeply. Ixt’Ik’Eesh recalls being on the skiff with his father and uncle, surrounded by the vast ocean.
“I remember putting my hand in the water, and I could feel the herring as they ran around it, and just the sight and the smell of it and the beauty of the world around us,” recalled Ixt’Ik’Eesh. “It’s an amazing time of the year.”
He now plays a vital role in educating community members on the techniques of harvesting herring eggs. He has successfully trained around 100 participants in the community harvest program he leads. This volunteer-driven program involves coordinating volunteers to collect and distribute the eggs through a Facebook group. Active for two decades, the program has successfully distributed about 17,000 pounds of eggs, benefiting roughly 20,000 people. This initiative not only feeds the community but has also empowered individuals by providing them with the necessary experience and knowledge to launch their own fishing operations.

	“There was a period of time not too long ago where there was just a little over a dozen harvesters left, and that was really scary to me on a number of ways,” explains Ixt’Ik’Eesh.
For Ixt’Ik’Eesh, it is crucial to preserve and pass on the traditional knowledge of herring egg harvesting to ensure it remains a vital part of Łingít culture rather than fading into history.
“This is one of the few practices that we have that have been unbroken by colonization.” says Ixt’Ik’Eesh.
He not only brings valuable experience and oversees a community harvest program, but also holds formal leadership roles for both Sitka and the state of Alaska, serving on various boards and commissions, in addition to being a Council member of the Sitka Tribe of Alaska. Last year, he represented the Sitka Tribe of Alaska at the Alaska Board of Fisheries meeting as a traditional harvester, where he advocated for the protection of Promisla Bay from commercial fishing. He proposed designating the bay as part of the subsistence conservation zone, highlighting its significance as a major producer of herring eggs and a vital harvesting area for locals.
The proposal didn’t pass but that hasn’t stopped Ixt’Ik’Eesh, and his work doesn’t go unnoticed. In a nomination form for the Joint Board of Fisheries/Commercial Fisheries Entry Commission Herring Revitalization Committee, which is a combined board of the Alaska Commercial Fisheries Entry Commission and the Alaska Board of Fisheries to herring across the state. Ixt’Ik’Eesh has been recognized as the number one producer of subsistence herring egg harvesting.
The nomination highlighted his work providing herring eggs to over 10,000 households through the implementation and 20 years of distribution of tribal food security initiatives. Additionally, it recognized his extensive experience, exceeding 25 years, in both subsistence and commercial fishing.
Ixt’Ik’Eesh shared that he is guided by the Kiks.adi Clan principle of sharing. It serves as a powerful reminder of generosity.
“We measure people, and particularly leaders, not by what they have or what they show but by what they give away,” says Ixt’Ik’Eesh. “And so for me, that’s a big part of my upbringing, of my core values, and that whenever we have an abundance of something, we share it.”
This philosophy is reflected in the numbers. According to the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, in 2023, “93% of the harvest was shared with other households within Sitka or in other communities in the state and beyond.” This level of sharing underscores ancestral traditions that prioritize community health and connection.
Despite the unsuccessful Promisla Bay proposal and complexities of colonial management systems, Ixt’Ik’Eesh will always be found on his traditional homelands and ocean. This bond is rooted in a deep cultural understanding of his place and calling. Engaging in the labor of harvesting for community members and individuals who are unable to access the eggs is a task that is both physically and mentally demanding. However, Ixt’Ik’Eesh finds joy in this work, as it allows him to contribute to the well-being of his people while honoring traditional practices. The Facebook group plays a crucial role in this dynamic, serving not only as a means of communication and organizing but also as a place to share memories.

	“I really like it when people send pictures and when they post pictures of their family meals and their gatherings and people enjoying them and knowing that myself and my friends and volunteers all had a very strong hand in producing that food that’s on their table that they’re enjoying.” says Ixt’Ik’Eesh.
Capturing Community
One of the volunteers aboard Ixt’Ik’Eesh’s boat this season was Mary Goddard, a Łingít filmmaker and artist. She experienced the herring egg harvest in Yakutat as a young girl and remembers her and her mother running to the beach to witness the herring spawn. They’d return the next day to check if the eggs were ready to eat. She recalls pulling seaweed from the ocean, each strand covered in herring eggs. Originally from Yakutat, a Southeast Alaska community about 230 miles from Sitka, Goddard hadn’t experienced the large harvest that Sitka is known for but still felt the same excitement.

	“It was fun to be able to just walk down from our house to the beach and grab those herring eggs and eat them for dinner that night,” says Goddard. Her first career path was in acting, which took Goddard across the country to New York City, where she attended the American Musical and Dramatic Academy. But along the way, she fell in love with filmmaking. After spending 15 years in the industry, she returned to Alaska.
That leap of faith led her to found her own production company, MidnightRun LLC. After moving to Sitka, she came to see the harvest as a community celebration to welcome spring. Due to her curiosity as a filmmaker, Goddard herself began harvesting.
Aboard a boat in the ocean loaded with about 30 hemlock trees, Goddard was nervous yet excited because of her role in the harvesting process.
“My role this year was really fun, because I gotta do it from start to finish,” says Goddard.
The process begins by determining the spawning locations and timing for herring, which, according to Goddard, happen during the spring season when dollar-sized snowflakes are falling from the sky. Following this, the volunteer crew prepares by searching for medium-sized hemlock trees that have fresh needles, as these provide a desirable flavor for the herring eggs. Once enough branches are collected, they are placed in the water, secured with weights and buoys. The next step involves checking the branches one or two days later, with the hope that the herring will have laid their eggs on the gathered branches.
“Then a couple of days later, you’ll come back and pull up those trees and if it’s a good harvest, they’re rich and thick, full of herring eggs,” says Goddard.
Harvesting has evolved into more than just a filming opportunity; it has become a chance for Goddard to share this tradition with her son. This season, she took her 9-year-old out on a Saturday to scout for trees in preparation for the harvest. By bringing her community on screen, Goddard also returned home to connect younger generations with their elders, utilizing filmmaking as a tool to generate enthusiasm for traditional practices.
“Being able to teach the youth in a way that maybe they’re already engaged with is one way to ensure that the youth will continue to practice our harvesting ways,” says Goddard.
Ultimately, Goddard wants her son to appreciate the effort involved in harvesting from the land and recognize the value of natural resources like herring eggs. She emphasizes that it is far easier to waste food purchased from a grocery store than to invest the time and energy required to gather and prepare food sourced directly from the earth or sea. Additionally, she highlights the deep connection that Indigenous peoples have with the animals they rely on, underscoring the importance of respect and stewardship in their relationship with nature.

	“I want him to be able to respectfully harvest, respectfully take care of his body through healthy food that he knows where it came from,” Goddard said.
“I want him to really care for himself by eating really healthy food, and being connected to community and gratitude, and all these amazing things that subsistence living teaches you,” Goddard continued.
Family tradition
Like Goddard, for Ricardo Worl, known by his Łingít name Gooshdeihéen, this is a family tradition, something he has looked forward to since childhood. Although he was too young to be on the ocean, he was able to contribute to the harvesting process in other meaningful ways. Gooshdeihéen remembers packaging the eggs collected by his uncles in Sitka, often handling boxes that weighed as much as 50 pounds. Surrounded by family, he participated in the enduring tradition of utilizing and processing the resources provided by the land.
“I just remember me and my cousins receiving that box excitedly, and vacuum sealing it, sharing it out,” reflects Gooshdeihéen.
As a community harvester, he can now be found alongside his uncles in the ocean each spring. As a nephew, he is expected to learn from their experience. His responsibilities extend beyond merely acquiring knowledge; he is also tasked with engaging in physically demanding work.
“My role was to cut down all the trees, bring them from out of the woods, down to the boat so they could put the trees and branches into the water,” Gooshdeihéen said. “And after the herring had spawned on the trees, my job was to pull the trees up to the boat so we could clip the branches off and pull them in.”
Gooshdeihéen didn’t formally participate in the harvest until after completing his undergraduate education at Whitworth University in Spokane, Washington, in 2021. After Gooshdeihéen returned home to Juneau he enrolled in the Haa Yoo X’atángi Deiyí: Our Language Pathway Project to learn his Łingít language. In the program, Gooshdeihéen expressed that he was interested in reconnecting his language with subsistence practices.

	“I found that becoming a language scholar has made me a better fisherman and being a better fisherman has made me a better language learner,” says Gooshdeihéen.
He believes that both elements of the language and ways of living are inherently intertwined, and says he now has a greater appreciation when learning about his heritage.
Although Haa Yoo X’atángi Deiyí ended in 2023, Gooshdeihéen continues his linguistic journey to translate the Łingít language, aiming to contribute to the development of educational curricula. He shares that he is not only grateful for past language speakers but that his community is “lucky that our aunties, uncles, and grandparents documented a lot of our language, so there’s a lot to be translated. ”
Gooshdeihéen is one of the 22,601 individuals of Łingít descent, according to the latest Census data. The Łingít people are the largest group of Alaska Natives with a rich cultural heritage and historical presence in Alaska. According to the Alaska Native Language Center there are about 500 speakers of the Łingít language. 
“I’d love to do translation and curriculum development to create some curriculum and language learning resources for future generations,” says Gooshdeihéen.
Gooshdeihéen’s goal and data figures highlight the ongoing efforts to preserve and revitalize the language, which is an integral part of the Łingít identity. 
In the meantime, he is enrolled in language classes at the University of Alaska Southeast and coaches the Yadaa.at Kalé ski team, and the cross-country, and track teams at Juneau-Douglas High School. When he isn’t focused on language studies, skiing, or retrieving heavy tree branches from the ocean, Gooshdeihéen enjoys preparing herring eggs by blanching them on the branches, then picking them off and dipping them in seal grease. He has also been experimenting with new methods to enjoy this traditional delicacy.
“But recently, I have been trying new recipes with the row on kelp, where I sort of marinate it like you would kimchi,” says Gooshdeihéen.
Beyond trying new recipes and learning traditional ways of living, Gooshdeihéen is part of a larger network of Indigenous people who are living the traditional ways of their ancestors. Belonging to the Kaagwaantaan clan, Gooshdeihéen shares that having the opportunity to harvest herring eggs with his uncles not only reinforces his connection to the land but also the connection to his clans and community. He explained that when he is out on the ocean, he is amazed that he can “connect with the lands that my ancestors stewarded and do the things that they’ve been doing since time immemorial.” 
“I’m doing the same thing in 2025 that my ancestors were similarly doing 10, 15,000 years ago,” Gooshdeihéen continued.
A 2019 study by the University of Alaska Southeast confirms this. 
“In northwestern North America, the archaeological record of faunal remains shows that herring were fished for more than 10,000 years and were routinely taken by at least 4,000 BP (Before Present),” the university announcement of the study said.
He is dedicated to continuing his ancestral traditions in other ways as well.
“I made sure I shared a box with my grandparent’s people, the T’akhdeintaan out of Hoonah, and it’s really rewarding, and it feels good to reinforce these clan connections that have been also maintained since time immemorial,” says Gooshdeihéen.
The lessons he learned in childhood remain meaningful as he continues to pack eggs into boxes for his community. 
Historical Athabascan and Tlingit trade routes
One of the special boxes was sent to Val Adams, a Gwich’in and Koyukon Athabascan from Beaver, who lives in Fairbanks, Alaska. Her friend, Sara Beaber-Fujioka, whom she knows through church, sent the box from Sitka. Beaber-Fujioka’s late husband was a fisherman who also harvested herring eggs and through his knowledge and relationship with Alaska Native traditions, also packaged and sent similar boxes. 
“Harvesting and sharing food was central to his life, and so we had been harvesting and sharing herring eggs as this amazing abundance that we have in Sitka,” says Beaber-Fujioka.
After her late husband’s passing, Beaber-Fujioka and her daughters decided to carry on the legacy. She says that being able to share this abundance with people she knows will carry forward the joy of giving, especially among elders, is Beaber-Fujioka’s way of giving back to the community.
Adams chose to share the mail by distributing the eggs among the elders in the Denakkanaaga program, a nonprofit organization that provides cultural programming for elders living in the Interior.
“It’s our traditional way,” says Adams. “It’s our custom to share, especially delicacies such as this.”

	Sharon McConnell, the executive director of Denakkanaaga, emphasizes that this generosity illustrates the historical trade relationships that existed before Western contact. As noted by Sealaska Heritage, Łingít people have always historically traded amongst themselves and neighboring communities for goods that couldn’t be found in the region. Łingít’s offered, “greenstone for tools, clams, mussels, red and yellow cedar, dried halibut and salmon, seal oil, herring eggs, seal meat, hooligan oil, and berries.” 
“Through the decades we’ve traded with other tribes throughout the state of Alaska, and the bonds have been made between Native people in different regions of Alaska, and one is between Southeast Alaska and Interior Alaska.” says McConnell.
While the box of herring eggs didn’t cross the vast landscape through the rivers, mountains, and lakes on a trade route, the eggs were still enjoyed by the elders. McConnell shared that everyone loved it as the elders enjoyed the eggs to their liking, such as eating them raw or blanching the eggs before eating. 
“For those in Southeast to share it with us, it’s very meaningful and very appreciated,” reflects McConnell.

	The 2025 herring egg harvest in April serves as a reminder of how traditional values continue to foster unity among diverse communities of Alaska. This annual harvest, deeply rooted in Indigenous practices, reflects a respect for nature and a commitment to sharing resources. As the herring spawned, various clans, each with their own histories, came together to participate. 
Goddard shares that the act of gathering isn’t only a means of food security but also reinforces the community aspect of this practice.
“I don’t think we were meant to do it on our own, or especially in our cultures, we weren’t meant to do it on our own,” Goddard said. “We’re meant to rely on each other, and I think that is something like the herring egg harvest really represents.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-13 00:43:40+00:00,CT Mirror,CT faith leaders denounce Avelo Airlines as deportation flights start,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/12/avelo-deportation-flights-ct-protest/,CT faith leaders led a protest at Tweed New Haven Airport Monday against Avelo Airlines as it began its deportation flights in Arizona.,"Over a dozen faith leaders from across the state of Connecticut stood outside Tweed New Haven Airport on Monday evening in protest of Avelo Airlines’ first deportation flight transporting migrants from Arizona to El Salvador. 
The clergy, who represented a variety of faith denominations, spoke to a crowd of people carrying signs and chanting “Shame on Avelo!” 
Josh Williams, the pastor of the Elm City Vineyard Church in New Haven, asked how many members of the crowd had flown on a flight chartered by Avelo. A number of hands shot up. Williams said he had flown on the airline as well.
“ I’ll tell you why I did … it was cheap, easy and convenient,” said Williams. “And it turns out that things that are cheap, easy, and convenient aren’t always good or right.” 
This is not the first protest at Tweed Airport against Avelo Airlines. Early last month, about 50 people gathered outside of Tweed to protest the company’s decision to contract with the state Department of Homeland Security to charter deportation flights.

A second protest took place at Tweed on April 17, where U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., called on Avelo to “do the right thing” and break their contract with the federal government. An online petition calling for the boycott of Avelo has nearly 37,800 signatures. 
Bishop John Selders of Amistad United Church of Christ in Hartford decried that the deportations were taking place without “due process of law.” 
“ When systems fail, we have the moral right and the faith-filled obligation to raise our righteous voice and bear witness,” said Selders. “ We must bear witness in response to the moral and spiritual depravity decisions that promote money and profits over people and humanity.”  
Courtney Goff, communications manager for Avelo, told The Connecticut Mirror in an email that their major priority regarding Monday’s protest was to ensure that everyone was safe. 
“While we recognize the right of individuals to peacefully assemble, Avelo’s main priority will continue to be maintaining the safety and timeliness of our operation,” Goff wrote.  
Faith leaders who were present Monday repeatedly quoted portions of the Bible that referenced the duty to welcome strangers who enter into a foreign land, and to love one’s neighbor. 
“Scripture doesn’t speak specifically to AI or tariff policy between nations, but it does say really clearly how we are to treat immigrants. It says in the Book of Leviticus that you are to treat the immigrant as yourself because you know what it’s like to be a stranger,” Jamie Michaels, senior pastor at the First and Summerfield United Methodist Church in New Haven, told CT Mirror. 
Helena Martin, a Ph.D student at Yale who is also an Episcopal priest, said she felt it was important to show people the truth about what it meant to be Christian. 
“ It is being a faithful Christian to advocate for due process and for caring for our neighbor. Being a Christian has nothing to do with separating families and deporting people without caring about who they are,” she told CT Mirror.

Rabbi Herbert Brockman of Congregation Mishkan Israel in Hamden recalled the pride he felt as the child of immigrants reciting the Pledge of Allegiance. He said his parents experienced poverty and violence before coming to the U.S., and he emphasized how the end of the pledge was a commitment to justice that could be connected back to the prophets of the Old Testament.  
Margarita, an immigrant from Ecuador who did not give her last name, also spoke at the rally. She told the crowd through an interpreter that her husband had gone for a routine immigration check in Hartford two months ago, and had been detained. Four days ago, he was deported to Ecuador. 
Margarita asked for help so that she and her 9-year-old son could return to Ecuador as well. The organization Unidad Latina in Accion has set up a GoFundMe page to help raise money for their return.   
Margarita told CT Mirror in Spanish that she and her husband had come to the U.S. so that their son could receive an education and a better life. But she currently has no job, she said, and she and her son have had to stay in a church. She said her son enjoys school.  
“He doesn’t want to leave, but he says ‘I miss my dad,’” she said. 
Avelo’s contract with DHS has also prompted state officials to take action. In April, the legislature’s Judiciary Committee voted to expand a bill regulating the ways that state and local police can or cannot cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Under the provision, companies would be added to the list of entities that are able to be prohibited from cooperating with federal immigration authorities.
The new language in the bill would require that “any principal or key personnel of the person, firm or corporation” that decides to apply for a contract with a state agency “will not cooperate with any federal immigration authority or engage in any contract for purposes of the detention, holding or transportation of an individual” protected under the state’s Trust Act.
If the company refuses, the state would be directed to award the contract instead “to the next highest ranked proposer or the next lowest responsible qualified bidder” or to seek new bids. 
During the Judiciary Committee meeting in April, Rep. Steve Stafstrom, D-Bridgeport, co-chair of the committee, noted that Avelo does not pay Connecticut’s state aviation fuel tax.

On April 8, Attorney General William Tong sent a letter to Avelo Airlines CEO Andrew Levy asking questions about the company’s policies for deportation flights and expressing “deep disappointment” at the company’s decision to contract with the Department of Homeland Security.
Levy responded a week later, saying that there seemed to be a “fundamental misunderstanding how the federal government contracts the flights that are the subject of your [Tong’s] letter.” He suggested that Tong submit a Freedom of Information Act to obtain the contract between Avelo Airlines and the Department of Homeland Security.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025_0512_SR_AveloRally277-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-12 21:01:01.435928

As legal rulings block the Legislature’s ban on abortion and allow lawsuits against Freedom Caucus initiatives to proceed, the caucus has called for reforming the courts.
The post Citing court losses, Freedom Caucus turns attention to Wyoming judges appeared first on WyoFile .","Like President Donald Trump’s efforts to detain immigrants in an El Salvadoran prison and slash the federal government through executive orders, the Wyoming Freedom Caucus’s agenda has hit roadblocks in the courts.  
And like the president, the caucus is targeting the court system in response. 
Trump has responded to adverse rulings by calling for federal judges to be impeached. His allies in Congress — including Wyoming’s delegation — then introduced bills to curtail the judicial branch’s power.
Following suit, the Wyoming Freedom Caucus is taking aim at Wyoming’s appointment process for state court judges. In a pair of recent blog posts, the caucus argued that recent court decisions it disagrees with are the result of a biased system, dominated by “insiders” with a political agenda. 
“For far too long, the judicial branch has been seen as untouchable, outside the realm of criticism,” an April 30 post to the group’s substack read. The posts are not signed by a particular author. 
“As our founders knew well, all human institutions are capable of corruption,” the post continued. “It’s time for judicial reform in Wyoming in a way that gives the people a stake in our bench.”
The Freedom Caucus opened its offensive on the judiciary at a time when Wyoming’s courts are weighing momentous cases — with perhaps the most politically significant one being abortion access. The caucus’s call to reform the courts comes as the state waits for a Wyoming Supreme Court ruling on the constitutionality of abortion bans the Legislature passed in 2023.

A Teton County judge last year ruled the ban conflicted with a provision of the Wyoming Constitution and halted its implementation. And last month, a Natrona County judge suspended two new laws passed by the Legislature in 2025 — one that sought to require women get ultrasounds before taking abortion pills and another that placed new regulations on Wyoming’s only abortion clinic that opponents said would force the facility’s closure.
The Freedom Caucus cited those abortion rulings, as well as others that haven’t gone in their favor in both state and federal courts, as evidence the judicial system has become somehow corrupted. 
“A lack of public buy-in to the judicial selection process has left Wyomingites feeling confused, upset, and blindsided by the decisions reached by many on the bench,” the caucus wrote.
Critics say the group is trying to remove checks on its political and ideological agenda. 
“This boils down to them not appreciating the Wyoming Constitution, and at times, the U.S. Constitution,” Rep. Karlee Provenza, D-Laramie, said. “If you don’t appreciate what the Constitution says and how it’s interpreted, then your goal becomes to change the court.”

Sweetwater County Republican lawmaker Cody Wylie also questioned the Freedom Caucus’s increasing invocation of “liberal courts” at the state level. 
“Maybe — just maybe — the problem is the bills themselves,” he wrote in a letter to the editor published by various Wyoming news outlets. “When legislation is unconstitutional or doesn’t fit within Wyoming law, it doesn’t stand. The solution: Do the work. Make sure the bill fits Wyoming laws.” 
Exactly what judicial reform the group might pursue remains up in the air. Last legislative session, the Freedom Caucus members who lead the Wyoming House held back a bill that would have placed a constitutional amendment on the ballot to make judges elected officials — a dramatic measure that would mark a sea change for Wyoming’s court system and politics.
Elections and appointments
The Freedom Caucus does not appear aligned behind the idea of elections for judges, though two leaders of the group told WyoFile they were open to whatever the legislative process brings about. Both House Appropriations Chairman John Bear, R-Gillette, and Rep. Rachel Rodriguez-Williams, R-Cody, the current Wyoming Freedom Caucus chairwoman, support the state adopting the federal government’s model — where the president is largely free to pick the judges he wants, provided the U.S. Senate ratifies them. 
Presidents tend to pick federal judges who align with their political party. Trump appointed three U.S. Supreme Court justices in his first term — with Republicans in control of the Senate — and significantly altered the composition of the nation’s highest court. 
Wyoming operates under what is commonly called the Missouri Plan, where a commission reviews applicants and sends a limited set of choices to the governor for a final pick. The Missouri Plan’s advocates say appointment commissions take partisan politics out of judicial selections and ground the decisions in legal expertise and temperament. 
In Wyoming, the Judicial Nominating Commission is composed of six people appointed by the governor — three lawyers and three people from outside the bar. The seventh member, who serves as chairperson and tie breaker, is the chief justice of the Wyoming Supreme Court — a post now held by Kate Fox. 
But the Freedom Caucus claims both the Wyoming Bar Association and commission are “a victim of left-wing institutional capture,” as the caucus wrote in its blog posts.
Two members of the commission, one a lawyer and one not, told WyoFile they were surprised by the Freedom Caucus’s allegations. “Our process is apolitical, merit-based and it digs deep on candidates,” Sheridan attorney Clint Langer said. 
Describing himself as having “serious Republican roots,” Langer disputed the Freedom Caucus’s depiction of the commission as a left-wing political apparatus. 
“You would have to get lawyers and citizens appointed by a Republican Governor all agreeing to infuse left-leaning politics into the system,” he said. He does not know the political affiliation of his fellow commission members, he said. Nor does Richard Fagnant, a longtime Lander accountant who is one of the non-lawyer members of the commission. 
Fagnant, who was appointed by Republican Gov. Mark Gordon, told WyoFile he is semi-retired and spends large chunks of his time reviewing judicial candidates — about two hours per applicant, he said. 
On Monday, the commission met to consider an open seat in Goshen County. Fagnant said there were 12 applicants, and the board would interview perhaps five or six candidates before sending three choices to the governor. 
Fagnant feared the Freedom Caucus would politicize the judicial nominating process in exactly the way members say they’re seeking to stop — particularly if lawmakers pursue judicial elections. Campaign war chests and the political red meat issue of the day would sway elections, he said.

“You’re looking at who has the biggest bankroll, who is the best baby kisser, and who is going to stand out in the public eye based on issues that may not be related to judicial temperament,” he said. 
Bear said he too had questions about judicial elections. But if the governor had wider latitude to make choices, then voters could hold the chief executive accountable when judges start to drift from the will of the people. 
“There’s just no real reason to restrict the executive, whether it’s this executive or a future executive who might be more conservative,” Bear said. 
Those skeptical of the caucus’s interest in judicial reform are “the very same elites and bar officials who have long enjoyed unchecked control over judicial selection in Wyoming,” Rodriguez-Williams wrote to WyoFile in an email. “They’re not defending the people’s right to fair courts—they’re defending their own influence.”
Despite the Wyoming Freedom Caucus’s statements that trust in the state’s judiciary is at a low, more residents approve of how the state’s judges handle their jobs than disapprove, according to the Wyoming Survey and Analysis Center. In polling conducted last September and October, only 13% of respondents told the center they disapproved of how judges handle their jobs, while more than 40% of respondents said they approved. 
Meanwhile, national polls conducted after the first 100 days of Trump’s second term suggest that people want to see the different branches of government check each other, and indicate a majority of voters oppose the president ignoring court orders. 
Bias or lawmaking? 
To support the caucus’s allegations that the state’s legal institutions are permeated by left-wing politics, Rodriguez-Williams pointed to recent selections by the judicial nominating commission for the state supreme court. In recent cycles the commission has put forward former Republican lawmaker Tim Stubson and former state bar president Anna Reeves Olson as candidates for recent seats. 
Stubson has remained politically active since leaving office, and has opposed the Freedom Caucus’s rise in past election cycles. Gordon did not select him for the open state supreme court seat. Reeves-Olson was among 41 attorneys who signed a letter in 2022 criticizing U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman for promoting the false idea that the 2020 election was rigged against Trump. The lawyers who signed the letter said Hageman was violating her obligation to uphold respect for the law by continuing to claim the election was stolen after a number of federal judges found no evidence of tampering. 
Rodriguez-Williams wrote that Reeves Olson had denounced Hageman “simply for expressing conservative political views that diverged from the Bar establishment.”
The state bar chose not to open a disciplinary investigation into Hageman, though an attorney filed a report against her, WyoFile previously reported.
If Reeves Olson fell afoul of the state’s right-wing conservatives in that instance, the Freedom Caucus’s blog post itself shows that the judges and lawyers can cut both ways.  
In its posts, the caucus listed three active lawsuits in which it argues Wyoming courts are letting “free speech [come] under attack.” One example is a defamation lawsuit against a Freedom Caucus political action committee for mailers sent during the last election. Another is the lawsuit a former Campbell County librarian brought against people she says ousted her from her job for refusing to remove certain library books. One of the defendants in that case is Bear’s wife, Sage Bear. 
And the third case is a lawsuit Artemis Langford, a transgender University of Wyoming student, brought against two conservative lawyers who sought to have her removed from her sorority.
After a federal judge dismissed the case seeking to toss her from the sorority, Langford sued the lawyers who brought it, claiming wrongdoing and judicial persecution.
The conservative attorneys are represented in court by Reeves Olson.
Reeves Olson did not respond to a WyoFile request for comment Monday.

Celeste Maloy, R-Utah, at Salt Lake Central Station in Salt Lake City on Monday, April 7, 2025. (McKenzie Romero/Utah News Dispatch)As Utah looks to double power production in the next 10 years, state leaders view geothermal energy as an untapped resource. But, officials say federal regulations are stunting the industry and hope Congress will peel back some of the red tape. 
On Monday, the U.S. House of Representatives’ Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources, which is under the House Committee on Natural Resources, held a hearing in Cedar City to discuss the barriers to geothermal production on federal land. 
“For far too long the promise of geothermal energy has been underappreciated and underutilized in our national energy conversation. Despite its incredible potential, geothermal faces regulatory delays, permitting hurdles and a lack of investment that doesn’t match the scale of opportunity,” said Utah Republican Rep. Celeste Maloy during her opening remarks Monday. 
In 2023, geothermal power plants located in seven states produced about 17 kilowatt hours of electricity, which is about 0.4% of all utility-scale electricity generation in the U.S., according to a congressional memo. Most of those sites are in the West or Hawaii — California produces more overall geothermal power than any other state, while Nevada generates the highest percentage of electricity from geothermal. 
Despite recent advances in Utah, the Beehive State is lacking compared to California and Nevada. According to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, Utah generates about 3.2% of total geothermal energy production in the U.S. — California is at about 66%, and Nevada at 26%. And about 1.5% of Utah’s power comes from geothermal, compared to 10% in Nevada, and 5% in California.  
Speaking during the hearing on Monday, deputy director of the Utah Office of Energy Development Jake Garfield laid out the state’s recommendations to Congress and the federal government.

First, he said, the Bureau of Land Management, or BLM, should offer more land for companies to lease. In the last five years, Garfield said the agency has put up more than 160,000 acres of land in Utah to lease for geothermal — during that same timeframe, the BLM office in Nevada put up more than 700,000 acres. 
“If it can be done in Nevada, it can certainly be done here,” Garfield said. 
The BLM should also focus on what Garfield called “broad scale, programmatic planning” for geothermal energy in the West, looking at where production is most feasible and where it should be prioritized. 
“Just last year the Biden administration did a similar planning effort for solar power, and if it can be done for solar it can be done for geothermal energy, particularly because geothermal energy has far fewer impacts on the landscape,” Garfield said. 
And, streamlining energy production can’t happen if the federal government does not also streamline construction of transmission lines, a unique challenge for geothermal facilities. Transmission lines need to be built to the source of energy, and doing so is a process burdened by federal regulations, Garfield said. 
“We’re seeing the initial construction of a long transmission line from new energy sites in Wyoming down to southern Nevada,” he told the committee. “So far that’s taken 16 years to permit, and construction still won’t be done for another five years. If we see delays like that for transmission, we’ll never see the full buildout of Utah’s geothermal potential.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Lastly, the permitting process for geothermal energy production itself needs to be shortened, Garfield said, calling out the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA, a 1970 law that requires the federal government to conduct an environmental review before moving forward with infrastructure projects.   
Garfield said offering geothermal projects certain exemptions under NEPA would help the industry — like what’s being proposed by Maloy through her Geothermal Energy Opportunity Act, which requires the U.S. Department of Interior to process a geothermal drilling permit within 60 days. 
Maloy is also sponsoring the Streamlining Thermal Energy through Advanced Mechanisms Act, which gives the geothermal industry the same flexibility as the oil and gas industry, cutting some of the regulations when pursuing a project on public land that’s already been studied or disturbed by industry.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Duffy-train-ride-18-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-12 21:01:01.435928

Kim Reynolds' desk May 12, 2025. (Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Iowa House lawmakers sent legislation to implement restrictions on pharmacy benefit managers to Gov. Kim Reynolds Monday, a bill supporters said will help keep rural pharmacies in business — but that opponents said could lead to higher insurance and drug costs for Iowans.
Pharmacists celebrated from the gallery as the House voted 75-15 Monday on Senate File 383, the legislation setting some restrictions and regulations on pharmacy benefit managers. PBMs are the entities that negotiate prescription drug prices between manufacturers, health insurance companies and pharmacies.
The bill sets new restrictions on certain PBM practices that supporters of the measure argue are major factors contributing to the closure of local and rural pharmacies in the states. It creates multiple restrictions on PBMs’ use of strategies that favor a specific pharmacy to fill a prescription, like different cost-sharing rates or fees, or other financial penalties or incentives.
The legislation would also require pharmacies to be reimbursed at the average state or national acquisition cost of a drug.
Rep. Brett Barker, R-Nevada, said the bill was needed to combat practices by PBMs, which he said have manipulated the U.S. health care system and “stacked the deck against consumers, pharmacies, employers and taxpayers.”
“These monopolistic companies have become three of the most powerful corporations in the world from profiting off an opaque and complex system at the expense of everyone else in supply chain,” Barker said. “These abusive, anti-competitive practices have created an epidemic of pharmacy closures and rising prescription drug prices nationwide. … Community pharmacists want to care for their communities, and it’s time that they get an even playing field to do just that.”
Pharmacists and advocates have spoken out in favor of the bill, saying that current PBM practices favoring mail-order prescription refills and pharmacy chains have played a major role in the closure of more than 200 pharmacies across the state, including 31 pharmacies in 2024. The measure was amended by the Senate to make some definition changes for how drug rebates received by PBMs would be passed through to health insurance companies to lower coverage costs, but Democratic Sen. Sarah Trone Garriott said the amendment could lead to higher health insurance costs for Iowans.
Some business leaders share these concerns, citing the Legislative Services Agency analysis that found the bill could result in higher costs and copays for the state’s health insurance program. According to a news release Iowa Association of Business and Industry (ABI) from earlier in May, the bill could result in an additional $340 million in costs for private-sector health insurance plans and raised costs of approximately $169 per insured Iowan annually.
Leaders representing business organizations like ABI, the Iowa Business Council and Iowa chapter of the National Federation of Independent Business released a statement urging lawmakers to make further changes to the legislation that will ensure health coverage costs do not rise for Iowans.
“ABI members and Iowa businesses support policies that improves access to care. But this legislation simply shifts hundreds of millions of dollars in new costs to employers and working families,” Nicole Crain, ABI president said in the news release.
Rep. Jeff Cooling, D-Cedar Rapids, introduced an amendment that he said would limit prescription drug cost increases for Iowans, but the proposal failed. He said he believed the portion of the bill setting a dispensing reimbursement fee of $10.68 from PBMs to pharmacists for each prescription would be a cost put on Iowans filling their prescriptions.
Cooling said the bill allows the insurance or employer group to decide whether to cover the dispensing fee.
“As a representative in this state, I can’t imagine an employer that is going to say, ‘yes, that’s okay insurance company, raise my rates, I’ll cover that,'” Cooling said. “What to me seems far more likely is (saying), ‘no pass that on.’ So I believe a vote for this is a vote to raise prescription costs per fill by $10.68 if someone fills them at an independent pharmacy.”
He also said this provision will likely further incentivize Iowans to fill their prescriptions at larger pharmacies and increase financial pressures on independent and rural pharmacies, as people filling their prescriptions at larger, chain companies which do not receive the $10.68 dispensing fee.
“That’s fine, but when folks figure out that they can go to a larger pharmacy and not have to pay that $10.68 at the counter, where do you think they’re going to go to save money?” Coolin said. “That’s what I think will happen. I think even with the best of intentions with this bill, that it will not fix the problem that we all want to fix.”
But the Iowa Pharmacy Association, a major supporter of the bill, released a statement urging the legislation, as passed by the Senate, to go to the governor’s desk. In a news release, the organization stated other states have implemented similar PBM regulations and have not seen health insurance premiums increase.
Wes Pilkington, the president-elect of the Iowa Pharmacy Association Board of Trustees and owner of Evans Crossing Pharmacy, said in a statement that further changes to the bill “are only designed to protect the massive profits of Big Insurance and the PBMs they own.”
“Big Insurance makes huge profits on the current system which leads to pharmacy closures and harm to Iowa’s patients,” Pilkington said. “This legislation is designed to help Iowa pharmacies, NOT protect Fortune 10 insurance companies.”
Barker dismissed the criticisms of the bill as misinformation.
“Despite mistruths many you have heard in this room tonight, dark money, astroturf campaigns and fear mongering, we have a really good bill in front of us that will move the needle to protect vital health care infrastructure in our state,” Barker said. “… By sending this bill to the governor, Iowa will take a huge step to catch back up with states across the country who have taken a leading role in reforming a broken system by reining in abusive PBM practices.”
Kate Gainer, CEO of the Iowa Pharmacy Association, celebrated the bill’s passage in a statement Monday.
“This bill is a critical step toward protecting Iowa’s local pharmacies and ensuring accountability for PBMs, whose practices have forced Iowa pharmacies to shutter their doors and countless Iowans to lose healthcare access,” Gainer said. “With states nationwide enacting similar reforms, we’re grateful the House and Senate have paved the way for Governor Reynolds to sign this bill and safeguard Iowa’s pharmacies and the patients they serve.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/pbms.house_.5.12-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-12 20:02:40.579741

(Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)FRANKFORT — Franklin Circuit Judge Thomas Wingate has declined to approve a final settlement in the longrunning lawsuit against big hedge funds over their role in controversial investments by the Kentucky Retirement Systems more than 13 years ago.
The settlement was announced Jan. 8 by Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman, who said the hedge funds had agreed to pay $227.5 million to Kentucky’s pension programs for public employees.
  Franklin Circuit Judge Thomas Wingate
But in a four-page order, Wingate said, “The Court is left without a sufficient reason as to why the Court’s approval is necessary for this settlement or why this Court is being asked to make findings that the Court is without sufficient knowledge to make.”
Wingate wrote that he “welcomes the parties to settle the matter as they best see fit, however, the Court declines to bless an agreement and enter an order that asks the Court to make findings that the Court believes to be outside of its role.”
While the order leaves open the door to further settlement talks, it is a setback for Coleman, the hedge funds and the other parties who had presented a proposed final settlement order to Wingate for his approval. 
Kevin Grout, a spokesman for Coleman’s office, said late Monday, “We’re reviewing the court’s order and discussing with the Kentucky pension board leaders.”
The order appears to be a big win for four Kentucky public employees who filed a separate case against the same hedge funds. That’s because a key part of the proposed settlement order would have required that their case, as well as other related cases, be dismissed.
The employees in that separate case are represented by attorney Michelle Ciccarelli Lerach. A spokesman for Lerach said Lerach is reviewing Wingate’s order and will release a statement later this week.
Wingate’s Friday order also included a directive that will slash the potential amount that could be paid in fees to attorneys who represent Coleman’s office in the case.
The contract between Coleman and those private attorneys led by Ann Oldfather, of Louisville, calls for the fees to be 20% of the first 20% of gross recovery in the case.
The proposed settlement called for hedge funds to turn over $227.5 million, but that total had two parts — $82.5 million in new money plus $145 million held in reserve by Prisma, one of the hedge fund companies that are defendants in the case.

Wingate’s order said the $145 million has belonged to Kentucky’s pension funds all along and is “not to be considered ‘recovered funds’ and/or a portion of the ‘settlement recovery’ for the purpose of determining attorneys’ fees.”
Don Kelly, the attorney representing Blackstone, one of the defendants in the case, emphasized in a statement Monday that Wingate’s order leaves the door open for the parties to settle the case. “The settlement is clearly in the best interests of the Commonwealth and its pensioners and will result in significant assets being paid to the pension plans,” Kelly said. “As stated by the Attorney General and the KPPA (Kentucky Public Pension Authority), who are best positioned to make decisions in the public interest, now is the time to put an end to this long running expensive and distracting litigation.”
From the case’s outset the hedge funds have denied allegations that the investments resulted in high fees, low transparency and massive losses for Kentucky public pension plans. Kelly said in his statement Monday that Blackstone Alternative Asset Management had “delivered a net return of 30 percent on investment.”

A majority of the state Supreme Court, however, opted not to issue an answer on Monday. (Getty Images)As Huntington and Cabell County are attempting to appeal a 2022 federal ruling that found West Virginia’s public nuisance laws insufficient grounds for their lawsuit against three opioid distributors, the state Supreme Court on Monday declined to answer a certified question from the federal appeals court on a crucial aspect of the case.
Last March, the federal Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals asked the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals to decide whether state law recognizes conditions caused by prescription drug sales to be a public nuisance, and if so, what the elements are of such claims.
In an opinion issued Monday written by Justice C. Haley Bunn, the state Supreme Court declined to answer that question due to “disputed factual findings and related legal conclusions resting on those factual findings.” Justice Beth Walker issued a separate opinion concurring with Bunn’s opinion and the court’s decision to remain quiet on the question.
A dissenting opinion was written by Chief Justice Bill Wooton and supported by Kanawha County Circuit Court Judge Tera Salango, who is sitting in on temporary assignment. Justices Tim Armstead and Charlie Trump both recused themselves from the case.
In her opinion, Bunn wrote that, since Huntington and Cabell County — as the plaintiffs in the case — were disputing “unsettled facts” used in U.S. District Court Judge David Faber’s 2022 decision in favor of AmerisourceBergen, Cardinal Health and McKesson, the state court can’t fairly answer the legal question posed by the Fourth Circuit. 
“We would have to assume that some or all of the district court’s disputed findings of fact and related legal conclusions were incorrect to answer any kind of question regarding public nuisance, because if the district court’s challenged findings and related conclusions are correct, this Court need not reach the legal question of whether a public nuisance cause of action exists in these circumstances,” Bunn’s opinion reads.
In their dissenting opinion, however, Wooton argued that the state court could certainly offer an answer to the public nuisance question without taking on all the details and potential outcomes of the federal appeals case.
“In short, nothing in our law compels the conclusion that a certified question must be dispositive of an entire case, which appears to be the majority’s underlying rationale,” Wooton wrote. “Our mandate is to resolve an issue, which is exactly what the Fourth Circuit has asked us to do.”
Wooton called the majority’s reasoning in refusing to issue an answer to the questions “wholly unpersuasive.” 
“[Huntington and Cabell County] are entitled to an answer to the question posed by the Fourth Circuit, and the [drug companies’] argument to the contrary can fairly be deemed cursory at best; it consists of one brief paragraph and a footnote,” Wooton wrote. “Unfortunately, the majority has come to the rescue by making the argument the [drug companies] could have made, but did not.”
Wooton pointed to weaknesses in case law from decisions in other states that were used by the majority to explain its rationale in denying answering the question, saying such cases lacked West Virginia-specific context. He also emphasized how critical the court’s decision could be, and pointed to other similar circumstances where the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals opted to answer a certified question from a higher court when facts for the case were under dispute. 
“In declining to utilize [state law] in order to answer the certified question, this Court could well be viewed as having once again ducked an issue which it has ducked on three previous occasions,” Wooton wrote.
Those “three previous occasions” he cites were cases also centered on opioid distributors where the state supreme court opted not to issue opinions.
“We may never have a better opportunity than the one we are squandering today,” Wooton wrote. “The certified question in this case is one of great importance to our State, which has been ravaged by a flood of epic proportions: a flood of opioids which has, over the course of decades, overtaken the capacity of State, county, and municipal institutions and programs to remediate the damage caused in its wake.”
Huntington and Cabell County alone, he continued, lack the resources necessary to recover from the ongoing drug and overdose epidemic.
But the localities, Wooton wrote, “deserve an answer to their overarching question: is there a light at the end of this tunnel?”
Huntington and Cabell County opted out of a statewide lawsuit against opioid distributors in order to bring their own legal action in hopes of earning more money for remediation efforts. The arguments made in their case against the distributors, however, are nearly identical to those that were made on behalf of the state in its litigation. The state’s case proved successful. 
Since the localities opted out of the statewide case against distributors, they are ineligible to receive most of the funds directly distributed to counties and municipalities from that settlement. The localities can, however, apply for and receive grant funds from the West Virginia First Foundation, the private nonprofit organization responsible for allocating the state’s share of the money.
The localities have argued that the excessive distribution of opioids in their communities caused significant harm, spurring what is now a decades-long and still ongoing drug epidemic. According to the state Office of Drug Control Policy, at least 876 individuals in Cabell County died from overdoses involving opioids between 2015 and 2021, the highest fatal overdose rate for opioids in the state over that time.
Distributors named in the ongoing litigation allege, as they have in opioid cases across the country, that public nuisance laws do not apply when legal products are being distributed.
Cabell County and Huntington are seeking about $2.5 billion from the companies to support recovery efforts in their communities and implement a plan to decrease the impact of the crisis.
Without an answer from the state Supreme Court, the Fourth Circuit will likely have to interpret West Virginia’s laws on its own as the localities’ request for an appeal moves forward.

The cost of natural gas infrastructure, generous utility profits, and the region’s continued fossil fuel investments left us ill-equipped to deal with an exceptionally cold winter. 
The post Why is your energy bill so high? Blame natural gas volatility and utility profits   appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","THIS WINTER, New England residents were battered by persistently high energy bills, especially for natural gas service. In Massachusetts, the state’s energy efficiency program, Mass Save, unfortunately emerged as a convenient scapegoat, despite saving the Commonwealth and ratepayers billions of dollars.  The real culprit for high bills this winter? The cost of natural gas infrastructure, generous utility profits, and the region’s continued fossil fuel investments – which left us ill-equipped to deal with an exceptionally cold winter.  In response to complaints about energy affordability, utilities like Eversource and National Grid have pointed to increased funding of the state’s cost-effective energy efficiency program. This is no small source of irony – Mass Save is a relatively small fraction of bills, but it is the most potent tool available to empower consumers to control their energy costs and protect them from fossil fuel price spikes.  The vast majority of the bill, around 70-75 percent, goes toward natural gas costs – relating to gas supply, distribution, and maintenance – compared to just 15-25 percent going toward energy efficiency. Unlike other energy costs, efficiency is the only investment that is required to pass cost-effectiveness testing. In fact, overall energy system costs would be billions of dollars higher without the cost reductions secured with efficiency. Not nearly enough scrutiny has been given to the investments on which gas utility companies make money. One of the primary ways an investor-owned gas utility makes a profit is by making a return on investment at a specific rate, approved by the state, on capital investments in gas infrastructure projects: the extensive, multi-billion-dollar pipeline network in place under our streets.  In Eversource territory, for example, this healthy rate of return ranges from around 9.5 percent to 9.9 percent. This generous profit structure incentivizes utilities to pursue costly system upgrades and expansions, which are well-compensated, and to add more customers onto the system despite the misalignment with state goals. The more utilities spend on outdated infrastructure, the more money they make, and the national numbers bear this out: Over the last three years, residential electric rates for investor-owned utilities have risen 49 percent more than inflation. Meanwhile, the rates at publicly-owned electric utilities have increased 44 percent less than inflation.   It should also be noted that existing gas customers pay a disproportionate share of the costs for bringing new gas customers online. Since 2018, existing gas customers have footed the bill for 80 percent of all new gas customer connections. And these subsidies – known as line extension allowances – are driving up gas bills for everyone.  In 2023 alone, Massachusetts gas customers were charged $160 million to add new customers to the gas system, to the tune of $9,000 per new customer, which is reflected on ratepayer gas bills. The cost of adding new customers is rising as well. The average cost of adding new customers rose 50 percent between 2020-2021 and again in 2022-2023. In fact, despite an acknowledgement by the state and by utilities that we should be winding the gas system down – not expanding it – the growth of the sprawling pipe network shows no signs of stopping.  According to a recent earnings report from Eversource, for example, the company projects that its gas distribution costs across New England will increase 83 percent between 2023 and 2029, faster than either their electric transmission or distribution subsidiaries. Given the rapid pace of electrification and related system needs, this discrepancy between what utilities have committed to, and what’s actually happening, is noteworthy. A separate analysis commissioned by the Massachusetts attorney general’s office corroborated that a potentially vast and rapid gas system build-out – and associated impacts to ratepayer bills – could occur without state intervention. According to the AG’s analysis, the path we’re currently on could see the state’s gas rate base – the total value of gas system assets on which utilities are allowed to earn a rate of return – jump from $10 to $20 billion in a short span of roughly 10 years. In multiple sectors of the economy, Massachusetts and the rest of the region remain frustratingly over-reliant on natural gas. In 2023, about half of Massachusetts households used natural gas for home heating, and the Commonwealth – as part of ISO-New England’s regional grid – relied on gas for roughly 55 percent of the power produced in 2024.  What this means is that when it gets cold in the winter, costs can shoot up dramatically due to the volatility of natural gas prices. And, as America exports more liquefied natural gas (LNG) abroad, domestic gas prices are increasingly tied to the unpredictability of global gas markets. It was very, very cold this winter; the coldest winter since 2014-2015, in fact. According to data compiled by Acadia Center, the average temperature in December 2024 was a full 10°F colder than December 2023. Further, from December 2024 through February 2025, Massachusetts saw 23 days colder than 20°F, compared to only nine such days the year prior.  These colder temperatures generally mean that residents are using more energy, driving up bills. However, due to the Commonwealth’s overreliance on natural gas and other fossil fuels, it also means higher costs for the supply of energy. For example, the region endured a whopping $4 billion in wholesale electricity market costs this winter, per ISO-New England (a roughly $2 billion increase from last year), making it the costliest winter since 2014-2015.  One small ISO-New England program giving payments to dual-fuel (gas-oil) power plants, the inventoried energy program (IEP), cost almost $80 million over just five days. Can anyone really look at the region’s exposure to such volatile, concentrated costs and conclude that the region should invest less in energy efficiency, rather than more? Other barriers to offshore wind and local clean energy will only increase this unhealthy reliance on natural gas further.  If Massachusetts wants to take steps to lower energy bills in the long-term, we should not shy away from renewables and energy efficiency. Instead, we should embrace those clean resources, take steps to end our overreliance on natural gas and fossil fuels, and reduce business-as-usual utility profits. Kyle Murray is director of state program implementation at Acadia Center, a nonprofit climate advocacy organization.  The post Why is your energy bill so high?

Search consultant Larry Ebbers provided an update to the community college board of directors Monday on search preparations ahead of its official launch in July. The college hosted separate forums for the campus community and faculty and staff in early May, which Ebbers said were well-attended.
“Lots of enthusiasm, lots of good participation by faculty (and) staff,” Ebbers said. “We got over 100 to participate, so that’s very good.”

Further feedback on what people want to see in their future feedback is being sought through an online survey, found on the presidential search website.
The board is set to receive further updates on the meetings and online survey at its June 16 meeting. According to the online timeline of proceedings, after the July launch of the search, applications for the role will be due Sept. 1.
A three-person screening committee made up of Kirkwood Community College President Kristie Fisher, North Iowa Area Community College President Steve Schulz and Eastern Iowa Community Colleges Interim Chancellor Liang Chee Wee will review the applications. A search committee will also be selected in September, and after internal interviews with candidates, they will come to campus for interviews in October.
Rob Denson, DMACC’s current and longest-serving president, announced in January he will retire at the end of the calendar year after more than 20 years with the college and more than 40 years in higher education.
While the official search has yet to be launched, Ebbers said he is already receiving news of interested parties.
“I’ve already received nominations, and I’m also in the process of calling people around the country that I know who might be interested,” Ebbers said.

The law doesn't take effect until 2029. (Photo by Jake Goldstein-Street/Washington State Standard)In a few years, with the help of technology, prolific speeders in Washington won’t be able to drive as fast as they want.
Gov. Bob Ferguson on Monday signed House Bill 1596 into law, requiring a new speed-limiting device as a condition to getting a restricted driver’s license after getting it suspended for reckless driving or excessive speeding.
Judges can also require the speed limiters as a condition of pre-trial release or post-conviction probation.
The tech, shown at a demonstration at the Capitol on Monday, is similar to ignition interlock devices that require people with histories of drunk driving to blow into a breathalyzer to show their blood alcohol concentration before they can start the car. 
These new devices use GPS to restrict speed to the posted limit. Under the legislation, drivers could override the limiter three times per month.
The bill received bipartisan support in the Legislature as the state aims to turn the tide on traffic deaths after reaching a 33-year high in 2023. Of the 809 deaths that year, a third involved speeding drivers.
“What’s behind this bill is a really simple goal, which is to save lives,” Ferguson said. 
The new law is known as the BEAM Act, named after four people killed in a crash last year with a speeding driver near Renton: Boyd Buster Brown, Eloise Wilcoxson, Andrea Smith Hudson and Matilda Wilcoxson. 
Last month, a judge sentenced the driver in the case to 17½ years in prison after he pleaded guilty to four counts of vehicular homicide in the high-speed crash.
The driver was held up as an example of someone who would’ve needed to install a speed limiter. In the prior 10 months, he had reportedly been involved in two crashes in which his speeding was a factor.
Before signing the BEAM Act, the governor met with families of those killed in that crash and others who are pushing for stronger traffic safety measures.
“It’s the family members who got us to this day,” said prime sponsor Rep. Mari Leavitt, D-University Place. “They’re the ones who were willing to share their story over and over again.”
In Europe, new vehicles are required to have intelligent speed assistance technology installed.
But in the United States, the speed limiter idea is new.
Last month, Virginia became the first state to enact such legislation, requiring intelligent speed assistance devices for drivers convicted of going over 100 mph. Georgia quickly followed, with a bill awaiting the governor’s signature.
Last year, Washington, D.C. approved a “speed governor” requirement for repeat offenders.
Lawmakers in several other states have also considered the requirement. In California last year, Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed a measure requiring passive speed limiters.
Washington’s legislation defines excessive speeding as 20 mph above speed limits over 40 mph, or 10 mph above speed limits under that threshold. 
If a driver has a history of moving violations, including excessive speeding, they would have to use an intelligent speed assistance device for 120 days after getting their license back from a suspension. In reckless driving cases, that rises to 150 days. Driving without one during this probationary period would be a traffic infraction that could add 30 days to a license suspension.
Tampering with the device is a gross misdemeanor. 
Drivers would have to pay to install and remove the speed limiter, and an additional $21 per month. That monthly fee would go to the state Department of Licensing to offset the costs for low-income people who need the devices but can’t afford them. 
The legislation doesn’t go into effect until Jan. 1, 2029.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/speed-limiter-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-12 19:07:33.610940

Nancy Mace spoke at the Greenville County GOP convention at the Greenville Convention Center on Monday April 14, 2025. (Photo by Mark Susko/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)A lawsuit filed Monday by U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace claims one of the men she targeted in a shocking speech on the U.S. House floor of defaming her on social media in the weeks afterward.
The 1st District congresswoman accuses Eric Bowman of “repeatedly and maliciously” damaging her reputation following her hour-long speech in February, for which she’s being sued for defamation by one of the other men she named. Bowman has said more lawsuits are likely, but he meant against her.
All four men, who include Mace’s ex-fiancé, have vehemently denied her accusations that they committed “some of the most heinous crimes against women imaginable.”
Bowman, a Sullivans Island software developer, called the lawsuit filed in Charleston County court “headline theater.”
Mace claims Bowman “acted with reckless disregard to the truth and with actual malice towards Rep. Mace through his utter disregard of and callousness to her rights as a South Carolinian in purposely making such knowingly false declarations,” the lawsuit reads.
The lawsuit cites Bowman’s posts on X, formerly Twitter, between Feb. 27 — 10 days after her speech — and March 17.
In that nearly hour-long speech broadcast live on C-SPAN, Mace accused the men of an array of sexual crimes, including raping and videotaping women without their knowledge.
Mace said she was among the victims. All four men immediately denied her claims.
At the time, the state Law Enforcement Division confirmed it was investigating Mace’s ex-fiancé. A spokeswoman said Monday the agency had nothing new to report as the investigation continues.
No charges have been filed.
Bowman and Mace have blasted each other in social media posts since the speech.
The posts that Mace cites in her lawsuit include Bowman’s allegations that Mace illegally used her position on the House Veterans’ Affair Committee to steer VA contracts to friends and political allies.
“Bowman knew these statements were objectively false when they were made and acted with a reckless disregard for the truth in repeatedly making such statements without support or any attempt to verify the veracity of such statements,” the lawsuit reads.
In addition, it continued, “Bowman has also spent months smearing Rep. Mace’s name and reputation through wide range of vile, contemptible, and repugnant character attacks.”
Responding to the lawsuit, Bowman said his social media activity represents the truth.
“My posts — based on documents, public records, witness testimony, and materials from her own staff— present evidence of hacking, blackmail, misuse of private images, misappropriated tax dollars, and retaliation against rival VA contractors,” he wrote to the SC Daily Gazette in a text.
“Those posts remain publicly available on my X feed (@_ericbowman) for anyone who wants to review them. I acted in good faith and without malice, and I will present this evidence under oath,” he said.
Defamation cases are harder for public figures to prove. Their claims must meet the “actual malice” standard — that whoever they’re suing knew the information was wrong or didn’t care and recklessly spread it.
“I’m confident the First Amendment — and the documented facts — will prevail. Nancy Mace can’t be trusted,” Bowman’s text concluded.
While posts included in the lawsuit stop March 17 — three days after a defamation was filed against her in U.S. District Court in Charleston — Bowman’s posts about her continued.
In an April 9 post that tagged Mace, he wrote, “What if this isn’t just politics or drama? What if we’re witnessing a real mental breakdown — public, painful, and unchecked?”
Mace announced her lawsuit against him on X: “Let this be a warning to all. I didn’t come to play,” she wrote.
The suit against Bowman comes a month after he was arrested on unrelated charges of stalking and harassment.
He said those April 8 charges came from his estranged wife, who he claimed he has not spoken to since November 2023. He denied the allegations and continued to criticize her on X after he got out of jail, calling the accusations “weaponized law enforcement.”
Bowman turned himself in at the jail and was released later the same day.
Mace has yet to respond legally to the lawsuit filed in March by Brian Musgrave of Fort Mill.
The case could test the limits of the “speech or debate” clause of the U.S. Constitution, which shields members of Congress from lawsuits for what is said in either chamber. Musgrave contends her posts after the speech aren’t protected.
Rep. Mace sued by 1 of the men she accused of being a sexual predator

Musgrave’s suit came two weeks after his lawyers, Eric Bland and Ronnie Richter, warned Mace in a letter to either reveal evidence of the allegations, apologize or prepare to be sued.
Mace has never responded directly to the lawsuit, even to reporters. Instead, she’s repeatedly referred questions back to her House speech.
“She has been uncharacteristically quiet (about the lawsuit) for a woman who isn’t afraid to get in front of the microphone,” Bland told the SC Daily Gazette on Monday.
The lawsuits loom as Mace mulls a run for governor. Mace hasn’t officially announced but it’s widely expected that she’s going to be part of a crowded field vying for the GOP nomination.
Gov. Henry McMaster, who’s already the state’s oldest and longest-serving elected governor, can’t seek another term.
Others expected to run include Attorney General Alan Wilson and Lt. Gov. Pam Evette.
Mace has taken jabs at both on social media. U.S. Rep. Ralph Norman, as well as state Sens. Josh Kimbrell and Sean Bennett are also considering bids.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Nancy-Mace-4-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-12 19:07:33.610940

Thousands of tons of nuclear waste from the Manhattan Project were dumped there in the 1970s (Theo Welling/Riverfront Times).A bill expanding the state’s ability to find radioactive contamination in the St. Louis region that dates to World War II development of the atomic bomb is on its way to the governor after unanimously clearing the Missouri House Monday.
The measure, which passed unanimously out of the Senate last week, would authorize the Department of Natural Resources to seek a search warrant to conduct investigations on otherwise off-limits government land. The bill also removes a $150,000 annual cap on how much the state can spend on an investigation and changes the rules governing the fund so that unspent money is not moved to another fund.
Money transferred to the fund could not be used for clean-up of any contamination found in the investigation. The waste was spread by federal contractors and should be cleaned up by federal authorities, state Sen. Nick Schroer, a Defiance Republican, said during last week’s debate.
“Let’s give them the data. Let’s see where that goes,” Schroer said. “And if they’re not willing to clean the mess up, I think we’re going to have a lot of lawsuits on our hands. But I think we’re gonna be back in this building, talking about it and if they’re not going to do it, we need to step up and protect our people.”
Records reveal 75 years of government downplaying, ignoring risks of St. Louis radioactive waste

St. Louis has struggled for decades with remnant radioactive waste from the World War II-era effort to build the world’s first atomic bomb.
While the presence of radioactive contamination in suburban St. Louis was known for years, an investigation by The Independent, MuckRock and The Associated Press revealed in 2023 that the federal government and companies handling the waste were aware of the threat to the public long before informing residents.
Uranium was refined in downtown St. Louis for use in the development of the bomb. After the war, it was trucked to St. Louis County, often falling off of trucks along the way. It was dumped at the airport, susceptible to the wind and rain, and contaminated the adjacent Coldwater Creek.
As suburban neighborhoods sprung up along Coldwater Creek, generations of children and families were exposed to the radioactive waste, elevating residents’ risk of certain cancers.
The waste was sold and moved to a site in Hazelwood, also along Coldwater Creek, so that a company could extract valuable metals. Eventually, the remnant radioactive material was dumped in the West Lake Landfill where it remains today.
“This has been a long time coming,” state Rep. Raychel Proudie, a Ferguson Democrat, said of the radioactive waste investigative fund legislation passed Monday. 
Coldwater Creek is being cleaned up by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers while the Environmental Protection Agency is overseeing the cleanup of the West Lake Landfill.
The EPA announced earlier this year that it expanded the area of the West Lake Landfill that requires remediation by 40 acres after discovering contamination was more widespread than the agency previously thought. The cost of the project is now nearly $400 million, up from $229 million.
State Rep. Doug Clemens, a Democrat from St. Ann, said Monday that his community is ravaged by rare cancers that he attributes to the radioactive contamination left behind by development of the atomic bomb. 
“We played our part in World War II,” he said. “This weapons project left waste behind. That waste is incredibly harmful.”

The law will impose an undue burden on the right to vote and is unconstitutionally vague, the complaint filed by a voting rights group alleges. Secretary of State Chuck Gray disagrees. 
The post Wyoming’s new voter registration law spurs legal fight appeared first on WyoFile .","A Wyoming voting rights group filed a federal lawsuit Friday challenging the constitutionality of the state’s new voter registration requirements. 
Set to go into effect in July, the law requires a person to provide proof of state residency and U.S. citizenship when registering to vote. It represented a key priority of the further-right wing of the Wyoming Legislature and Secretary of State Chuck Gray.
The law, however, will impose an undue burden on the right to vote — particularly for women as well as Hispanic, young and low-income voters — and is unconstitutionally vague as written, according to the complaint filed by Equality State Policy Center in the U.S. District Court for Wyoming. 
“Wyoming has a proud tradition of fair and secure elections, and there is no evidence of non-citizen voting or widespread fraud to justify the harsh new restrictions,” policy center Executive Director Jenny DeSarro said in a statement. 
There have been four convictions of voter fraud in Wyoming since 2000, according to a database created by The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. All four cases involved U.S. citizens. 
Supporters of the new law, including Gray, maintain it is needed to ensure that only Wyoming residents vote in Wyoming elections. In February, the Wyoming Legislature passed House Bill 156, “Proof of voter residency-registration qualifications,” before Gov. Mark Gordon let it become law without his signature.
Gillette Republican and former Wyoming Freedom Caucus Chairman Rep. John Bear was the lead sponsor of the bill. 
“The people of Wyoming overwhelmingly support this no-brainer law, and rightfully expect the attorney general to vigorously defend it in court,” the Freedom Caucus posted Monday on Facebook.  
The suit names Gray and each of the state’s 23 county clerks in their official capacities as defendants. 
“Proof of citizenship and proof of residency are common sense, conservative measures pivotal to election integrity, which is why house Bill 156 was the number one priority of our conservative election integrity agenda during the 2025 Legislative Session,” Gray said in a press release.
“I will be vigorously defending Wyoming’s proof of citizenship and residency requirements. We will fight this lawsuit and the false claims in it. And we will win.”

The law specifies what documents provide proof of residency and citizenship, but leaves the secretary of state’s office to iron out the technicalities through the rulemaking process. That requires a public comment period, which is currently open. 
Undue burden
In many instances, a valid Wyoming driver’s license will suffice for proof of identity, residency and U.S. citizenship under the new law. Under the rules now being proposed by Gray, those documents will work so long as they list a Wyoming address. 
But the process won’t be so simple for other voters, the complaint argues. 
“This is particularly true for young, low-income, and already underrepresented voters,” the suit states. “Many more do not have documents that match their current name—including women who changed their names after marriage.” 
And obtaining such documentation will “require navigating a labyrinth of bureaucracy, all with attendant costs and delays, while election day draws nearer.”
Others still, the complaint argues, won’t realize they need such documentation “until it is too late and will be disenfranchised altogether.”
The suit points to voters who may think they are still registered despite “Wyoming’s uniquely aggressive voter list maintenance.” 
Around this time last year, for example, more than 83,000 Wyoming registered voters were purged for not having voted in the most recent election — accounting for a roughly 28% drop in the state’s registered voters. 
Plus, there may be added confusion since the state “allows a much wider range of documents to prove identity to satisfy its voter ID law” as compared to its new proof of residency and citizenship laws, “including student IDs, Medicaid insurance card, even Wyoming concealed firearm permits,” according to the complaint.

Altogether, the new law “favors people who have lived in the same place, with the name they were given at birth, and have a safe and stable place to store their sensitive documents,” the plaintiffs argue. 
“But many citizens, who are no less entitled to vote, do not enjoy these conditions.” 
Constitutional vagueness 
The plaintiffs also argue the new law is unconstitutionally vague as written, which was a concern shared by Gordon when he allowed the bill to become law without his signature. 
In particular, Gordon pointed to a section of the new law that instructs county clerks to accept a prospective voter’s proof of citizenship so long as it does not contain “any indication” that the person is not a U.S. citizen. 
“This standard may be difficult for clerks to administer, as it is unclear and perhaps awkward for our county clerks to consistently apply with any degree of certainty,” Gordon wrote in a letter explaining his decision not to sign the bill. 
The lawsuit makes a similar point. 
Such a standard “both fails to allow persons of ordinary intelligence to anticipate how the law will be enforced and invites arbitrary enforcement, it is void for vagueness,” the complaint states. 
The lawsuit also points to other states that have attempted to add proof of residency and citizenship requirements to the voter registration process, including Arizona, Kansas and New Hampshire. 
“Other states have tried to impose similar restrictions, and their experience proves that the real effect of the [new law’s] requirements will not be to safeguard Wyoming’s elections from noncitizen voting — a problem that does not exist,” the complaint states. “Instead, the new restrictions will exclude citizens from the electoral process.”
The case has been assigned to U.S. District Judge Scott Skavdahl, according to the case docket.

Ryan Zinke speaks at a press conference announcing the launch of the bipartisan Public Lands Caucus, while Montana Rep. Troy Downing listens. (Courtesy photo)Montana U.S. Rep Ryan Zinke, a Republican, joined with Rep. Gabe Vasquez, D-NewMexico, to launch a new bipartisan congressional coalition focused on conserving America’s public lands and expanding access to natural resources for all Americans. 
At a press conference in Washington D.C. last week, Zinke announced the launch of the Public Lands Caucus, which he will co-chair with Vazquez, comprising 14 members of the U.S. House representing districts across country, but heavily centered in the West. 
“Our public lands is not a Republican or a Democrat issue. It’s an American issue, and we should use it in that context of being red, white and blue,” Zinke said during the press conference announcing the caucus’ formation. “It’s important that we talk about better management to preserve and defend why we live in the West and why America’s greatest idea should be preserved and defended.”
Zinke was the former Secretary of the Interior during Donald Trump’s first administration before resigning amid a series of ethics investigations. 
The caucus’ goal is to bring lawmakers together to advance “practical, consensus-driven public lands policy that conserves national resources while supporting recreation, local economies and public access,” according to a press release from Zinke’s office. 
“Make no mistake, our public lands are this nation’s great equalizer. On the water, on the land or in the back country, we all benefit equally from the foundations laid by great conservation leaders like Aldo Leopold and Teddy Roosevelt,” Vasquez said during the press conference. “Public lands and public access to our forests, rivers, grasslands and deserts are a unique American experience that we must continue to fight for and that we cannot take for granted. They also help support a multi billion dollar industry, an outdoor recreation that powers rural communities, connects Americans to their history and to their heritage, and allows us to pass on our traditions to the next generation.”
In addition to the two founding caucus chairs, the Public Lands Caucus includes representatives from Michigan, Idaho, California, North Carolina, Colorado, Virginia, Washington, Nevada, Arizona and Montana. 
Rep. Troy Downing, a freshman congressman representing Montana’s eastern district, told reporters at the press event that “100%” of Montana’s representatives supported the idea. Downing referenced his time serving on the Montana Land Board while he was the State Auditor, a five-member board that managed 5.5 million acres of state land, where he helped manage lands by “sustained yield,” to preserve them for generations.
“In Montana, public lands, public land access, hiking, hunting, fishing are incredibly important to us. You could say it’s in our veins, making sure that we are being stewards of these incredible assets,” Downing said. “But that’s not just Montana. That’s not just the western states. It’s not a partisan issue. I don’t care what side of the aisle you come from, or if you come from neither side of the aisle. You care about this. You understand.”
Many conservation-focused groups expressed their support of the new coalition, including Trout Unlimited, Ducks Unlimited, Backcountry Hunters & Anglers, and Western Landowners Alliance.
Public lands have become a political flashpoint in recent months as the  Trump administration has promoted the idea that federal lands are part of the nation’s “balance sheet” and could be utilized to help pay off the national debt. 
In early April, when the U.S. Senate passed its federal budget, Montana’s two Republican Senators, Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy, bucked their party in a vote for an amendment which would have prevented the sale of public lands to lower the federal deficit, though the amendment failed 49-51. 
Showing that all of Montana’s congressional delegation shares a similar idea on keeping public lands public, Zinke reintroduced his “Public Lands in Public Hands Act,” earlier this year with Vasquez, a bill which would ban the U.S. Department of Interior and the U.S. Forest service from selling or transferring “most public land,” except in specific circumstances. 
And in Helena, a resolution which would have supported a Utah lawsuit against the federal government seeking to transfer federal land to the state, was defeated in the Legislature on a 33-66 vote. 
But the issue continues to gain traction. 
Late Tuesday night, the day before Zinke announced the launch of the new caucus, House Republicans on the Natural Resource Committee approved an amendment that authorizes the sale of thousands of acres of federal land in Nevada and Utah. 
The proposed sales and exchanges are part of a large budget reconciliation bill that will require a vote before the full House. 
The lands involved are almost all near the urban areas of Las Vegas, Reno and St. George, Utah, and appear aimed at allowing for affordable housing developments on Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management land. 
The move has drawn opposition from Democrats and conservation groups. 
Tracy Stone-Manning, a Montanan who used to lead the BLM under the Biden administration and is now president of the Wilderness Society, told NPR that the move was the start of a bigger push to transfer federal lands. 
“Congress is considering selling off our public lands to pay for tax cuts to the wealthy,” Stone-Manning said. “What we’re seeing from this administration is no balance at all.”
During the Public Lands Caucus press conference, reporters asked Zinke about the committee actions, and Zinke responded, according to Politico, by saying he would make it clear to House leadership that he opposed the idea. 
“I strongly don’t believe (land sales) should be in the reconciliation bill,” Zinke said, though he did not explicitly say that he would oppose the entire reconciliation package as it stands.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/831A4243-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-12 19:07:33.610940

The possible breakthrough is laid out in newly published research in Nature Communications. The study, “Epitope-Optimized Vaccine Elicits Cross-Species Immunity Against Influenza A Virus,” describes a vaccine that protects against H1N1 swine flu and can also protect against influenza in birds and humans.

“This research sets the stage for developing universal influenza vaccines so people won’t have to go to the doctor and get a flu shot every year,” said Eric Weaver, director of the Nebraska Center for Virology who led the Nebraska research team. “This vaccine will protect you against the different strains that are out there.”
 Named after computer software

According to a UNL news release, swine vaccinated with immunogens designed in Weaver’s lab showed no signs of illness after being exposed to a commonly circulating flu strain. They developed antibodies against multiple viruses from several decades and several species and maintained their immune response throughout the six-month study.
Based on the study results, Weaver said that immunity in pigs could last at least a decade. “We hope that would translate into humans,” he said. 
Called the Epigraph vaccine, after computer software used to design it, the vaccine significantly outperformed a commercial vaccine used by the pork industry and a “wild type” vaccine based on naturally occurring strains with similar immunogens.
Both the National Institutes of Health and the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture supported the study.
The newly published findings confirm previous research that showed the vaccine design protected against the H3 influenza subtype. Weaver said the new results are particularly encouraging because H1 swine flu variants are detected twice as often as H3 variants and have nearly three times more genetic diversity.
“This H1 subtype is the largest and most genetically diverse subtype in pigs,” Weaver said. “It’s also among the viruses that jumped from swine to humans to cause the 2009 swine flu pandemic. It’s a big target and one of the harder targets to hit.” 
The UNL team noted that influenza A infects as much as 15% of the human population and causes thousands of deaths annually. Today’s vaccines often lack long-lasting protection because of the genetic diversity and rapid mutation of proteins that help form the virus.

Another challenge in controlling influenza, according to UNL, is that it infects multiple species, including birds, swine, horses and dogs, along with humans. “Swine often act as a mixing vessel because they are susceptible to human and bird flu variants, contributing to the evolution of novel forms of the disease that can be transmitted back to humans,” the statement said.
UNL offered as an example the 2009 swine flu pandemic, transmitted from hogs to humans. About 25% of the human population was infected with the new variant, and more than a half million people died from it in the first year, according to some estimates. 
“If we can prevent influenza in swine, we can also prevent zoonotic jumps from avians through swine to humans, or from swine directly to humans,” Weaver said. “We could basically cut off this evolutionary arsenal or advantage that the virus has.”
A goal, he said, is to produce a pediatric vaccine that will protect people throughout most of their life — and, ultimately, eradicate influenza. 
 Flu strains back to 1930

Weaver’s vaccine strategy, which has been patented, used the Epigraph software to study genetic codes of more than 6,000 strains of influenza virus from 1930 to 2021 and create a vaccine that represents their most common epitopes. 
Epitopes were described as regions on a virus that trigger the immune system to produce antibodies to neutralize the virus and to send T-cells to destroy infected cells. Also according to the news release, some epitopes disappear as the virus evolves. The computer-derived Epigraph strategy increases the likelihood that the vaccine contains the epitopes needed to trigger an immune response and prevent illness. 
“Our ability to understand how viruses evolve has increased exponentially in the past 20 years,” Weaver said. “What I see on the horizon is a third wave, where we go from good vaccines to universal, lifelong vaccines.” 
The UNL team now plans to test a vaccine to protect against both H1 and H3 strains of influenza. 
Weaver said that he doesn’t have a projection yet for when the longer-lasting vaccine for humans might be available, but said his team is in discussions with a biotechnology company for that purpose.

Brad Little touted tax cuts and public school funding as key takeaways from this year’s legislative session.
In a news conference on Monday in Nampa, Little reflected on the outcome of the 2025 session of the Idaho Legislature and ongoing federal cuts — by the executive branch and proposed by Congress.
With the over $400 million in tax cuts Little signed into law this year, the governor said he and state lawmakers have cut taxes by $6 billion in the six years he’s been in office. 
“Idaho has proven that we can give back consistently while taking care of the needs of a very fast growing state,” Little told reporters.
He also said since he became Idaho’s governor, the state’s support for public schools has boosted 60% — from a $1.7 billion budget to now over $2.6 billion. 
Early on in the legislative session, Little expressed concern about the high amount of tax cuts proposed by the Legislature — which were well over the $100 million the governor proposed in his budget. 
Asked how he felt about the state’s finances after signing the tax cut bills, Little pointed to the future. 
“I remember the speaker saying, ‘Oh yeah, we can afford it.’ And he’s exactly right. We can afford the 400 million. But the issue is, where are you in year two, year three, year four?” he said.
“Right now, we’re still about the fastest growing state. And if we can continue, we’re going to be fine. But I just don’t think most Idahoans think we ought to bet on being the fastest growing state forever,” Little continued.

 Idaho Gov. Little reflects on signing private school tax credit bill

In his State of the State address at the start of the legislative session, Little proposed putting $50 million to allow tax dollars to be spent on private schools. But later in the legislative session, he said he worried the private school tax credit bill — which proposed that same amount of funding — didn’t have enough accountability.
Asked why he signed the bill, Little said government oversight of those funds rose to six state tax commission employees amid negotiations. And he said the bill excludes families earning over a certain high income, and overweighs for disadvantaged students.
“Those were all components of what I asked for,” Little said. “I would have done it a little differently. But literally, everything I get from the Legislature, I would have done a little differently. That’s part of our constitutional process.”
 Idaho governor vetoed a medical freedom bill. Then he signed a revised version.

The governor only vetoed one bill from the Idaho Legislature this year: A sweeping “medical freedom” bill that bans requirements for vaccines or any medical treatment as a condition of entering or receiving services from businesses, schools, and state and local governments
In his veto letter, Little said he worried the bill would prevent schools from sending home sick kids. 
Then about a week later, he signed a revised version of the bill that allows schools to send home sick kids. 
Little told reporters Monday that lawmakers fixed his issue with the bill. But asked whether the bill will also block businesses from sending home sick employees or customers, he didn’t seem sure.
“That will obviously be determined,” Little said. “My veto was predicated on what it did for public schools.”
 Idaho Gov. Little heads to Washington, D.C., amid federal budget cut talks in Congress

Little said on Tuesday he’s heading to Washington, D.C., to talk about executive branch federal cuts that affect Idaho — including those by the executive branch that ended grants for the city of Pocatello.
For many of the grants halted or paused, the money is still available, he said. 
“We need to see how the money gets reallocated. There’s a lot of that taking place. I haven’t seen anything that rises to the magnitude that is something that we need to be urgently concerned about,” Little said.
Congress is also debating massive federal cuts to extend tax cuts in what has been dubbed the “big, beautiful bill.” Little said he wonders what’ll be in the bill, and how it impacts Idaho.
“We’re one of the most efficient states,” Little said of Idaho’s management of Medicaid. “And that’s one of the things I’m worried about is they categorically tell all the states ‘We’re going to cut your program by such and such.’”

Jeff Colyer, who is edging closer to filing as a 2026 Republican candidate for governor, chats with former Democratic Gov. Kathleen Sebelius during a ceremony on steps of the Kansas Capitol in 2023. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Former Gov. Jeff Colyer’s campaign for governor accelerated with appointment of a treasurer in advance of filing for the Republican Party’s nomination in 2026.
Colyer, 64, served as Kansas chairman of last year’s campaign by President Donald Trump. He is a former Johnson County member of the Kansas House and Senate who was lieutenant governor on the ticket with GOP Gov. Sam Brownback. Upon Brownback’s resignation to serve in the first Trump administration, Colyer was sworn in as governor in 2018.
Colyer sought a full term as governor but narrowly lost the 2018 primary to Republican Kris Kobach, who was defeated in the general election by Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly. In terms of the 2026 race, Colyer has yet to formally register as a candidate with the secretary of state.
Colyer did announce selection of state Rep. Kyle Hoffman, a Coldwater Republican, as treasurer for his gubernational campaign.
“Kyle is a leading voice for rural Kansas and a great advocate for fiscal responsibility and conservative values,” Colyer said. “He’s going to be a huge asset as we carry our winning message to every county in Kansas.”
Kelly, who followed her defeat of Kobach with a victory over former GOP Attorney General Derek Schmidt in 2022, cannot seek reelection. Colyer was poised to seek the Republican nomination for governor in 2022, but withdrew following a diagnosis of prostate cancer.
Democratic Governors Association spokesman Sam Newton said in a statement Colyer was the “failed right-hand man” to Brownback.
“Besides reminding Kansans of the broken budgets and underfunded public schools of the Brownback era, Colyer’s announcement confirms that the GOP primary field is going to be crowded, chaotic and focused on extreme partisan policies,” Newton said.
Newton said Kansas would be better off with a governor like Kelly who took a middle-of-the-road approach to leadership, balanced the state budget, promoted business investment and ended the state’s sales tax on groceries.
Hoffman, treasurer of Colyer’s campaign, said Colyer was “more than a politician, he is a humanitarian – selflessly serving those in need around the world. He’ll make a great governor.”
Colyer, a surgeon in the Kansas City area who served international medical missions, was the state’s 47th governor from January 2018 to January 2019.
He was lieutenant governor under Brownback from 2011-2018. He was in the Senate from 2009-2011 and the Kansas House from 2007-2009.

(Photo by Shaun Griswold / Source NM)Those who suffered losses in prescribed burns gone awry in New Mexico’s historic 2022 wildfire season are asking the courts to intervene, following what their lawyers say are failures by the federal government and Congress to make victims whole. 
In the spring of 2022, the Cerro Pelado Fire, the Hermits Peak Fire and the Calf Canyon Fire escaped containment lines to become runaway wildfires, all of them first ignited by the United States Forest Service as prescribed burns. The Hermits Peak and Calf Canyon Fires merged in late April of that year and grew into the biggest fire in New Mexico history. 
In total, the fires burned nearly 400,000 acres, and left livelihoods and homes destroyed in their wake. 
Last week, thanks to a federal judge’s intervention, a dozen victims of the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire finally received full compensation, while lawyers representing Cerro Pelado Fire victims recently filed a lawsuit against the United States Forest Service, setting up a difficult battle in federal court. 
In the scar of New Mexico’s largest wildfire, a legal battle is brewing over the cost of suffering

The court has emerged as a last resort for compensation amid ongoing concerns about the distribution of $5.45 billion compensation fund for Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire victims Congress created in late 2022, along with an unsuccessful effort by members of New Mexico’s congressional delegation to create a similar fund for Cerro Pelado Fire victims, lawyers for victims of both fires said in recent interviews.
“Here we are, three years later, after the devastation of the burn scar, my clients finally got their day in court,” Brian Colón, attorney with Singleton Schreiber, a firm representing Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire victims, told Source New Mexico. “They got compensation awarded for the trespass that the federal government conducted when they were negligent three years ago.”
A ‘watershed’ for Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire victims
Federal Judge James Browning took a day and a half last week to listen to testimony from a dozen victims of the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire, who each described in detail the financial cost and also the emotional toll of the federally caused, 534-square-mile wildfire.
One by one, Judge James Browning ordered the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which oversees the fund Congress created, to award them thousands of dollars. The judge stepped in as part of a “judicial review” allowed for in the act Congress passed when the parties cannot agree on an appropriate compensation amount. 
By the time the victims testified in court, FEMA had offered them low or sometimes no money at all for certain categories of losses. Notably, Browning ordered FEMA to provide the victims so-called noneconomic damages, akin to pain and suffering payments, for the emotional hardship the fire caused. FEMA had provided each of them a final payment offer listing “$0” for noneconomic damages.
Even though last week’s hearing involved only a dozen clients, the payments ranging between $9,000 and $330,000 represent a “watershed” moment and a measure of closure in a legal battle pending for more than a year, Colón said. FEMA initially said the law Congress passed only allowed the agency  to pay victims for losses that carry a price tag: burned homes, forgone business revenue and evacuation expenses, for example.
By intervening to hear individual cases, Browning had to evaluate and quantify aspects of victims’ experiences such as their proximity to the fire as it was burning; their anguish as they fled the blaze; and the extent of the “nuisance” and “trespass” the fire represented on their property.
After federal judge’s order, NM fire victims should seek to describe their anguish, lawyer says

Late last year, in a separate, more-sweeping lawsuit, Browning ordered FEMA to begin awarding noneconomic damages, saying in a 99-page ruling that the damages are allowable under New Mexico state law and the law Congress passed.
That order remains pending, and, as with the individual cases Browning ruled on last week, can still be appealed. FEMA and the United States Attorney’s Office, which represents the agency in court, have declined to say whether they plan to appeal. 
While the victims’ lawyers have “no indication what FEMA’s intentions are,” Colón noted that his firm has filed lawsuits on behalf of hundreds of named victims, each of whom could go before Browning in the coming months to seek whatever recourse the judge deems fit to award. 
“We’re gonna put as many of them in front of Judge Browning as he will permit, in whatever timetable he dictates,” Colón said. “And we’re optimistic that he is going to continue dedicating a very substantial amount of time to try and move these cases forward.”
Browning announced in January he intends to retire in February 2026 after 22 years on the bench. 
While the payment of hundreds of millions of dollars in noneconomic damages for all victims who seek them is still pending, the FEMA claims office Congress created is continuing to award compensation for other types of losses. 
According to the latest figures, FEMA has paid 16,966 claims totaling $2.35 billion for things like reforestation, business expenses, damaged property and losses local governments incurred responding to the fire. 
Victims left out due to ‘cover-up’, lawsuit alleges
In enacting the Hermits Peak bill, members of New Mexico’s congressional delegation have said they envisioned the accompanying claims office as a way to swiftly and fairly pay victims of the fire without the need for a costly and time-consuming court battle. 
A new lawsuit alleges a Forest Service “cover up” denied people living within the Cerro Pelado Fire the same opportunity.  
In late April of this year, lawyers representing 20 plaintiffs, including individual property owners and the Jemez Pueblo and Jemez Mountains Electric Cooperative, filed a lawsuit against the Forest Service for the 46,000-acre fire in the Jemez Mountains, alleging that agency was negligent in failing to monitor the area for still-burning embers in the pile of thinned trees and brush it ignited after the snowpack had melted.
The lawsuit also accuses the Forest Service of covering up its failure to monitor the pile by issuing an initial investigation determining the cause of the fire to be “inconclusive.” Moreover, the lawsuit says, the Forest Service only ordered a second investigation that ultimately concluded the wildfire had begun as a “holdover” after a “whistleblower” and others raised issue with its original determination.

“The [Forest Service’s] cover-up of the actual cause and origin of the wildfire resulted in the  victims of the fire being left out of the Hermit’s Peak Calf Canyon Fire Assistance Act,” the lawsuit alleges.
A spokesperson for the Forest Service did not respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit Monday afternoon from Source New Mexico.
Chris Bauman, the plaintiffs’ lawyer with B&D Law Offices, told Source New Mexico on Monday that even after New Mexico Democrats U.S. Rep. Teresa Leger Fernandez and U.S. Sen. Ben Ray Luján sponsored the Cerro Pelado Fire Assistance Act, he never thought the separate bill had much of a chance of delivering compensation like the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire Assistance Act did. 
“We were told by people that know more about how things work in Washington that it was a long shot,” he said. “So really we didn’t have much expectation, but obviously we were hopeful.”
Winning a lawsuit against the federal government is difficult, Bauman said, due to the “discretionary function” exemption to the Federal Tort Claims Act. That exemption prohibits the federal government from being liable if employees acted within the scope of their duties during a harmful act. 
Bauman’s firm needs to prove that the Forest Service employees who lit the fire in January violated a mandatory policy when they failed to notice that the pile of debris they had lit smoldered undetected for months until catching a huge wind gust on April 22, 2022. According to the lawsuit, the burn plan laying out the series of pile burns in the area requires continuous monitoring, especially after the snowpack disappears. 
“So that’s what we’ve tried to highlight in our complaint, is that there were multiple instances where they were required to do things under the burn plan and failed to do so,” he said.
Feds try to skirt responsibility in lawsuit for people who died after state’s biggest wildfire

It’s not clear how much damage the fire caused, in terms of dollars, Bauman said, though he acknowledged it’s far less than the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire. Still, he said, the victims’ only recourse is a lawsuit with a high bar to clear.
“The government will probably file the motion to dismiss, claiming lack of jurisdiction because of the discretionary function defense. We anticipate that will be sort of the first challenge to our case,” he said. “Hopefully we’ll survive that.”
Once the information had emerged that the Cerro Pelado Fire had escaped from a pile burn, the state’s congressional delegation in October 2023  introduced legislation similar to the Hermits Peak bill to compensate victims. It’s been stalled ever since.
Leger Fernandez told Source New Mexico on Monday in an emailed statement that she has not given up on Congress passing the Cerro Pelado Fire Assistance Act and fully compensating those victims like the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire Act aims to do.
“We continue to push for the Cerro Pelado Fire Assistance Act because the communities harmed by that fire deserve justice—just like the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon survivors,” she said. “When Democrats were in the majority, we were able to pass the Hermits Peak legislation because we had leadership in the House, Senate, and White House that prioritized disaster relief. Unfortunately, that’s no longer the case.”
Republicans have refused to advance the Cerro Pelado bill “despite repeated efforts,” she said. She also cited the recent firing of the FEMA administrator a day after he testified that FEMA should still exist.
“It’s clear that the Trump White House isn’t focused on helping disaster survivors,” she said.
“We’re not giving up. We’ll keep fighting to get Cerro Pelado survivors the compensation they deserve.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/IMG_0514-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-12 19:07:33.610940

The program, known as RGGI, established a carbon credit auction for electricity producers in 11 northeast states to pay for the right to emit carbon dioxide. The money received would go to each state for uses, ranging from utility assistance and energy efficiency projects to subsidies for alternative energy.
Gov. Tom Wolf entered the compact in 2022 over the objections of Republican state lawmakers. They raised concerns it would increase electricity prices, hasten the closing of the commonwealth’s remaining coal power plants, and not reduce carbon emissions overall, but simply force them into other states.
In a legal challenge to the program’s constitutionality, GOP leaders in the  House and Senate contended the requirement to buy carbon credits was an impermissible tax. A Commonwealth Court panel of five judges agreed.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
In its decision, the appellate court said that Pennsylvania’s participation in RGGI must be approved through the General Assembly and that the state Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) does not have the authority to impose a tax.
Gov. Josh Shapiro’s administration appealed, with the DEP,  arguing that the commonwealth’s membership in RGGI is authorized by the state’s Air Pollution Control Act (APCA). The law empowers the state to enact rules and regulations to reduce pollution, including establishing fees used to eliminate air emissions.
Several nonprofit citizens rights and environmental groups including Penn Future, the Sierra Club, the Clean Air Council and the Environmental Defense Fund moved to intervene in the appeal. They argue the Commonwealth Court wrongly decided the case because it failed to consider the DEP and Environmental Quality Board’s obligations under the Environmental Rights Amendment (ERA) to the state constitution. The groups also back the DEP’s argument that the agency is empowered to establish fees to enforce the APCA.
Adopted in 1971, the ERA requires the commonwealth to preserve public natural resources for the benefit of all people. It’s considered one of the strongest such constitutional protections in the nation, according to PennFuture.
Since the Commonwealth Court’s decision in 2023, Shapiro has introduced a Pennsylvania-focused alternative to RGGI called the Pennsylvania Climate Emissions Reduction Act (PACER) that he said would leverage the commonwealth’s status as an energy exporter to fund carbon-neutral energy development. 
Sen. Carolyn Comitta (D-Chester) who plans to introduce legislation to establish PACER, said Shapiro’s alternative was developed in collaboration with Republican lawmakers and energy companies. Comitta said the Supreme Court case and RGGI would make the Supreme Court case moot, but GOP lawmakers have said the plan falls short of their goals to reduce energy costs and ensure reliable electricity supplies. 
The Supreme Court will hear arguments in the case at 9:30 a.m. Tuesday in Harrisburg. An audio stream of the proceedings is available on YouTube.

Photo by Michelle Griffith/Minnesota Reformer.Kevin Kinney, auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of St. Paul-Minneapolis, joined Minnesota Catholics Monday at the Capitol, urging state lawmakers to keep a program that allows undocumented people to receive free or discounted health insurance.
“I’m here because of my love for the immigrant brothers and sisters and (because)  we need to continue to reach out and walk with them and help them,” Kinney said at a Capitol press conference. “We need to be able to offer health care to anyone who is here, no matter how they got here, who let them in. Are we going to let them die on the streets? Are we gonna let them suffer? Or are we going to allow them — all of us — the basic health care that we need?”
The bishop’s decision to use his moral megaphone — on the heels of the recent election of Pope Leo XIV, who is set to become a leading American advocate for the world’s poor and dispossessed — arrives at an auspicious time: Legislative leaders and Gov. Tim Walz are making final decisions on a state budget that could fray Minnesota’s relatively robust safety net.
Republicans, who share control of the 67-67 Minnesota House, are against allowing undocumented people to access MinnesotaCare.
The leaders have been meeting daily for over a week behind closed doors to come to a deal on a two-year budget expected to exceed $60 billion. The session ends on May 19, after which Walz would have to call a special legislative session so lawmakers can agree on a budget by June 30. Otherwise the government shuts down on July 1.
MinnesotaCare was created in 1992 to help close the gap in coverage for low-income working families who make more than the income threshold for Medicaid, which is called Medical Assistance in Minnesota.
In 2023, the DFL trifecta expanded the social safety net to include undocumented immigrants, which began on Jan. 1 this year.
Enrollment has surpassed estimates, and Republicans argue undocumented people should be taken off the rolls to save money and discourage people from moving here for coverage.
The Department of Human Services says that its most recent data show that as of April 24, 20,187 undocumented people had enrolled in MinnesotaCare. The program is fee-for-service, meaning the state only pays claims after services are administered.
DHS says it has received 4,306 claims for service, costing Minnesota $3.9 million. This is nearly $1 million over what the state had projected by this date, according to DHS. Some of the undocumented immigrants on MinnesotaCare pay a monthly premium, like other residents who are on the program.
The Minnesota Catholic Conference — the public policy arm of the Catholic Church in Minnesota — lobbied for the creation of MinnesotaCare in the 1990s.
“How do you steward the gift of life if you don’t have access to basic health care? MinnesotaCare is a really comprehensive set of programs and health care benefits, and it’s just really important that low-income people have access to good preventative — not just acute — care,” said Jason Adkins, executive director of the Minnesota Catholic Conference.
Adkins said the MCC has met with Republican leaders on the issue, but they “haven’t seen a lot of policy movement.”
U.S. House Republicans released a proposal this week that would cut Medicaid coverage for millions of low-income Americans. The bill would also target states that allow Medicaid coverage for undocumented immigrants by reducing federal funding for all childless adults without disabilities to 80% from 90%. It’s unclear if this would impact MinnesotaCare, which is not part of Medicaid.
Kinney said that the immigration system needs to be fixed at the federal level, but until then, Minnesotans can take steps to ensure all people, regardless of their immigration status, can have access to health care. He encouraged legislative leaders to think of creative solutions to continue to fund MinnesotaCare for undocumented people.

The Indianapolis hearing was the second and final opportunity for the board to openly weigh Ritchie’s plea for a commuted sentence.
Ritchie, who has been on Indiana’s death row since his 2002 conviction, is set to be executed May 20 for the 2000 killing. 
The five-member panel heard from a remorseful Ritchie at the Indiana State Prison last week, but the condemned man did not appear at the latest hearing in Indianapolis. Instead, the session was reserved for public comments from those who oppose — and support — clemency.

The governor, in tandem with the parole board, can elect to commute a death sentence to life imprisonment.
Nine of Toney’s family members, friends and fellow police officers at the Beech Grove Police Department who spoke at Monday’s hearing were resolute: “Deny clemency.”
“It’s time. We’re all tired,” said Dee Dee Horen, Toney’s widow. “It is time for this chapter of my story, our story, to be closed. It’s time for us to remember Bill, to remember Bill’s life, and not his death.”
The officer was also survived by two daughters. Neither spoke at the hearing.
Horen, a Beech Grove elementary school teacher, rejected Ritchie’s claims that a difficult childhood fueled his actions.
“I’ve taught 100 Benjamin Ritchies, and they had difficult upbringings, and they had obstacles in their lives, and to my knowledge, none of them made this decision — none of them made a choice to be a criminal and kill a police officer,” Horen said. “We all have choices in our life, and he chose to kill Bill.”
She called on the board, and the governor, to follow through with Ritchie’s execution “because we believe in a system that honors its protectors and punishes those who choose to destroy our peaceful towns.”
The board will make a recommendation, but a final clemency decision about whether to commute Ritchie’s death sentence to life in prison without parole will ultimately be up to Gov. Mike Braun. There’s no timetable for the board, or Braun, to issue opinions.
A ‘cowardly ambush’
More than 20 law enforcement officers — including a dozen from the Beech Grove Police Department — attended Monday’s hearing.
Per court documents, the underlying crime began as a police pursuit of a stolen van on Sept. 29, 2000. Toney later pursued Ritchie on foot. Ritchie ultimately fired four shots at the police officer, who did not survive the shooting.
Ritchie said that on the night of the incident, he was with a group trying to steal rims from car dealers. He said the subsequent police chase “sped out of control” and ended in a “shootout.”
The inmate said he regretted his “horrible actions,” which Ritchie and his legal team have attributed to an unstable upbringing and lifelong brain damage from fetal alcohol exposure.
‘I am so sorry’: Clemency hearings begin for Indiana death row inmate Benjamin Ritchie

Beech Grove Deputy Police Chief Robert Mercuri, who was a sergeant and supervisor in charge on the night of the killing, was involved in the initial vehicle pursuit and was among the first to render aid after the shooting. 
“I found my friend Bill lying on the ground in that backyard. I attempted CPR. I rode with him in an ambulance to Methodist Hospital, praying the entire time that he would survive,” Mercuri recalled. 
He said Toney had volunteered to work an extra shift to help a colleague that night. Mercuri called Toney “a rising star in law enforcement” who “brought energy and optimism” to the job and was a role model to other officers.
He refuted Ritchie’s claims of a shootout, emphasizing that Toney was targeted by “a cowardly ambush.”
Ritchie hid in bushes and fired the first shot at Toney while the officer was clearing a fence, Mercuri told the parole board. He said the inmate still “does not own up to his dishonorable act.”
“Benjamin Ritchie continues to put out there that he was just some kid, and and the truth is that he is a conniving, manipulating predator who prays on the weak, good and unsuspecting people of the world,” Mercuri said, adding that he “would victimize the weaker prisoners and create a bunch of Ben Ritchies, emboldened by the fact that he played the system,” if granted clemency and allowed to enter the general prison population.
Tyler Banks, with the Indiana Attorney General’s Office, additionally argued against clemency based on Ritchie’s repeated violent behavior in prison. He pointed to Ritchie’s 43 conduct reports since 2001 that stemmed from assaults of officers and other inmates, in addition to threats, intimidation, disorderly conduct and other “disruptive” incidents.
“He’s tried to convince you that if you commute his sentence, he will not be a problem, but an asset, for those other offenders in general population,” Banks said. “His conduct in the highly-structured environment of death row proves otherwise.”
Although Ritchie claims his earlier defense lawyers were “ineffective” because they failed to present his FASD diagnosis at trial or in post-conviction proceedings, Banks maintained the trial record already contained extensive evidence of prenatal substance abuse.
“All that Ritchie has that is new or different is simply a new name for a diagnosis,” Banks said.
A ‘hidden disability’
But an hour-long presentation from a mental health expert argued otherwise, emphasizing that Ritchie suffers from a “hidden disability” that went undiagnosed for most of his life and his condition has only recently been investigated.
Dr. Megan Carter, a forensic psychologist and expert in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), told the board she diagnosed Ritchie with pFAS, or partial FAS. Carter noted in her evaluation of Ritchie that he has 15 of the 23 deficits of the disorder. 
She said he especially struggles with speech, emotional regulation, academics and social skills.

“People think that is a childhood disorder, but it’s really a lifelong disorder,” Carter said. “It’s often known as a hidden disability because … you can’t see the problem. But you see it in their behaviors and their emotions.” 
The inmate’s current counsel said prior lawyers “completely failed to investigate the source of Ritchie’s serious brain damage” because they “erroneously believed” he lacked the facial features that are commonly associated with prenatal alcohol exposure — like small eyes, a flat midface and thin upper lip.
Carter said less than 10% of individuals with FASD exhibit those facial features, though.
FASD inhibits a person’s ability to process information quickly and understand consequences, and also impacts their decision-making skills, emotional regulation and abstract thinking, Carter explained. She held that people with FASD, “in a lot of ways,” have brains similar to toddlers.
The psychologist cited evidence that Ritchie’s birth mother drank heavily during pregnancy and was neglectful during his early childhood. In addition to the FASD diagnosis, testing of Ritchie’s baby teeth revealed significant lead exposure.
Carter said Ritchie’s neurodevelopmental condition left him especially vulnerable to reacting violently under stress.
“When he gets into stressful situations, like this was on that night, his frontal lobes — which are already not functioning very well — kind of go offline, and he goes more into a primitive, survival mode,” Carter said. “That means that he’s not thinking about consequences. He’s not considering other people’s perspectives. He’s just simply reacting.”

She noted that in “emotionally-charged situations,” those with FASD “tend to be more reactive” due to a faster and increased release of cortisone and other stress hormones.
“The situation was unique. It was different than he’d ever experienced,” Carter continued. “It was unpredictable, emotionally-charged, unstructured and unsupported, and that’s when individuals with FASD have the most trouble conforming their behavior to what’s expected.”
The expert additionally maintained that an earlier diagnosis and “external supports” in school and at home might have changed the course of Ritchie’s life. Had he been diagnosed with FASD before age six, Ritchie would’ve had a “higher chance” of staying out of the criminal justice system.
“A lot of people have had really terrible childhoods, right? They were beaten, they were neglected, and they don’t go on to commit crimes. But they don’t have a lot of behavior dysregulation. They don’t have severe deficits like (Ritchie),” Carter said. “We’re not going to see the neurocognitive scores that we see in FASD. … I think those things are important to acknowledge as contributions to his brain development and his social development.”
John Mast, a former special education teacher who worked with Ritchie for more than three years starting in the early 1990s, further described him as a student with a “severe emotional handicap” that “affected all aspects of life,” including in the classroom.
Mast recalled Ritchie’s “violent and aggressive” outbursts in response to “minor,” everyday disruptions like a lost pencil or school bus delay.
“Given my experiences with Ben as an adolescent, this situation was the exact type of situation where those severe emotional disabilities became fully evident and engaged,” he said. “He did not have the emotional tools, he did not have the skills, to make a different and acceptable decision.”
Indiana death row inmate seeks SCOTUS intervention weeks before scheduled execution

Members of the parole board asked about Ritchie’s psychological profile, his ability to understand consequences, and whether new neuroimaging might shed more light on his condition and his thinking at the time of his crime.
Ritchie’s attorney, Steve Schutte, said “those are legitimate questions” that the defense team wanted to explore before the Indiana Supreme Court, but the justices denied requests for a new hearing. The inmate’s lawyers are now seeking a last-minute execution pause from the U.S. Supreme Court.
“The governor and this board now have to make a decision without the kind of process we’d usually rely on,” Schutte said.
“(Ritchie) is not looking for sympathy,” Schutte added. “What he’s asked is to be allowed to spend the rest of his life in prison.”
Neither the governor nor any current members of the state’s parole board have deliberated a death penalty clemency case before Ritchie’s.
Three clemencies have been granted in Indiana since 1976.
The most recent was in 2005, when then-Gov. Mitch Daniels commuted the death sentence for Arthur Baird, who killed his pregnant wife and her parents in 1985. Although the parole board denied his petition for clemency, Daniels granted Baird clemency one day before the scheduled execution, in part citing questions about Baird’s sanity.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)It’s been a disappointing year for Minnesota’s parents of young children and the advocates hoping to secure more investments in child care. 
Across the state, child care centers are shutting down, exacerbating the shortage of day care spots. Meanwhile, the cost of care continues to climb; only Washington, D.C. and Massachusetts have higher average infant child care prices. Child care workers in Minnesota earn on average just over $15 per hour, often less than they could make at Target or a restaurant.
Now, a plan by President Donald Trump to cut funding is threatening the already-precarious child care system.
Teachers and advocates for Head Start, the federal program that provides subsidized child care to low-income families, gathered at the Capitol Monday — with hundreds of preschoolers in tow — to protest proposed Head Start cuts and the lack of state action to counteract them.
More than 12,000 Minnesota children could lose their care if Head Start funding expires at the end of September. 
Advocates with Kids Count On Us — a child care advocacy group affiliated with the religious organization ISAIAH — rallied for state and federal spending on child care in conjunction with National Day Without Child Care events around the country. 
“Minnesota needs to be bold about raising revenue to fund the things we need, like a fully funded child care system, so it is affordable and accessible for all families,” said Reneé Olsen, who runs child care centers in Barnum and Willow River.
The threats to Head Start come on the heels of an especially difficult six months for child care. 
Although Gov. Tim Walz says he wants to make Minnesota “the best state to raise a family” — and Vice President J.D. Vance fancies himself a beacon of pro-family public policy — neither the state nor the federal government plan major investments in child care anytime soon. 
In Washington, Republicans are rolling back programs that provide child care to low income families, at the behest of Vance and the world’s richest man, presidential advisor/donor Elon Musk. Vance co-authored an essay in the Wall Street Journal in 2021 arguing against child care subsidies; instead, the government should reward parents who choose to stay at home and raise children, Vance wrote. 
More than 80% of stay-at-home parents are women. 
And in Minnesota, there’s not money in the state coffers this year to make up for the potential loss of federal funds. The state is already spending more money than it’s bringing in, and with tax increases off the table for Republicans, Walz and legislative leaders are looking for ways to cut spending. 
November’s budget forecast, which predicted a $5 billion deficit in 2027 and 2028 if current spending trends continue, ended hopes of wide-scale state-level investment in child care before the legislative session began.
State Sen. Grant Hauschild, DFL-Hermantown, said a tax on social media companies, which was included in the Senate’s recently released tax bill, could help pay for investments in child care. But in the House, which is tied 67-67, Republicans have vowed to vote against any tax increase.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MG_8937-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-05-12 18:10:04.417984

Dan McKee, right, are at odds on whether cabinet members should get raises this year. (Photos by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)Gov. Dan McKee and House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi have rarely, if ever, butted heads in their four years leading the executive and legislative branches.
That might be about to change.
The Rhode Island House of Representatives is slated to vote at 4 p.m. Tuesday on a resolution rejecting McKee’s proposal to raise salaries for 11 of his department heads. 
If approved by both chambers before the April 18 deadline, the veto would mark the first instance of the legislature exercising its legal power to reject the executive’s annual cabinet raises.
McKee wants to give raises to 11 state department heads. Not so fast, Shekarchi says.

McKee insists the annual pay bumps are necessary to attract and retain top workers to the state, matching other state government jobs and the private industry.
“When the Governor came into office, many cabinet salaries had fallen behind industry standards, failed to keep up with inflation, and in some cases, were lower than the salaries of other department staff—making it difficult to recruit from out of state or promote from within.,” Olivia DaRocha, a McKee spokesperson, said in a statement Monday, 
Shekarchi, who as House Speaker has final say over the state’s annual budget, says it’s not the time to dole out raises.
“Given the current challenging budget outlook, as well as the tremendous uncertainty in Washington, the House members strongly feel we must reject these requested raises,” Shekarchi, a Warwick Democrat, said in a statement Monday afternoon. “This is no reflection on the job performance of the Cabinet members.”



The House resolution has nine co-sponsors, including House Minority Leader Mike Chippendale, a Foster Republican; House Majority Leader Christopher Blazejewski, a Providence Democrat; House Finance Chairman Martin Abney, a Newport Democrat; and the chamber’s lone independent, Rep. Jon Brien of Woonsocket.
The annual authorization for the state’s executive to raise department heads’ pay each April is typically met with passive approval by the Rhode Island General Assembly. Under state law, the governor’s proposed cabinet raises automatically take effect within 30 days unless both chambers take formal action to reject them through a joint, concurrent resolution. 
The Senate has not yet scheduled a vote to stop the raises as of Monday; its leadership leadership is still discussing the resolution, and has not decided whether to take action, Greg Paré, a Senate spokesperson said. 
In 2022, McKee walked back his initial salary increases, agreeing to spread out pay bumps over two years in response to concerns from lawmakers. In 2013, former Gov. Lincoln Chafee in 2013 withdrew his proposed 6% raises for cabinet heads due to concern from legislative leaders of both parties, according to news reports.
But there’s no record of the legislature ever taking formal action to reject proposed cabinet raises, Larry Berman, a spokesperson for Shekarchi, said previously.
When McKee rolled out raises for 11 cabinet members in March, Shekarchi appeared caught off-guard, telling WPRO in a March 24 interview that he found out about the proposed salary hikes by reading a Providence Journal story published days earlier. Shekarchi expressed reservations about doling out raises given the state’s forecasted budget deficit. McKee stood firm.
McKee’s proposal includes 5% raises for nine cabinet heads, along with a 2% raise for Rhode Island Department of Transportation Director Peter Alviti Jr., and a 0.5% bump for Col. Darnell Weaver, Rhode Island State Police superintendent and director of the public safety department. 
The proposed increases, combined, would cost an additional $82,000 combined.
DaRocha described the raises as “modest” and “fiscally responsible.” 
On Friday,  state budget crunchers adopted revised revenue forecasts predicting an $80 million boost to state coffers in the current year and the upcoming one.

An extra $60.7 million is now expected to flow into state coffers by June 30 under new estimates adopted by state budget crunchers Friday. The rosy conclusion to the biannual Revenue and Caseload Estimating Conference also projected $19.3 million more revenue for fiscal 2026.
The combined $80 million projected revenue increase for this year and next shaves nearly one-third off the expected $250 million budget deficit. Which leaves lawmakers with a $170 million spending gap to close — not insignificant, especially against the backdrop of potentially devastating federal funding cuts and warnings of a “recession-adjacent” economic slowdown. 
Indeed, House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi’s reaction to the updated revenue numbers Friday was not exactly celebratory. “The revenue results preview the effects of the weakening US economy linked to turmoil in Washington, DC,” Shekarchi, a Warwick Democrat, said in a statement. “Any short-term positive news is overshadowed by the magnitude of that uncertainty and the many related or unsolved budget issues.”
Senate President Valarie Lawson, an East Providence Democrat, and Senate Finance Chairman Lou DiPalma, a Middletown Democrat, also referenced the uncertainty of federal funding in a joint statement reacting to the updated state revenue estimates.
“We remain committed to passing a balanced, responsible budget in time for the state’s new fiscal year, which begins on July 1, and if subsequent developments in Washington necessitate additional action, we will be prepared to address that at the appropriate time,” they said Friday.
Yet the latest state forecasts suggest revenue is rising across a wide array of tax sources. Personal income taxes, which account for one-third of the state’s $5.6 billion annual revenue forecast, are now expected to come in $37.1 million higher by June 30, with an extra $10.1 million in fiscal 2026. The state is also poised to bring in more money through lottery taxes (up $15.4 million over the next two years combined) along with taxes on public utilities, insurance companies, and cigarettes.
These gains will be partially offset by less-than-expected income from sales and use taxes, trimmed by $22 million in fiscal 2025, and down another $37.1 million in fiscal 2026. The state also won’t be generating as much revenue from taxes on bank income; the expected $12.3 million fiscal 2025 revenue from financial institutions taxes is one-third of the $39.5 million forecast six months ago. 
In response to state budget analysts, the Rhode Island Division of Taxation said it initially thought additional taxes paid in 2023 reflected an increased tax liability for 2024, when in fact the elevated 2023 returns were the result of overpayments.
How much of the loss in expected bank tax revenue reflects a change to state tax code enacted by lawmakers in June at the request of Citizens Bank was not immediately available. The controversial tax rewrite, which took effect Jan. 1, was expected to reduce fiscal 2025 revenue by $7 million, rising to $15 million for the full fiscal 2026 year, based on the lower tax bill for Citizens.

Clayton Airport (City of Wolf Point photo)Federal spending cuts could be coming to rural airports across the country, with a national program utilized by seven Montana airports facing a $300 million downturn.
In early May, Russell Vought, Director of the United States Office of Management and Budget, sent a letter detailing federal cuts the executive branch wants to make in the fiscal year 2026 budget.
The letter included cutting $308 million from the Essential Air Service, or EAS, a program that directs federal money to air carriers operating in rural environments. 
“The EAS program funnels taxpayer dollars to airlines to subsidize half-empty flights from airports that are within easy commuting distance from each other, while also failing to effectively provide assistance to most rural air travelers,” the document reads.
It is unclear what impact any cuts would have on Montana, but the proposal would effectively halve the program’s budget. Montana has seven airports that receive money through EAS — Butte, West Yellowstone, Glasgow, Glendive, Havre, Sidney and Wolf Point. 
Five of those — Glasgow, Glendive, Havre, Sidney and Wolf Point — are run through Cape Air and the federal funding subsidizes direct flights to Billings.
Montana has a group dedicated to EAS, helmed by Walt McNutt, the state’s EAS Task Force Chairman. Along with working with elected officials, the task force is also part of the contract process with airlines like Cape Air, which inked a four-year contract with the five airports doing Billings runs in 2023. The four-year deal with those five airports totals about $75 million.
McNutt has seen attempted cuts to the service before, which haven’t always come to fruition.
“I could have had a heart attack probably 10 times in 30 years over it if I let myself,” McNutt said to the Daily Montanan. “There’s going to be a lot of dialogue, a lot of information. You know, unfortunately, you probably had a Senator or a Representative get on an EAS flight that was half full and go berserk.
“When they do the final analysis of it, really looking at the facts and the boardings in the service, a lot of minds get changed pretty quickly.”
The four members of Montana’s Congressional Delegation did not return a request for comment. All four of Montana’s delegations are Republican.
McNutt, Dawson Airport Manager Craig Hostetler and Sidney Airport Manager Ryan Huotari all pointed to one of the main benefits of the program, connecting people with larger cities that don’t have a lot of options to get there.
It’s a problem public transportation advocates pointed to repeatedly during the 2025 Legislative session.
“We’re kind of an older community, and a lot of med flights,” Hostetler said. “People are using it to get to Billings in order to take care of the medicals and such. A lot of people use it for connecting flights, because Billings is a small hub and we can get on the bigger airlines there. So it gets used by a variety of different people.”
According to the Federal Aviation Administration, Montana had 2.87 million “enplanements,” an aviation term meaning a passenger boarding a plane, in 2023.
About 2.5 million of those boardings came from airports in Bozeman, Missoula, Kalispell, and Billings. Bozeman led the way with 1.2 million.
Butte and West Yellowstone received about $2.5 million combined through the EAS program in 2023 for SkyWest to operate flights to Denver and Salt Lake City out of both airports.
West Yellowstone had 8,750 passengers in 2023, an increase of 19.11% more than the previous year. Butte had slightly more than 16,000 passengers in 2023.
Sidney had 8,000 boardings — a 22% increase more than 2022 — with Wolf Point, Havre and Glasgow each having around 3,000 boardings. Glendive had 2,177 boardings in 2023.
“It’s vital,” McNutt said. “We don’t have an interstate, we don’t have a bus, we don’t have a train, we don’t have anything in eastern Montana except the airlines.”

(Courtesy of New Jersey Governor's Office)The Louisiana House of Representatives leadership added money to its state budget proposal to avoid a public school teacher pay cut that was expected after a March constitutional failed to pass. 
The House Appropriations Committee approved a budget plan Monday that contains $198 million to cover stipends for K-12 school teachers and school support staff. They are in line to receive $2,000 and $1,000, respectively, in the 2025-26 academic year. 
House leaders found the money by delaying $92 million worth of government acquisitions, including the purchase of new state vehicles and equipment, for another year. Legislators also proposed paying off retirement debt for Louisiana State Police troopers early, resulting in an additional $25.5 million in savings that would be used to cover the teacher stipends. 
House leadership will also sideline a “high-dosage” tutoring program for public school students that was put in place after the COVID-19 pandemic to find another $30 million for the stipend. 
Their strategy also relies on a temporary state government hiring freeze and the elimination of state employee “work from home” benefits to produce at least $20 million in savings. 
The Louisiana Department of Health would also lose $26.3 million in state funding under the House leadership plan. These savings will be achieved, in part, by removing people from Medicaid who have moved out of Louisiana or otherwise don’t qualify for the government health insurance. 

The health department has recently started to check its Medicaid enrollment information against the state’s Office of Motor Vehicle database in order to cut coverage for people who no longer live in Louisiana. 

The state also conducted an extensive Medicaid enrollment check during most of last year as part of a national effort to reduce Medicaid bloat from the COVID-19 pandemic. It’s unclear how much the ongoing OMV review will cover the same ground. 
In addition to the teachers’ stipend, the House leadership also added funding to avoid cuts to domestic violence shelters and advocacy centers that provide services to children who are victims of crime. They also added approximately 750 more slots for seniors and people with disabilities to receive home assistance as well as tens of millions of dollars worth of lawmakers’ pet projects. 

Notably, the House leadership has avoided cutting any funding for the new LA GATOR private school voucher program that Gov. Jeff Landry favors. If the governor gets his way, nearly $100 million of public money will be used to cover private education costs next school year.
Teachers have been at risk of losing their pay stipend – given out the past two years instead of a permanent salary increase – after voters rejected a state constitutional amendment March that the governor pushed. 

The amendment would have made dozens of changes to Louisiana’s tax and budget structure, a few of which were expected to produce enough savings to make the stipend a permanent part of teachers’ salaries. Nearly two-thirds of voters balked at the overall proposal, however, deeming it too complicated. 

Before the election, Landry and Republican lawmakers said teachers would only retain their current pay level if the amendment passed. But after the amendment failed by a large margin, several legislators retreated from that stance. 

House Appropriations Committee Chairman Jack McFarland, R-Jonesboro, said the majority of House members have told him in recent weeks that they wanted to find a way to keep the teacher stipend in place this year.
The leader of the Louisiana Federation of Teachers, the state’s largest teacher union,  was encouraged by the budget change.
“We think this is a good first step,” LFT president Larry Carter said in an interview.
The solution is temporary, however. All of the funding McFarland has proposed to cover teacher stipends won’t be available again next year. 
House leaders are hoping the stipend won’t be needed in 2026 because the state will have the resources to offer teachers and support staff permanent salary increases. They are pushing to put several segments of the amendment that failed in March back on the ballot next spring as simpler, individual ballot items. They include the constitutional changes needed to free up money for the teacher salary bump equivalent to the current stipend. 
The Louisiana House is scheduled to vote on the budget proposal Thursday. The Senate will then take up the proposal, and the two sides must reach an agreement on the funding plan by June 12.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/42712297215_30935ab2e2_c.jpg,,,2025-05-12 18:10:04.417984

Thirty percent of corn and 16% of soybean acres have emerged as of Monday. 
Stu Swanson, president of Iowa Corn Growers Association, said despite weather delays last month, his fields, and those in his north central region are “sitting in a really good spot.”

“Farmers tend to be worriers,” Swanson said. “We worried that we weren’t going to get back in, and we appreciated the rain because now we’re looking dry and we’ll need a little shot of rain to get the rest of the soybeans to go.” 
Swanson said he was able to plant all of his corn between April 11 and 15, then faced a 16-day delay due to the rain, which set soybean planting behind slightly. Swanson said he finished planting beans late last week. 
Statewide, 76% of corn acres and 64% of soybean acres have been planted. 
Swanson said cold rain in the middle of April caused some “spotty” corn emergence in some fields, which he said has led to some replanting in those areas.
Overall, the rain has meant adequate moisture in 70% of topsoil and 67% of subsoil. 
State Climatologist Justin Glisan said Iowa had “unseasonable warmth” with some regions of the state logging temperatures 10 degrees or more above normal. 
Warm temperatures and an average rainfall for the state of 0.05 inch, led to nearly seven days suitable for field work during the reporting period of May 5 -11. 
According to the crop report, 6% of the state’s first cutting of alfalfa has been completed. More than 80% of hay and oats rated good or excellent.
The U.S. and China  announced Monday they agreed to a 90-day pause in trade-war tariffs, which Swanson said caused a bit of a “jump” in soybean prices. 
“That was great, but we’ll need an extended rally just to get them back to where we were earlier in the year,” Swanson said.

File photo by Peng Chen/VTDigger A Swanton man is facing a murder charge for allegedly fatally shooting another man who had recently been staying in the same home as he was early Saturday morning. Mitchal Shedrick, 52, pleaded not guilty to a charge of second-degree murder Monday during his arraignment hearing in Franklin County Superior criminal court in St. Albans. The felony offense, according to charging documents, stems from the shooting death of 37-year-old Joshua Many during an argument. Judge Navah Spero granted a request from Franklin County Deputy State’s Attorney Diane Wheeler to hold Shedrick in custody without bail pending a further hearing in the case.The investigation leading to the murder charge began around 3:15 a.m. Saturday when police reported receiving 911 calls from the residence on Fourth Street in Swanton, according to charging documents. Responding officers, the filings stated, found a man, later identified as Many, dead inside.Katrina Montgomery told investigators she was Many’s fiancee and that they had been staying at the residence on Fourth Street for a few weeks, Detective Sgt. Isaac Merriam of the Vermont State Police wrote in an affidavit in support of the murder charge. Montgomery added that several other people resided at the home, including Shedrick, according to the filing. Montgomery said an argument took place between Shedrick and Many in an upstairs room following a dispute that started over money, Merriam wrote. She reported hearing a gunshot and then she ran upstairs and heard Many say, “You shot me” and then “Why did you shoot me?” as he exited Shedrick’s room holding his chest, the affidavit stated. Many made it to a downstairs room, where he collapsed, and Montgomery said she called 911, according to the charging document. Another person at the home at the time of the shooting reported to police that Many and Shedrick had been “bickering back and forth” over a drug debt for more than a week, Merriam wrote in the affidavit. A later autopsy determined Many’s cause of death to be a gunshot wound to his torso, according to the filing.Attorney Paul Groce, representing Shedrick during the arraignment Monday, argued against the prosecution’s request to hold his client without bail. Groce said that based on the charging document there is at least an “outline” of a possible self-defense claim.He added that Shedrick was not a flight risk, having lived at the residence for many years and having limited mobility. Shedrick attended the hearing Monday in a wheelchair.  Wheeler, the prosecutor, countered that the evidence was strong, adding that there were witnesses in the home who provided sworn statements that they saw Shedrick with a gun and heard Many after being shot asking Shedrick, “Why’d you shoot me?”Spero, the judge, said she was holding Shedrick without bail, at least for now, pending another hearing to more thoroughly consider the strength of the prosecution’s evidence in the case.If convicted of the second-degree murder charge, Shedrick faces 20 years to life in prison. Read the story on VTDigger here:  ‘Why did you shoot me?’: Witness reports hearing slain Swanton man ask his accused killer .",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Franklin-Superior-Court-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-05-12 18:10:04.417984

The dispute, officially titled Original No. 141 Texas v. New Mexico and Colorado, came to a head in 2024, when U.S. Supreme Court justices struck down a deal proposed by New Mexico, Colorado and Texas to end the litigation. SCOTUS, — in a close 5-4 decision  — sided with the federal government’s objections that the states’ deal unfairly excluded the “unique federal interests,” and sent the parties back to settlement talks, or potentially back to court. In fact, the parties had been scheduled for a June 9 trial in Philadelphia, while still in talks.
On Monday, attorneys for both the core parties told the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit Chief Judge D. Brooks Smith they are “cautiously optimistic” the case may be resolved in coming months, and promised more details to come.
Jeff Wechsler, the lead attorney representing New Mexico, told the court during a status hearing on Monday he expected documents related to the agreement to be signed later in the afternoon, with subsequent paperwork later this week.
He also requested, on behalf of all the parties, for the court to cancel the June 9 trial date and instead schedule a hearing for later this year.
“Our intent with the request for the hearing is to provide you with everything you need to understand the agreement,” Wechsler said.
Smith serves as the special master for the case, and is charged with overseeing the case and issuing reports for the U.S. Supreme Court, which has final approval over interstate water lawsuits and settlements.
Smith commended the parties and mediator, retired federal Magistrate Judge Arthur Boylan, for the “progress made in this very lengthy litigation.”
The case has changed dramatically since it was first brought to court. In 2013, The state of Texas alleged New Mexico pumping diverted Rio Grande water owed to Texas under an 86-year old agreement: the 1939 Rio Grande Compact, a legal document for splitting the river’s water between Colorado, New Mexico and Texas. A compact violation between states can only be addressed in the nation’s highest court.
In 2018, SCOTUS allowed the federal government — which operates a network of dams, and nearly 140 miles of irrigation canals to deliver water to two irrigation districts in the region and Mexico — to join the case as a party. The federal government used similar arguments as Texas: that New Mexico groundwater pumping threatened irrigation and treaty interests.
But alliances reshaped themselves in recent years. In 2022, Colorado, New Mexico and Texas proposed a deal to measure Texas’ water at the state line and include transfers of water between New Mexico and Texas irrigation districts to balance out shortfalls, which the federal government opposed.
It appeared those lines of contention broke down in the most recent negotiations.
“The parties did a good job negotiating in good faith and bridging the gaps on the difficult issues,” said Thomas Snodgrass, a senior attorney for the U.S. Department of Justice representing the federal government.
Some concerns remain for the City of Las Cruces, one of the 12 organizations not a party to the lawsuit that has filed so-called “friend of the court” (amicus curiae) briefs in the case.
Jay Stein, an attorney for the City of Las Cruces, said the state’s second-largest city may not sign the current terms because the current agreement leaves the city “uncertain” on the issues of municipal supply.
Wechsler said amici approval is not required to move the agreement forward — it only requires the sign-off of the three states and the federal government —  but said that the State of New Mexico “believes there is a path forward in resolving these issues,” with Las Cruces to prevent further litigation.
Boylan, the mediator in the case, thanked parties for the “Herculean efforts” to settle the case and said he would continue mediation to address pending issues.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — A virtual charter school aiming to someday serve thousands of Oklahoma students at risk of not finishing high school has been approved to open in 2026.
The Statewide Charter School Board voted unanimously Monday in favor of establishing ThrivePoint Academy of Oklahoma. The online alternative school plans to enroll about 400 students statewide in grades 6-12 for the 2026-27 school year but has goals to reach 2,000 students after five years, according to its application.
Oklahoma is the fifth state where the Arizona-based Learning Matters Educational Group will establish and manage a charter school. The organization has opened ThrivePoint schools in Arizona, California and Nevada and is preparing to open a school in Utah next year.
The Oklahoma school, with teachers and staff based in the state, would focus on students who have fallen behind on credits needed to graduate.

“They have some experience in other states doing this and having success,” the statewide board’s chairperson, Brian Shellem, said after the meeting. “One of our tasks is to attract high-quality people who are already getting it done, so we’re hopeful that they will have a great impact on Oklahoma, especially for kids who have already fallen behind.”
ThrivePoint Academy promises an individualized learning plan, a flexible class schedule, small class sizes and a teacher/coach model “where students have multiple points of contact with adults who understand their struggles and achievements,” former Oklahoma state Sen. Clark Jolley, who leads the school’s governing board, wrote in a letter to the statewide board.
Each student will work with a teacher and a student success coach who will help them develop an academic plan, accelerate their learning and catch up on credits, said Timothy Smith, co-founder and CEO of Learning Matters Educational Group.
Oklahoma has one virtual charter school that serves students at risk of dropping out before graduation. Insight School of Oklahoma enrolls more than 1,100 students and has seen its numbers increase each of the past seven years, state data shows.

ThrivePoint academies have experienced significant growth in Arizona and California, where Learning Matters has run schools for 20 and 15 years respectively, Smith said. That led the group to expand into other states.
After its first application to open a ThrivePoint Academy in Oklahoma was denied last year, Learning Matters applied again in March — this time with a renamed and restocked Statewide Charter School Board. The board used to be known as the Statewide Virtual Charter School Board and had mostly different members.
The new board members asked for more clarity from ThrivePoint’s March application, including in the school’s bylaws, class schedules and fiscal plan. They then approved an updated version of the application on Monday.
Smith said the new Oklahoma board has been more receptive since it was reconstituted last year.
“They’re definitely forward thinking, looking for innovative schools,” Smith said after the vote. “We think that we are one, and so we’re very excited.”

House committee,John Cole,,,,,https://penncapital-star.com/government-politics/general-assembly/piaa-playoff-reform-bill-advances-out-of-pa-house-committee/,The proposal would allow the PIAA to create separate playoffs and championships for public and non-public schools.,"(Getty Images)The Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association (PIAA) may soon be able to create separate playoffs and championships for public schools and non-public schools.
A proposal to hand the association that power passed a state House committee on a bipartisan basis Monday.
Rep. Scott Conklin (D-Centre), sponsor of House Bill 41, believes his measure would correct what he and other supporters argue is an “imbalance” in the current system, which pits public schools, which they describe as “boundary” schools, in the same state playoffs and championship games as non-public schools. They include private, charter and parochial “non-boundary” schools.
Conklin mentioned that a few other states, including neighboring Maryland, currently use this approach.
“It’s worked very, very well,” Conklin said.
He likened his proposal to Penn State football being able to play an Ivy League team in the regular season and being able to “beat the tar out of them,” but ultimately the two schools won’t be vying for the same championship. 
Among the reasons Conklin’s cited in pushing the measure are that in the past, some high schools were talking about dropping out of the PIAA over the issue. He also highlighted how non-public schools only represent a small percentage of schools in the state, but ultimately win state championships at a larger rate.
A Capital-Star report in May 2024 found that at that time, non-public schools comprised 24% of the high schools in the PIAA, but accounted for a disproportionate amount of state champions in most common sports over the past decade.
Conklin also made the case that his proposal is not meant to “harm” those non-public schools in any way.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The PIAA has said that they don’t have the authority to make such a change without legislation. A co-sponsorship memo notes it gives the association the power to make changes.
However, the proposal is not a mandate for the PIAA, unlike a previous 2019 plan that would have mandated the PIAA to hold separate playoffs for public and non-public schools in certain sports.
Several committee members spoke out in support of the bill, including Rep. Jeff Olsommer (R-Pike), who said his brother is a football coach at a public high school in the state.
“I can’t tell you how many times he’s gone into the state playoffs, faced a charter or a private school that is loaded with talent and just gets mowed down. I hear it from the coaches on the staff and his friends of coaches, that this idea that is in this bill that you’re talking about, is widely prevalent and thought of as a great idea amongst the coaches, at least, in my brother’s circle,” Olsommer said.

Gov. Ron DeSantis and other government officials held a news conference in Tampa on Monday to discuss immigration arrests made last week by the Florida Highway Patrol, which for the first time has that authority.
The Legislature passed and DeSantis signed legislation in February that allows local and state law enforcement agencies to enter into what are known as 287 (g) agreements with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to execute immigration enforcement inside Florida.
Master Sergeant Joshua Malloy with the Troop C Criminal Interdiction Unit of the Florida Highway Patrol said on Monday that troopers “executed an operations enforcement operation” in Tampa last week that resulted in the apprehension of 30 undocumented immigrants in just over an hour.
“While this was the first operation featured on national news, it was part of a much larger effort where state troopers were working either independently or directly with the federal government to enforce federal and state laws,” Malloy added.
That “national news” that Malloy referred to was how the FHP gave exclusive access to a Fox News reporter on a ride-around last week to report on the operation, which featured footage of an FHP officer running after a man on I-4 after “his legal status was questioned,” according to the reporter.
“During this operation, three undocumented aliens fled from one of our traffic stops and ran across several lanes on I-4,” Malloy said — adding that, after the man was caught, he was transported to the Hillsborough County jail and “charged with felony burglary amongst other charges.”
Working with ICE last month in a statewide operation labeled “Operation Tidal Wave,” several Florida law enforcement agencies helped arrest more than 1,100 undocumented immigrants. That will now become the “new normal,” according to Larry Keefe, executive director of the State Board of Immigration Enforcement.
“Florida was kind of like a pushy partner,” Keefe added at the press conference. “We can do more. We have more capacity, more capability.” He displayed a 37-page document that he labelled the “Florida blueprint” to achieve the mass deportations goal issued by the Donald Trump White House.
Authority to deport
Dave Kerner, executive director of the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, said that the FHP is “the first in the nation to be delegated federal enforcement authority in the immigration space,” adding that 1,800 state troopers have been credentialed and delegated federal immigration enforcement authority.
“What that means is that if you see a state trooper, he or she has federal authority to detain, investigate, apprehend, and deport,” he said, adding that those troopers have been in some way involved in the arrests of more than 1,000 undocumented immigrants in Florida this year.
DeSantis said that approximately 70,000-80,000 undocumented immigrants have already appeared before immigration judges in Florida. He referred to a proposal under consideration that if approved by the federal government would allow Florida National Guard military judge advocates to serve as immigration judges, establishing temporary detention facilities and providing transportation.


Along with the FHP, Florida law enforcement agencies that have signed collaboration agreements with ICE include the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, the Florida State Guard, the Florida Department of Agricultural Law Enforcement, and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, according to an announcement by DeSantis in February.
Uthmeier’s appeal
Meanwhile, Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier filed an appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit last week of a decision by a federal judge in South Florida to block the law (SB 4-C) passed in February that bars undocumented people in the U.S. from entering the state.
U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams of the Southern District of Florida has suspended enforcement of the law but Uthmeier has said he won’t tell state or local law enforcement officials to stop apprehending undocumented migrants, despite the fact that the judge has said she could hold him in contempt later this month. DeSantis has said he stands by Uthmeier’s decision.

This year, a legislator is seeking to modify that requirement so that it no longer applies to minors.
Bill sponsor Ambureen Rana (D-Bangor) and medical experts said Monday that the change would grant health care providers more flexibility when it comes to how and when to discuss concerns or issues related to sexual or gender identity with young people, understanding that these conversations may impact their physical or mental health. 
The bill (LD 1945) would also remove the stipulation that providers collect this data from all patients during each doctor’s visit — a provision that means these conversations are being forced, rather than letting providers assess the best times to ask these questions, Rana said.
The rule change is supported by the Maine Medical Association and the Maine Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics. 
During a public hearing before the Maine Legislature’s Health and Human Services Committee, the health associations both said that the new law allowed people, particularly those in the LGBTQ+ community, to discuss their own identity, rather than have providers make assumptions. However, they believe collecting that information on every visit is unnecessary, particularly for minors who may not be ready to talk about those topics. 
The new bill comes as scrutiny of transgender people, particularly students, is increasing nationwide and in Maine, while some Republican lawmakers are seeking to roll back affirming gender identity protections, including gender affirming care. 
Protecting the privacy and safety of minors is an important goal of the proposed bill, said Madeleine DesFosses, advocacy and public health manager of the Maine Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics.
“Requiring health care providers to collect information through an intake form related to gender identity and sexuality for a minor may put them in an uncomfortable or confusing position,” she said.
“A minor may not feel comfortable or safe disclosing their gender or sexual identity in a healthcare setting. In addition, data may be skewed if a minor doesn’t feel they can be truthful about their gender identity or sexuality in this kind of setting.”
Under current law, anyone can decline to share this information, which the bill does not aim to change.

John Haste, R-Broken Arrow, attends a special session of the state Senate on June 12, 2024, at the Oklahoma State Capitol. (Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – A joint legislative panel on Monday moved one step closer to changing course on a new inpatient mental health hospital.
The state had planned to build a state-of-the art inpatient mental health facility, the Donahue Behavioral Health Campus near the Oklahoma State University in Oklahoma City, but the Joint Committee on Pandemic Relief Funding voted to reallocate some of those funds to other projects.
The new $130 million facility was to be funded in part with federal American Rescue Plan Act dollars and from $50 million the sale of the Norman facility.
Lawmakers said Monday that they still plan to move the state’s inpatient mental health hospital from Norman to Oklahoma City, but want to renovate an existing location.
Sen. John Haste, R-Broken Arrow, told the Joint Committee on Pandemic Relief Funding that the new $130 million construction project, set to open in December 2025, has become unworkable.
“The gap in funding is still not clear, but the last estimate was more than $100 million,” Haste said. “The cost continues to escalate. The land has not been sold and the opening date is now sometime in 2028.”
One site in Oklahoma City has been identified for renovation and can meet the needs to replace the beds at Norman’s Griffin Memorial Hospital, Haste said. That facility has been in use for over a century.
“This pivot from new construction to renovation will save the state both time and money as the replacement of these beds remain critical,” Haste said. 
The excess dollars would be invested in the Tulsa Behavioral Health Project, which has a gap in funding, Haste said.
Senate Minority Leader Julia Kirt, D-Oklahoma City, moved to reduce the amount awarded to replace Griffin from $87 million to $66.5 million. The motion passed.
“These funds will be used to pay existing expenses and to purchase and renovate a facility to provide additional behavioral health capacity,” Kirt said.
The new campus will have 197 beds, which is more than Griffin Memorial Hospital, Kirt said.
“There’s still a discussion about an annex building and whether that will end up being part of the final project,” Kirt said.
The panel also voted to move $7.9 million from the Griffin replacement project to the Tulsa Center for Behavioral Health, a 56-bed state owned and operated psychiatric hospital. 
“This project will provide much needed mental health services and additional beds for capacity,” Haste said.
Senate Appropriations Committee Chair Chuck Hall, R-Perry, said the changes will be put into bills and sent through the legislative process, which will give lawmakers and the public time to weigh in.

[…]","John Curran has re-entered the lieutenant governor contest as a write-in candidate. (Photo courtesy of John Curran). John Curran, the former Republican candidate for lieutenant governor who said internal sabotage cost him a spot on the primary ballot, announced Monday he is re-entering the race — this time as a GOP-aligned write-in.
“Today, I am announcing my WRITE-IN campaign for Lieutenant Governor of Virginia as a Republican,” Curran said in a statement. “My decision is not to split the ticket but to save it.”
Curran’s announcement reignites tensions in an already turbulent race following his exit in April, when he failed to qualify for the ballot despite claiming to have far surpassed the 10,000-signature requirement. 
“Unfortunately, a person(s) associated with my campaign conspired to steal most of my signatures and then attempted to extort money for them,” Curran wrote in a Facebook post after the filing deadline passed. “Disappointingly, the Virginia Department of Elections and the Republican Party of Virginia did nothing to correct this wrong.”
Mark Peake, chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia, dismissed Curran’s write-in bid as entirely unofficial, distancing the party from his campaign. 
“He is not running under the GOP banner whatsoever,” Peake said. “We have a GOP candidate, and that’s John Reid.”
Peake pointed out that Curran never qualified for the Republican primary, despite claiming to be a contender. “He failed to get enough signatures to get on the ballot,” he said. “He is 100% not a Republican candidate in this upcoming election.”
And Andrea Gaines, a spokeswoman for the department, said in an email that since write-in candidates do not appear on the ballot, “they do not have party affiliation.”
Political observers say Curran’s surprise reentry raises more questions than answers.
“It is difficult to know what to make of John Curran’s announcement,” said David Richards, a political science professor at the University of Lynchburg. “As a write-in candidate, it seems like the sore loser law might not apply, but it also might limit his campaigning. Regardless, the whole thing seems odd.”
Curran said in his statement that his campaign is fueled by “grassroots organizations, religious and family groups, and collegiate groups” and not designed to divide the party. But by positioning himself as an alternative to Reid, the GOP’s official nominee, he risks deepening an already visible rift within the party.
“Is Curran running to offer an alternative to John Reid? While that might seem a likely scenario, it has the danger of splitting the party,” Richards noted. “And the GOP has already been wrestling with Reid’s candidacy.”
Reid, a conservative commentator and longtime Richmond radio host, became the GOP’s nominee by default after Pat Herrity, a longtime member of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors, dropped out for health reasons.  
Late last month, Virginia’s GOP turmoil escalated when Reid accused Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s Spirit of Virginia PAC of attempted extortion, claiming the group offered to make damaging attacks disappear if he dropped out. Reid said the threats came after Youngkin personally urged him to quit over concerns tied to a controversial social media account. 
Reid, the first openly gay statewide candidate in Virginia history, called the situation “bigotry and ugliness,” warning that the pressure from party leaders has only intensified.
Curran alluded to those dynamics Monday, emphasizing that his concern is not Reid’s personal background, but the process that installed him as nominee.
“This issue is not about my opponent being gay; it is about Virginia deserving the ability to choose who represents them as the Republican candidate,” he said.
When asked for comment about Curran’s renewed bid, a campaign spokesman for Reid texted back, “Who?” 
Curran is now betting that Virginia conservatives will rally around a write-in candidacy — a historically uphill battle. “Write-in campaigns are notoriously difficult to pull off,” Richards said, pointing to the failed 2024 effort by Bob Good supporters to mount a last-ditch write-in bid after his congressional primary defeat. 
“Only a few hundred wrote in Good’s name. This time it is a candidate himself announcing the write-in campaign. Maybe he will gain some traction, but it will take a tremendous shift in the GOP vote to make a difference.”
Curran’s platform touches on a range of issues — from housing and disaster recovery in Southwest Virginia to opposing abortion and improving adoption services. 
“Virginia faces real issues that require strong leadership,” he said, portraying himself as a principled outsider wronged by the system. “It is time for common sense and strength, for someone who will fight for everyone.”
Still, his decision could prove costly for Republicans in November.
“Every write-in for Curran will mean a vote taken away from Reid,” Richards said. “That opens the lead for whoever wins the Democratic primary in June.”

,New Jersey Monitor,2025-05-12 21:03:25+00:00,New Jersey Monitor,New bill would remove some protections for temporary workers in New Jersey,Sophie Nieto-Munoz,,,,,https://newjerseymonitor.com/2025/05/12/new-bill-would-remove-some-protections-for-temporary-workers-in-new-jersey/,"The new bill comes less than two years after the law known as the ""Temp Workers Bill of Rights"" went into effect.","The new bill comes less than two years after the law known as the ""Temp Workers Bill of Rights"" went into effect. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)The sponsor of 2023 legislation that created new workplace protections for temporary workers is blasting a new bill that would remove many of those safeguards. 
“I believe in equal pay. I believe in equal benefits for equal work,” Sen. Joe Cryan (D-Union) told the Senate Labor Committee Monday. 
The new bill, which the committee discussed but did not vote on Monday, comes less than two years after the law known as the ‘Temp Workers Bill of Rights’” went into effect. That law requires employers to provide basic information on jobs in workers’ native language and guarantees a minimum wage to an estimated 127,000 temporary workers, staffed mostly in warehouses and factories. 
Sen. Paul Sarlo (D-Bergen), sponsor of the new bill, had voted in support of the earlier law, which passed after a years-long push by labor advocates who said the state’s temporary workers were victims of exploitative job conditions and wage theft.
Sarlo’s bill seeks to make several key changes to the temp worker law.
The current law requires staffing agencies to pay temp workers the same pay and benefits given to full-time workers performing the same work. Sarlo’s bill would revise that to remove the benefits provision and leaving only equal pay. Under the bill, equal pay would mean the agency is required to pay the equivalent of a client’s entry-level pay rate for a worker with minimum qualifications. 
A provision of the law requiring staffing agencies to disclose pay rates would also change under Sarlo’s bill, which would reverse that requirement.
The law also applies to New Jersey temp workers who take jobs in other states. Sarlo’s bill would ax that provision, saying it is “causing third-party clients in other states to reduce their use of temporary laborers from New Jersey.” 
Mike Nolfo, a franchisee for Express Employment Professionals, said his company employs nearly 2,000 temporary workers daily at 300 local businesses. Nolfo supports the new bill, and said it’s an opportunity to help mom-and-pop shops that are struggling because of the new law. He agreed that Pennsylvania companies aren’t using New Jersey agencies because of state laws. 
“We lost virtually all of our clients in East Stroudsburg because of this law, because they just don’t want to comply with it,” he said. “There’s a lot of pieces to it. We’re not saying the whole thing. Some of it doesn’t make sense.” 
The temp worker law passed out of the Legislature in February 2023 with the minimum number of yes votes a bill needs to pass the Senate, 21. It went into full effect that summer.
Staffing agencies and business groups sued over the law, claiming it is unconstitutionally vague and makes New Jersey less competitive. Cryan noted the plaintiffs have lost all their legal challenges.
Cryan said supporters of the new bill say it’s aimed at cleaning up mistakes in the law, but he called the measure “far from that.”
Opponents of the bill said weakening the protections of temporary workers only hurts vulnerable people who are abused and exploited in the workplace. Nedia Morsy, executive director of immigrant advocacy group Make the Road New Jersey, said it’s “stunning that in a climate of federal attacks on workers, on immigrants, and on the institutions that protect both, that a bill like this would even see the light of day.”

Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/12/ct-budget-deal-education-aid/,"The General Assembly must overcome unprecedented challenges to adopt a new budget, but the biggest hurdle now involves local schools.","The General Assembly must overcome unprecedented challenges to adopt a new budget before its session ends June 4.
But the biggest hurdle legislators and Gov. Ned Lamont need to clear involves local schools.
Aggressive budget caps are leaving education and other core programs hundreds of millions shy of what majority Democrats say is necessary to meet current needs, and officials fear larger cuts in federal aid are coming this summer as Congress wraps an unprecedented effort to slash aid to states.
Unless officials can protect rural poor communities facing cuts in basic K-12 grants, boost aid to long-neglected urban centers and continue to fix a growing crisis in special education, the prospects of a budget deal are murky at best.
Can CT continue to shield all districts from education aid cuts?
“If we [won’t] spend less than $10 million [next year] for 81 communities,” said Sen. Cathy Osten, D-Sprague, “that’s saying those communities don’t count.”
Osten, who co-chairs the Appropriations Committee, is battling to ensure no district receives less Education Cost Sharing [ECS] grant funding than it currently receives.
A $2.4 billion program that provides the bulk of state aid to elementary and secondary districts, ECS would grow by $85 million next fiscal year under a revised formula lawmakers adopted eight years ago.
Based on that formula, almost half of Connecticut’s cities and towns would lose funding next fiscal year while many others simply would simply break even.
But that system, which is based on wealth, student enrollment, special needs, and past local spending, has a big flaw. Lawmakers haven’t adjusted the foundation payment of $11,525 per student for inflation in more than a decade.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025_0225_SR_SenateVote_197-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-12 17:07:48.590498
,DC,2025-05-12 20:58:50+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,U.S. House GOP mandates Medicaid work requirements in giant bill slashing spending,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-gop-mandates-medicaid-work-requirements-giant-bill-slashing-spending,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. House Republicans plan to debate and approve the three final pieces of their “big, beautiful bill” in committee this week, including the tax measure, major spending cuts to Medicaid that will change how states run the program and an agriculture bill.At least $880 billion over the next 10 years would be slashed under the piece of the bill that covers energy and health care, including from Medicaid. Republicans would add new Medicaid work requirements for some able-bodied adults; seek to penalize the dozen states that allow immigrants living in the U.S. without legal status in the program; and require states to more frequently check Medicaid enrollees’ eligibility, among other changes.An estimate was not yet available for exactly how much that would save in Medicaid spending or how many people enrolled might lose coverage. Earlier projections of various other scenarios by the Congressional Budget Office had placed the numbers of displaced enrollees in the millions, and Democrats predicted the same effect from the newest plan.House panels have already signed off on eight of the 11 bills that will make up the sweeping reconciliation legislation. And if all goes according to plan, that chamber should approve the entire package before the end of the month.Debate is expected to begin Tuesday in each of the panels and last hours, possibly into Wednesday. Democrats will offer dozens of amendments seeking to change the bills and highlighting their disagreement with GOP policy goals.Internal Republican disputes between centrists and far-right lawmakers over numerous tax proposals and funding changes to Medicaid will also likely lead to debate on GOP amendments.With paper-thin majorities in the House and Senate, nearly every Republican needs to support the overall package for it to move through both chambers and to President Donald Trump.If Republicans fail to reach agreement during the next couple months, it would put nearly every aspect of their agenda in jeopardy. GOP leaders would also need to negotiate a bipartisan debt limit agreement before the August recess, should the reconciliation package fall apart, since they plan to include debt limit language as well.GOP divided over Medicaid cutsKentucky Republican Rep. Brett Guthrie, chairman of the committee that oversees energy and Medicaid, wrote in a statement last week announcing the markup that his panel’s measure would “end wasteful government spending, unleash American energy and innovation, and strengthen Medicaid for mothers, children, individuals with disabilities, and the elderly.”But the bill released this weekend might not have support from far-right members in the House and seems to be running into opposition from some GOP senators as well. Texas Republican Rep. Chip Roy, of the hard right, wrote on social media that he hoped “House & Senate leadership are coming up with a backup plan…. ….. because I’m not here to rack up an additional $20 trillion in debt over 10 years or to subsidize healthy, able-bodied adults, corrupt blue states, and monopoly hospital ceos…”Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley, who has voiced concern for months about potential cuts to Medicaid, wrote an op-ed published in The New York Times on Monday highly critical of a “contingent of corporatist Republicans” who support lower federal spending on the program.”“This wing of the party wants Republicans to build our big, beautiful bill around slashing health insurance for the working poor,” Hawley wrote. “But that argument is both morally wrong and politically suicidal.”The entire House package will be open to amendment if the legislation makes it to the Senate, where several GOP lawmakers are expected to rework or even eliminate entire sections.Work requirementsThe Energy and Commerce Committee’s bill is the one that would cut federal spending by at least $880 billion during the next decade including on Medicaid, the state-federal health program for lower income people.The legislation would institute work requirements nationwide for able-bodied adults between the ages of 19 and 65, with several exceptions, including for pregnant people, enrollees with certain disabilities or serious medical conditions, and parents of dependent children.People not exempted from the requirements would need to work, engage in community service, or enroll in an education program for at least 80 hours a month.A staffer on the panel told reporters during a background briefing Monday that Republicans tried to learn from challenges certain states had in the past when they implemented work requirements.After discussions with current and former state Medicaid directors, the staffer said the committee wrote a bill that they are confident “states will be able to implement effectively.”The work requirements take into account various unexpected circumstances, like if someone were to be hit by a bus and unable to complete the 80-hours-per-month requirement on time because they were hospitalized, the staffer said.“We did try to be very thoughtful about any kind of circumstance that could happen,” they said.Immigrant coverage, eligibility checksThe Medicaid legislation also seeks to encourage states who include undocumented immigrants in their program to stop doing so or lose some federal funding.The federal government currently pays 90% of the cost of covering enrollees who are eligible for Medicaid under the 2010 Affordable Care Act expansion. That would decrease to 80% for the expanded population if states choose to keep covering undocumented immigrants.The committee staffer said this would impact California, Colorado, Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Utah, Vermont and Washington states if they don’t change their policies regarding undocumented immigrants.Additionally, states would need to check eligibility for all of their Medicaid enrollees every six months, instead of once a year for the expanded population. This likely would lead to some people being kicked out of the program.Committee staff members were unable to share exactly how each of the Medicaid provisions would affect the federal budget or how many people could lose access to the program if Congress were to implement the legislation as written.But the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office wrote in a letter Monday that it estimates the Energy and Commerce Committee met its target of cutting at least $880 billion in spending “over the 2025-2034 period and would not increase on-budget deficits in any year after 2034.”Staff on the committee said they don’t expect to have the full CBO score before the markup begins Tuesday and didn’t have an estimate for when that information will be out.Energy and Commerce Committee Ranking Member Frank Pallone, D-N.J., wrote in a statement the GOP bill would lead to millions of people losing access to Medicaid.“This is not trimming fat from around the edges, it’s cutting to the bone,” Pallone wrote. “The overwhelming majority of the savings in this bill will come from taking health care away from millions of Americans. No where in the bill are they cutting ‘waste, fraud, and abuse’—they’re cutting people’s health care and using that money to give tax breaks to billionaires.”Repealing clean-energy fundsThe Republican proposal would repeal more than a dozen sections of Democrats’ 2022 reconciliation law related to energy and environment programs.The law, known as the Inflation Reduction Act, included hundreds of billions in tax credits for renewable energy and energy-efficiency measures. It was considered the largest investment by the United States in tackling climate change.The House bill would repeal sections including the $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which helps finance clean-energy projects, and a $40 billion Department of Energy loan program meant to stimulate production of clean-energy infrastructure.Sections targeting carbon emissions, air pollution, offshore wind transmission, and other programs would also rescind any unspent funds for those purposes appropriated in the Biden-era law.The measure would allow pipeline builders to pay fees to bypass environmental review. Natural gas pipelines could pay $10 million to access an expedited approval process and liquified natural gas exports could pay $1 million for the Energy Department to deem them “in the public interest.”Rep. Kathy Castor, the ranking member on the Energy and Commerce Energy Subcommittee, said the proposal would sabotage efforts to drive down prices for consumers.“Cleaner, cheaper energy for consumers gets left behind,” the Florida Democrat wrote in a statement. “Dismantling our landmark Inflation Reduction Act will kill jobs, hurt businesses, and drive-up Americans’ energy costs.”Tax cutsThe Ways and Means Committee released its 28-page starter bill late last week and the full 389-page version Monday afternoon, but Republicans on the panel could add to it during the Tuesday markup.House GOP tax writers propose making permanent the underlying 2017 tax law provisions while temporarily expanding several of them, including the child tax credit and standard deduction.The child tax credit would increase to $2,500, up from $2,000, until 2028. The refundable amount of the tax credit per child — meaning how much taxpayers could get back — would now reach up to $1,400. Taxpayers claiming the credit would now have to provide a Social Security number, as well as the SSN of a spouse.The standard deduction for single and married joint filers would temporarily increase until 2029 up to $2,000, depending on filing status.Trump’s campaign promises, including no tax on tips, also made it into the proposal, though only until 2028. Those claiming the tax break on tips will also need to provide a Social Security number as well as the SSN of their spouse, if married.Trump’s promise to eliminate taxes on car loan interest, also set to expire in 2028, would not apply to any vehicle that was not finally assembled in the U.S.Tax writers increased but ultimately left a cap on the amount of state and local taxes, commonly referred to as SALT, that households can deduct, an incredibly contentious issue for lawmakers with constituents in high tax areas like New York and California. GOP lawmakers increased the SALT cap to $30,000, up from $10,000.That level, however, might not have the support needed among Republicans' extremely thin majorities and will likely lead to heated debate during markup, or on the floor.Republicans from higher-tax states have repeatedly said they will not vote for the entire package unless they feel their constituents will benefit from raising the SALT cap.The dispute has spilled over several times already, including in a statement last week from four New York Republicans, who wrote, “The Speaker and the House Ways and Means Committee unilaterally proposed a flat $30,000 SALT cap — an amount they already knew would fall short of earning our support.”“It’s not just insulting—it risks derailing President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill,” they wrote. “New Yorkers already send far more to Washington than we get back—unlike many so-called ‘low-tax’ states that depend heavily on federal largesse.“A higher SALT cap isn’t a luxury. It’s a matter of fairness.”New York Republican Rep. Nick LaLota wrote on social media Monday afternoon: “Still a hell no.”How much the tax proposal will cost has not yet been released, but government deficit watchdogs estimated a wholesale extension of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, without the enhancements, would cost north of $4 trillion over the next decade.Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation, said the proposal provides some certainty to individual taxpayers but it also adds complexity in many areas.“You can clearly see the thinking here was probably just a straight-up extension (of the 2017 law), people wouldn’t feel like they got a tax cut because it's just continuing. So they had to do something to make it feel like there's a larger tax cut,” York said.Ag cuts remain a mysteryThe House Agriculture Committee, led by Pennsylvania Republican Glenn 'GT' Thompson, hadn’t released its bill as of Monday afternoon but was scheduled to begin the markup on Tuesday evening.That panel is supposed to cut at least $230 billion in federal spending during the next decade, some of which will likely come from reworking elements of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.Committee leaders are also planning to include elements of the much overdue farm bill, though those provisions could run into issues in the Senate if they don’t have a significant impact on federal revenue or spending.Republicans are using the complex reconciliation process to move the package through Congress with simple majority votes in each chamber, avoiding the Senate’s 60-vote legislative filibuster, which would otherwise require bipartisanship. Reconciliation measures must address federal revenue, spending, or the debt limit in a way not deemed “merely incidental” by the Senate parliamentarian. That means the GOP proposals must carry some sort of price tag and cannot focus simply on changing federal policy.Jacob Fischler and Ashley Murray contributed to this report.",,,,2025-05-12 17:07:48.590498

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Lawmakers expressed concerns Monday about whether the state’s mental health department is adequately reimbursing a group of specialized providers who care for uninsured Oklahomans.
Lawmakers peppered the state’s chief financial officer and a special expert appointed by Gov. Kevin Stitt with questions about whether providers who operate certified community behavioral health centers are being correctly compensated for services after Oklahoma Voice last week reported that several providers said they’re owed close to $150 million in unreimbursed costs during the 2024 and 2025 budget years.  
Aaron Morris, the state’s CFO, and David Greenwell, who has temporarily been appointed by Stitt to oversee the Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services’ finances, were the latest officials called to testify before a special legislative committee probing the agency’s financial shortfalls and ongoing disarray that’s resulted in contracts being cut or canceled and warnings that the department can’t afford to pay its nearly 2,000 employees. 
Both men said the state agency would need a supplemental appropriation to make ends meet and make payroll for the rest of the current fiscal year, but said they were still trying to determine what that amount is. They said that supplemental request would not include the $150 million that several providers have said hasn’t been reimbursed by the state agency. 
While these providers haven’t historically been reimbursed for 100% of these services and the agency isn’t contractually obligated to do so, reimbursements have been made when funds are available, Morris said. 
Rep. Mark Lawson, R-Sapulpa, who chairs the select committee, said many providers have received these payments for years and built them into their business models. Lawmakers will consider including funds for these reimbursements in a supplemental appropriation, he said, but paying state employees and “getting through” the current fiscal year comes first. 
Joy Sloan, president of the Alliance of Mental Health Providers of Oklahoma, a coalition of eight certified community behavioral health centers, has said that providers generally aren’t reimbursed for all claims and don’t expect to be.

In a letter addressed to Mental Health Commissioner Allie Friesen and sent to lawmakers on Monday, Sloan wrote that while she understands Friesen’s burden, the recent financial cuts have placed an “unprecedented strain” on Oklahoma’s certified community behavioral health centers. 
“Without financial support to offset the costs for those unable to pay, our ability to sustain this open-access model is in jeopardy,” she wrote. “Some of us may be forced to reduce services, lay off staff, or close programs. None of us want that. Therefore, considering this challenging budget year, and in the spirit of shared responsibility, charity and compromise, we request that ODMHSAS consider funding some portion of these services.” 
In total, the eight providers have over $84 million in services not reimbursed this fiscal year. Slightly over 1 in 4 clients was uninsured, according to the letter. 
Following the hearing, the mental health department released a statement that said the agency has not traditionally budgeted separately for the payments but instead used funds still available at the end of the year. 
Friesen had asked a former employee to create “an algorithm to assist providers in estimating and planning” for those payments, but it wasn’t completed, said Maria Chaverri, the agency’s spokesperson, in a statement.
She acknowledged “significant and sometimes unrealistic mandates” that make the current payment model “challenging” for providers, and said the department is working to “restore the model’s original fidelity” to ensure the monthly contract rates are sufficient.
“Several factors have contributed to the current rise in pended payment amounts, including systemic shifts such as the transition to managed care, broader state-level reforms, and increased service mandates placed on (certified community behavioral health centers),” Chaverri said in a statement. 
Senate Minority Leader Julia Kirt, D-Oklahoma City, said she’s worried that those provider payments are being viewed as “optional” when the Legislature mandates that the services be provided. It has increased the number of uninsured receiving treatment, she said. 
“I’m worried that we’re going to view it as optional when actually they’ve built this capacity based on our requirements,” she said.

Rep. Anthony Moore, R-Clinton, asked that Morris and Greenwell consider including the payments in the supplemental budget request for the current fiscal year and in the budget request for the upcoming fiscal year. 
He said the budget request would not be accurate without them.
“We will be back here next year with a giant headache on our hands if we shut these providers down,” he said. “Because we all know that we’re going to treat these people somewhere, and it’s going to be somewhere in the system, and I’d much rather be in the mental health system than in jails and in the court system.”
Morris, the state CFO, said they will provide lawmakers with the “support” to make that determination. 
Immediate needs and obligations, like making payroll, are the priority, Morris said. One lawmaker said around $1.5 million has been added to the mental health department’s payroll by new executive staff hires. 
Morris and Greenwell did not offer a dollar amount on how much would be needed for a supplemental appropriation at Monday’s hearing, but said they planned to get a number to lawmakers later that day. 
The two financial experts said they would be meeting with leaders from the Legislative Office of Fiscal Transparency to finalize and compare numbers Monday. 
“There are human beings behind every single dollar we’re looking at,” Sen. Paul Rosino, R-Oklahoma City, said. “People in crisis, people in need of services, and please don’t lose focus of that.” 
After lawmakers are presented with a request for an appropriation, they will internally review it before it can go through a joint committee on appropriations and budgets.

(Screenshot of postcard)Hoosier voters will soon be receiving postcards in the mail from the Secretary of State’s Election Division as part of statewide voter registration list maintenance.
A news release issued Monday said the goal is to identify outdated, duplicate, and inaccurate voter registrations to improve the accuracy and integrity of Indiana’s list.
There are currently 4,644,046 registered voters in Indiana.
Residents don’t necessarily have to respond upon receipt of an initial postcard.
But if a postcard is returned as undeliverable, a second postcard will be sent to the forwardable address on file with the U.S. Postal Service.  The second postcard will ask a voter to confirm or update their residence address or cancel their Indiana voter registration using a postage pre-paid voter response card. Hoosiers who receive a second postcard should follow the instructions to complete and return the pre-addressed, postage-paid response card to the Election Division.
This process is required by federal and state law.
The release said a registration “flagged” as inaccurate by this process can only be canceled by a county voter registration board if the flagged registration is not utilized for voting in two successive federal elections. Voters can correct or update a flagged registration by mail, in-person at their county clerk’s office, or at the polls when they vote in a primary or general election.
The next election in Indiana is the primary on May 5, 2026. The general election is Nov. 3, 2026.
This process has led to approximately 800,000 inactive or outdated voter registrations being canceled in Indiana over the past two list maintenance cycles, according to the release.
“Sending these postcards is an essential step in maintaining clean and accurate voter rolls,” Secretary of State Diego Morales said. “It helps identify outdated or incorrect information and ensures our voter registration lists reflect current, eligible voters. This process is vital to protecting the integrity of our elections and upholding voter confidence across Indiana.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-12 20:48:27+00:00,CT Mirror,CT officials on federal Medicaid cuts bill: ‘Designed to hurt people’,Katy Golvala,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/12/ct-officials-federal-medicaid-cuts-proposal/,CT officials warned that federal Medicaid cuts outlined in a Congressional Republican plan would have devastating consequences.,"Connecticut officials on Monday warned that Medicaid cuts outlined in a Congressional Republican plan would have devastating consequences, even though the changes stop short of the scenarios that would have most heavily impacted enrollee benefits and the state budget.
In a plan released on Sunday, House Republicans on the Energy and Commerce Committee provided details for the first time on how they propose to find $880 billion in spending cuts in order to meet the Trump administration’s budget priorities. Among other measures, the plan would implement 80 hours of work, volunteer or educational requirements a month for certain enrollees and freeze the hospital tax, a mechanism that enables states to increase the amount of Medicaid funding they receive from the federal government.
“This bill has a number of provisions that seem designed to hurt people in Connecticut, that seem designed to take coverage away from folks, to put our hospitals into financial difficulty,” Sen. Matt Lesser, D-Middletown, co-chair of the state legislature’s Human Services Committee, said during a press conference at the state Capitol on Monday.
Rob Blanchard, a spokesperson for Gov. Ned Lamont, said that the state is evaluating the impact of the proposal on residents and the state budget, but “it’s clear that these proposed cuts will have a significant impact on every state.”
“In the meantime, the Governor will continue working with DSS, our legislative leaders, and our Congressional delegation to mitigate any damage from potential cuts and preserve access to quality care for the most vulnerable residents in our state,” Blanchard wrote in emailed comments.
Some of the most drastic changes to the program floated over the last several months, including reduced federal matching and a per enrollee cap on federal funding, are not included in the plan. Lesser said the absence of those proposals is a sign that “there’s really been an impact from this public outcry” that’s taken place over the last several months.
“Republican members of Congress are hearing from their constituents when they hold town halls. They’re being reminded that Medicaid is a program that people in red states and blue states rely on,” Lesser said.
Medicaid, known as HUSKY in Connecticut, covers roughly 1 million people in the state, according to the Department of Social Services, which equals just about 25% of the population.
States depend heavily on the federal government to pay for the program. The state’s Office of Policy and Management projects Connecticut will spend a total of $11.6 billion on Medicaid this fiscal year. The federal government contributed roughly $6.9 billion, or 59%, of that funding.
The state is in the process of analyzing how Medicaid work requirements would impact the state budget, Christine Stuart, a spokesperson with the Department of Social Services, confirmed. 
State officials in the past have criticized work requirements for being expensive to implement and based on incorrect assumptions that Medicaid enrollees don’t work. Although they are more moderate than some of the other changes Democrats feared, Pareesa Charmchi Goodwin, executive director of the state legislature’s Commission on Racial Equity in Public Health, said bureaucracy will likely lead to loss of coverage, even for those who qualify. 
“It is a lot of additional layers of administration and bureaucracy that are very difficult for people to navigate, and people end up losing benefits even if, for example, they are working,” Charmchi Goodwin said on Monday at the Capitol. “It’s deeply, deeply concerning.”
The Connecticut Hospital Association called the proposal, including the plan to freeze hospital taxes, “an attack on states and the way state budgets are developed to fund Medicaid.”
“If federal contributions to state Medicaid programs are frozen, over time healthcare providers will have no choice but to make up the significant losses elsewhere or cut back on services. This would be devastating to affordability and access,” Paul Kidwell, senior vice president of policy at CHA, stated in emailed comments.
The proposal would also implement copays for certain Medicaid enrollees, require eligibility screening every six months instead of every year and penalize states, like Connecticut, that provide Medicaid-like coverage to children and people who are pregnant or postpartum regardless of immigration status. 
Connecticut provides Medicaid-like state-sponsored coverage regardless of immigration status to children 15 and under, as well as people who are pregnant or postpartum, who have qualifying incomes. 
The federal government covers roughly half the cost of coverage for traditional Medicaid enrollees, but for those who don’t qualify for Medicaid because of their immigration status, the state bears 100% of the costs. However, the feds provide 65% of the funding for prenatal coverage, even for those who wouldn’t qualify because of immigration status.
Lesser called the attempt to prohibit states like Connecticut from providing coverage regardless of immigration status a “huge overreach,” particularly considering they do so without the support of federal funding. He predicted the measure would face legal challenges.
Additionally, the plan seeks to ban Medicaid coverage of gender-affirming care for transgender kids and prevent providers who perform abortions from receiving Medicaid funding for any services they provide. Federal law already prohibits federal funding for abortions, except in cases of rape, incest or life endangerment of the pregnant person.
Amanda Skinner, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Southern New England, said the provision would leave “thousands of patients in Connecticut with nowhere else to turn.”
“In Connecticut, 46% of PPSNE’s patients rely on HUSKY Health to receive services like birth control, cancer screenings, wellness exams, STI testing and treatment, and more. We are their trusted source of care. Our health centers are an irreplaceable part of Connecticut’s health care system,” Skinner wrote in emailed comments.
Lesser conceded that the proposal includes a limited number of measures he sees as beneficial to residents, including provisions to rein in the power of pharmacy benefit managers, companies that serve as middlemen to help manage drug benefits for health plans, but have recently come under fire for driving up prescription drug costs.

The town was a hotspot for infestations in late April, leaving dry, rotted-out ash trees ready to crash.But Hardwick, just a few towns north, has never seen any confirmed case of emerald ash borer, according to the state.“It’s a good lesson in how the insect spreads,” said Noah Hoffman, the invasive species coordinator for the Vermont Department of Forests, Parks and Recreation. “Most of the emerald ash borer in the state –– we put it there.”The emerald ash borer chews its way through forests with little regularity; it often spreads as a result of human activity, being carried on infested firewood or logging timber. They are most likely to use ash trees, which make up 6% of Vermont’s trees by volume, as hosts for larvae. The bugs have been spotted in 96 out of Vermont’s 247 municipal areas, Hoffman said.That there are no emerald ash borers in Hardwick could be attributed to the work that foresters, educators and town management have done to slow the spread. “The state has done a great job with their educational outreach,” said Rose Paul of Plainfield’s conservation commission, “and we’ve tried to do our part in town.”READ MORE





 


As the emerald ash borer munches on, Vermont tries to protect ash trees that are left

Hoffman said the state Agency of Natural Resources’ educational programs have been a big success in slowing the insect’s spread, teaching the public how to identify infected trees or wood and how to treat it.“There are landowners who might have ash in their forest. If we can slow the spread, it gives people more time to think about what they want to do, do some research, create a plan for their trees,” Hoffman said. “Maybe they want to do some logging and cut their healthy ash trees.”Trees with emerald ash borer larvae living in their bark can resemble partially peeled carrots — chunks of bark are stripped off. Those marks come from woodpeckers flecking away in search of grub. Other indications of infestation include splitting bark, thinning crowns and D-shaped exit holes on the trunk.If left untreated, the infestation dries out the wood and turns it brittle, useless for logging, liable to fall and ultimately dead.In Calais, townspeople’s understanding of the hazards of sick trees has made it possible to plan tree removal on a broad scale. “One of the things that strikes me about Calais is there’s a lot of interest in conservation and protection of natural resources,” said Kari Bradley, town administrator.The town’s selectboard applied for an ash tree removal grant from the Vermont Urban and Community Forestry Program, a collaboration between the state and the University of Vermont Extension. Bradley said there was no opposition from the public on the board’s unanimous decision. “Calais has close to 80 miles of road, and there are somewhere (around) 3,000 ash trees along the right of way on those roads,” Bradley said.Grant funding for the Urban and Community Forestry Program has changed due to “the shifting priorities of the current administration,” said Hoffman with a dry chuckle. “Is that a nice way of saying it?”The Trump administration’s mass campaign to cut federal awards is a cause of “angst and concern,” Hoffman said, because although the program is state funded, “a lot of the work we actually do and the service we provide to Vermonters is through federally awarded grants.”Other methods of managing the bug include injecting trees with a systemic insecticide, a process that can cost several hundred dollars every three years. It may seem pricey, but Hoffman argues that a tree could end up costing much more to take down than to vaccinate, especially if it caused damage on its way down.For several years, the state has also been releasing natural predators to the emerald ash borer: few species of wasp-like insects that lay eggs inside the borer’s larvae or eggs. It’s a biocontrol measure aimed “to try to reduce its density and to try to give the trees more of a chance,” Hoffman said.Read the story on VTDigger here:  How local Vermont towns are handling the emerald ash borer.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/emerald-ash-borer.jpg,,,2025-05-12 17:07:48.590498

Jared Polis shakes hands with state Sen. Julie Gonzales after he signed the Colorado Voting Rights Act, a measure Gonzales sponsored, into law Monday, May 12, 2025 at the Governor’s Residence in Denver. (Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)Colorado Gov. Jared Polis signed the Colorado Voting Rights Act into law Monday, establishing various protections contained in the federal Voting Rights Act at the state level. 
Senate Bill 25-1, the first bill of the 2025 legislative session, prohibits election practices that limit the participation of people of color and other protected groups, bill sponsors said. It also includes protections for LGBTQ+ voters, expands multilingual ballot access, and requires accommodations for people with disabilities at residential facilities. 
The state attorney general could enforce voting rights under the Colorado measure, so the state does not need to rely on federal courts to enforce voting protections. The provisions of the bill would apply to all state and municipal elections. Voters whose rights are violated under the act can take action along with civil rights groups.

Bill sponsors include Sen. Julie Gonzales, a Denver Democrat, Rep. Jennifer Bacon, a Denver Democrat, and Rep. Junie Joseph, a Boulder Democrat. Supporters of the bill include Colorado Common Cause, the Colorado Criminal Justice Reform Coalition, the League of Women Voters and the ACLU, among other groups. 
Gonzales said inaction from Congress and decisions from federal courts have led to the “slow dismantling” of the federal Voting Rights Act. Several court decisions have weakened the federal VRA over the last decade, and there’s growing concern that President Donald Trump’s administration could try to further erode its protections. 










Those were hard fought protections that the civil rights movement and the Black community particularly fought and led to achieve, and to see the fact that now a generation later, we don't know whether or how long those protections will continue to exist — we're not just going to sit around and see what happens.


– State Sen. Julie Gonzales


“Those were hard fought protections that the civil rights movement and the Black community particularly fought and led to achieve, and to see the fact that now a generation later, we don’t know whether or how long those protections will continue to exist — we’re not just going to sit around and see what happens,” Gonzales said at a bill signing ceremony at the Governor’s Residence in Denver. “We are taking action now. We are taking action here today to ensure that every Coloradan can cast a ballot free from discrimination and free from fear.”
‘Historical weight’
Polis said the Colorado Legislature makes the first bill each session something that is particularly important and that it’s appropriate that SB-1 centers on voting rights, because “our democracy begins with voting.” 
“Voting is not something that we can take for granted. We need to make sure that we are protecting our rights as Americans to have our voices heard,” Polis said at the bill signing. “Colorado’s election system is one of the very best in the country, and with this, we’re taking steps to make sure that no matter what happens at the federal level, we can make sure to protect our voter integrity here in the great state of Colorado.”
The measure ensures incarcerated voters have the right to vote while in custody and eases access for voters who live on tribal lands in Colorado. Eligible voters in assisted living facilities will also be provided information to make it easier for them to vote. The bill also expands requirements for multilingual ballots to include municipalities in a county already required to provide multilingual ballots under requirements of a 2021 law. 
Joseph, who immigrated to the U.S. from Haiti, said the Colorado Voting Rights Act has “historical weight” building on protections established in the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which prohibited racial discrimination in voting. She said that had it not been for that measure, “I would not be before you here today.”
A January poll found that two-thirds of Coloradans support protecting voting rights at the state level, and 61% support the Colorado Voting Rights Act, while 33% oppose it. Eight states have passed their own versions, several others have considered similar measures.
Polis also signed House Bill 25-1225, which adds protections against intimidation, threats or coercion to people voting or helping others to vote.

The Daily Montanan made a few visualizations of some stats from the session — using data derived from the Legislative Services Division and the Montana Free Press, which does a great job of crafting a database of LSD data.
 More bills than ever were introduced during the 2025 session

Lawmakers come to Helena with more ideas for legislation than would ever be heard, much less end up on the Gov. Greg Gianforte’s desk.
The last two sessions saw a big jump in the number of bill drafts requested by legislators — around 4,500 — up more than 1,000 from the 2021 and 2019 sessions. That has translated into back-to-back record numbers of bills actually introduced into the body — discounting the 1973-1974 sessions, the first following the adoption of the new Montana Constitution — with 39.1% of drafts receiving an official introduction this year.
The 2025 session saw 1,759 bills, resolutions and initiatives make it to at least one committee vote. In the 85 days lawmakers were in Helena, 884 bills passed both chambers. As of May 12, 570 bills have become law so far, with more than 200 awaiting action, while Gov. Greg Gianforte has already vetoed a handful.

The Montana Legislative Services Division keeps track of the passage of bills throughout the legislative process and produces visualizations to show the winnowing down of potential laws.
The below chart, taken from the LSD’s interactive “Billboard,” shows that most bills that don’t make it out of the Legislature, die in their original chambers. After that, it’s more likely the second chamber will approve a bill and it will end up heading to Gianforte’s desk. In 2025, just more than half of all bills introduced made it all the way through the process, not counting single-chamber resolutions.

In 2023, the total number of bill passed, including single-chamber resolutions, was 907. In 2025, that number jumped to 996.
 Visualizing voting statistics

Lawmakers in both chamber pressed their green or red buttons a lot of times this year — there were 2,659 votes taken in the Senate, and 2,706 in the House, according to the bill tracking data compiled by the Montana Free Press.
Of those votes, a vast majority of them were bipartisan votes, and many near-unanimous ones, which might seem odd, given that it is often highly partisan rhetoric stemming from politicians pointing fingers back and forth on myriad issues that breaks through the Capitol to the outside world.
But it’s possible to visualize the bipartisan nature of most votes, by looking at how often each lawmaker’s vote aligned with the majority of a chamber.
Take the Senate for example. The following chart shows how often each senator was on the winning side of an issue.

The lowest percentages were 66% for Democratic Sen. Andrea Olsen of Missoula and 68% for Republican Sen. Daniel Emrich of Great Falls, while 10 lawmakers were in the winning coalition more than 90% of the time.
The average Republican was in the majority 84% of the time, while the average Democrat was 78% of the time, which makes sense because the GOP held the majority in the chamber and could theoretically pass any law without any Democrat support.
Of course, that wasn’t the case, as anyone following the session closely might be aware. A major storyline from the Legislature was that the Senate chamber was effectively run by a working majority coalition of nine Republicans and all Democrats — 27 lawmakers that could pass laws on a bipartisan basis.
By plotting how often a lawmaker voted with the majority of each party, the breakout of the nine Republicans who joined Democrats in many votes is clearly visible.
Note that the axes start around 50% in order to illustrate the differences between lawmakers better.

The Nine are highlighted, and are shown clearly apart from the majority of their caucus, and dragging the “average Republican” statistic over. It’s also clear that two more Republican senators, Mike Yakawich of Billings and Mike Cuffe of Eureka, were also more likely to align with Democrats than most of their GOP members.
This chart also shows that Sen. Dave Fern, D-Whitefish, was more bipartisan that the rest of the Democrat caucus.
Another interesting statistic — Sen. Emrich, shown at the far left side of the chart, voted against Democrats more than anyone else in the Senate, but also voted against his own party more often than anyone except Sen. Russ Tempel, one of The Nine.
Of course, a reminder that these charts show general statistics, so individual votes or subject area votes can’t be inferred.
The House had a much more clear partisan divide. The following chart is a little different, plotting how often a lawmaker voted with the majority party Republicans, and how often they voted on the winning side of an issue.
The trend among Democrats — the more often a lawmaker voted with Republicans, the more likely they were to be on the winning side of an issue — is an obvious one given the Republicans’ 58-42 control of the chamber.
Among Republicans, however, the correlation between how often a representative votes with their party (96% of the time for Rep. Kerri Seekins-Crowe) and how often they voted on the winning side (97% for Rep. Valerie Moore) is much less clear.
The biggest outlier in the chamber is freshman lawmaker Rep. Lukas Schubert of Kalispell, who voted with his own party 4% less often than the next lawmakers, and voted on the losing side of an issue more than any Republican other than Reps. Caleb Hinkle of Belgrade and Kathy Love of Hamilton.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250212_MTLeg-566-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-12 17:07:48.590498

U.S. Chief District Judge […],"(Stock photo by Ivan Balvan/Getty Images)The group seeking to legalize recreational marijuana in Florida has joined a legal challenge to a newly approved crackdown on ballot initiatives.
Smart & Safe Florida over the weekend asked to intervene in a federal lawsuit filed last week by an organization seeking to place Medicaid expansion on the 2026 ballot. U.S. Chief District Judge Mark Walker granted Smart & Safe’s request on Monday. Walker, meanwhile, has set a telephonic conference on May 14 to discuss scheduling for the lawsuit and how to move forward.
Smart & Safe Florida, the group behind the proposed constitutional amendment to legalize recreational use of cannabis in 2024, is actively working to get another measure on the ballot in 2026 and didn’t respond to a request for comment.
But in a lengthy court filing, Smart & Safe Florida called the new restrictions signed into law by Gov. Ron DeSantis “legislative gaslighting” that is not designed to block fraud in the initiative process as contended by the governor and others but will “effectively destroy the people’s right to invoke the citizen initiative.”
The group, which has been largely financed by the medical marijuana giant Trulieve, was behind the 2024 initiative that fell just short of the 60% threshold needed to get approved. They have already started gathering petitions to try to make the 2026 ballot and have more than 200,000 signatures verified.

Smart & Safe Florida says some of the restrictions in the law, including a ban on using out-of-state residents to collect petition signatures, have already hampered their efforts. The organization has halted mailing out petition forms to registered voters due to a new requirement to turn over signed petitions within 10 days.
The law prohibits felons, noncitizens, and non-Florida residents from acting as petition circulators; requires additional personal identifying information for voters signing petition forms and for petition circulators; and includes a requirement to place a financial impact statement drawn by a state-controlled panel on petition forms. 
That financial impact statement requirement violates its First Amendment rights, Smart & Safe Florida argues.
While the Legislature, mostly the House, fought with the governor throughout the session, the Republican leadership did come together to pass HB 1205. DeSantis signed it into law three days after receiving the bill.
The new law stems from a report from the DeSantis administration that alleged fraud in the petition-gathering process.
The January report published by the state’s Office of Election Crimes and Security asserts that more than 100 representatives of the group attempting to pass the abortion-rights amendment last year committed crimes related to gathering petitions.
Meanwhile, Florida Decides Healthcare filed the the lawsuit last week. The group has been working to get its proposed constitutional amendment on expanding Medicaid on the statewide ballot in November 2026.
In a press conference last week, Florida Decides Executive Director Mitch Emerson called the law a “calculated and cowardly attempt by politicians in Tallahassee to rewrite the rules, not to serve the people, but to protect their own power. “

Last month, the four students sued Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement Acting Director of ICE Todd Lyons in federal court.
According to their lawsuit, each of the plaintiffs was admitted to the United States on an F-1 student visa. The lawsuit alleges that on April 10, 2025, ICE abruptly canceled, without explanation, the plaintiffs’ status as students within DHS’ Student and Exchange Visitor Information Systems, or SEVIS, database.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
A few days later, the lawsuit claims, three of the plaintiffs’ visas were revoked without explanation. The three each received identical messages from U.S. embassies, warning them that “remaining in the United States can result in fines, detention, and/or deportation.”
The lawsuit alleges that Homeland Security has initiated a national policy of “coercing international students into self-deportation by leveraging ambiguous student-status revocations, coupled with visa revocation notices and threatening language.”
On April 24, the judge in the case entered a temporary restraining order blocking Homeland Security from detaining or deporting the plaintiffs. The judge is still considering a motion to convert that order to a longer-lasting preliminary injunction.
Late last week, lawyers for Homeland Security submitted to the court a sworn statement from James Hicks, a division chief for the Student and Exchange Visitor Program within ICE.
In his statement, Hicks said the SEVIS database has restored the plaintiffs’ status as students to “active” in keeping with the court’s temporary restraining order. Hicks said that while outsiders can’t see it, there is a new notation added in each student’s electronic record indicating their active status was restored retroactively to the original date of termination.
Lawyers for the students, however, appear to be less than satisfied by Hicks’ assurances.
“Defendants have not backdated the restoration of plaintiffs’ SEVIS status in a manner visible to designated school officers and other immigration agencies,” they responded in a court filing. They noted that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services — which is a different entity from the similarly named Immigration and Customs Enforcement — “may deny a benefit based on a student’s failure to maintain status, and the Department of State, which could deny or revoke a visa at any time, including for failure to maintain status.”
Unless the students’ SEVIS record is modified in a way that is visible to all end-users of the system, Homeland Security and ICE are out of compliance with the court’s temporary restraining order, attorneys for the students argue.
Homeland Security’s promise that it will not attempt again to terminate the four individuals’ status as students provides little protection, they add, pointing to a new policy at ICE and the agency’s limited promise that it won’t try again to terminate the UI students’ status in a manner that’s “based solely” on the criminal record check that triggered the initial attempt.
On April 26, 2025, they point out, ICE implemented a new policy introducing two new grounds for student termination — visa revocation and failure to maintain status – that could now be applied to the four UI students.
ICE and Homeland Security, the students’ lawyers have told the court, “have given no assurance that they will not terminate on these grounds.” The two federal agencies, they add, are “staying notably silent on their new, unlawful grounds for termination.”
The students’ lawyers cite ICE’s shifting policies as further evidence of the need for a preliminary injunction in the case.
The four plaintiffs in the case are Sri Chaitanya Krishna Akondy, an Indian national now working for the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services; Prasoon Kumar, an Indian national and chemical engineering student; Songli Cai, a Chinese national and third-year undergraduate student; and Haoran Yang, a Chinese national and third-year undergraduate and pre-doctorate student.

After his rehabilitative care is completed, Muntz said Kasper will return to his home in south Fargo. No timeline has been set for his return home.
Kasper has served in the North Dakota House of Representatives since 2001. Over his five terms in office, he has sponsored more than 400 bills, which included House Bill 1584 during the 2025 legislative session that provides licensure and regulatory requirements for pharmacy benefit managers.
Also during the 2025 session, Kasper was the primary sponsor on House Bill 1303 that prohibits sanctuary city policies in North Dakota and House Bill 1602, which allows local subdivisions to not participate in the Public Employees Retirement System’s defined contribution plan.
All three of those bills, among others he sponsored and co-sponsored, were signed into law by Gov. Kelly Armstrong.

,DC,2025-05-12 20:17:08+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Noem revokes temporary deportation protections for some Afghans in the U.S.,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/noem-revokes-temporary-deportation-protections-some-afghans-us,,"WASHINGTON — Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem Monday announced about 9,000 Afghans living in the United States who had been protected from deportation will no longer be shielded as of mid-July.After the United States withdrew from Afghanistan in 2022, the Biden administration designated Temporary Protected Status, along with other legal temporary status pathways, for thousands of Afghans who aided the U.S. against the Taliban terrorist group and fled their home country. Thirteen U.S. military members were killed in the chaotic withdrawal at the Kabul airport.About 80,000 Afghans came to the U.S. and settled in various programs that offered legal protections and work authorization. Of that group, 9,000 were designated TPS.TPS is granted to nationals whose home country is deemed too dangerous to return due to violence or disasters.The TPS designation for Afghanistan will expire on May 20 and deportation protections will lift on July 12. The order is likely to face legal challenges, since Noem’s moves to curtail TPS for other nationals have faced lawsuits.“This administration is returning TPS to its original temporary intent,” Noem said in a statement. “We’ve reviewed the conditions in Afghanistan with our interagency partners, and they do not meet the requirements for a TPS designation. Afghanistan has had an improved security situation, and its stabilizing economy no longer prevent(s) them from returning to their home country.”The termination of the status comes as the Trump administration fast-tracked the classification of refugees for white South Africans who landed in the U.S. Monday at Dulles International Airport in Virginia.President Donald Trump signed an executive order in February that noted Afrikaners — an ethnic group in South Africa made up of European descendants, predominantly Dutch — are “victims of unjust racial discrimination” after South Africa’s government passed a land ownership law in an effort to address land dispossession that occurred under apartheid.The Trump administration suspended all refugee services in late January and has resisted a district court's order to reinstate the program, along with contracts to organizations that facilitate refugee resettlement services.Noem said that determination to end TPS for Afghanistan was based on a review from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services on Afghanistan's conditions along with input from the State Department.The Taliban currently control the government and the State Department’s travel advisory for the country is the highest level, a 4, which means it advises against traveling.DHS added in a statement that Noem “further determined that permitting Afghan nationals to remain temporarily in the United States is contrary to the national interest of the United States.”Noem has also ended TPS for Venezuelans and Haitians.The Trump administration asked the U.S. Supreme Court in early May to lift a lower court’s order that reversed Noem's decision to end TPS for one group of Venezuelans.",,,,2025-05-12 17:07:48.590498

According to a report from Reuters, Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, an advisory body created through an executive order, has prompted the firing, severance and early retirement of more than 260,000 government employees. However, U.S. District Judge Susan Illston has issued a temporary restraining order, blocking efforts to restructure the federal government. 
In March, Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced his own DOGE-related cuts, aiming to terminate 20,000 full time employees and reorganize the department’s 28 divisions to 15. The department has also closed its regional offices in Boston, Chicago, New York City, San Francisco and Seattle, halving its total regional facilities.

However, a coalition of 20 attorneys general, including Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, have taken legal action against Kennedy and several department officials, arguing these cuts would functionally dismantle the DHHS. 
If the court doesn’t provide immediate relief, and the case is allowed to play out, Nessel warned that these cuts could cause “immeasurable harm” to the nation and its health system. 
“You’re essentially leaving the agency, as a whole, completely dysfunctional by eliminating so many departments or regions, you know entire offices just wiped off the map and, of course, getting rid of some people with some incredible expertise,” Nessel told the Michigan Advance
The DHHS is eliminating roughly 3,500 employees at the Food and Drug Administration, 2,400 at the Centers for Disease Control, 1,200 at the National Institutes of Health and 300 at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.
It will also work to consolidate the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health, Health Resources and Services Administration, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health under the new Administration for a Healthy America. 
Public health and infectious diseases know no borders, Nessel said, warning that the decision to shutter regional health programs, close CDC labs and close all 10 of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services’ regional offices jeopardizes public health in every community. 
“Also it’s just a flagrant violation of the law. Disregards the separation of powers, and it places this new burden now, of course, on the states, because there are certain things that you rely upon the federal government to do, especially in terms of coordinating efforts between the states,” Nessel said. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“Let’s say you have an outbreak of a new variant in bird flu that could impact the entire country. Maybe that happens in Vermont. Is Vermont supposed to coordinate that response with Michigan? You know, it’s the CDC that does that. How are we supposed to make up for that?” Nessel questioned. 
While the state has its own lab testing capabilities, the federal government and its labs act as a conduit for sharing data with the states and across the nation, as well as monitoring other countries. 
“They fill this incredibly important role in terms of preventing the next global pandemic and mitigating it here in Michigan. And it’s a burden that, frankly, the state simply can’t sustain. It’s the reason why we have a federal government,” Nessel said. 
Additionally, it’s the federal government’s job to ensure its laws are enforced, Nessel said, and Congress delegates money to ensure those laws are complied with. Deciding to withhold those funds and cut staffing without regard for which workers are essential, and shutting down offices without regard for whether the department can continue to comply with federal law not only violates the law and the Constitution in a myriad of ways, Nessel contends, but it compromises the safety and health of people in Michigan. 
While Kennedy said the intent of the cuts was to address waste and inefficiency within the department, Nessel said the argument doesn’t hold water due to the way the DHHS approached its firings. 
“It’s not as if it took any significant period of time to evaluate, you know, is this really a necessary function of the government, and do we really need this to fulfill the mission of this agency? There were no determinations of any kind made like that” Nessel said, pointing to comments Kennedy made to the media where he admitted 20% of cuts at the agency were a mistake, and would need to be reinstated. 
He also admitted he had forgone a line-by-line review of each employee’s jobs because “it takes too long, and you lose political momentum.”
Among those cuts were doctors and the administrator of the World Trade Center Health program, which certify illnesses in first responders and survivors of the 9/11 terrorist attacks as part of the requirements of the Zadroga Act, with the New York Daily News reporting nearly all 16 employees cut from the program had been rehired as of May 7, including the program’s director, James Howard. 
“If you were more careful and cautious before you fired them in the first place, maybe we wouldn’t have this issue,” Nessel said. 
The case filed by the attorneys general points to several other examples of offices impacted by the cuts, including the Food and Drug Administration missing a vaccine application deadline and canceling a critical test for the bird flu virus, suspending the testing program for a year. 
The case also points to Kennedy’s anti-vaccine views and history of promoting misinformation about vaccination. 
According to the filing, some FDA employees were told to go home following the March 27 downsizing announcement and prepare for the possibility that they would not be back. If they received a termination email, they would lose access to the building.

“Beginning in the early morning of April 1, 2025, HHS employees in all offices, administrations, agencies and sub-agencies began to receive termination notices. Some employees had not seen their early morning termination email before leaving for the office, and were surprised when they arrived at work to find their access cards had been deactivated,” the case reads. 
“Many notices contained errors. For example, some listed incorrect information about workers’ recent performance ratings. At FDA, the listed point of contact for the Equal Employment Opportunity office had departed a month earlier,” it says. 
While this case doesn’t directly address that lack of support and protection for employees, several unions and groups of federal employees have taken legal action on these concerns. 
“It’s embarrassing and disturbing to see any workers treated like this, but especially, you know, ones that have worked so hard to protect the American people,” Nessel said.
She also pointed to the ways these firings would impact the economy, calling them “penny wise but pound foolish.”
In the announcement, Kennedy promised to lower costs for taxpayers, with the 10,000 person layoff expected to cut down on $1.8 billion a year. However, Nessel said these costs would crop up in other ways.
“What has a bigger impact on the economy than people’s health, you know? If people are too sick to be able to work, that’s a problem,” Nessel said, noting that widespread infectious disease can have a devastating impact on the economy. 
“It’s not just that we’re not really saving money. We’re going to lose an unknown amount of money, an untold amount of money, if people who could otherwise have been healthy are not healthy,” Nessel said. 
While Michigan is still assembling its state-specific declarations, these firings will also impact the state’s efforts on issues like mental health and create issues in how they distribute resources within their budgets, Nessel said. 
“If we’re trying to prioritize and say, ‘Well, how much money are we going to spend on substance abuse, or how much money are we going to spend on mental health treatment?’ It’s kind of important to know how much of it you’re going to get from the federal government. And because this is done in such a chaotic manner, it’s really hard to know,” Nessel said.
In addition to their case on the mass firings, Nessel and 23 other attorneys general filed suit against Kennedy and the DHHS for terminating almost $11 billion in critical public health grants across the country. 
That includes $379.3 million in grant funding awarded and owed to the State of Michigan for certain mental health and substance abuse grants and grants from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention meant to support infectious disease control and vaccinations for children and vulnerable adults, among other programs.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Facetune_24-01-2024-20-49-21-1024x726.jpg,,,2025-05-12 17:07:48.590498

Cooperative Extension) The Farm Service Agency has closed two local offices and cut five staff in the region, state official says. North Carolina is looking for ways to fill the gaps.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture has just one staffer providing guidance for farmers’ disaster loans across 23 North Carolina counties, a state official said Monday.
USDA’s Farm Service Agency is charged with distributing aid after storms like Hurricane Helene wipe out crops. But Emily Gangi, chief deputy for the governor’s Helene recovery office, said they now had a threadbare presence in the region after the White House made cuts.
“You heard me right,” Gangi said. “One loan officer for 23 counties.”
The agency has closed two local offices, according to Gangi, and cut five staff. And there’s currently a hiring freeze in place.
USDA’s skeletal staffing could further complicate the flow of federal money to farmers and ranchers in the mountains. The Farm Service Agency oversees an array of disaster loan programs, several of which have deadlines and sign-ups in the coming months.
North Carolina has submitted a proposal to receive more than half a billion dollars from USDA through a block grant program. And local governments have until the end of the month to apply for money to clear debris and repair drainage infrastructure. Over the summer and early fall, applications will open for other programs dealing with commodities and livestock loss.
Gangi said her team was exploring options for the state to help “if the federal government is not going to staff these programs.”
“Our farmers need more attention and more support,” she said.
Ronald Garrett, who was appointed earlier this month as North Carolina’s state director for the Farm Service Agency, did not answer a call Monday. The U.S. Department of Agriculture did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.
The FSA cuts are another obstacle for state officials looking to send as much federal money westward as quickly as possible. A key office within the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development that handles disaster recovery has reportedly prepared to cut most of its staff. And new leadership at FEMA, an agency the president has mused about abolishing, has reduced the cost-share between the federal government and state.
North Carolina lawmakers have also set out money for a state crop loss program. Applications were set to close May 4 but will remain open for another week. Matt Calabria, who leads the governor’s Helene recovery office, said there had been fewer applications from western farmers than anticipated.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Ag-extension-helene.jpg,,,2025-05-12 16:07:20.574881

The second one is because Joe’s reputation has been damaged irreparably by the actions of the town and the only way that can be recovered is through a civil lawsuit.”The latest legal salvos follow a civil lawsuit Swanson filed earlier this month in Windsor County Superior Court seeking $5 million in punitive damages, alleging that he was unlawfully ousted from his job and “maliciously maligned” by town officials whom, he suggested in court documents, treat heterosexual employees differently in disciplinary matters.READ MORE





 


Woodstock police chief tries to hold on to his job as municipal manager seeks demotion 

by Valley News 
March 21, 2025, 4:19 pmMarch 21, 2025, 4:27 pm 



The lawsuit alleges that the trustees had no legal basis to demote the police chief under his contract with the town and lobs back counterexamples of alleged conflicts of interest, favoritism, secret dealings and ethical lapses by some trustees as they sought to push Swanson out of his job.The “Findings of Fact,” which the trustees initially balked at publicly releasing, incorporates many of the same complaints testified by Woodstock Police Department employees during a March public hearing held before the trustees at Swanson’s request to challenge Duffy’s decision to bump him down to the lowest rank on the department’s ladder.Trustees Chair Seton McIlroy said via email to the Valley News that although she couldn’t speak for the other members of the Board, “I chose to vote ‘yes’ because I believe it’s appropriate under the circumstances.”(Regardless, the Board’s 4-0 vote of reversal — one trustee was absent — to release the document publicly was rendered moot when Swanson’s attorney attached it as an exhibit to the preliminary injunction motion).Over the course of 14-plus hours of hearings, several members of the police department, including Sgt. Chris O’Keefe, the department’s No. 2 and currently interim chief, described incidents of Swanson’s loose management style, which in their view contributed to tension and low morale among department personnel during his 15 months as police chief.Police department employees testified that Swanson frequently had “unnotified absences” from work, did not adhere to the hours as specified in his contract, could be hard to reach, failed to respond to investigatory matters in a timely or thorough fashion, was inconsistent or unresponsive in exercising discipline, could be dismissive of coworkers’ concerns, reported for duty out of full uniform, and kept a “messy” office, among other complaints and infractions.Dissatisfaction reached a boiling point earlier this year when both of the police department’s employee bargaining units — each of which has only a handful of members — issued “no confidence” votes against Swanson and asked Duffy, the municipal manager, to find a new police chief.The chief’s work habits, style and inconsistent communication with the five-officer police force, dispatchers and administrative staff led to low morale within the department, the trustees wrote in their “Findings” report — even though, they noted, Duffy had given Swanson a largely positive review in his first performance evaluation.(Duffy said he only became aware of discontent within the department following Swanson’s performance review).Swanson — who did not dispute his office was messy — has countered that the complaints were distorted, taken out of context or misinterpreted reactions to things he said. He has said he considered department morale to be overall “high, at least on most occasions,” despite “some ripples and bumps.”He also presented evidence that he responded to more than 900 off-hour dispatcher calls during his 15 months as police chief, including on weekends, holidays and vacation.But, based on testimony from Duffy and police department personnel given during the March hearing and after reviewing documents submitted from attorneys for both sides, the trustees concurred that the municipal manager had made the right call.Duffy’s “decision to demote Swanson was based not on one particular violation,” they wrote in the “Findings” report. “Rather, (Duffy) based his decision on the totality of complaints and the combined evidence regarding Swanson’s conduct and performance as police chief.”The municipal manager “believes the chief of police must be an ambassador to the community and must provide leadership, direction of Police Department strategies and related policies, training (and) supervision of employees, and discipline where warranted and … must be able to build relationships in the community and with employees,” the report said.Ultimately, the trustees concluded, Swanson “did not meet Duffy’s expectations that he function as a role model while serving as chief of police.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Woodstock trustees’ report says former police chief failed to serve as town ‘role model’.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/woodstock-joe-swanson.jpg,,,2025-05-12 16:07:20.574881

(Photo courtesy of University of West Florida)University of West Florida President Martha Saunders will resign months ahead of the expiration of her contract on Dec. 31, she announced Monday morning. She has served as president since 2017. 
The resignation came after Gov. Ron DeSantis made clear his intention to overhaul the Pensacola university, including controversial trustee appointments and criticisms of university research and student activities. 
“In accordance with the terms of my contract, and after thoughtful reflection, I have made the decision to conclude my presidency,” Saunders wrote in a letter to the university community. “This was not an easy choice. I know it may come as a surprise, and for some, a disappointment. Please know I did not make it lightly. I believe this is the right time — for me and for UWF.”
DeSantis (and Board of Governors) appointees to the UWF Board of Trustees caused a stir this legislative session, with one rejected by the Senate and two others resigning before the Senate could vote on their confirmation. 
DeSantis said last month there are “big changes” in store for UWF while bragging about the political overhaul of New College of Florida.
DeSantis said UWF has some of the “most liberal programs in the state” and that Florida will not tolerate “indoctrination camps” during an April 15 news conference about Hope Florida in Pensacola. “Buckle up,” DeSantis said to UWF.
UWF stakeholders and some senators have questioned how liberal the university could be, considering the significantly higher number of registered Republicans than Democrats in the counties the school primarily serves.
Senators asked the UWF trustees during April confirmation hearings if they thought major changes were needed in regards to administrative or political problems at the university. Most said they weren’t aware of any major changes that needed to be made, the Phoenix reported.

Trustee concerns
Since DeSantis’ “big changes” comment, he appointed Zack Smith, a fellow at the Heritage Foundation, to the UWF board last week. DeSantis appointed Smith to the Pensacola State College board in February, too. 
Days after his appointment, Smith, a Pensacola local, described a “pattern of problematic actions” at the university under Saunders’ presidency.
During a UWF trustee meeting Thursday, Smith questioned Saunders about university actions he found “deeply troubling.”
A student-organized drag show presented in partnership with the university’s office of equity and diversity in 2019 and UWF libraries recommending reading “How to be an Anti-Racist” by Ibram X. Kendi in 2023 were among actions Smith took exception to. 
Smith said he was not fully satisfied with Saunders’ responses to his questions about those topics. 
Smith was asked by WEAR News on Saturday if the goal of the board was to oust Saunders. He did not directly answer the question; instead, he said the duty of the board is to do what is best for students. 
“Over the past several years, we’ve accomplished extraordinary things together: record enrollments, historic fundraising, national recognition, and a campus culture that puts students first,” Saunders wrote. “We’ve met challenges head-on and kept our values intact. I could not be more proud of what we’ve built.”
Her letter does not mention a leave date. “I will work closely with the Board of Trustees and the campus leadership to ensure a smooth transition. My commitment to this University and its people remains strong through my final day in office — and beyond,” she wrote.
Senators responded to public pushback against trustee appointments Gates Garcia, Adam Kissel, and Scott Yenor. Those appointees, and five others, were part of DeSantis’ (and the Board of Governors’) push to change UWF.
Yenor, a political science professor from Idaho, director at the Claremont Institute, and a Heritage Foundation writer, was elected chair of the board earlier this year but resigned following an uproar in the UWF community. He has a history of controversial comments about women and the LGBTQ community.
Other newly appointed trustees voted for Yenor to be chair, and senators asked them to defend that vote while considering their confirmations.
Garcia, a Tampa resident, resigned after facing the curious senators and Kissel was rejected, with senators citing their desire for more local members on the board. Sen. Gayle Harrell said the Senate is “closely watching” the UWF board.
Officials in the DeSantis administration raised concern over a UWF research grant they called a “social justice grant.”
According to DeSantis communications director Bryan Griffin, on X, the grant was eliminated as part of the Florida DOGE initiative.
The $800,000 grant from the National Science Foundation was called Educating Science and Mathematics Majors to Teach with Social Justice Models in High-Needs Schools. The university said it has used about 25% of the grant, WUWF reported.
The university said social justice was not incorporated in the program despite the title of the grant. The grant had been funding a water quality sampling study, the university said.
Saunders’ contract base salary is $536,273 and up to a 20% performance bonus. Her contract requires 90 days written notice to resign, although the board can waive that wait period.
Saunders may return to her job as a tenured professor, according to her contract. 
DeSantis’ office did not respond to a request for comment Monday afternoon.

Kim Reynolds’ announcement that she will not seek reelection in 2026.

Former state Rep. Brad Sherman is the only Republican to have officially launched his campaign for governor, which he announced in February before Reynolds had exited the race. But alongside Feenstra, others are expected to join the race — state Sen. Mike Bousselot, R-Ankeny, launched an exploratory committee for the governor’s race in April. Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird and House Speaker Pat Grassley have also said they are considering a run for the governor’s seat in 2026, but have not officially made any decisions on running.
Feenstra is the only member of Iowa’s all-Republican House delegation to say he was considering a run — U.S. Reps. Ashley Hinson, Mariannette Miller-Meeks and Zach Nunn all said they do not plan to run for the position. He had told reporters at an April Marshalltown event that it was a “fair statement” to say he was keeping his options open on a gubernatorial campaign, according to the Des Moines Register.
The 4th District, representing much of northwest Iowa, is considered a conservative stronghold in the state. Feenstra has represented the district in Congress since the 2020 election, when he beat former U.S. Rep. Steve King in the Republican primary. He served as a state senator from 2009 until his election to federal office, and as Sioux County treasurer from 2006 to 2008.
Iowa Democratic Party Chair Rita Hart released a statement Monday criticizing Feenstra following the filing for a gubernatorial campaign.
“Whether in Washington or Des Moines, Congressman Randy Feenstra has been a reliable foot soldier for the misguided partisans and insiders ruining our state,” Hart said. “Meanwhile, Iowa is now 49th in economic growth and losing manufacturing jobs while Rep. Feenstra has failed to deliver a farm bill, voted to gut Medicaid, and supported Iowa’s unaccountable voucher program that’s jeopardizing Iowa’s fiscal budget. We need a new direction and Randy Feenstra is just more of the same failed leadership.”

(Photo by Jacob Fischler/States Newsroom)OKLAHOMA CITY – Gov. Kevin Stitt accused lawmakers of acting “bananas” and wrote over the weekend that they needed to stop “monkeying around” and pass tax cuts.
The Republican, who has ramped up his calls for income tax cuts in recent days, appeared to try to poke fun at lawmakers as he vetoed legislation creating a special license plate benefitting the Oklahoma City Zoo.
He also on Saturday signed a number of measures, including one that could ban some drag shows.
Senate Bill 837 would have allowed Service Oklahoma to enter an agreement with the Oklahoma Zoological Society to use its logo. The Oklahoma Zoological Society, a nonprofit which supports the Oklahoma City Zoo, to receive not more than $20 for each plate sold. 
The measure, which also created a motorcycle plate for Tulsa’s Greenwood Historical District and allowed $27 of the fee paid for the plate to go to the Tulsa Juneteenth Festival, was one of seven bills he vetoed on Saturday.
“It’s bananas that our Legislature has time to dedicate to creating more novelty license plates but doesn’t have the time to pass tax cuts,” Stitt’s veto message said. “The Legislature should stop monkeying around and address the elephant in the room. It is time to boa (sic) up and pass tax cuts.”
Oklahoma has over 200 specialty license plate options ranging from those that honor the military to those supporting various colleges, occupations, groups and causes. One of those is for the Tulsa Zoo.
“The Legislature’s overzealous commitment to vanity license plates has resulted in a bloated catalogue full of taxpayer funded advertisements for special interest groups,” Stitt wrote.
Stitt has been pushing lawmakers to reduce the state’s 4.75% income tax rate and find a way toward elimination.
In the past week, he’s posted social media videos praising 17 state senators, who he said support cutting taxes, and of school-aged children, being urged on by an adult, chanting “tax cut, tax cut” on his official Facebook page. 
Stitt used social media to explain why he had signed other measures, including House Bill 1217, calling it a “no brainer.”
“We are basically banning drag shows in front of kids,” Stitt said.
House Bill 1217 makes it a crime to engage in adult performances that have obscenity, or permit them, on public property where a minor could view them.
“Go check out and see who voted against that bill,” Stit said. “Crazy.”
Critics said the measure is unconstitutional.

Photo by Kevin O’Connor/VTDiggerVermont’s Roman Catholic Diocese, now seeking to reorganize its depleting finances in U.S. Bankruptcy Court after settling 67 priest misconduct lawsuits, is bracing for a new wave of child sex abuse claims.The state’s largest religious denomination paid out $34.5 million to survivors in the two decades between when news of a nationwide scandal broke in 2002 and its filing for Chapter 11 protection last fall.As part of the bankruptcy process, all pending and future lawsuits have been placed on hold, with Judge Heather Cooper inviting accusers who haven’t reported abuse before to join the case as potential creditors.As a result, 118 people have submitted confidential claims, records show — almost double the number of previously settled lawsuits.The bankruptcy court doesn’t have the authority to hold hearings on any of the allegations, which are sealed from the public and the press. Instead, the judge has scheduled a non-evidentiary “presentation of survivor statements” for Wednesday at 10 a.m. at Burlington’s Federal Building.READ MORE
“For many survivors, it took years and a lot of courage to come forward, so when the diocese filed for bankruptcy, it robbed those survivors of their opportunity to stand in front of a jury of their peers,” said Brittany Michael, a lawyer for a federally appointed committee representing creditors with abuse claims. “We know that the opportunity to speak in court can be an important part of the healing journey,” Michael said. “The survivors’ statements are a way to at least tell their story.”The diocese, facing allegations of priest misconduct dating as far back as 1950, is the nation’s 40th Catholic entity to seek bankruptcy protection, it notes on an explainer page on its website.Under federal law, the diocese must present the court with a tally of its financial assets and liabilities and petition for Chapter 11 help. The judge, in turn, will decide whether to allow church leaders to develop a reorganization plan that would require approval from both the court and creditors.Seeking “full disclosure and transparency,” abuse claimants are seeking church records detailing not only a reported $35 million tied to the diocese’s headquarters and its state-level holdings but also all the community operations it oversees, starting with 63 parishes with an estimated collective worth of $500 million.The resulting findings are expected to spark future debate on whether abuse claimants and other creditors will be limited to compensation from the church’s headquarters or also could be reimbursed through local assets.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont’s Roman Catholic Diocese faces 118 more clergy misconduct claims.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/VTD-Catholic-18-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-12 16:07:20.574881

(Kansas Reflector screen capture of Kansas Legislature's YouTube channel)TOPEKA — The Kansas Legislature’s auditors reported Monday the state Department of Commerce didn’t consistently adhere to internal evaluation processes and maintain transparency in selecting recipients of $99 million in federal infrastructure and economic development funding.
Kristen Rottinghaus, deputy auditor of the Kansas Division of Post Audit, said the review raised questions about the commerce department’s compliance in early 2022 with its method of scoring the 250 qualifying applications and the authority wielded by Secretary David Toland to include his personal analysis of applications in wake of the devastating COVID-19 pandemic.
Eligible applications were to be scored by two state agency staff members, but in some instances only one score existed or reviewers left certain questions on scoring sheets blank. Absence of that information could have disadvantaged applicants, the audit report said.
“We think these inconsistencies are important,” said Rottinghaus, who said auditors took a deep dive into 10 applicants.
The Department of Commerce hired a private company to perform initial screening of 455 applications submitted by cities, counties, colleges and universities, businesses and nonprofits. The idea was to inject funding into upgrading business parks, improving health care facilities, modernizing infrastructure as well as invest in other development initiatives.
Applications came from 84 of the state’s 105 counties and sought a total of $1.7 billion. About 200 were discounted because they didn’t meet minimum requirements. The commerce department deployed a scoring rubric and subjective assessments tied to geography, project type and need to narrow the list to 35 projects in 24 counties.
Awards ranged from $13,500 to $10 million, but two counties in Kansas won 29% of the projects and 49% of available money.
Johnson County, the state’s most populous county, received six awards for $33 million. The second-biggest recipient was Butler County with four projects valued at $15.5 million. The population of Butler County ranks 8th among counties in Kansas. The county is represented by Senate President Ty Masterson, an Andover Republican contemplating a Republican campaign for governor in 2026.
Sen. Mike Thompson, R-Shawnee, said the Department of Commerce devoted a lot of time to the application scoring system but he alleged Toland “sort of ignored it.” Toland, who serves as commerce secretary and as lieutenant governor in Kansas, is among potential Democratic candidates for governor.
“Was the scoring system more for appearance or just to give cover for the secretary to decide whoever he wanted to give the money to?” said Thompson, who also questioned whether some projects receiving funding were a higher priority than proposals rejected.
“It seems like it was just willy-nilly granting money,” he said. “It just seems like this was rushed and not well-though-out.”
The grant program, known as Building a Strong Economy or BASE, was established by the so-called SPARK executive committee that included Toland, Masterson, then-House Speaker Ron Ryckman and several appointees of state government officials. SPARK was authorized by Senate Bill 159, which was passed in spring 2021 to handle allocation of an avalanche of federal relief funding.
In terms of the Kansas award recipients, 16 of 35 projects received at least 90% of the amount requested. Eleven of 35 projects secured less than half the request. Twenty of 24 recipient counties had a single project. In addition to multiple grants secured by Johnson and Butler counties, Shawnee County received three grants and Wyandotte County was awarded two grants.
Rachel Willis, director of legislative affairs at the Department of Commerce, said the agency rapidly carried out the grant process in response to a global pandemic that wreaked havoc on the Kansas economy.
“The BASE program has successfully provided funding to support key infrastructure development projects across the state to help expand the state’s base of businesses and residents,” she said. “This was a challenging task given the significant number of applications received and the importance of getting the money into the communities quickly.”
Willis said the Department of Commerce was committed to geographic distribution when making the final grant awards, which meant not all projects receiving the highest technical score could be funded.
“If we only evaluated strictly on technical scores, only a couple regions of the state would have received nearly all the grants, leaving the state’s other regions with nothing,” she said.
Willis said the commerce secretary had authority under state law to evaluate applications “using a broader scope and breadth of factors,” including whether the applicant was in a rural, suburban or urban setting. Toland also took into account diversification in the types of project, potential impact a project would have on the community and how the project aligned with the state’s strategic economic development plans, she said.
The audit report, however, said public transparency was compromised by failure of the Department of Commerce to document Toland’s process of making final decisions on grant awards.
Willis acknowledged human error found its way into documentation of the selection process, but noted the audit “confirmed there was no wrongdoing in the selection process by the agency.”
Rep. Sean Tarwater, R-Stilwell, pressed the state auditor on this point, asker Rottinghaus directly whether the review uncovered fraud.
“This was just assessing their process,” she said. “We can’t speak to any fraud.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Rottinghaus-of-legislative-post-audit-1024x450.png,,,2025-05-12 16:07:20.574881

(Photo by 10'000 Hours/ Getty Images)The federal government has terminated $35 million of funding that would have provided digital skills and online safety for rural Mainers, veterans and low-income residents. 
The National Telecommunications and Information Administration told the Maine Connectivity Authority, the agency leading broadband expansion in the state, that it was terminating three grants as of Friday. According to a news release from the state agency, the grants funded programs that would have served nearly 130,000 people by helping improve digital skills, provide internet safety education and ensure people have affordable devices. 
Maine Connectivity Authority (MCA) has been preparing to use these funds since 2022 through the creation of the state’s Digital Equity Plan. They came from the bipartisan Digital Equity Act of 2021 that President Donald Trump called “racist” and “totally unconstitutional” the day before MCA received the termination notice. 
“This announcement is deeply disappointing, and MCA is exploring Maine’s options to respond to the legality of the grant termination,” said President Andrew Butcher.
Maine wasn’t alone with these cuts, with grant terminations nationwide, the release said. 
The agency conducted a statewide survey in 2023 that showed more than nine in 10 people are worried about staying safe online and don’t feel they have the tools to protect themselves and their families. Additionally, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston found more than 2,000 people in Maine fell victim to internet crimes that year, costing more than $31 million.
The three affected grants include $10 million to fund a statewide device donation and refurbishment campaign, as well as another $11 million for the Greater Portland Council of Governments to provide digital services for municipal governments, device programs, digital skills education, business support programs and more. 
“These programs are not abstract policy initiatives — they are lifelines for thousands of Maine residents who depend on digital access for education, healthcare, employment and basic communication,” said Kristina Egan, executive director of the Greater Portland Council of Governments.
The remaining $13.8 million was supposed to help the National Digital Equity Center partner with over a dozen community organizations throughout the state to provide digital skills, technical support, telehealth access and affordable device programs.
While the cuts could disproportionally affect older Mainers, small businesses, students, veterans and low-income residents, the programs affected are separate from the state and federally funded broadband infrastructure grants.

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)For the second time in as many years, South Dakota Republican U.S. Sen. Mike Rounds has formally asked the federal Department of the Interior to establish a tribal law enforcement training center in his home state.
This year’s request took the form of a letter from Rounds to Doug Burgum, who served as North Dakota’s governor before ascending to the role of Interior secretary for the Trump administration.
Rounds and U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson of South Dakota agitated for a regional Bureau of Indian Affairs law enforcement training center last year. Johnson had previously pushed for field hearings that would bring members of Congress to tribal areas to learn the challenges of policing them.
Tribes seek youth police academy to fill open jobs

Their advocacy last year dovetailed with the controversy sparked by comments from former South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem Noem, who’s now secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. She said Native American reservations in South Dakota were overrun by Mexican drug cartel members and that some tribal leaders were benefiting from it. She also said that unemployment and absent parents had left Native American children bereft of hope.
Leaders of all nine tribes in the state voted to ban her from their lands in the months that followed. Some have since rescinded the bans.
Noem, who said a lack of tribal law enforcement exacerbates public safety problems, worked with Attorney General Marty Jackley to sponsor an additional state-level basic law enforcement training academy session last summer that gave priority to Native American recruits.
Typically, potential Native American officers from South Dakota attend 12 weeks of basic law enforcement training in Artesia, New Mexico — 1,000 miles or more from home.
The 11 recruits trained in Pierre last year were able to get their certification to work in policing in South Dakota, but were also given the chance to remotely complete an additional BIA training module called the Bridge Training Program that would typically take place in New Mexico.
As Noem sparred with tribes rhetorically and pushed to train more tribal officers in South Dakota’s state training academy, the congressional delegation pushed the BIA to establish a regional training center in Pierre.
Such a center, they argued, would allow potential Native American police officers to train during the week and return home to their families on weekends.
Rounds reiterated that point in Monday’s letter to Burgum.
“Many tribal law enforcement leaders believe that the distance to the New Mexico facility is a barrier to recruitment,” Rounds wrote.
He suggested that an existing training center could serve as a satellite training location for tribal policing, and pointed to last summer’s training in Pierre as an “encouraging” sign that such a setup can work.

(Photo by Shaun Griswold / Source NM)As the U.S. government considers cutting funding for the nation’s most prominent food benefits program, advocates in New Mexico recommend the state government step in to protect and expand it.
Nonprofit child advocacy organization New Mexico Voices for Children on Friday released a report outlining five recommendations for New Mexico to improve its Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP), commonly known as food stamps.
The U.S. House Committee on Agriculture is expected on Tuesday to hold a “markup” hearing to discuss how Republicans plan to cut federal funding for SNAP.

The report, written by NM Voices Senior Research and Policy Analyst Emily Wildau, notes that while the U.S. Department of Agriculture administers SNAP, state governments manage applications, certify households and issue monthly benefits to participants’ Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) cards.
The proposed Republican cuts to SNAP, Medicaid and other programs “will mean less food assistance for families and lead directly to higher costs for groceries, increased hunger, and significant harm for both local economies and state spending priorities over time,” the report continues.
In New Mexico, one quarter the population receives SNAP benefits, the highest rate of any state in the U.S., according to the report, and out of all SNAP recipients in New Mexico, 38% are children and 62% are working. Overall, between 2015 and 2019, SNAP lifted an average of 60,000 New Mexicans, including 25,000 children, above the poverty line each yea,
“It is critical that advocates work to protect SNAP benefits and enact important reforms at the state level that can counter these federal attacks,” the report states.
Wildau’s report contains five recommendations on how the state of New Mexico should support the SNAP program. First among them: codify the state’s SNAP Outreach Plan into state law, which would require the state Health Care Authority to submit an annual outreach plan to the federal government.
This would allow nonprofits working with the state government to use federal matching funds to distribute food to SNAP recipients, the report says.

Both chambers of the New Mexico Legislature unanimously passed this proposal in the most recent legislative session but Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham vetoed it.
The governor wrote that the legislation is unnecessary because 90% of New Mexicans who are eligible for the benefits already receive them.

“We continue to invite collaboration with advocacy groups to discuss ways to make meaningful improvements to our programs,” the governor wrote.
NM Voices also recommends that New Mexico streamline the SNAP application process so eligible New Mexicans have lower barriers to benefits. Currently, someone can initially apply for SNAP online but cannot report changes in income or renew their benefits online, the report says.
Last fall, New Mexico extended the SNAP exit threshold to 200% of the federal poverty level, up from 165% last year. This means people can continue to receive SNAP even if their income is twice the federal poverty line.

Paige Knight, research director at NM Voices, told Source NM in an interview that the group’s recommendations could change as the proposed federal cuts become reality.
“Whatever happens federally, we may need to update some of those recommendations based on what’s feasible, what changed federally, and make adjustments,” she said.
The report’s third recommendation is for New Mexico to continue softening the SNAP benefit cliff, which is when someone loses eligibility for benefits when their income exceeds the program’s income eligibility limit. The state government could create its own SNAP benefit for households that have recently lost eligibility after increasing their incomes above 200% of the federal poverty lines, and provide an extended benefit for several months to allow families to continue saving money as they transition out of SNAP, Wildau wrote.
New Mexico could also expand the program to reach more people by treating child support payments as an income exclusion rather than a tax deduction, which would lower a household’s taxable income, the report notes.
Finally, the report recommends New Mexico provide SNAP to immigrant households with children who are ineligible for the benefits under federal regulations, and provide protections and education to immigrant families who can receive SNAP but may fear repercussions “due to the changing federal landscape.”

On Feb. 28, Caruso was sentenced to 20 months in federal prison, and was ordered to pay forfeitures and fines totaling roughly $816,000, according to federal court documents.Caruso reported Friday to a federal minimum security satellite camp in Otisville, New York to serve his 20-month sentence. In an interview, Caruso said he intends to return to Ludlow after his prison term is finished and said he plans to use the time while incarcerated to seek permits to build condominiums, houses and hotels on his land ownings surrounding the golf course.Caruso was initially set to surrender April 8, but he was granted an extension to April 22 to “arrange accommodations for his businesses,” according to a request letter filed with the court. On April 18, Caruso was granted a second extension of his surrender date to May 9 for additional time for business arrangements. The request letter filed to the court by Caruso’s lawyer stated that “26 of his company accounts have been cancelled, in addition to his personal and business credit cards.” In an interview on April 23, Caruso said he had several outstanding work-related tasks, including initiating new lines of credit and helping with the engineering phase for a condominium project at the Fox Run Golf Course, before his surrender date. In interviews a week prior, Caruso said staff are in place to manage his businesses in Ludlow — including the Fox Run Golf Club and his restaurants — while he serves his sentence. Caruso expects this to be the “busiest year ever” for his various establishments, with the golf club opening for the spring and summer season and his restaurants “all running properly.”Caruso’s 37 limited liability companies based in Ludlow will remain registered under his name as principal manager, he said, except for Sam’s Steakhouse, which the Federal Emergency Management Agency intends to buy out after the building sustained significant flood damage. Caruso’s other business that sustained flood damage, Mr. Darcy’s Bar and Burger, is expected to reopen later this year as a private Bourbon and Cigar bar, he said. In a Feb. 14 letter addressed to the U.S. District Judge Lewis J. Liman, Caruso expressed remorse for his criminal conduct and wrote that his actions were influenced by a downturn in the economy during the Covid-19 pandemic.“My conduct has risked everything I worked so hard to achieve in life. I have also risked the future of my businesses, and more importantly, the future of my employees,” Caruso wrote. “I have lost construction jobs, two lines of credits with two different banks, consulting contracts, multiple credit cards, reputational damage, golf members, customers and endless opportunities.”The Ludlow municipal manager, the Ludlow selectboard vice chair and the executive director of the Okemo Valley Regional Chamber of Commerce said they had no comment on Caruso’s sentencing and the potential impacts on Ludlow’s community and local economy. Read the story on VTDigger here:  Ludlow business owner begins 20-month term in federal prison.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/fox_run_golf_club_28_select_1_med.jpg,,,2025-05-12 16:07:20.574881

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current) Rhode Islanders’ health care spending rose 7.8% in 2023 over the previous year — a new state record — thanks in part to more hospital visits and the popularity of pricey weight-loss drugs, according to a new report out Monday.
The finding exceeded the 6% rate anticipated by the Office of the Health Insurance Commissioner (OHIC), which published the annual report on health care spending and quality.  The office is charged with multiple duties regulating the Ocean State’s health insurance plans, including data collection and yearly review of health insurers’ proposed rate increases.
Hospital discharges, outpatient visits, and prescription fills are some of the data points that help OHIC determine utilization, or the overall volume of medical services used by Rhode Islanders. In 2023, Rhode Islanders amassed a total of $9.52 billion in health care spending, or $9,892 per person. All three of the state’s major insurance markets — commercial, Medicare, and Medicaid — went past the 6% cap. The growth cap had already been enlarged from the rate used from 2019 to 2022, which was 3.2%. 
“We expected growth, but we observed much higher growth than we expected,” Commissioner Cory King said. “It wasn’t just price driven, which would account for inflation, but it was utilization driven.”
A significant driver for increased spending: weight-loss drugs such as semaglutide, sold as Ozempic and Wegovy. The drugs belong to a family of type-2 diabetes management drugs called GLP-1 agonists, which work by suppressing glucagon, a hormone that raises blood sugar. 
In 2023, a total of eight branded GLP-1 drugs comprised $63.2 million in insurance claims, compared to $50.7 million for 122 other drugs in the diabetes and weight-loss categories combined.
That’s not all that surprising, given that the drugs cost about $1,000 a dose, King said. 
“The most frustrating part of my job — and I think other state leaders across the country will agree — is that states just don’t have control over drug pricing,” King said. 
The 7.8% increase is the highest since OHIC began analyzing spending data in 2019. The office calculates an approximate, annual ceiling for the growth of Rhode Islanders’ health care costs, leaving room to accommodate inflation, wages and other economic factors. But prediction could only go so far in a year when inflation soared to its highest in 40 years.
Commercially insured patients saw an increase of about $6,735 per person (a 6.9% increase) and Medicaid patients paid $7,678 more (a 6.7% increase). Medicare represented an 8.7% increase in per person spending, for about $14,400 annual spending per enrollee — something of an anomaly, King thought, as the Medicare growth rate has historically been “relatively low.” 
Spending also differed by insurers, according to OHIC’s estimates. In the commercial market, both Tufts Health Plan and Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Rhode Island were under the cost growth target, at a little under 5% growth. United Health Care saw an 8.5% increase in spending, and Neighborhood Health Plan rose 17.4%. 
Rhode Island’s spending growth was in line with other states that saw unexpected jumps: Connecticut experienced 7.8% growth, Massachusetts 8.6%, and Delaware 9.1%.

A much bigger appetite for Ozempic and friends 
After Ozempic secured widespread cultural and clinical popularity for its success in rapidly reducing appetite and weight, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the rebranded-but-identical Wegovy for weight-loss in 2021.  
OHIC’s analysis found that claims for 30-day prescriptions of the weight-loss drugs doubled from 2022 to 2023, from about 9,000 to over 18,000. Total commercial spending on GLP-1 drugs totaled over $121.4 million from 2021 to 2023, and spending tripled in that time. 
As demand for weight-loss drugs rises, states grapple with Medicaid coverage

King acknowledged the long-term benefits or risks of GLP-1 drugs as weight-loss treatments are still unclear. They might save money in the long run, by lowering obesity rates and the chronic conditions associated with it.   
“But in the short term, we have a tradeoff as a society, as ‘Can we afford to pay the prices that are required?’” King said.
Insurers are asking the same question. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts announced in April it would begin covering GLP-1 drugs for diabetes only.   
Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Rhode Island did not have an immediate comment Monday on the status of GLP-1 coverage in Rhode Island. The company noted in December 2024 that in the first three quarters of 2024, it experienced a $30 million operating loss, generated partially by a $29 million increase in prescription drug costs, including GLP-1 agonists.
Growth is good, sometimes
Health care spending is expected to go up from year to year, the report acknowledges.
“In fact, there are components of Rhode Island’s delivery system, such as primary care, community-based behavioral health care and Medicaid-funded community providers, where spending needs to grow to promote access to care in the most appropriate, lowest cost setting,” the report states.
This year’s report makes two broad recommendations to improve the state’s understanding of how people are spending money on health care: 

Boost investment in primary care across all payers, not just commercial ones. 
Expand state oversight of health care systems and hospitals by making hospital finances more transparent and publicly accessible.

King foreshadowed the first recommendation on April 29 when he joined Gov. Dan McKee and other state health leaders to announce a slate of initiatives meant to repair the state’s primary care challenges.  
If the state builds out its primary care infrastructure, the data should reflect fewer emergency department visits and hospitalizations, more efficiency and healthier people, King said.
“I don’t want people to walk away with the inference that, ‘Oh gosh, health care spending is increasing so rapidly; we can’t spend any money anywhere,’” King said. 
King cited the pandemic as one possible reason Rhode Island saw more health care spending than predicted, given widespread interruption in regular checkups and delays in preventative care.
The 2023 data also begins to capture the consumer consequences of rising inflation since 2021. OHIC recommends maximum rate increases for commercial insurers, but King said his office can only adjust these levers sparingly because of multiyear contracts in the private market. There aren’t opportunities to negotiate higher rates accounting for inflation until contracts are up for renewal, he said. 
So far, the preliminary 2024 data shows more of the same, King added, with inflation driving costs, 
King’s office can’t regulate self-funded employer plans, which account for about 60% of employer-sponsored health coverage statewide.
“We don’t have any say in those contracts, but I think we have influence,” King said. 
That influence is not entirely symbolic, King thought, as many of Rhode Island’s self-funded plans are issued by health care systems themselves, like Brown University Health: “I think they should understand the importance of equitable payment for primary care.”
An X-ray into hospital finances
The report’s second recommendation seeking greater state oversight of health care delivery calls for the creation of a statewide data system that can gather, analyze and publicly share information on hospital system finances. The report notes similar databases in Colorado and Massachusetts as examples worth following.
Data like hospitals’ operating margins remains somewhat opaque. A unified data system, King said, could help “create a more balanced picture of how the dollars flow from the taxpayer and the worker down to the provider, and then are redistributed to workers and capital.”










The most frustrating part of my job — and I think other state leaders across the country will agree — is that states just don’t have control over drug pricing. 


– Rhode Island Health Insurance Commissioner Cory King


In 2023, inpatient and outpatient hospital care combined made up more than 40% of all health care spending in the state, the report states. 
In the commercial market, outpatient costs alone increased 11.3%, from $1,618 to $1,801 per person, and emergency department spending rose 12.5%. 
Hospitals usually charged more for basic services like lab tests. In 2023, a routine bloodwork panel may cost $39 at a hospital-based provider, compared to $9 in a non-hospital setting. Hospitals were paid up to seven times more than outpatient clinics to deliver injections and chemotherapies. A typical cost for a medicine injection might be $23 at a standalone clinic, but $235 in a hospital setting. Imaging and endoscopies sported price tags triple in size when delivered in hospitals. 
“The disclosure of those price differences was not meant to say, ‘Oh, gosh, hospitals are bad and non-hospital settings are good,’” King said. “There are reasonable factors at play for why hospitals charge more…But there is an opportunity for savings, ultimately to the consumer and to the employers and the taxpayer, by shifting more care to these non-hospital settings.”

In question is whether the online retail giant should have collected state sales taxes on behalf of third-party sellers on Amazon’s website. The case before the state’s high court Wednesday […],"The South Carolina Supreme Court in Columbia. (Mary Ann Chastain / Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — A nearly decade-old dispute over whether Amazon owes South Carolina millions in uncollected sales taxes goes before the state Supreme Court this week.
In question is whether the online retail giant should have collected state sales taxes on behalf of third-party sellers on Amazon’s website.
The case before the state’s high court Wednesday is specifically over what was owed in the first quarter of 2016, the months immediately after the expiration of a five-year sales tax exemption approved by the Legislature.
However, the ruling could result in Amazon owing more than $277 million tied to two separate pending cases, according to the state Department of Revenue.
The agency’s initial audit found Amazon owed more than $12 million in taxes, penalties, and interest for not collecting sales taxes from third-party vendors who sold products to South Carolinians in the first three months of 2016.
Amazon balked at that December 2016 assessment and disputed the bill in the Administrative Law Court, which hears challenges of actions by state agencies.
Amazon argued the state tax code was unclear, and that it was the responsibility of those independent sellers to collect taxes from customers and pay the tax bill.
The Administrative Law Court disagreed.
But before Amazon could appeal to the state Court of Appeals — which also sided with the state agency — it had to pay the tab in full. So, Amazon has actually already paid the money at the center of the case justices will hear, according to the state’s tax collection agency.
However, the unpaid tab kept growing until April 30, 2019, when Amazon started collecting sales taxes from third-party sellers and sending it to Revenue.
According to two other state audits, Amazon owes $277.2 million in back taxes and interest from April 1, 2016, through 2019. The second audit came as the Legislature debated a law on third-party sellers, signed by Gov. Henry McMaster on April 26, 2019.
The company has disputed both of those bills to the Administrative Law Court as well. Those cases are on hold pending the outcome of a ruling by the state Supreme Court, according to the Department of Revenue.
Lawyers representing Amazon declined to comment to the SC Daily Gazette on the pending litigation.
A tax deal
Prior to a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 2018, which reversed an earlier decision, companies needed a physical location in a state to be required to collect and pay taxes from sales within that state.
For Amazon, that meant once it built a distribution center in a state, it would need to collect taxes from online shoppers living there — unless it received an exemption, which it pursued in states nationwide.
South Carolina obliged, promising in 2010 a five-year exemption in exchange for creating at least 1,249 full-time jobs with health benefits and investing $90 million. The deal struck by the administration of then-Gov. Mark Sanford was almost undone after Gov. Nikki Haley took office in January 2011 and attempted to cancel it.
Organizations representing brick-and-mortar retailers opposed the deal as giving Amazon an unfair advantage. After the deal appeared dead, the Legislature ultimately approved the exemption over Haley’s objections after Amazon upped the ante to at least 2,000 full-time jobs with a $125 million investment.
The law resulted in Amazon building its first two distribution facilities in the state in 2011 and 2012 — one in West Columbia and one in Spartanburg.
When the sales tax exemption ended Dec. 31, 2015, Amazon began collecting sales taxes on purchases sold directly by Amazon and its affiliates but not third-party sellers on the website.
Those sellers had the option to pay an additional $40 monthly fee to Amazon to collect the taxes for them. But Amazon still sent the money to the seller to forward to Revenue. Many sellers chose not to bother.
‘The flow of funds’
In his order, Chief Administrative Law Judge Ralph Anderson III compared Amazon to a consignment shop.
Like a consignment shop owner, Amazon collects various fees for its services, controlling “the flow of funds between customers” and therefore making the company responsible for tax collection, he wrote.
Judges in the Administrative Law Court and Court of Appeals also shut down arguments by Amazon that definitions in state law of a retailer left tax collection responsibilities open to interpretation.
Amazon claimed it’s operating an online marketplace — that it did not own the goods and was not the seller. Rather, it was simply providing a platform.
But lawyers for the state countered that Amazon “makes no meaningful distinction between sales of its own goods and those owned by third parties.”
“Only Amazon directly interfaces with the customer through the purchase transaction,” state Department of Revenue lawyers continued in written arguments. “Only Amazon accepts and processes customer payments, and Amazon is the only point of sale for all transactions on the website. Thus, only Amazon has the ability to collect sales and use taxes.”
A question of ambiguity
In its written argument filed with the state Supreme Court, Amazon suggests the high court should take its side because the previous rulings weaken a “longstanding protection for taxpayers against the overzealous enforcement of the tax laws.”
Amazon argues it’s a long-held practice that “a taxpayer receives the benefit of any reasonable interpretation of a tax statute.”
“This protection is recognized across the country, is essential for sound financial and business planning, promotes legislative accountability for tax burdens on the public, and makes tax enforcement uniform and fair,” the company’s lawyers wrote.
The U.S., state and Columbia chambers of commerce also have come to the defense of Amazon in briefs filed with the court saying certainty is essential to businesses’ hiring and operating decisions.
“To adopt successful business strategies and to make effective investments, businesses must be able to predict their tax obligations with accuracy. A lack of predictability in tax laws, in contrast, harms both the business community and the overall economy,” the groups wrote in court documents.
But lawyers for the state said “the mere fact that the parties disagree … does not mean that the statute is ambiguous or must be construed in favor of the taxpayer — it just means that one of the parties is wrong.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/SCSupremeCourt-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-12 15:07:33.781822

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)For the second time in as many years, South Dakota Republican U.S. Sen. Mike Rounds has formally asked the federal Department of the Interior to establish a tribal law enforcement training center in his home state.
This year’s request took the form of a letter from Rounds to Doug Burgum, who served as North Dakota’s governor before ascending to the role of Interior secretary for the Trump administration.
Rounds and U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson of South Dakota agitated for a regional Bureau of Indian Affairs law enforcement training center last year. Johnson had previously pushed for field hearings that would bring members of Congress to tribal areas to learn the challenges of policing them. 
AmeriCorps cuts are ‘devastating’ for nonprofit Native American school in South Dakota, lawsuit says

Their advocacy last year dovetailed with the controversy sparked by comments from former South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem Noem, who’s now secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. She said Native American reservations in South Dakota were overrun by Mexican drug cartel members and that some tribal leaders were benefiting from it. She also said that unemployment and absent parents had left Native American children bereft of hope.
Leaders of all nine tribes in the state voted to ban her from their lands in the months that followed. Some have since rescinded the bans.
Noem, who said a lack of tribal law enforcement exacerbates public safety problems, worked with Attorney General Marty Jackley to sponsor an additional state-level basic law enforcement training academy session last summer that gave priority to Native American recruits.
Typically, potential Native American officers from South Dakota attend 12 weeks of basic law enforcement training in Artesia, New Mexico — 1,000 miles or more from home.
The 11 recruits trained in Pierre last year were able to get their certification to work in policing in South Dakota, but were also given the chance to remotely complete an additional BIA training module called the Bridge Training Program that would typically take place in New Mexico.
As Noem sparred with tribes rhetorically and pushed to train more tribal officers in South Dakota’s state training academy, the congressional delegation pushed the BIA to establish a regional training center in Pierre. 
Such a center, they argued, would allow potential Native American police officers to train during the week and return home to their families on weekends.
Rounds reiterated that point in Monday’s letter to Burgum.
“Many tribal law enforcement leaders believe that the distance to the New Mexico facility is a barrier to recruitment,” Rounds wrote.
He suggested that an existing training center could serve as a satellite training location for tribal policing, and pointed to last summer’s training in Pierre as an “encouraging” sign that such a setup can work.

Ron DeSantis speaking at the Florida Highway Patrol's offices in Tampa on May 12, 2025. (Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)After negotiations over the state budget between the GOP House and Senate leadership broke down Friday, the Florida Republican Party of Florida stepped in, proposing to host a summit between Gov. Ron DeSantis, Speaker Daniel Perez, and Senate President Ben Albritton.
The talks would include senior staff and leadership teams in a bid for a common path forward as the two chambers remain billions of dollars apart due to competing tax cut proposals.
But DeSantis said Monday that he’s not interested.
“With all due respect though, that’s not the role of the Republican Party of Florida,” he said in response to a question asked by a Phoenix reporter during a press conference in Tampa.
“And so no, we’re not going to do a dog and pony show. That’s not the way this works. The way it works is people should do their jobs.
“Now my role in the process is to sign or veto the budget as a whole but also individual line items in the budget, so there may be things that I’ll say — ‘Hey, this is something that I’m going to be looking for’ — and obviously the Legislature needs to take that into account. But the reality is the House leadership has kind of careened off course the whole session, not just on the budget, let’s just be clear. This has been the whole session this has happened. ”
DeSantis has been relentless in blasting the Florida House over the past month, initially over a committee’s investigation into the Hope Florida Foundation, the initiative connected to DeSantis and his wife Casey DeSantis. The bitter rancor has now moved on to the House’s support for a major sales tax cut. DeSantis and his supporters have instead been pushing for lawmakers to cut property taxes.
DeSantis spent considerable time Monday when asked about the situation between the two chambers to boast about how he’s handled the state budget during his six-plus years in Tallahassee. He said that, under his leadership, he’s been able  to reduce the state’s debt by 41% but also made important investments in law enforcement, transportation, environmental restoration, and education.
‘Just keep doing what we’ve been doing’
“You don’t need a summit to just keep doing what we’ve been doing,” he said. “And I think if you look at my budget, we build off the success that we’ve had. I don’t know what’s gone on in terms of the breakdown [between the House and Senate]. I wasn’t a part of those negotiations per se, because, quite frankly, the Senate and the House go back and forth on these things. But I can tell you, the voters want us to continue doing what we’ve done. To build off the success, to meet challenges that are before us, and to put their interests first.”
In his statement released on Friday afternoon, Republican Party of Florida Chairman Evan Power suggested a summit would present an opportunity for the state’s GOP leaders to “collaborate, unite, and deliver relief and lasting results for Florida families.”
“Our Republican leaders are deeply committed to this state and have bold ideas to keep Florida thriving,” Power said. “Bringing everyone to the table will help us focus on our shared priorities — fiscal responsibility, tax relief, and a balanced budget.”
While there is no date yet when the full Legislature will return to Tallahassee to take up the budget impasse, the House is scheduled to meet on Tuesday for a floor session to pass a concurrent resolution extending the timeline to continue budget negotiations through the end of June. The new fiscal year opens on July 1.
Also, the 37-member House committee formed to study the possibility of reducing or eliminating property taxes in the state is also scheduled to convene.

Last week, he went back with a new issue in mind.
WSHU’s Ebong Udoma spoke with CT Mirror’s Lisa Hagen to discuss her article, “With federal funding in flux, a CT farmer went back to Washington,” as part of the collaborative podcast Long Story Short. Read Lisa’s story here.
WSHU: Hello, Lisa, you tell us about Willie Dellacamera — he’s a Northwood, Connecticut farmer who first got media attention when he rode his farm tractor all the way to Washington, DC last year. That’s a fascinating story. But why did he have to go back again this time?
LH: Yeah. Willie Dellacamera, along with other Connecticut farmers and generally around New England, have been waiting for disaster and ag farm relief for some months now. And so I had written about this federal block grant that got passed in a major, major bill to fund the government at the end of December basically. And so I was just curious to follow up on it. I hadn’t seen that the Farm Aid had gone out yet; states like Connecticut are still negotiating it. And so I just kind of happened to reach out to Willie about a week or so ago, and I wanted to come see him on his farm and get a sense of where things stood. Within a matter of days, he was in D.C., and he was coming to watch the Agriculture Secretary and lawmakers talk about this farm relief and just USDA writ large.
WSHU: So what was his experience like?
LH: It was something that I don’t think he even quite expected. Basically, there was a pair of hearings that the Agriculture Secretary, Brooke Rollins, was going to testify at. The public can go to any of these hearings. They can sit down; they can listen to her testimony. And so he did that. He was able to go for two days, during which she was testifying, and when she wrapped up, he went over to the door to meet her, and she took the time to hear him out. They talked about the farm aid that still needed to come down. And you know, he was pretty pleasantly surprised. He told me he got phone numbers of the staff, and within two days, I mean, she knew his name, his story, and had invited him to a press conference. And so, you know, he and others are just, again, still waiting for this aid to come out.
WSHU: But he wasn’t expecting the reception that he got, considering that the Trump administration has been pushing for cuts to all sorts of federal agencies, and there was no guarantee that this money was going to go out. Even right up to the end, I remember speaking with Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro, who was pushing for this, and the money comes directly to the farmers in the Northeast. The small farmers in the Northeast. It is a unique system, and the first time this has ever happened, we had a new administration coming in. The whole feeling at that time was, was this really going to happen? And here we are now, and it seems as if Dellacamera came away feeling a little bit optimistic that it might happen. What exactly is the situation right now?
LH: Exactly. There was really no expectation for him going into this. He didn’t know if the block grant was going to come up at the hearings or if Secretary Rollins would stop and talk with him. And so there was a Senate hearing and a House hearing. It had come out that the Senate one, and it was a bit unclear where that funding stood, because they were talking about much larger pots of disaster money. And so that was kind of the focus. But when it was the House hearing, Congresswoman DeLauro, who again helped set up this block grant money, was very specifically talking about that $220 million for New England and small farms. And so basically, she wanted to get Rollins on record as committing to that funding.
So what I came out of those hearings understanding was, there is still a commitment that money will flow. They had given an end-of-May deadline, but it’s still a bit vague. It was unclear whether that meant states like Connecticut and their Ag department would finalize agreements about that funding, or if they meant that that money would actually flow at that time. So you know, they’re skeptical exactly of what that end of May deadline looks like, but at least they felt like they got that commitment that that money is still intended as Congress appropriated to flow, and farmers will eventually get that. It’s just unclear exactly when.
WSHU: In the meantime, Dellacamera and other farmers in his position have all these bills to pay. So what are they being advised to do? And what are they doing?
LH: Well, exactly. And you know, as I was watching Dellacamera tell Secretary Rollins, the first time he met her, he was saying that he was getting creditors calling all the time. She advised him, you know, to tell him that that $220 million was coming. But I imagine for people who are on the hook for all those bills and the people wanting to get paid, you know, just hearing words of federal money will come, is not enough. And so it’s definitely a tough position. He owes hundreds of thousands of dollars. He wants to be able to pay these bills off. And again, they don’t know when this money is coming. And so I think in the coming months, it’s going to put a lot of farmers in Connecticut and the region in a really tough position of how to move forward. And you know, this disaster money will come out at some point. But Dellacamera also told me he relies on this local farm assistance program, where he gets money from the federal government and gives local food to food banks, and that money will actually stop in October. That is money that the Trump administration has terminated.
WSHU: So it’s not a good position to be a small farmer in Connecticut right now.
LH: It’s hard. And you know, that was a program that was mutually beneficial for everyone. It was for the people receiving that food, being able to eat local, healthy food. It was dedicated income for the farmers and producers. And, you know, ways that the schools and food banks were involved. And so losing that revenue stream is really tough. And on top of it all, these farmers who suffered extreme weather that basically damaged their farms in 2023 and 2024 are still waiting on this disaster relief.
WSHU: So, bottom line, it was worth it for him to go to Washington.
LH: I think so. Again, he was not expecting to get as much face time as he did. Congresswoman DeLauro gave him a lengthy shout-out that’s now in the congressional record at these hearings. And so he is hoping that by putting, you know, a face to the story and to that policy, it shows the need for these farmers to have this money.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_4682-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-12 15:07:33.781822

On Wednesday, the U.S. Supreme Court will evaluate a deal the states say solve legal issues over Rio Grande water, which the federal government objects to. Federal and local partners are inviting New Mexicans in Sierra and Doña Ana counties to participate this week in planning for projects to address flooding, drought and water conservation in the Lower Rio Grande Basin.
Southern New Mexico faces less water making its way into the Rio Grande, with reliance growing on groundwater from agriculture and, to a smaller extent, cities. Alternatively, storms supercharged by warmer weather have also produced devastating floods in recent years, hitting crops and infrastructure.
Managers for the federal program hope to address the large problems impacting the Lower Rio Grande — such as damage from flooding and sediment building in the river — promote more aquifer recharge with managing storm water and creating or sustaining habitats.
This week marks the first round of public meetings, according to Connie Maxwell, a regional water planner at the New Mexico Water Resources Research Institute, which is leading the outreach.
“Any water user is welcome, and that would mean all of us,” Maxwell said. “Folks actually living in the region have an enormous amount of local knowledge and it really is the community that has the best sense of what the important priorities are.”




How to attend the meetings
All meetings take place at 6 p.m.
Tuesday, May 13: Doña Ana Community College Sunland Park Center (3365 McNutt Road)
Wednesday, May 14: Hatch Community center (837 West Hall Street)
Thursday, May 15: Center for Spiritual Living in Las Cruces (575 North Main Street)
Wednesday, May 21: Albert J. Lyons Event Center in Truth or Consequences (2953 South Broadway Street




In addition, an online survey asks participants to rank the goals for future projects and solicit ideas for development. Residents can also sign up to participate in additional working groups, which are voluntary positions.
“This particular project, it’s not just a planning effort, it’s really focused on implementation,” Maxwell said, noting that water planning often centers on short-term fixes to address flooding in a certain area.
“It’s becoming critical to address the root of the problems at the same time,” she said, adding that one of the efforts will address the feedback loop of pumping more groundwater, and losing recharge.
The survey will be open for several more months, but an initial assessment of submitted projects will begin after June 15, followed by another round of input and project assessments, Maxwell said.
Last May, the U.S. The Department of Interior under the Biden administration awarded nearly $60 million in Inflation Reduction Act funding to develop projects or programs that benefit the network of dams and canals in the Rio Grande Project and endangered species.
The federal funding was allocated to a partnership including the NM WRRI, The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, Elephant Butte Irrigation District and nonprofit National Fish and Wildlife Foundation.
Whether this program will be impacted by federal cuts, which have included climate programs at other federal agencies, remains unclear.
An emailed request for comment to the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation media office regarding the exact funding available for this program had not been returned prior to publication.

Gavin Newsom urges cities to make certain camps illegal.","In summary
In his latest push to crackdown on homeless encampments, Gov. Gavin Newsom urges cities to make certain camps illegal.


Gov. Gavin Newsom has a new strategy to eliminate the large, long-standing homeless encampments that have been a thorn in his side throughout his administration: Push cities to make them illegal. 
The governor on Monday called on every local government in the state to adopt ordinances that restrict public camping “without delay.” He provided a hypothetical model ordinance that lays out exactly what he’d like to see banned: Camping in one place for more than three nights in a row, building semi-permanent structures such as make-shift shacks on public property, and blocking streets or sidewalks.
“There’s nothing compassionate about letting people die on the streets,” Newsom said in a statement. “Local leaders asked for resources — we delivered the largest state investment in history. They asked for legal clarity — the courts delivered. Now, we’re giving them a model they can put to work immediately, with urgency and with humanity, to resolve encampments and connect people to shelter, housing, and care. The time for inaction is over. There are no more excuses.”
Newsom instructed cities and counties to copy his proposed ordinance or change it as they see fit. Though nothing about Newsom’s Monday missive would force cities to adopt this camping ordinance or any other, last year he threatened to withhold funding from local governments that don’t do enough to remove encampments. 
Monday’s push comes with the promise of $3.3 billion to address street homelessness and mental health. That money comes from Proposition 1, a $6.4 billion bond that California voters approved in March to pay for treatment beds and permanent housing. Newsom and other state officials were expected to give more details Monday afternoon.
Newsom also warned cities that they should not prohibit camping at all times across the entire city if no shelter beds are available, and that they should “prioritize shelter and services.” He said cities should store belongings confiscated during encampment sweeps and give their owners a chance to claim them. He suggested cities give encampment residents a 48-hour warning before a sweep.
Newsom’s model ordinance would ban all camping — including sleeping with a sleeping bag or blanket — in one place for three days or nights in a row. Unless a city has enough shelter beds or affordable housing to offer their entire homeless population — which is almost never the case — that means people would be forced to pack up their belongings and move at least 200 feet every three days.
The National Health Care for the Homeless Council has found that encampment sweeps can damage residents’ health, sever their connections to services and set them back on their path toward housing. 
Even in cities that have shelter beds available, going to a shelter often requires people to abandon their pets or belongings, or to go without their partner. A CalMatters investigation earlier this year found some shelters throughout California are plagued by violence, poor conditions and little oversight. 
Newsom’s call to ban certain homeless encampments is the latest salvo in his ongoing fight against street camping. The push started last summer, after the U.S. Supreme Court in Grants Pass v. Johnson ruled that cities can make it illegal to camp on all public property, even if there is nowhere else for people to go. That decision overturned six years of legal protections for homeless residents in California and other western states, where cities effectively had to make sure shelter was available before cracking down on camps. 
A month later, Newsom ordered state agencies to adopt policies to clear encampments on their property, and urged local governments to do the same. Since then, more than two dozen California cities and counties have passed new camping bans, resumed enforcing old bans or made existing ordinances more punitive. 
This is a developing story. Check back for updates.

(Jan Sonnenmair/Getty Images)TOPEKA — Kansas county health officers issued warnings about four sites where people may have been exposed to measles, as the number of cases increases.
Confirmed measles cases have spread outside the initial eight southwest Kansas counties, with one case confirmed in Wichita and another in Hutchinson. As of last Wednesday, the Kansas Department of Health and Environment had reported 48 cases statewide. That number doesn’t yet include the cases in Sedgwick or Reno counties.
In Wichita, the Sedgwick County Health Department lists two possible exposure sites. Anyone who was at the Wichita Dwight D. Eisenhower National Airport from 6:15 p.m. to 9 p.m. May 2 should monitor symptoms until May 23. And anyone at Carnicerias El Guero No. 1 grocery store, 524 W. 21st St N. in Wichita, from 6:30 p.m. to 10 p.m. April 29 should monitor symptoms until May 20.
Adrienne Byrne, Sedgwick County health director, said the delay in letting the public know about measles exposure happens because symptoms can take time to show up. 
“Once someone is infected, it takes one to two weeks for symptoms to show,” she said. 
Initial symptoms of fever, cough, runny nose and watery eyes can be mistaken for a cold or flu, Byrne said. Then within two or three days, tiny white spots inside the mouth can occur with a bluish white center, then shortly after a rash forms.
It’s not until the rash appears that many people realize they have measles, she said.
“By that time, they’re almost at the end of their infectious period because people are infectious four days before the rash and four days after the rash,” Byrne said.
Once health officials become aware of a case, epidemiologists work with the infected person and their family to figure out where they might have been in the preceding days.
As of Monday morning, the Sedgwick County Health Department hadn’t received any phone calls from people concerned they may have been exposed at the airport, she said. They have contacted everyone on the airplane who was exposed and all have been vaccinated, Byrne said.
She encouraged anyone with measles symptoms who visited either of the two locations to call a hotline at 316-660-5558 to speak with a health professional.
Byrne said the county’s epidemiologist is trained to help people feel comfortable talking about the locations they’ve visited and sharing who may have been exposed.
“People feel guilty if they’ve exposed someone,” she said, adding that they often don’t want to make people miss work. If an unvaccinated person is exposed, they should quarantine for 21 days, she said.
The COVID-19 pandemic made people less willing to trust government officials and to share information, Byrne said.
“We are in a Republican state, and more and more it’s the right to individual freedom and the right of the individual versus the good of all,” she said. “So much distrust happened during COVID.”
Other exposure sites in Kansas include the Hutchinson Public Library, from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. May 3; and B & P Auto Parts, 515 S. Main St. in Cimarron, all day May 2, May 5 and May 6.
State health officials encourage individuals to know their vaccination status. Byrne said the vaccine is 97% effective, so it’s rare that someone who has been fully vaccinated becomes ill.
If someone has been in one of the exposure sites and is unvaccinated, they should monitor for symptoms for 21 days after the exposure, she said. If they suspect they might have measles, they should not go to the doctor or the emergency room but should instead call the hospital or their doctor. That can help to limit the spread of infection, Byrne said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-2202122534.jpg,,,2025-05-12 15:07:33.781822

(Photo by Holly Hildreth/Getty Images)Lawmakers advanced a proposal Monday to provide state funding for schools to stock free feminine hygiene products in women’s restrooms — but it may have a hard time making it to the finish line this session.
House File 883 would provide state funding for schools to have menstrual products like tampons and sanitary pads available in school women’s bathrooms for 6th through 12th grade students from July 1, 2025 through June 30, 2028. The bill had received approval in March from the House Education Committee, but had not been discussed in the months since.
At a House appropriations subcommittee meeting Monday, Angela Caulk with the Family Planning Council of Iowa, thanked lawmakers for their work “behind the scenes” on the bill, ensuring that it was still in the discussion.

“Just as a woman and someone who was a teenager, I just want to thank you all for this, because I think it can make a big difference,” she said.
In earlier meetings on the bill, students and supporters said providing these products for free in school restrooms will help low-income students and help reduce chronic absenteeism at Iowa schools. The measure was brought up in part because of advocacy efforts by the nonprofit Love for Red, an organization focused on providing free sanitary products. Students who created the nonprofit alongside their school counselor said a pilot program providing these products for free led to a reduction in female student absences.
Rep. Amy Nielsen, D-North Liberty, questioned if the funding for the proposal was coming from State Supplemental Aid (SSA), the per-pupil funding for Iowa’s K-12 schools — but Rep. Devon Wood, R-New Market, said it was her understanding this proposal would provide new funding from fiscal years 2026 through 2028. The legislation states that after 2028, funding for the measure would come from SSA.
The legislation does not set an exact allocation for providing these products, but states “an amount necessary to fund the full cost of compliance” will come from the state’s general fund for the 2026-2028 time period. Wood said she understood questions about the exact funding for this measure, but said the measure will provide needed support for students in difficult situations.
“I think that’s an important question to note, so we make sure we know where we’re at, budgetarily, going forward with this,” Wood said. “But I think if this is something that we can do … we do need to assess the need to make sure that we’re fulfilling that (need).”
As the House Appropriations Committee did not take up the bill at its meeting Monday, the funding proposal is unlikely to make it into the state’s final budget for fiscal year 2026. Rep. Gary Mohr, R-Bettendorf, the committee chair, said there’s only one bill outstanding for the committee to consider — the standing appropriations bill — before the committee is done for the year. While the money for feminine hygiene products could come up in this meeting, the bill would also need to pass on the House floor and then go through the committee process in the Senate, as the other chamber has not considered the measure or passed a companion bill this session.
The proposal could be added to another appropriations bill that will make it through the session, but the measure was not included in the budget agreement reached between Senate and House Republicans.
Victoria Sinclair, lobbying on behalf of several organizations including those for Iowa school nurses, school counselors, school psychologists, said her clients have proposed an amendment to remove the spending component of this bill and allow school staff to be able to place donated products in school restrooms. The language has not yet been filed as an amendment to the bill.
“I understand that the appropriation has been a big hold up for many years as we looked at this,” Sinclair said. “And it’s our understanding that many schools actually do have a decent amount of donated products, as well as folks willing to donate.”

Nearly 1,000 resident physicians at the University of Minnesota are officially unionized with SEIU Committee of Interns and Residents after a state labor board certified on Friday that a majority of residents signed union cards.
The certification comes on the heels of more than 200 resident physicians at Hennepin Healthcare achieving certification last month as the first union of resident physicians in Minnesota.
“We work very hard to take care of people all over the Twin Cities and beyond, and burnout is a real problem,” said Dr. Kaitlin McLean in a statement released by the union. “It’s essential that we have a seat at the table so we can care for ourselves and our patients, and so that we can stay here in Minnesota doing that critical work.”
The union drives at both Hennepin Healthcare and the University of Minnesota were remarkably fast compared to the private sector because of a recent change in state law, which governs public sector employees.
Under a 2023 law passed by the then-DFL-controlled Legislature and signed by Gov. Tim Walz, the Minnesota Bureau of Mediation Services will certify a union without a secret mail ballot election if the agency can verify a majority of the bargaining unit has signed cards in support of the union. The Legislature also made it easier for University of Minnesota employees to unionize that year.
In the private sector, workers often must vote in an election after filing a petition with federal labor regulators.
While physicians can look forward to highly paid jobs in medicine, their four or so years of residency after medical school in which they work under the supervision of an attending physician is defined by low pay, crushing workloads and little power to negotiate.
University of Minnesota resident physicians regularly work 80 hours a week for as little as $16 an hour. Resident physicians note they have little power over their pay or working conditions because of the national process through which newly minted doctors match with residency programs.
A spokesperson for the university shared a statement saying it had received notice of the union certification from the Bureau of Mediation Services and that it “honors its obligations under the Public Employment Labor Relations Act.”
It’s still rare for doctors — traditionally the most privileged and valued of hospital staff — to pursue collective bargaining to improve their wages and conditions.
But the consolidation of health care is making doctors increasingly feel more like workers on assembly lines than masters of their own practices.
In 2023, more than 550 primary and urgent care clinicians — including doctors, physician assistants and nurse practitioners — across dozens of Allina Health facilities voted to form what was then the nation’s largest private-sector union of advanced health care providers. Just a few months later, the union of more than 130 Allina Health doctors at Mercy and Unity hospitals was certified over the health system’s objections.
SEIU’s Committee of Interns and Residents, which represents more than 37,000 doctors nationwide, says it’s one of the fastest growing health care unions in the country, doubling in size since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The union won six elections with 250 or more workers across the country in January 2025 alone.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/university-of-minnesota-medical-center-1024x643.png,,,2025-05-12 15:07:33.781822

(Photo via the Florida House)Lawmakers during this past session refused to make changes to the state’s heavily criticized and often politicized claims bill process, but at the same time signed off on $27 million worth of payments in lawsuits that had been filed against local governments.
A Florida Phoenix review of the 2025 session shows the Legislature passed nine claims bills totaling $26,938,364 in liability that will be passed on to local governments or entities acting on their behalf.
The City of Gainesville is responsible for the largest claims bill (HB 6251), which will allow the payment of $10.8 million against the city for the negligence of a utility employee who ran a stop sign on his way home from work. The accident left Jacob Rodgers paralyzed from the waist down.
The bill analysis shows that of the total claim, $2.6 million-plus will go to his attorneys and another $137,500 will be paid to lobbyists who, according to the lobbyist disclosure system, are Matthew Forrest and Adrian Lukas with the firm Ballard Partners.
Conversely, the smallest claim bill passed during the 2025 session (SB 22) was for $200,000 and involved Joe Dimaggio Children’s Hospital and the death of a seven-year-old-child, referred to in the record as E.E.M. The hospital, part of the South Broward Hospital District, did not oppose the claims bill, filed on behalf of Eric Miles Jr. and Jennifer Miles, E.E.M’s parents.
Claims bills are required because Florida enjoys sovereign immunity for state and local governments as a legal sovereign from civil lawsuits filed in state court. The state does, however, allow negligence claims against itself and its subdivisions — agencies, cities, counties, and public hospitals — within limits.
Set in statute, those limits are $200,000 per person and $$300,000 per occurrence.
Injured parties can sue for damages and collect within those limits. But jury awards beyond those limits cannot be collected without the Legislature first approving a claims bill.
The claims bill process is lengthy and allows the defendant to challenge a jury verdict — two reasons why, Rep. Fiona McFarland says, she has twice filed legislation to change the law.
Her latest effort, HB 301, was one of the most heavily lobbied bills in Tallahassee this session, drawing 214 lobbyist registrations. The original bill would have increased the caps to $1 million per person and $3 million per occurrence.  She later agreed to tag on an amendment that increased the caps to  $500,000 per person and $1 million per incident for claims accruing on or after Oct. 1 and  $600,000 per person and $1.1 million per occurrence for claims that accrue on or after Oct. 1, 2030.
While the amended bill passed the House by comfortable margins it never was considered by the Senate.
“I’m very disappointed,” McFarland told the Florida Phoenix as the session drew to an end.
She promised she’d sponsor the bill during the 2026 session. 
While McFarland pushed the bill to change what she called an arbitrary process, a bid to raise the limits was opposed by local governments and public hospitals.

Eleven of Iowa’s 410 nursing homes were staffed at least 40% below the level expected to meet residents’ needs during the third quarter of 2024, according to the data. Among the 50 states, Iowa ranked in the middle of the pack, with staffing levels that averaged 20% below expectations.
According to federal data compiled by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid and then analyzed by the nonprofit Long Term Care Community Coalition, nine in 10 nursing homes across the country were staffed below the level expected based on resident needs.

The report comes as Congress considers budgetary proposals that include instructions requiring the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to delay, until January 2035, enforcement of new minimum staffing standards for nursing homes.
Richard Mollot, LTCCC’s executive director, said the coalition’s methodology for calculating resident needs isn’t based on arbitrary benchmarks, but on each facility’s first-hand evaluation of its own residents’ condition and medical needs.
“It gives residents, families, operators, and policymakers a clear and meaningful way to gauge whether a nursing home is adequately staffed to ensure safe, appropriate care,” he said.
In the third quarter of 2024, the study shows, the average U.S. nursing home provided 3.73 total nurse staff hours per resident, per day. Based on resident acuity, the national average expected staffing level was 4.94 hours. As a result, the median nursing home fell 25% short of expected staffing levels, according to the coalition.
Only two states — Alaska, where staffing levels averaged 21% above expectations, and Oregon, where the homes were staffed 2.5% above expectations — met or exceeded their expected staffing levels.
The states with the worst overall staffing averages included Illinois, where the homes averaged 37.7% below expected levels, followed by Texas, New Mexico, Missouri, Georgia and Virginia, all of which were at least 30% below expected levels.
Lowest-rated Iowa homes are in rural and urban areas
The new report indicates there’s insufficient data on staffing for 13 of Iowa’s 410 nursing homes. Of the remaining 397 homes, 34 are reported to be staffed at or above the expected level.
There are 11 Iowa nursing homes that were staffed at a level at least 40% below the expected level based on each home’s assessment of residents’ needs. State records show that of those 11 homes, seven were cited by state inspectors for insufficient nursing staff at some point during the past 10 years.
The 11 Iowa homes that were staffed at least 40% below the expected level are:

Even as Republicans in Congress walk back their most aggressive proposal to slash federal Medicaid spending, they are weighing other options that could force states to cut services for children and other vulnerable populations.
U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters last week that his caucus won’t reduce the 90% federal funding match that states get to cover working-age adults who became eligible for Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. However, the GOP is still considering capping federal spending by setting a fixed amount for how much states receive for every Medicaid enrollee.
That move would fundamentally change the nature of the program, which has been an open-ended entitlement since its passage 60 years ago.

Another Republican congressional proposal would limit states’ ability to increase Medicaid payments to doctors and hospitals by using tax revenue they collect from health care providers. States draw down additional federal dollars by utilizing the strategy, and the extra money helps many hospitals stay afloat.
Any federal cuts to Medicaid — large or small — would strain state budgets and likely lead to service cuts and coverage for fewer people, according to a new analysis released last week by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
The agency predicted that to make up for lost federal dollars, states would have to reduce payments to health care providers, curb benefits or reduce enrollment. Some advocates also suggest that states might seek savings in other areas of their budgets, such as K-12 education.
Child health advocates say any of those actions would have a significant trickle-down effect on children and their caregivers. They’re concerned states would have to reduce or even eliminate services that help tens of millions of children access routine care that’s critical from birth, such as vaccinations and physical exams.

Half of U.S. kids

About half of the nation’s 72.8 million children are covered by Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, known as CHIP, another joint federal-state program that covers children from families who earn too much to qualify for traditional Medicaid.
“I think what is missing from some of these debates is [Medicaid] is not only the primary payer for children’s health, it’s also supporting the safety net for children’s health, by paying for hospitals, clinics, physicians and offices,” said Heather Howard, a former New Jersey health commissioner who is now a faculty affiliate with the Center for Health and Wellbeing at Princeton University.
“It’ll mean that hospitals will close in rural areas, but even in urban areas, we’re going to see, as hospitals see their funding cut, they’re going to have to pull back on services,” Howard added. “And that clearly is going to impact kids.”

Mississippi pediatrician Dr. John Gaudet said the importance of Medicaid for children begins at birth; Medicaid covered 41% of all U.S. births in 2021. The program also covers a benefit package called Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment, which covers an array of critical services meant to take care of childhood mental and physical health, such as dental and vision care, vaccinations, lab tests and physical exams.
The program serves children struggling with severe emotional distress, as well as physical disabilities. Medicaid pays for long-term and home-based care services.
Gaudet says he’s afraid that a variety of child-related services could be affected by federal Medicaid cuts.
“As a pediatrician, I’m very concerned about prevention and wellness, because that’s going to give you more return on your investment in the long run, if you can prevent an illness rather than wait until it gets more severe and then you’re having to treat it,” Gaudet said in an interview.

School health services

Medicaid cuts also could affect the health services offered in schools.
Between $4 billion and $6 billion in annual Medicaid spending helps pay for school-based health services, including routine health screenings, preventive care, mental health care and physical, speech and occupational therapies.
Children from underserved communities disproportionately rely on school-based health services, according to Abuko Estrada, vice president of Medicaid and child health policy at First Focus on Children, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit group.
“We’re not only talking about things like higher emergency room utilization for kids or increased hospitalizations for preventable conditions,” Estrada said in an interview. “We’re also talking about lost educational opportunities, potentially reduced future earnings in adulthood, and perpetuating cycles of poor health that ultimately cost the nation far more than it would potentially save.”










As hospitals see their funding cut, they're going to have to pull back on services. And that clearly is going to impact kids.


– Heather Howard, former New Jersey commissioner of health and senior services


But Brian Blase, president of the Paragon Health Institute, a conservative policy group that is working with Republicans to imagine Medicaid cuts, wrote in an email to Stateline that the ideas circulating on Capitol Hill wouldn’t harm children at all. Rather, he said, the proposed cuts would shift the funding focus away from working-age adults toward children and more vulnerable populations.
“In my view, it is a moral imperative for Congress to protect the program for the truly vulnerable and end Washington’s discrimination in favor of non-disabled, working-age, childless adults,” wrote Blase, who was a health care adviser to President Donald Trump during his first term.
Chris Pope, a senior fellow at the conservative-leaning policy group the Manhattan Institute, said he doesn’t think Republicans in Congress will be able to cut much from Medicaid.
Republicans couldn’t get the votes to make major changes when they tried in 2017, Pope noted, and they have even fewer votes this year. “Unless they can get every Republican to sign off on cuts,” he said, “it’s just not going to happen.”

Republicans in Congress are trying to find roughly $2 trillion in savings to offset the cost of extending tax cuts enacted during the first Trump administration and to make additional tax cuts. The U.S. House committee that oversees Medicaid is supposed to come up with $880 billion of that total.
Despite Johnson’s assertion that reducing the federal Medicaid match for working-age adults is off the table, some fiscal hawks in his own party aren’t ready to give up the idea, which would save more money than any other proposal.
“It’s necessary to stop robbing from the vulnerable to fund the able-bodied,” U.S. Rep. Chip Roy of Texas wrote on X shortly after Johnson’s comments were reported.
In a May 7 letter to House Republican leaders, 32 GOP representatives vowed to find $2 trillion in cuts, calling the House budget framework “a floor for savings, not a ceiling. We must hold that line on fiscal discipline to put the country back on a sustainable path,” the letter said.

More than 10,000 orphaned baby birds were rescued last week in Delaware after a shipping mishap left them stranded at a postal distribution center.
The Delaware Department of Agriculture (DDA) and the First State Animal Center (FSAC) stepped in to save the birds, which were discovered in undeliverable boxes at the USPS Delaware Processing and Distribution Center on May 2.
The initial call to DDA reported a single box of chicks, but a follow-up alert revealed multiple packages.
READ: Study ranks Delaware last in U.S. for pet healthcare
Staff from DDA’s Poultry and Animal Health section and FSAC worked late into the night to care for the animals, which included chicks, turkeys, geese, quail, and chukars.
The birds were originally shipped from Freedom Ranger Hatchery in Pennsylvania on April 29.
An estimated 4,000 birds had already died due to prolonged exposure to unsuitable conditions.
The surviving animals were transported to FSAC for care and rehabilitation.
Officials say the birds were en route to destinations across the country — some as far as Spokane, Washington — but somehow ended up in Delaware.
Freedom Ranger Hatchery, which is certified as disease-free under the National Poultry Improvement Plan, is investigating the cause of the routing error.
The rescued birds are currently being rehabilitated and will be available for adoption soon.
FSAC is expected to announce adoption details early next week via their website here.
Officials say the episode underscores the importance of humane handling in agricultural practices and the power of collaborative action in addressing animal welfare emergencies.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DDA_chicks.jpg,,,2025-05-12 13:11:48.388146

New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, two potential Democratic candidates for president 2028, will headline the Florida Democratic Party’s (FDP) annual Leadership Blue Gala next month at the Seminole Hard Rock in Hollywood, officials announced Thursday.
Booker, who ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination for president in 2020, made history last month when he stood on the Senate floor and gave a 25-hour speech protesting the actions of the Trump administration. It was the longest floor speech in the history of the U.S. Senate.
  N.J. U.S. Sen. Cory Booker will appear with Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear at the Florida Democratic Party’s annual Leadership Blue Gala in June.
Beshear is the popular two-term governor of Kentucky who has shown an ability as a Democrat to win in a red state. He is believed to be seriously considering a run for president in 2028.
“Senator Booker and Governor Beshear are two of the brightest starts of today’s Democratic Party, and their visit to Florida is more proof of the party’s commitment to the future of our state and the importance of the South,” said FDP Chair Nikki Fried in a written statement.
The event is considered the FDP’s premier fundraising event of the year. It will take place with the party once again back on its heels following the defection two weeks ago of one of its legislative leaders, South Florida Sen. Jason Pizzo, who turned independent, saying that the state party was “dead.”
The Republican Party of Florida is holding its Florida Freedom Forum on Aug. 2 at the Rosen Shingle Creek Hotel in Orlando, which will feature U.S. Sen. Rick Scott, Attorney General James Uthmeier, and U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds, among others.
The FDP’s Leadership Blue Weekend is scheduled to take place from June 20-June 22.

They were quickly removed. (Courtesy of Autumn Featherstone)On Feb. 24, 2025, my friends and I were kicked out of the Utah House of Representatives gallery. Why? Because after House Speaker Mike Schultz ignored multiple phone calls and emails, we tried to deliver a petition to him directly. When our petition was refused once again, we donned gas masks and bright T-shirts inscribed with our demands and walked silently into the House gallery. Within minutes, we were removed by security.
We wrote our petition in response to Schultz’s call for a “pause” on Great Salt Lake-related water legislation for the 2025 session, and the announcement that Utah would be hosting the 2034 Olympics. We demanded the following actions to protect and restore the Great Salt Lake by 2034:

No new water diversions or developments that would further deplete the Great Salt Lake.
Increase water flow to the Great Salt Lake by 1 million acre-feet per year, restoring the lake to a minimum elevation of 4,198 feet.
Commit to continuous assessment of water policy, ensuring that solutions are adaptive and responsive to the evolving crisis.

Nearly 250 Utahns signed this petition, but it still hasn’t reached the legislator’s desk.
I have lived my entire life less than an hour from the Great Salt Lake. Yet, like it was for many residents of Utah, the lake was simply an afterthought. It was only when I heard about the serious risks tied to its drying up that I started to pay attention. The Great Salt Lake is a breathtaking, unique ecosystem that is a vital stopover for millions of birds during migration. It is also a thin blanket that protects millions of people from decades of buildup of toxic metals in the lakebed. Currently, over 900 square miles of lakebed are exposed, and 2.8 million Utahns breathe the pollution downwind — including me.
The lake is essential to my survival and future as a young person. I am 19 years old and I want to spend the rest of my life here in this beautiful state, but if our legislators continue to ignore this ongoing crisis, I will have to leave my home behind. I am inheriting a world that has been discarded by legislators who make decisions about my future while shutting out my voice. They are silencing youth and refusing to take action on the issues that matter to us, while putting their energy towards legislation that actively harms us.
Despite the massive impacts of the lake drying up, Mike Schultz placed a moratorium on major water bills, citing the need for “a break.” But the legislature seemed to have plenty of energy for legislation that harms youth rather than helping us. This legislative session, Utah became the first state to ban pride flags in all school and government buildings, making it harder for queer youth to find safe spaces in their schools. Lawmakers also passed legislation barring transgender students from living in dorms that align with their gender identity, and approved another bill that restricts comprehensive health education in schools. They’re also trying to end collective bargaining rights for the upcoming generation of public sector workers.
 These issues on education, workers’ rights, public health, LGBTQ+ rights, and lack of adequate environmental policy all stem from the same crisis: a government that ignores science, dismisses the voices of young people and other marginalized communities, and targets the most vulnerable instead of protecting us. By spending so much time and resources actively infringing on our human rights, they are passively infringing on our right to a healthy environment. Air pollution shortens our lives by two years — queer people, educators, and unions do not. But instead of addressing existential issues head-on, legislators are “rearranging deck chairs” on a sinking ship. They need to get their priorities straight.
Utah claims to be the country’s most “family-friendly” state, yet its policies are anything but. The Utah legislature is ignoring the issues that matter most to young people while spending all their time pushing bills that disproportionately harm us. Despite the legislature’s best efforts, youth are still fighting. Even though our emails, calls, text messages, and in-person requests to deliver the petition were ignored, we are not giving up. We are continuing to demand that the state take the necessary steps to protect the Great Salt Lake and our future.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_2439-e1747066187225-1024x897.jpeg,,,2025-05-12 12:19:23.762894

Kennedy Jr. would be responsible for the rulemaking  “to impose most-favored-nation pricing.”“We are going to pay the lowest price there is in the world,” Trump said.Prescription pricing for brand-name drugs in the U.S. is more than four times higher than in similar countries, according to a 2024 study by the nonpartisan research nonprofit RAND.Clear price targetsA White House official previewing the policy in a background call with reporters Monday said the president will direct the Department of Commerce to “take all appropriate action” on countries that ""suppress drug pricing abroad.”The Food and Drug Administration will also consider expanding imports of pharmaceutical drugs from nations beyond Canada, the White House official said.Former President Joe Biden issued an executive order to direct the FDA to work with states to import prescription drugs from Canada.The White House official said Kennedy “will set clear targets for price reductions across all markets in the United States.”Kennedy appeared at the White House alongside the president Monday morning.“The United States will no longer subsidize the health care of foreign countries, which is what we were doing,” Kennedy said. “If the Europeans raise their price of their drugs by just 20%, that is tens of trillions that can be spent on innovation and the health of all people all across the globe.”Trump said Monday the drug pricing policy would be included in the “one, big, beautiful,” reconciliation bill that is the top priority of congressional Republicans. The measure is also expected to provide tax cuts and a significant funding increase to border security.Staff on the House Energy and Commerce Committee told reporters twice during a background briefing around the same time that most favored nation prescription drug pricing would not be in that reconciliation package.First termThe order is similar to an effort the president made in his first term, which was struck down in federal court.The White House official said Monday’s order is an expansion of those first-term efforts, which tried to apply the pricing model for those with Medicare – the health insurance program for those who are 65 or older and certain people under 65 who have disabilities – to 50 drugs.“The expectation should not be that we will just be pursuing that same rulemaking,” a White House official said. “We have moved on from that for broader action.”The pharmaceutical industry has long opposed such a move and is already bracing for the president’s planned tariffs on prescription drugs. More details on specific actions in Medicare will be announced later, according to a White House official.“We will be taking action in the Medicare program if the pharmaceutical companies do not come to the table and lower their prices across markets,” the White House official said.Effort unserious, leading Democrat saysU.S. Senate Finance Committee ranking member Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, slammed Monday’s executive order.“If Trump was serious about lowering drug prices, he would work with Congress to strengthen Medicare drug price negotiations, not just sign a piece of paper,” Wyden said.The Inflation Reduction Act that Democrats passed along party lines in 2022 when they held unified control of Washington allowed for drug negotiating pricing that aims to lower drug costs for those with Medicare.“Democrats took on Big Pharma and won by finally giving Medicare the power to negotiate lower drug prices on behalf of seniors and capping their out-of-pocket costs for expensive prescriptions,” Wyden said, referring to the law.Jennifer Shutt contributed to this report.",,,,2025-05-12 12:19:23.762894

Gary Peters (D-Bloomfield Township) as Michigan’s next U.S. Senator, former Michigan House Speaker Joe Tate has joined the ever-growing field of candidates. 
Tate, a Detroit Democrat who currently serves as a state representative for Michigan’s 9th House district, made his announcement on Sunday, which was first reported by Bloomberg.
“I’m running for Senate to lay a foundation for the next generation of Michiganders, one strong enough to protect the promise Michigan holds for every family,” Tate said in a video posted to social media on Monday. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Tate, a former NFL player who served two combat tours in Afghanistan as a U.S. Marine Corps officer, was Michigan’s first Black speaker of the House, leading the chamber during Democrat’s trifecta in Lansing from 2023 through the end of 2024. 
Under the leadership of Tate and Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks (D-Grand Rapids), Democrats forged ahead on decades of pent-up policy priorities, repealing the state’s right to work laws, retirement tax and its 1931 abortion ban. Democrats also expanded the 1976 Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act to add protections against discrimination based on gender identity or sexual orientation, set a 100% clean energy standard for 2040 and passed sweeping gun reforms, including universal background checks, safe storage requirements and a series of policies allowing for extreme risk protection orders, also known as red flag laws. 
However, Tate’s term as speaker ended on a sour note, as House Republicans walked off the floor, refusing to return unless Tate placed policies on road funding and policies looking to water down changes to the state’s minimum wage and sick leave laws on the agenda. 
While Democrats, who held a 56-54 majority, were able to continue holding votes, the chamber failed to reach a quorum for two days in a row, bringing the House to a sputtering halt. Unable to pass legislation, several bills including proposed bans on ghost guns and bump stocks, a host of bills to address racial disparities in maternal health and plans to subject the Legislature and the Governor to the state’s Freedom of Information Act, were left dead in the water. 
Tate has faced further criticism from both sides of the aisle, as nine bills passed by the Michigan Senate sit in limbo, after the House did not present them to the governor for her signature prior to the new Legislative session. Current House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) has blamed Tate for failing to present the bills, with the impasse resulting in legal action from Brinks and the Senate.
Tate joins a Democratic field that already includes U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham), State Sen. Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak) and former Wayne County Health Director Abdul El-Sayed. On the Republican side, former U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers (R-White Lake) launched another Senate bid, after an unsuccessful campaign in 2024, which he lost to now-U.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Holly) by just over 19,000 votes.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Facetune_13-12-2024-14-29-21-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-05-12 12:19:23.762894

His own family story made him inclined early to “question notions of nationalism or anything like that,” he told Source NM, a tendency his teen years in California only heightened as he became exposed to racism against Latinos.
Collingwood received his Ph.D at the University of Washington where, with Latino polling and research expert Matt A. Barreto as his advisor, he began working on projects with colleague Benjamin Gonzalez O’Brien, with whom he went on to co-author the influential study “Sanctuary Cities: The Politics of Refuge” (Oxford University Press, 2019).
“In graduate school, and since then, most of my network, the people I work with, are… disproportionately Latino, and many of them were from variety of different countries of origins or mixed race,” Collingwood said. “I started to identify a little bit with that crowd, in part because they would talk of their immigration experiences and it just kind of reminded me a bit of the things I’ve dealt with, although I haven’t really had to deal with it to the same degree that they are.”
Collingwood also authored “Campaigning in a Racially Diversifying America: When and How Cross-Racial Electoral Mobilization Works” (Oxford University Press 2020). His research areas also include immigrant detention and privatization. The following interview has been edited for clarity and concision.
Source: Your 2019 research on sanctuary cities showed that cities with so-called sanctuary policies don’t have more crime as a result. What were the political conditions that prompted you to study and ask those questions?
LC: When Donald Trump first ran for office in 2015 as part of the 2016 campaign, we were really struck by the more or less anti-Mexican immigrant statements that he made. At first, we all thought it was a joke, like a lot of people did. Strategically or not, he really tapped a nerve, and it turned out a lot of people really liked what he had to say, and so we started studying that.
Around that time, there was a white woman…in the Bay Area in San Francisco, which is a sanctuary city, who was shot and killed by an undocumented immigrant who had recently been released from [jail]. That person, had they been in a non-sanctuary city, very likely would have been detained by [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement] and then put into detention and, potentially, removal proceedings. Suddenly, the claim was getting made that sanctuary cities were causing crime. [Gonzalez O’Brien] and I had already been talking about doing work on sanctuary cities, but we were struggling a little bit with the angle on it.
We started collecting data and trying to figure out which cities are sanctuary cities or not, and when they became sanctuary cities or didn’t. City-level data is often hard to work with — it’s not standardized in any way, so it can often take a really long time to collect that data. But we did it fairly quickly. When we started doing our comparisons, it became pretty clear, pretty soon that the idea that when a city became a sanctuary city suddenly its crime rates increased, just was not really at all true.
A New Mexico-based immigration attorney recently wrote a column for Source NM responding to Trump’s executive order calling for a crackdown on sanctuary cities and characterized it basically as a temper tantrum. What’s your take on it?
In a lot of ways, sanctuary cities have been [Trump’s] pet peeve, probably the thorn in his side this entire time. He tried to undo them in his first administration and that wasn’t successful, and so they’re just taking another crack at it and trying to just come up with various alternative means. I actually think what they’re going to try to do is they’re going to try to prosecute some elected officials and they’re probably trying to see if they can come up with a legal justification for [saying] a sanctuary city is basically the same as harboring and hiding… undocumented immigrants. But that’s just a personal opinion.
The Trump administration has already sued Colorado and Denver over their sanctuary laws. Do you think New Mexico has that sort of risk? We have a high number of sanctuary cities and counties.
New Mexico is a sanctuary state overall, and then several of our counties are and then also several of our cities. I haven’t done this kind of overlapping jurisdictions analysis, but my anecdotal sense — just because I spend a lot of time looking at this data and thinking about it — is that New Mexico is one of the safest place for undocumented immigrants, and it’s generally probably not as much on the administration’s radar. My read… is that our attention has been on the militarized border…that seems to be where we’re getting the most attention, and they haven’t been focusing as much on the interior undocumented population. But I could be wrong about that.
Do you have specific questions about New Mexico’s militarized border zone that you’re thinking about?
My biggest question with this, and with a lot of zone-type issues, which I haven’t done much of yet, but we are looking into it, is basically whether this is going to lead to racially profiling of Latino people or Latinos who speak Spanish. You have a lot of that here in New Mexico, of people who are either citizens and or are legal residents, and they could fairly easily get caught up in that dragnet.
Given the current environment of increased criminalization of undocumented immigrants, how does the work that you’ve done examining private prison lobbying inform what we’re seeing right now?
The main thing we have discovered is there’s a fairly small subset of Democratic legislators who are influenced massively by these private prison companies, whether it’s through donations or actual physical lobbying on the hill in DC or in Santa Fe…or legislators that have these facilities in their districts. Republican legislators just basically are anti-immigrant across the board and punitive. They want more money for detention, and they don’t want to let anyone go free and they want to deport everybody. I mean, literally. It used to not be that way, right? It used to be that a fairly large, sizable portion of the Republican infrastructure was supportive of legal or even guest worker immigration or maybe wasn’t so harsh on illegal immigration. So, whether those Republicans get money from the GEO Group, or whether they have facilities in their district doesn’t really matter, at least that’s what we’ve tended to see.
Democrats are more supportive of legalization [or policies] that would reduce the chances that an undocumented immigrant or an asylum seeker gets put into detention. But when these Democratic legislators do have these facilities in their districts, or they are taking money from Geo Group or Management & Training Corporation or something like that, they’re potentially going to start looking more like the Republican legislators in terms of their voting on relevant immigrant legislation. When I say relevant immigrant legislation, the classic example [were] bills in the New Mexico Legislature that have failed in the State Senate a couple years running that [would have made it] harder for private immigrant detention centers to run in the state and would have potentially put one or two of them out of business. New Mexico, although it’s a Democratic leaning state… they cannot pass a bill like that, at least in my read.
What direction is your work taking now?
[With sanctuary cities], over the last couple of years, we’re just expanding that research. We got the texts of the [sanctuary policies]… and we’ve done a bunch of network analysis where we see how sanctuary cities are copying language from other sanctuary cities, and which ones look more similar than other ones, and there’s regional effects.
And then I have another book project, with my colleague [California State University Northridge Political Science Professor] Jason Morín, and we’re looking at immigrant detention and privatized immigrant detention. [Morín] was [recently cited [in the] New York Times about it. He and I have published a couple of papers on that because there are three immigrant detention facilities in New Mexico and they’re all privately run or managed.
You know, academic research is slow going. We try to fire it out sometimes, but basically, we’re trying to create the platform that people can use…to back up policy making…and for advocacy. Even though, personally, we probably have a stake in this — just the nature of the work that we’re doing — we do our best to come at this objectively so that we can provide that evidence and the knowledge base to the people that are making the arguments one way or the other.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Collingwood_3.jpg,,,2025-05-12 12:19:23.762894

The department reported both people were unvaccinated and one was hospitalized as a result of the disease. Both people are believed to have contracted measles from international travel.
Two Essentia Health clinics in the Fargo area were exposed to the disease and public health officials said unvaccinated individuals present at those facilities should quarantine themselves for 21 days to monitor for symptoms.
The two clinics exposed were:

Essentia Health – The Lights West Fargo Clinic from 2:30 to 6 p.m., May 7. The entrance to the clinic is shared with Bar Down Sports Bar and Restaurant.
Essentia Health Walk-in Care Clinic from 5:30 to 8 p.m., May 9.

Some schools cancel band trip to Williston because of measles cases; parade to go on

Last week, public health officials reported three schools in Williston were exposed to measles that resulted in about 150 unvaccinated students isolating at home to monitor for symptoms. Nine measles cases have been confirmed in Williams County since May 2.
The health department recommends children between 12-15 months old should receive their first dose of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine and a second dose between 4-6 years of age.
“People who are vaccinated and exposed to measles are not likely to develop the disease,” said Molly Howell, immunization director for HHS. “MMR vaccination is critical to preventing the spread of measles in the community. Anyone who is eligible and has not yet been vaccinated is encouraged to contact a trusted health care provider about MMR vaccination.”
Howell said the MMR vaccine is 93% effective after one dose and 97% effective after a second dose.
Adults born before 1957 are generally presumed immune due to natural exposure, the department said.
Immunization records for North Dakota residents can be reviewed through the HHS website or by contacting a health care provider.
Measles symptoms can develop up to 21 days after exposure. The symptoms are:

Fever
Cough
Runny nose
Eye irritation
Body-wide rash

The measles virus is spread through the air and people remain contagious for several days before and after the first symptoms appear, the department said. They added there is no specific medical treatment for measles, but antibiotics may be used in cases resulting in a secondary bacterial infection.
The risk of measles to the general public is low due to a majority of North Dakotans being immunized against the disease.
Vaccines are available through most clinics. For families in need, the federally funded Vaccines for Children Program offers support through local providers.   
For information about measles, vaccination, or local clinic availability, contact the HHS Immunization Unit at 701-328-2378 or 711 (TTY), or visit hhs.nd.gov/measles.

School-based health services nationwide are partially funded through Medicaid, and some advocates worry about potential cuts. (Jon Cherry/Getty Images)Even as Republicans in Congress walk back their most aggressive proposal to slash federal Medicaid spending, they are weighing other options that could force states to cut services for children and other vulnerable populations.
U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters last week that his caucus won’t reduce the 90% federal funding match that states get to cover working-age adults who became eligible for Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. However, the GOP is still considering capping federal spending by setting a fixed amount for how much states receive for every Medicaid enrollee.
That move would fundamentally change the nature of the program, which has been an open-ended entitlement since its passage 60 years ago.

Another Republican congressional proposal would limit states’ ability to increase Medicaid payments to doctors and hospitals by using tax revenue they collect from health care providers. States draw down additional federal dollars by utilizing the strategy, and the extra money helps many hospitals stay afloat.
Any federal cuts to Medicaid — large or small — would strain state budgets and likely lead to service cuts and coverage for fewer people, according to a new analysis released last week by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
The agency predicted that to make up for lost federal dollars, states would have to reduce payments to health care providers, curb benefits or reduce enrollment. Some advocates also suggest that states might seek savings in other areas of their budgets, such as K-12 education.
Child health advocates say any of those actions would have a significant trickle-down effect on children and their caregivers. They’re concerned states would have to reduce or even eliminate services that help tens of millions of children access routine care that’s critical from birth, such as vaccinations and physical exams.
Half of U.S. kids
About half of the nation’s 72.8 million children are covered by Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, known as CHIP, another joint federal-state program that covers children from families who earn too much to qualify for traditional Medicaid.
“I think what is missing from some of these debates is [Medicaid] is not only the primary payer for children’s health, it’s also supporting the safety net for children’s health, by paying for hospitals, clinics, physicians and offices,” said Heather Howard, a former New Jersey health commissioner who is now a faculty affiliate with the Center for Health and Wellbeing at Princeton University.
“It’ll mean that hospitals will close in rural areas, but even in urban areas, we’re going to see, as hospitals see their funding cut, they’re going to have to pull back on services,” Howard added. “And that clearly is going to impact kids.”

Mississippi pediatrician Dr. John Gaudet said the importance of Medicaid for children begins at birth; Medicaid covered 41% of all U.S. births in 2021. The program also covers a benefit package called Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment, which covers an array of critical services meant to take care of childhood mental and physical health, such as dental and vision care, vaccinations, lab tests and physical exams.
The program serves children struggling with severe emotional distress, as well as physical disabilities. Medicaid pays for long-term and home-based care services.
Gaudet says he’s afraid that a variety of child-related services could be affected by federal Medicaid cuts.
“As a pediatrician, I’m very concerned about prevention and wellness, because that’s going to give you more return on your investment in the long run, if you can prevent an illness rather than wait until it gets more severe and then you’re having to treat it,” Gaudet said in an interview.
School health services
Medicaid cuts also could affect the health services offered in schools.
Between $4 billion and $6 billion in annual Medicaid spending helps pay for school-based health services, including routine health screenings, preventive care, mental health care and physical, speech and occupational therapies.
Children from underserved communities disproportionately rely on school-based health services, according to Abuko Estrada, vice president of Medicaid and child health policy at First Focus on Children, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit group.
“We’re not only talking about things like higher emergency room utilization for kids or increased hospitalizations for preventable conditions,” Estrada said in an interview. “We’re also talking about lost educational opportunities, potentially reduced future earnings in adulthood, and perpetuating cycles of poor health that ultimately cost the nation far more than it would potentially save.”










As hospitals see their funding cut, they're going to have to pull back on services. And that clearly is going to impact kids.


– Heather Howard, former New Jersey commissioner of health and senior services


But Brian Blase, president of the Paragon Health Institute, a conservative policy group that is working with Republicans to imagine Medicaid cuts, wrote in an email to Stateline that the ideas circulating on Capitol Hill wouldn’t harm children at all. Rather, he said, the proposed cuts would shift the funding focus away from working-age adults toward children and more vulnerable populations.
“In my view, it is a moral imperative for Congress to protect the program for the truly vulnerable and end Washington’s discrimination in favor of non-disabled, working-age, childless adults,” wrote Blase, who was a health care adviser to President Donald Trump during his first term.
Chris Pope, a senior fellow at the conservative-leaning policy group the Manhattan Institute, said he doesn’t think Republicans in Congress will be able to cut much from Medicaid.
Republicans couldn’t get the votes to make major changes when they tried in 2017, Pope noted, and they have even fewer votes this year. “Unless they can get every Republican to sign off on cuts,” he said, “it’s just not going to happen.”

Republicans in Congress are trying to find roughly $2 trillion in savings to offset the cost of extending tax cuts enacted during the first Trump administration and to make additional tax cuts. The U.S. House committee that oversees Medicaid is supposed to come up with $880 billion of that total.
Despite Johnson’s assertion that reducing the federal Medicaid match for working-age adults is off the table, some fiscal hawks in his own party aren’t ready to give up the idea, which would save more money than any other proposal.
“It’s necessary to stop robbing from the vulnerable to fund the able-bodied,” U.S. Rep. Chip Roy of Texas wrote on X shortly after Johnson’s comments were reported.
In a May 7 letter to House Republican leaders, 32 GOP representatives vowed to find $2 trillion in cuts, calling the House budget framework “a floor for savings, not a ceiling. We must hold that line on fiscal discipline to put the country back on a sustainable path,” the letter said.

The Indiana Broadband Office announced Monday morning that it “has been notified by our federal partners to suspend” the program.
“At this time, we do not have any further information, but we will share any updates with you as we receive them,” the office added.
Previously called the “Digital Equity Program,” it was part of the federal Digital Equity Act.
The 2021 legislation provided $2.75 billion to establish three grant programs that promote digital equity and inclusion. They were intended to ensure “that all people and communities have the skills, technology, and capacity needed to reap the full benefits of our digital economy,” according to the office’s website.
Trump railed against the program last week, calling it “totally UNCONSTITUTIONAL” in a Truth Social Post last week, the Hill reported.
“No more woke handouts based on race! The Digital Equity Program is a RACIST and ILLEGAL $2.5 BILLION DOLLAR giveaway,” he wrote. “I am ending this IMMEDIATELY, and saving Taxpayers BILLIONS OF DOLLARS!”
The effort aimed to address systemic barriers to digital inclusion for certain populations: aging, incarcerated, disabled, low-income, rural and other people. Veterans, racial and ethnic minorities, and those with language barriers were also targeted for the help.
Indiana was awarded $842,000 in 2022 as part of the Digital Equity Planning Grant to fund the creation of the state’s first “digital equity plan” — although the office now refers to it as a “digital opportunity plan.” The Hoosier plan was developed in collaboration with the Purdue Center for Regional Development and was accepted by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration in April 2024.
Then, the state was allocated $15 million in Digital Equity Capacity Grant funding to implement the plan.
The state held a May 5 webinar to show entities how to apply, and had another scheduled for June. The deadline to apply was June 13. Those eligible to seek the grants were:

Political subdivisions, agencies or instrumentalities of the state, such as local government units and agencies responsible for adult education, literacy, or public housing.

Instead of imposing tariffs that will raise the cost of everything from kids’ clothes to strollers, Republicans could give parents a helping hand by expanding the child tax credit. When the credit was expanded nationally in 2021, the number of children living in poverty in Maine was cut in half. As they consider a new tax bill this year, lawmakers in Washington could repeat that success. Closer to home, lawmakers in Augusta are considering a smaller but meaningful change to the state level credit, increasing the amount for the most vulnerable kids in our state. 
Instead of submitting a dozen bills to repeal or weaken Maine’s new paid family and medical leave program, Republicans could support the initiative which will allow thousands of Maine parents each year to take time off for childbirth or to care for a sick kid. PFML makes for healthier kids and allows parents (especially moms) to continue participating in the labor force. 
Instead of cheering on the president’s illegal withholding of funds for school meals, and food banks, Maine Republicans could be working to ensure state funding replaces lost federal funds that help the one in five Maine families with kids at risk of going hungry. They could also urge their congressional colleagues not to cut more than a fifth of the funding to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, in which a third of Maine participating households have children. 
Republicans could also fight to protect health care coverage for Maine kids and parents. Expanding Medicaid coverage has restored coverage to 11,000 parents that lost their eligibility under former Governor Paul LePage’s cuts, but Republicans in Congress are putting that at risk with multiple plans to slash Medicaid funding at the federal level. 
State lawmakers could also support parents by funding child care programs and supporting child care workers. Trump has targeted the Head Start program for cuts, so far withholding $1 billion from states across the country. In Maine, Governor Janet Mills’s budget proposes reducing state support for the program, while also cutting wages for child care workers. Instead of taking away this crucial support for parents, lawmakers can strengthen it, ensuring that workers are paid fairly while keeping programs affordable for parents. 
As any parent will tell you, raising kids is hard. But it’s not difficult to see ways to at least make parenting — and childhood — a bit easier. If Republicans want more babies, they should stop punishing the parents who already have them. Parents don’t need platitudes. They need paid leave, child care they can afford, and food on the table. If politicians can’t deliver that, they should stop pretending to care about families at all.

Court records show that on April 24, a judge granted Sharma-Crawford’s motion for a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration revocation of their legal status as students . On May Wednesday, the judge extended the order to May 21.
Since Trump took office in January, Sharma-Crawford said, she’s seen an “unheard of” number of international students seek her counsel over having their immigration status terminated.
When the federal government notified the students, Sharma-Crawford said, they were told they had been “identified in criminal records” – with no elaboration.
Sharma-Crawford said on the Kansas Reflector podcast that students lost their status without explanation or communication. She said it was done to ultimately harm international students and the universities.
“Here you have somebody who is acting in a completely opaque manner with no transparency impacting people’s schooling, and their liberty and their rights even to go to school without any kind of proper notice, without any kind of proper hearing,” Sharma-Crawford said.

The plaintiffs — who attend Truman State University, Northwest Missouri State University or Southeast Missouri State University or have extended status to continue post-graduation work — in Sharma-Crawford’s lawsuit received notification in April that their Student and Exchange Visitor Program status had been revoked.
In the lawsuit, Sharma-Crawford outlined some reasons the students believe their statuses were revoked for operating a vehicle without a valid driver’s license, a noise complaint, a discontinued felony theft charge, a fleeing charge, an arrest for public intoxication, and traffic violations.
The lawsuit said the students paid all associated fines and had no reason to believe their status would be terminated. None of the potential criminal records, according to Sharma-Crawford, was enough to terminate their visas.
Yanky Perelmuter, an immigration attorney based in Overland Park, said he’s seen the same.
“Almost all of the students I’ve talked to have some underlying petty criminal issue, like speeding tickets, or shoplifting, maybe a DUI,” Perelmuter said.
The Kansas conference of the American Association of University Professors recently condemned the Trump administration’s targeting of college and university international students and scholars. The group asked higher education administrators to stop cooperating with federal investigators by giving them students’ personal information.
The way students found out about their change in immigration status also was problematic, Sharma-Crawford said communication was an issue.
“Students weren’t even getting notifications. Their schools were getting notifications,” Sharma-Crawford said. That robs students of due process, she said.
But, she said, the universities communicated with the students immediately and connected them with legal resources. She said the most important resources universities can provide are for mental health.
“It is critical that they not only have the legal backing but they have the stamina mentally,” Sharma-Crawford said.
Kansas Reflector reached out to every state university — the University of Kansas, Kansas State University, Pittsburg State University, Emporia State University, Wichita State University and Fort Hays State University — as well as Washburn University, and asked how many international students had their status terminated and what support was provided. Most of the universities did not respond, but Fort Hays and Pittsburg State said they’re monitoring the issue and are connecting students with resources.
Sharma-Crawford said she wasn’t surprised that most of the universities didn’t respond. She said the Trump administration uses fear and intimidation as a tactic to scare universities and international students.
“It’s hindering them from wanting to be here or come here,” Sharma-Crawford said. “I think, in some ways, that’s the plan. Because if you can economically harm the universities, then the universities will bend to your will.”
Sharma-Crawford said one of the cruelest parts of this is the timing. The students were notified of termination roughly one month before finals. She said the stress of it caused some students to immediately leave the country without seeking legal help. Sharma-Crawford encouraged any affected student to seek individualized legal help.

It’s been six long months now, but North Carolina’s seemingly never ending state Supreme Court election may soon be over. This past week, federal Judge Richard Myers II – a Republican appointed by President Trump — issued a complete rejection of GOP candidate Jefferson Griffin’s effort to overturn his narrow defeat by tossing the ballots of thousands of voters. In a detailed 68-page opinion, Myers wrote that Griffin’s effort to change rules governing voter eligibility after the election violates the U.S. Constitution.
One advocacy group especially heartened by the ruling was the North Carolina League of Women Voters – which intervened in the case – and the day after the ruling came down, NC Newsline caught up with the League’s president, Jennifer Rubin.

In 2022, there were 29 library title challenges in the state, according to the American Library Association. That number more than quadrupled the following year, reaching 117 in 2023.
The Accountability Project paired up with Connecticut Public state government reporter Michayla Savitt to explore the topic.
We interviewed librarians, parents and state lawmakers, and sifted through hundreds of school board meeting minutes.
We found books that spark controversy in Connecticut are often intended for young readers, and discuss themes of gender identity, sexual orientation, sexual education, race and racism.
In one example, at the Cragin Memorial Library in Colchester, a patron filed a petition in 2022 against the book “Who is RuPaul?”, which was on display for Pride Month, a celebration of the impact lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people have had in the United States and beyond. The book is part of a popular children’s biography series meant for kids ages 9 to 12.
The book was eventually put back on the shelves. But similar challenges have become more frequent, and the process of evaluating literature differs from one community to the next.

In response, Connecticut lawmakers have explored creating a more uniform approach. One bill, which is in committee, would immunize librarians from civil and criminal liability stemming from challenges to library materials.
Another bill would require all libraries to create a process to handle book petitions or challenges. Under the measure, a title couldn’t be removed solely because someone finds it offensive. Books would also be protected from additional challenges for three years if an attempt to have them removed fails.
Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff, a Norwalk Democrat, helped introduce that measure. The legislation might make it easier to track exactly how many books are being challenged in the state.
State Republicans have proposed other provisions, saying minors shouldn’t be able to access materials that have sexually explicit content or nudity.
“We’re not trying to ban books,” state Sen. Henri Martin, a Bristol Republican, said in an exchange at a February public hearing. “What we’re trying to do is protect our children.”

The American Library Association, a nonprofit that promotes libraries and library education, tracks efforts to ban or restrict access to reading materials nationally. To collect that information, it relies on news stories and reports from individual librarians.
That means some attempts to take books off the shelves can be missed.
Some librarians won’t report book bans out of fear, said Jenny Lussier, president of the Connecticut Association of School Librarians. Some school librarians in Connecticut have received threats for doing so, she added.
“We’re all professionals,” Lussier said. “We all want what’s best for our kids.”

Over the past decade, a Minnesota program called Early Learning Scholarships has awarded over 100,000 child care scholarships to families in desperate need.
State leaders who made that possible don’t often get to hear how that impacts those children and families. To them, it’s just another number on another spreadsheet.
If they did hear all of those stories, I bet they wouldn’t be on the verge of cutting scholarship funding. If the Legislature and Gov. Tim Walz don’t take action, about $100 million will be cut from the Early Learning Scholarship program. If this cut happens, the long-term effects on families and Minnesota would be disastrous. 
That’s why I am sharing my story.  
Scholarships literally changed the lives of me and my daughter Oaklyn.  
Early Learning Scholarships empower low-income families with babies, toddlers and preschoolers to access high-quality child care and preschool programs. These are the kinds of programs that get kids ready for kindergarten and everything that comes after. There is no way my daughter Oaklyn could have benefited from such a program without scholarships. We simply couldn’t have come close to affording it. 
Here’s our situation: Like millions of Americans, I have struggled with addiction and an abusive marriage. When I was pregnant with Oaklyn, I stayed sober. After she was born, I relapsed. My absolute rock bottom came when Child Protective Services took Oaklyn away from me.  
When that happened, I knew I needed help. My CPS case manager connected me with Wayside Recovery Center, where I started my recovery journey. Thank goodness for them, too. 
As I was going through treatment, Oaklyn and I were living in a shelter. Shelter staff encouraged me to apply for an Early Learning Scholarship. I was thrilled when I learned that we qualified and had been awarded a scholarship that we could use at any high-quality early learning program of our choosing! 
We chose Rise Early Learning Center, a four-star Parent Aware-rated child care program that is co-located in a housing complex in St. Louis Park. Beyond early learning for Oaklyn, Rise also helped me with support for toilet training, nutrition and other parenting challenges. They’ve helped Oaklyn communicate about the big emotions that she was feeling, and her vocabulary has grown so much.
At the same time, having Oaklyn in child care during the day allowed me to take care of the things I needed to take care of, and be more present with Oaklyn and treasure our time together. That part was huge, too. 
Because of the scholarship, I’ve been able to further my education. I’m working toward my certification as a Licensed Alcohol and Drug Counselor through Minneapolis Community and Technical College. I’m not quite there yet, but I can now see a clear path to financial independence and being a constructive part of my community. 
I can’t tell you how much it meant to me to have access to early learning help for Oaklyn and non-judgmental parenting advice for me. That’s happening because of Rise, but access to Rise is happening because of scholarships. And Early Learning Scholarships are happening because of the Legislature and governor. 
The Legislature is facing a difficult budget situation. I get that. I really do. But it breaks my heart to think that tens of thousands of little kids like Oaklyn could lose this opportunity for a much better life.  
Because Oaklyn and I are getting this amazing help now, I firmly believe that taxpayers won’t have to pay for as many expensive services to support us in the future. As great as scholarships have been for us, that seems like a good deal for taxpayers, too. 
Whatever happens with the budget this year, I wanted to wholeheartedly thank state legislators and Gov. Tim Walz for making a scholarship available to Oaklyn. It is changing the trajectory of her life. 
I just shared one life-changing story, but you have it within your grasp to empower another 15,000 other stories like ours every single year. That’s what funding Early Learning Scholarships for all eligible families would do. 
I hope you can find a way to do that for other great kids like Oaklyn.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/D753AC86-F1DD-456D-BA50-EDD802758461-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-05-12 11:12:31.759657

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Auditor Rob Sand, the only Democrat to currently hold statewide office in Iowa, announced his campaign for governor Monday.
Sand was widely expected to run for the position as a Democratic nominee, having raised more than $8 million in the 2024 calendar year, according to the Des Moines Register. But Sand is facing a different playing field for governor than predicted heading into the 2026 election cycle: Gov. Kim Reynolds announced she will not seek reelection in 2026, meaning Republicans are also facing an open primary in the gubernatorial race.
Several Republican elected officials, including Attorney General Brenna Bird, House Speaker Pat Grassley and U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra have said they are considering a campaign for governor. Iowa Sen. Mike Bousselot, R-Ankeny, has launched an exploratory committee for the governor’s race, and former state Rep. Brad Sherman entered the race in February, before Reynolds’ announcement.
While other Democrats may join the race for governor, Sand is considered a top contender to become the Democratic nominee. Though not competing against an incumbent could be favorable in the race, Sand and Democrats still must win over Iowa voters who have overwhelmingly elected Republicans in recent state and federal elections. Iowa’s congressional delegation is entirely Republican, and GOP supermajorities were elected in 2024 for both chambers of the Legislature. All statewide elected officials other than Sand are Republicans.
In a news release announcing his campaign, Sand said Iowa families and communities are falling behind because current elected leaders “aren’t focused on the issues that matter most.” He said he would bring his experience working as state auditor to the governor’s office to improve government accountability and work across the aisle to make improvements to the state.
“I’ve spent my career fighting for Iowans – locking up corrupt public officials, violent criminals, scammers, and thieves, rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse, and holding members of both parties accountable,” Sand said in a statement. “Now, I’m taking my fight to the governor’s office to serve all Iowans by lowering costs, continuing to make government accountable to taxpayers, and working with both parties to create more opportunities to help Iowa families not just get by, but thrive and live healthy lives.”
Sand, 42, was first elected as state auditor in 2018, defeating former state auditor Mary Mosiman, the Republican incumbent. He gained prominence working previously as assistant attorney general under former Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller, prosecuting cases including the Hot Lotto fraud case, a lottery rigging scandal.
He was reelected as auditor in 2022, retaining his position during an election cycle when several Democratic incumbents — including Miller, Iowa Treasurer Michael Fitzgerald and U.S. Rep. Cindy Axne — were defeated by Republican challengers.
Sand has repeatedly clashed with Republican leaders as auditor over issues like accessing information related to management of the Education Savings Account program providing public funding for private school costs, and Reynolds’ use of some federal COVID money before it had been officially allocated. Most recently, GOP state lawmakers on the House Government Oversight Committee questioned Sand about why his office had not more quickly identified or reported on the misallocation of $27.5 million in court debt funds between fiscal years 2021 and 2024 caused by coding errors.
Both Republican leaders and Sand have accused one another of pursuing these actions for political purposes. Sand has also criticized the GOP-controlled Legislature for passing laws restricting the auditor’s office from accessing certain information and limiting the office’s ability to file subpoenas against state government entities in order to access information, instead sending disputes to a three-member board of arbitration.
Sand said in a video posted to social media Monday that current leadership in Iowa state government serves “special interests and insiders,” saying he would instead focus on ensuring the government serves all Iowans.
“I’m doing it because we need more public service and less politics,” Sand said. “A lot of politicians yap about making a place redder or bluer — I want Iowa to be better and truer.”
Republican Governors Association Communications Director Courtney Alexander criticized Sand as an “extreme liberal” in a statement Monday.
“Democrats’ media darling Rob Sand is just another extreme liberal, supporting guys playing in girls’ sports and opposing President Trump’s agenda. Sand would turn Iowa into Tim Walz’s Minnesota: higher taxes and radical liberal values,” Alexander said in a statement. “Iowans want a governor who will protect their values and tax dollars, not one who needs his rich family to be named the ‘Influencer of Iowa Democrats’ by the New York Times.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/sand.judicial1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-12 11:12:31.759657

A new nationwide study reveals significant disparities in pet healthcare across the United States, with Colorado emerging as the best state for veterinary care and Delaware ranking last.
The analysis, conducted by Your Service Animal, underscores how factors such as emergency clinic access, veterinarian availability, and care costs vary dramatically depending on location — with real consequences for pets and their owners.
The report evaluated all 50 states using a composite Pet Healthcare Quality Score, which combined metrics including the number of licensed veterinarians per 100,000 residents, availability of 24/7 emergency clinics, average costs of care, and pet insurance rates.
Colorado secured the top spot thanks to a balanced combination of high vet availability, robust emergency services, and above-average insurance coverage.

Delaware’s pet healthcare ranking
Delaware received a score of 0.00 — the lowest possible — due to a severe lack of emergency clinics, a low number of vets, and minimal pet insurance coverage among residents.
“Pet owners often don’t realize how much their location affects their ability to get quality care for their animals until it’s too late,” says Nick Jordan, Founder of Your Service Animal. “Understanding these disparities helps families make better decisions about their pets’ health needs.”
Delaware’s shortcomings are especially stark.
The state has no 24/7 emergency veterinary clinics, only 38.11 veterinarians per 100,000 residents, and a pet insurance rate of just 0.4%. Combined with relatively high routine care costs ($78.95), the situation forces many pet owners to travel out of state for urgent treatment, creating potentially life-threatening delays.
The study also challenges assumptions about urban-rural divides.
“Delaware’s situation highlights how geographic factors can create healthcare deserts even in smaller states,” Jordan said. “Pet owners there often need to cross state lines for emergency care, creating dangerous delays in treatment.”
While rural areas are often associated with limited access to services, states like Wyoming and Vermont performed well, largely due to their high number of veterinarians per capita. Wyoming, for instance, has no emergency clinics but leads the nation with 130.95 veterinarians per 100,000 residents.
The relationship between cost and care quality also proved inconsistent.
States like New York and Illinois rank near the bottom despite high veterinary costs, whereas Nebraska, with lower average costs, ranked seventh overall.
“Our findings reveal how drastically pet healthcare quality varies across America,” Jordan said. “When pets lack access to timely care, preventable conditions often become emergencies, which results in higher costs and worse outcomes. For those in low-ranking states, I advise establishing a relationship with a primary vet before emergencies occur, researching the nearest 24/7 facilities (even across state lines), building an emergency fund, and considering pet insurance to manage costs.”
As more Americans welcome pets into their homes, the study highlights the importance of equitable access to veterinary care — and the need for pet owners to understand the unique challenges their state might present.

(Photo by Getty Images)A bipartisan group of lawmakers wants to change oversight of child welfare in Maine to mirror the approach taken by its neighboring state.
Assistant House Majority Leader Lori Gramlich, an Old Orchard Beach Democrat, said she modeled her bill after the New Hampshire Office of the Child Advocate. LD 1893, which has two Republican and seven Democrat co-sponsors, would transfer Maine’s existing child welfare ombudsman into a new, independent agency with expanding responsibilities to advocate for Maine children.
The proposed Office of Child Advocate would have the authority to receive complaints, access information, investigate, make public reports, and advise the executive and legislative branches on how best to provide services to the state’s youth.
“This bill builds a foundation for meaningful oversight and reform while ensuring children’s voices and interests remain at the forefront,” Gramlich told the Legislature’s Health and Human Services Committee during a public hearing Friday morning.
After renewed scrutiny in recent years, there have been multiple proposals from lawmakers and agency leadership to improve the state’s embattled child welfare system. Last year, frontline workers came forward with accounts of onerous workloads that culminated in December with a letter of no confidence in the agency’s leadership.
The proposed restructuring comes after the committee backed a proposal to update the state’s definition of child abuse and neglect that legal experts have argued is easy to conflate with poverty.
Christine Alberi, the state’s current child welfare ombudsman, supports the bill to transition her position into an Office of Child Advocate because it preserves the work her office is already doing while adding “necessary functions.” For example, the new office would allow for juvenile justice investigations and access to facilities such as Long Creek Youth Development Center, the South Portland-based youth correctional facility.
However, Alberi said that adequate funding would be crucial to the office’s success. During the hearing, she said it wasn’t clear where those resources would come from, since the ombudsman office has struggled with a lack of funding for staff since 2012.
The current child welfare ombudsman program in Maine operates as a nonprofit that assists and investigates complaints against how child protective services cases are handled. It submits an annual report that includes an analysis of case specific reviews and other details about its interaction with the Office of Child and Family Services.
Having served as New Hampshire’s first child advocate, Moira O’Neill said she believes Maine could have avoided a lawsuit with the U.S. Department of Justice over the state’s children’s behavioral health services had there been a proactive resource checking on the children in the care of the Department of Corrections. The suit was settled last November.
O’Neill, who helped craft the model in New Hampshire before stepping down in 2021, supported Maine adopting that structure. She said Maine’s current ombudsman office leaves many children, especially those in the juvenile justice system, without an ally.
Republican lawmakers in New Hampshire have expressed interest in cutting the Office of Child Advocate when looking for ways to trim the state budget.
Gramlich said the Office of the Attorney General suggested modest amendments to the bill that she is happy to work with the committee to incorporate.
The Department of Health and Human Services, which houses the state’s child welfare agency, spoke neither for nor against the bill. Director of Government Relations Abby Stivers said the department would like more time to review the proposal, but cautioned that the new framework being proposed likely requires more consideration than the department can give it in the remaining time for this legislative session.
Stivers said the authority granted to the child advocate in this legislation could be wide reaching and questioned whether it is necessary given the multiple forms of oversight that already exist for child welfare services. The agency is subject to federal oversight, multiple citizen review panels and was subject to extensive investigative work from the Legislature’s Government Oversight Committee last session.
However, Sen. Joe Baldacci, a Penobscot Democrat, reintroduced a bill he brought forth last session to create an Office of the Inspector General of Child Protection.
“The problems with the Maine Department of Health and Human Services are going to require far more than cosmetic surgery being suggested by some,” he told the committee when introducing LD 770.
An inspector general at the state level would send a “clear and articulate message” that the accountability and transparency of Maine’s child welfare system needs to be substantially changed, Baldacci said. He referenced a 2024 report from the federal watchdog that indicated Maine struggled to comply with best practices in the vast majority of abuse and neglect cases.
Under this proposal, the inspector general would be appointed by the governor to serve a five year term, with the potential for reappointment. It would also take on matters related to juvenile justice and have subpoena powers.
No one from the public testified on the bill. Bobbi Johnson, director of the Office of Child and Family Services, provided written testimony opposing the legislation. She wrote that it isn’t clear what benefit the role would offer to the “robust and comprehensive oversight of child welfare that already exists.”

A bill heading to the governor’s desk allows the state Attorney General’s Office to subpoena websites and internet providers to locate people suspected of accessing child pornography.
Attorney General Alan Wilson called the bill unanimously approved in both chambers a “game changer” for his office.
“It will make it so much easier to go after child predators online,” Wilson told reporters Friday.
According to Wilson, his office has made about 3,000 arrests for internet sex crimes since his tenure began in 2011.
The cases can be delayed for weeks, sometimes even months, as state prosecutors wait for court authority to get the information needed to track down suspects, he said.
The bill would enable the task force to get that information in a day or two if it relates to internet sex crimes.
“It’s going to cut the time down tremendously for going after people who are preying on children online,” said Wilson, who’s been advocating for this proposal for at least three years.
The new authority applies only to subpoenas issued by the Attorney General’s Office in cases investigated by the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force.
Ensuring that the bill was specific about that was crucial, said Sen. Matthew Leber, a co-sponsor of the proposal.
“We wanted to address the problem at hand and not create unintended consequences,” the Johns Island Republican told the SC Daily Gazette.
Another co-sponsor is Sen. Jason Elliott, a former prosecutor in Anderson and Greenville counties.
This bill is “a vital step in protecting children,” said the Greenville Republican.
Gov. Henry McMaster is expected to sign the legislation.
When he does, “we’ll be able to get to work and use this to better serve our state,” Wilson said.
SC AG seeks law criminalizing ‘artificial’ child pornography

Also expected to be signed into law are two bills criminalizing the use of technology to create child pornography — whether using actual or computer-generated photos of children. Both received final approval by the Legislature last week after similar bills fell short in 2024.
“We have to catch the laws up,” Wilson told reporters. “When they were writing child exploitation laws, no one ever dreamed that you could create children, or morph images of innocent children into these types of pictures and videos.”
Wilson is expected to be among candidates running for governor in 2026, though he hasn’t officially made a decision. One could be coming in the “not too distant future,” he told reporters Friday.
U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace, another likely candidate, has repeatedly claimed that Wilson doesn’t do enough to prosecute child predators.
The attorney general responded to the criticisms Saturday, referring to Mace only as a “would-be candidate” for governor.
His response on X included advocating for the bills soon to be law. He also says he quadrupled the size of the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force.
“Enough is enough,” he wrote. “I won’t allow someone to use lies, misinformation, and half truths (at best) to cast a negative light on hardworking men and women of law enforcement.”
The 1st District congresswoman followed up with another criticism, writing on X that “when predators walk free, that’s on him. The buck stops at Alan Wilson. Period.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_4587-scaled-1-1024x587.jpg,,,2025-05-12 11:12:31.759657

It’s a tough time for legislators who take their jobs seriously and try to understand every proposal on which they’re voting – a task that some have more success with than others.
One lawmaker who’s gotten pretty good at the speed-reading and comprehension that crossover week demands is Rep.

Hill City had hoped to use Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities funding for a floodplain study of the creek. (Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)Drinking water upgrades for Mobridge, efficiency boosting software systems for Rapid City and a tornado shelter for Chancellor are among the South Dakota projects that now count as formerly funded by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
FEMA announced the axing of its Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) grant program last month in a press release lambasting the Biden-era creation as “wasteful” and “politicized.”
The 2021 program aimed to direct $1 billion in funding toward infrastructure projects to help communities across the U.S. “reduce their hazard risk” as they “build capability and capacity.”


Federal Fallout
Go to the Federal Fallout page for Searchlight coverage of Trump administration firings, funding freezes, spending cuts, grant cancellations, tariffs and immigration enforcement.


The press release from the Trump administration’s incarnation of FEMA says all awards from 2020 through 2024 are rescinded, and that all the money that hasn’t been distributed won’t be. The unspent $882 million will flow into the U.S. Treasury or be reallocated by Congress, the release says.
FEMA falls under the leadership of Homeland Security Secretary and former South Dakota governor Kristi Noem. 
The program “was more concerned with political agendas than helping Americans affected by natural disasters,” the FEMA release says. “Under Secretary Noem’s leadership, we are committed to ensuring that Americans in crisis can get the help and resources they need.”
The South Dakota Democratic Party issued a press release of its own on the cessation of the grant program, one trashing Noem’s agency and Trump’s policies as damaging to South Dakota communities.
“Because of these cuts, city and county leaders will now have to scramble to either figure out where the rest of the money will come from, or ditch their projects altogether, leaving their communities vulnerable to disasters” wrote Shane Merrill, chair of the state party.
According to a tally of federal cuts compiled and updated weekly by the administration of Noem’s successor, Gov. Larry Rhoden, $8.9 million in South Dakota projects were set to benefit from BRIC grants. Based on South Dakota Searchlight calls to local governments involved in the projects, it’s unclear if that total figure represents the amount of grant money lost, or the total project costs including other funding sources. 
Mobridge water treatment
Some BRIC money was collected and spent before the shuttering of the program. The city of Mobridge got $311,000 for phase one of a three-phase project to replace the piping that delivers Missouri River water from Lake Oahe to the city’s water treatment plant on its way to residents’ taps.
That first round of BRIC money paid for engineering, planning and a dive team survey, all undertaken in preparation of the second round of BRIC funding, which Mobridge Finance Officer Heather Beck said would’ve set the physical piping upgrade portion of the project in motion. 
“We had been told by the FEMA folks that if phase one is awarded, they had never seen the second phase not get awarded,” Beck said.
The anticipated grant assistance with the pipe rebuild was a boon to Mobridge’s larger $11.2 million drinking water project. Water bills paid by the north-central South Dakota community’s residents are enough to keep the city “self-sustaining” for the most part, Beck said, but the cost of major upgrades can be a heavy one to spread around.










We had been told by the FEMA folks that if phase one is awarded, they had never seen the second phase not get awarded.


– Heather Beck, Mobridge city finance officer


“With only 3,200 people, it takes more from them to be able to pay for these projects,” Beck said.
The city’s on the lookout for more state or federal funding sources now, Beck said. The city had taken in some grant funding from the American Rescue Plan Act for the wider water treatment project already, but “a lot of that $11.2 million has had to be borrowed.”
City leadership has reached out to South Dakota’s congressional delegation in hopes that some of the grant funding can be restored through a program that’s not shuttered.
Mobridge’s nearly $4 million BRIC-funded project, with grant funding passed through to the city by Walworth County, was the largest project on the $8.9 million list of grant-supported projects in South Dakota. The city was set to pay 20% of the cost, meaning it lost out on about $3.2 million.
Rapid City building codes, tornado shelters
The project with the second-highest price tag on the state’s tally of lost grant funding was $2.6 million. That project was meant to help Rapid City cover the labor costs of updating its fire codes, pay for software that would allow citizens or companies to submit documents like building permits or developer plans online, and to upgrade its computing systems to connect departments and avoid duplicate work between departments managing development and permitting. 
A letter from Mayor Jason Salamun to the U.S. Senate majority leader, South Dakota Republican John Thune, says the work aligns “with the priorities of the Trump-Vance administration.”

“Our project was specifically designed to enhance operational efficiency within our local government, ultimately saving taxpayer dollars and reducing administrative burdens for both city staff and the general public, including housing developers,” the letter reads.
Rapid City’s share of the project was $623,093; the BRIC program was set to cover a little under a million dollars. 
The city also hoped to create an inventory of potentially hazardous buildings, although Grants Division Manager Jamie Toennies said decisions on what the city might do to address those buildings would come later.
“Opportunities are there to proactively keep the buildings from getting in worse shape,” she said.
The city is on the lookout for more funding sources, Toennies said, as “we had identified this need before this grant.”
The third-largest South Dakota project was $485,973 for the town of Chancellor, home to 316 people and one large ethanol production plant. According to a map of FEMA-funded mitigation projects maintained by the state, the town was in line for BRIC support of a severe wind and tornado shelter. 
Hill City, a city of around 1,000 in Pennington County, had asked for, but wasn’t awarded, money for a floodplain study of Spring Creek, which runs through town. Finance Officer Stacia Tallon said the federal share of the $167,200 project would have helped the city determine where to put replacement box culverts to mitigate flood risk, and to map out areas that might be safe for building.
The box culvert piece of the project in particular is still necessary, Tallon said, although it’s unclear when or how the city will be able to move forward with the plans.
“We’re still looking at them, but they’ve been kind of put on the back burner,” Tallon said.

Photo courtesy of the Williston ObserverThis story by Jason Starr was first published in the Williston Observer on May 8.Hey, let’s start a school newspaper!Those maybe aren’t words you’d expect to hear from high-schoolers in the mid-2020s, but that’s exactly what the three founders of The Hawks’ Nest have done this school year at CVU.Not since 2008 has the high school had a news source readers could physically hold and thumb through. A journalism class produced an online news site in recent years, but even that went dark at the end of last school year. Enter juniors Grace Warrington, Karmen Wilbur and Lily Gruber, three friends from Shelburne, Williston and Charlotte, respectively, who nurtured a vision of a new student-run print newspaper through last spring and summer. By fall, they had lined up an out-of-state printer and distribution plan, and in October published the premier issue of The Hawks’ Nest. They’ve since published four other issues.“We knew from the start we wanted to do print,” Wilbur said. “It’s important that people are able to actually pick it up … It’s more likely to be read. With online papers, you have to go out of your way to find them.”The paper is available in the cafeteria and library, as well as put in teachers’ mailboxes for them to distribute to their homeroom students. Wilbur recalls seeing a classmate discover The Hawks’ Nest for the first time. “I saw someone pick it up and start reading it and be like, ‘Oh, this is cool.’ I was like, ‘Oh my God, I had a hand in making that. And now I get to watch you enjoy it.’ … We’ve put so much work into it, and it has been just so cool to see people reading it.”Operating as a journalism club with a mostly hands-off faculty advisor, The Hawks’ Nest staff has grown to about seven writers, with coverage of sports, academic and arts events, staff profiles, opinion pieces and school policy news. For the current issue, Warrington wrote Part 1 of a definitive history of CVU school newspapers, with interviews of graduates from the 1970s who recall the days of the school’s original newspaper, The Clarion (1964-1972), and its successor The Cow Valley Press (1972-1979). The Hawks’ Nest will publish Part 2 of that history, written by Wilbur, in its final issue of the school year later this month. “We think it is important for a high school to have a school newspaper because it is an excellent way to build community and hear everyone’s voices and diverse opinions, along with giving students a chance to practice their journalistic skills,” Warrington, as editor-in-chief, wrote in the paper’s inaugural edition in October.Faculty advisor Justin Chapman added: “It’s a civic necessity. It’s integral to the functioning of any democratic institution, including and especially public schools … There’s a reason Jefferson referred to the press as the fourth pillar of American Democracy.”Publishing the paper has brought the founding trio closer together as friends. It’s also given them career skills and leadership experience. “It’s a way students can collaborate together to make something,” Warrington said. “I also think it’s important that students are given a chance to give their own perspectives on what’s happening in their school and what’s happening in the world, too.”The challenge of continuity of a school newspaper, with staff constantly moving on through graduation, is illustrated in the rise and fall of former CVU papers: The Clarion, The Cow Valley Press, The Crusader, the Champlain Valley Chronicle. If The Hawks’ Nest is to continue for more than another year, Wilbur, Warrington and Gruber will have to find underclass editors to take the reins. “I’d love to get some of the incoming freshmen to help because obviously we need to pass it on,” Warrington said.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Press on: Students launch CVU newspaper.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/The-Hawks-Nest-1024x419.jpg,,,2025-05-12 11:12:31.759657

That said, there are sound and accurate ways to do this important work that keep things up to date without disenfranchising voters who may simply have skipped an election or two — and as a new report from researchers at the Southern Coalition for Social Justice shows, this is an area in which North Carolina officials can and should do a better job.
Fortunately, as Newsline’s Rob Schofield was reminded in a recent conversation with the Southern Coalition’s senior voting rights counsel Hilary Harris Klein, the solutions in this area aren’t terribly complex and many are largely just a function of providing adequate funding to state and county election officials to hire necessary staff and purchase 21st century computer systems.

Courtesy of Minnesota House Public Information Services.Welcome to The Topline, a weekly roundup of the big numbers driving the Minnesota news cycle, as well as the smaller ones that you might have missed. This week: what’s in the Senate’s $365 million tax omnibus; a record-high graduation rate; the summer air quality outlook; and tallying the attorney general’s lawsuits against the Trump administration.
What’s in the Senate tax omnibus
Last week the Senate Tax Committee approved an omnibus tax bill with $365 million in new revenue over the next biennium. About $315 million of that figure comes from new taxes, with the remainder coming primarily from the expiration of various tax aids and credits.
A new tax on large social media companies accounts for the lion’s share of the proposed new revenue and would generate $138 million in the next biennium, according to Senate analysts’ estimates. 
The bill would also raise the rate of the net investment income tax from 1.0% to 1.5%, generating $74 million. That tax applies to investment income exceeding $1 million.
Another provision would reduce the maximum operating loss deduction in the corporate franchise tax, bringing in another $62 million.
About $40 million in additional revenue would come from reducing aid to local and county governments.
The bill still needs to pass the full Senate and undergo reconciliation with the House tax bill. Republicans, who share control of the Minnesota House, and allied groups oppose higher taxes — since in this case they’re not called “tariffs” — and have been critical of the Senate bill. So it’s unclear how many of these provisions will make it all the way through to the desk of Gov. Tim Walz. 
Lawmakers are also eyeing $300 million in cuts to the human services budget as the state attempts to forestall future budget deficits.
High school graduation rate hits new record
The Walz administration and teachers’ groups cheered the release last week of new data showing the statewide high school graduation rate edged to its highest level on record. The rate increased from 83.3% in 2023 to 84.2% in 2024, or nearly a full percentage point. It’s the highest rate on record, and the largest year-over-year increase in a decade.
“The graduation data show increases for students in the American Indian, Asian, Black, Hispanic or Latino and white student groups,” the Minnesota Department of Education noted. “Graduation rates also increased for English learners, students from low-income families, and students receiving special education services.”
The graduation rate among Asian and Hispanic students increased by about 2.5 percentage points, as did the rate among all students eligible for free or reduced-price meals. English learners posted the biggest year-over-year increase at 3.9 percentage points. 
Relative to 2020, the graduation rate among Indigenous and Black students increased by roughly 4.5 percentage points.
This aligns with a 2019 Walz goal to raise graduation rates. 
Staggering racial disparities remain, however. While nearly 90% of white students graduated, fewer than two thirds of Indigenous pupils did. The rate for Black and Hispanic students is closer to 75%.
“These Minnesota students overcame the disruptions and distractions of a global pandemic and a national racial reckoning after the murder of George Floyd to graduate at the highest rate on record,” said outgoing Education Minnesota president Denise Specht. “It’s remarkable, and a testament to the resilience of the students and the quality of instruction and support they received from their educators and families.” 
While the improvement in the graduation rate is welcome, data released at the beginning of the school year shows that student achievement still lags well behind the pre-pandemic levels, and in some cases continues to fall.
Summer ozone levels expected to be slightly above historic averages
Forecasters with the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency expect outdoor ozone levels to be unhealthy for sensitive groups between four and seven days this summer, slightly above average. 
The agency also expects 12 to 16 days of wildfire smoke impacts, up from last summer’s forecast of five to seven expected alerts.
MPCA will also begin issuing alerts for PM10, which covers airborne particles larger than those that make up wildfire smoke. It’s typically caused by blowing dust, which is an issue in agricultural areas between fall and spring, when topsoil can get blown off bare fields.
The agency issues regular air quality updates and forecasts on its website.
Keith Ellison has sued the Trump administration 22 times
The Star Tribune recently launched an ongoing tally of Attorney General Keith Ellison’s lawsuits against the Trump administration. The tally so far is 22, most of which were filed in conjunction with the attorneys general of a handful of other states.
The lawsuits cover everything from the administration’s anti-transgender actions to the abrupt cancellation of various types of grant funding to Elon Musk’s allegedly improper influence over the workings of the federal government.

While farming first brought him into the agriculture world, 802Logging founder Seth Robillard cut his own path to success in the woods.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  802Logging: From family farm to forestry enterprise.","“If VEDA financing weren’t an option, the landscape would be drastically different for my business,” Robillard said. While farming first brought him into the agriculture world, 802Logging founder Seth Robillard cut his own path to success in the woods. Growing up on Robillard Brother’s Farm, run by his parents and grandparents, he learned early on about operating heavy equipment and the value of hard work. At just 15 years old, Robillard and his brothers took over the farm and continued farming for several years. Making ends meet became increasingly difficult, and Robillard, determined to discover his own path, embarked on a new journey. He launched 802Logging, LLC on Jan. 1, 2018. His logging operation quickly expanded to include firewood sales and, eventually, composting services. This diversification was crucial in providing a steady income stream, especially during the dreaded mud season. As most loggers can attest, business is continually at the mercy of Mother Nature and machinery. VEDA came into the picture as Robillard was looking to purchase a feller buncher, a machine similar to an excavator but equipped with a saw head and accumulating fingers. Without it, he would need to hire custom operators, which would be a huge expense and logistical challenge. Owning the machine would save time and money. It would allow him to cut smaller amounts of wood at a time, critical during warm winter days when freeze-thaw cycles could potentially ruin inventory. For Robillard, the VEDA connection was personal. His partner, Nicole, went to college with loan officer Andy Wood. Adding fellow loan officer Colleen Leonard into the equation led to a five-year loan that significantly boosted efficiencies within the business. “If VEDA financing weren’t an option, the landscape would be drastically different for my business,” Robillard said. “The terms of the loan were instrumental in purchasing the feller buncher, and without it, our ability to secure a working lands grant would have been non-existent.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  802Logging: From family farm to forestry enterprise.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/VEDA_SS-0513251-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-12 10:12:18.157936

(Grace Hills/Kansas Reflector)KANSAS CITY, Mo. — Immigration attorney Rekha Sharma-Crawford filed a federal lawsuit against President Donald Trump’s attempts to block five international students from their college educations — and so far, she’s winning.
Court records show that on April 24, a judge granted Sharma-Crawford’s motion for a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration revocation of their legal status as students . On May Wednesday, the judge extended the order to May 21.
Since Trump took office in January, Sharma-Crawford said, she’s seen an “unheard of” number of international students seek her counsel over having their immigration status terminated.
When the federal government notified the students, Sharma-Crawford said, they were told they had been “identified in criminal records” – with no elaboration.
Sharma-Crawford said on the Kansas Reflector podcast that students lost their status without explanation or communication. She said it was done to ultimately harm international students and the universities.
“Here you have somebody who is acting in a completely opaque manner with no transparency impacting people’s schooling, and their liberty and their rights even to go to school without any kind of proper notice, without any kind of proper hearing,” Sharma-Crawford said.


The plaintiffs — who attend Truman State University, Northwest Missouri State University or Southeast Missouri State University or have extended status to continue post-graduation work — in Sharma-Crawford’s lawsuit received notification in April that their Student and Exchange Visitor Program status had been revoked.
In the lawsuit, Sharma-Crawford outlined some reasons the students believe their statuses were revoked for operating a vehicle without a valid driver’s license, a noise complaint, a discontinued felony theft charge, a fleeing charge, an arrest for public intoxication, and traffic violations.
The lawsuit said the students paid all associated fines and had no reason to believe their status would be terminated. None of the potential criminal records, according to Sharma-Crawford, was enough to terminate their visas.
Yanky Perelmuter, an immigration attorney based in Overland Park, said he’s seen the same.
“Almost all of the students I’ve talked to have some underlying petty criminal issue, like speeding tickets, or shoplifting, maybe a DUI,” Perelmuter said.
The Kansas conference of the American Association of University Professors recently condemned the Trump administration’s targeting of college and university international students and scholars. The group asked higher education administrators to stop cooperating with federal investigators by giving them students’ personal information.
The way students found out about their change in immigration status also was problematic, Sharma-Crawford said communication was an issue.
“Students weren’t even getting notifications. Their schools were getting notifications,” Sharma-Crawford said. That robs students of due process, she said.
But, she said, the universities communicated with the students immediately and connected them with legal resources. She said the most important resources universities can provide are for mental health.
“It is critical that they not only have the legal backing but they have the stamina mentally,” Sharma-Crawford said.
Kansas Reflector reached out to every state university — the University of Kansas, Kansas State University, Pittsburg State University, Emporia State University, Wichita State University and Fort Hays State University — as well as Washburn University, and asked how many international students had their status terminated and what support was provided. Most of the universities did not respond, but Fort Hays and Pittsburg State said they’re monitoring the issue and are connecting students with resources.
Sharma-Crawford said she wasn’t surprised that most of the universities didn’t respond. She said the Trump administration uses fear and intimidation as a tactic to scare universities and international students.
“It’s hindering them from wanting to be here or come here,” Sharma-Crawford said. “I think, in some ways, that’s the plan. Because if you can economically harm the universities, then the universities will bend to your will.”
Sharma-Crawford said one of the cruelest parts of this is the timing. The students were notified of termination roughly one month before finals. She said the stress of it caused some students to immediately leave the country without seeking legal help. Sharma-Crawford encouraged any affected student to seek individualized legal help.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Rekha-Sharma-Crawford-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-05-12 10:12:18.157936

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Just 140 miles south of the Arctic Circle, far from any major industrial or population centers, Alaska’s second-largest city has struggled for decades with some of the nation’s worst winter air pollution.
Now years of work to clear particulate pollution from the air in the Fairbanks North Star Borough, the approximately 7,500-square mile district encompassing the city of Fairbanks and its outskirts, is paying off.
At issue are the pollutants known as Particulate Matter 2.5, minute particles no bigger than 2.5 micrometers in diameter. Less than 5% the width of a typical human hair, they are health hazards. They can become embedded in the lungs and even pass through respiratory membranes to get into the bloodstream and body organs.
Since 2015, levels of those fine particulates – the majority of which has come from wood-burning stoves – have been roughly cut in half during the worst winter air-quality days.
“We have made tremendous strides in reducing PM 2.5 in the area, and I think that’s something that needs to be acknowledged,” said Steven Hoke, the borough’s air quality manager.

	Fairbanks North Star Borough Mayor Grier Hopkins remembers past decades, when clunker vehicles filled the streets and poured smoky pollution into the air. That problem has largely been addressed by improved automobile technology and the diligent use of plug-in block heaters that improve engines’ efficiency in cold weather. He also remembers old boilers that belched smoke, causing some to drift from the outdoor air into school hallways and classrooms. Those boilers have disappeared, and the difference is dramatic, he said.
“While we can have the reputation of some of the worst air in the nation, it doesn’t feel like that when you’re here,” Hopkins said. “I would argue it feels a lot cleaner here when I’m walking around than if I’m in Los Angeles on a smoggy day or something like that.”
An important milestone came in the last days of the Biden administration, when the Environmental Protection Agency gave its blessing to the state’s air plan for the Fairbanks North Star Borough. The tentative approval of what is known as the State Implementation Plan, or SIP, means that the borough will likely not face any additional air-quality related restrictions on construction or development at least until 2027.
 

  Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation data shows how particulate pollution in downtown Fairbanks has been reduced over time. Prior to 2006, the threshold for daily air-quality violations was 65 micrograms per cubic meter. The standard was tightened in 2006 to 35 micrograms per cubic meter. (Graph provided by Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation)

	There are still improvements to be made.
The borough continues to have occasional daily violations of air-quality standards in the winter. And there are continued state Department of Environmental Conservation advisories about health risks from particulate pollution, especially in the outlying community of North Pole, home to about 2,400 people, where inversions tend to be more intense. Over the winter of 2024-25, there were 32 such advisories issued for the borough.
Because federal standards on acceptable levels of fine particulates are tightened periodically, more progress is expected to be needed to meet future Clean Air Act requirements.
Extreme, but not unique
For Fairbanks, the air-quality challenge is stubborn, resulting from a mix of geography, climate and economics.
Like other cold-climate cities surrounded by mountainous regions, the Fairbanks area gets enveloped periodically in seasonal inversions, with stagnant cold air filled with ground-level emissions becoming trapped beneath warmer air.
“The cold air gets stuck in the valley and the warm air that’s the wind and it’s coming in from somewhere else just rides right over it,” said Bill Simpson, a UAF chemistry and biochemistry professor who studies Arctic air pollution.
 

  Air quality measurements taken Jan. 31, 2025, in the Fairbanks North Star Borough reveal more problems in North Pole than in the rest of the borough. Temperatures that day at the Fairbanks International Airport ranged from minus 30 degrees Fahrenheit to minus 10 degrees Fahrenheit. (Graph provided by Fairbanks North Star Borough)

Inversions are common elsewhere, in places like Denver, Salt Lake City, Calgary and Anchorage. Those cities, like Fairbanks, have contended with trapped particulate pollution during inversions.
But Fairbanks’ inversions are more severe, more concentrated and longer lasting.
At this high latitude, there is little winter sunlight to overturn and weaken inversion layers, as happens in Rocky Mountain places like Salt Lake City and Denver. This far inland, there is no ocean breeze to disrupt the inversions, as happens in Anchorage or in Scandinavian cities.
The lack of winter sunlight and lack of ground-level heat and wind compresses the Fairbanks inversion layer to only 230 feet or so, Simpson said. Layers in Lower 48 sites are typically at least twice that high, Simpson said, making their particulate pollution more dispersed.
Once an inversion sets it, violations of the Clean Air Act’s 24-hour standard for fine particulates often follow, Simpson said.
“When there’s a really bad day, it’s just really hard to avoid because the boundary layer is so shallow,” he said.
Fairbanks inversions can persist for days, creating temperature differences between high and low elevations that are much as 30 degrees Fahrenheit. Levels of fine particulates within those inversion pockets, though much lower than they used to be, are typically close to twice the regulatory limit of 35 micrograms per cubic meter, according to the EPA.
Inversions are a fact of life for residents, like the West Valley High School ski team members who congregate for practices and competitions at Birch Hill, the cross-country venue on a ridge rising more than 1,000 feet above the city.
“If it’s cold, you don’t go on White Bear. It can be like a 20-degree difference sometimes” said team member Maya Griek, referring to a long trail that loops down to the ridge’s lowest elevations.
Burning wood for heat
While there are multiple contributors, from big coal-fired power plants to small local coffee roasters, the primary reason for Fairbanks’ winter air pollution is relatively simple. It comes down to what people burn to stay warm and how they burn it.

	That also makes it hard to control.
Fairbanks temperatures can dip below minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit, and residents rely heavily on woodburning stoves as either main sources of heat or supplemental sources and where natural gas options are limited. That is a contrast to cities like Anchorage and Calgary, where most indoor heat comes from natural gas, or Scandinavian cities, where heat pumps and geothermal energy are widely used.
On the coldest days, severe inversions and pollution problems are most likely — and the desire to burn wood is the highest. But those are the days when burning is banned.
Burn bans have been unpopular. In 2018, voters passed an ordinance stripping the borough of enforcement powers on air-quality matters. Enforcement of bans and other matters, as a result, is up to the state.
That means the borough’s job, as Hopkins and Hoke describe it, is to monitor, provide opportunities for cleaner air and encourage residents to do the right thing.
“You can’t convince somebody to do something they don’t want to do,” Hoke said. “The best way to get them to do that is get them to see the benefits and then to convince themselves.”

	Since wood burning remains the top source of particulate pollution, much of that encouragement has focused on better wood stoves.
Since 2010, the borough, state and EPA have collaborated on a stove-trading program that enables people to replace inefficient stoves with modern versions. From 2010 to 2024, 4,783 old wood-burning stoves were swapped out for upgraded heating devices, according to the borough’s records.
Officials are also pushing residents to burn better wood. Kiln-dried wood, which burns more efficiently and produces less particulate pollution, is an important element of the newly approved plan.
Such wood has been offered since 2020 by a company called Aurora Energy Solutions. It has two kilns to process mostly birch, though some spruce is in the mix as well.
Birch, a hardwood, is the main firewood source in Interior Alaska. Though ubiquitous in the region and readily available through timber sales held on state land, it contains large amounts of water that can make burning slow and smoky.
The moisture content in delivered birch logs can be as high as 50%, in the form of liquid water in summer and ice in winter, said Susan Shopper, the general manager.

	The kilns, which are heated to 230 degrees, convert most of that moisture into steam that is released into the air. The resulting product has a moisture content that is no higher than 20%. The company aims for even lower levels that are in the teens, Shopper said.
There is high demand in winter for the dried wood, which costs money up front but saves it in the long run, she said.
But when it comes to meeting that demand, there is a seasonal mismatch.
The best season for drying wood is summer, when the coal-fired electricity plant across the street has the most excess steam power to sell to the kiln operation. It generally takes 4 ½ days to complete a wood-drying cycle in the winter; in summer, that time is cut to two days, Shopper said.
The worst time to dry wood, or to buy dried wood, is the dead of winter, when people want it the most.
During the hot, around-the-clock summer daylight, it can be a challenge to get customers to think about stocking up on wood for the cold, dark winter to come, Shopper said.

	“Processing and drying in the summer is very advantageous for us economically. But that’s not what people tend to want to buy firewood, so it’s kind of hard,” she said.
Lessons from science
While the characteristics of Fairbanks’ air-quality situation make it tough to address, they also fascinate scientists.
In 2022, nearly 50 scientists from North America and Europe gathered at UAF for a project to examine details of the borough’s air quality. The Alaskan Layered Pollution and Chemical Analysis project, or ALPACA, was not focused on regulation, but the information has proved useful to agencies and to people trying to address air-quality problems in other far-north and mountainous regions that also face inversion challenges.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)
 

	For seven weeks, the group made detailed measurements of air quality and weather conditions at varying atmospheric layers. They also examined indoor air quality and the interplay between indoor combustion and outdoor particulates.
Their studies have explored not only what goes into the air but how different pollutants react with each other once emitted, said Simpson, the project’s leader.
While woodsmoke is the underlying problem, emissions from other sources like power plants and heavy diesel-burning vehicles compound it, as different pollutants’ molecules bond with the woodsmoke molecules.

	One important finding is that sulfur, a byproduct of diesel, oil and coal combustion, is a significant problem. Through that chemical bonding process, sulfur is responsible for about 20% of the particulate mass, Simpson said.
Information about sulfur’s proven contribution helped lead the EPA to propose a mandate for ultra-low-sulfur fuel for those businesses and residents that burn diesel.
But state and borough officials convinced federal regulators that such a requirement would be counterproductive because the high cost of ultra-low-sulfur fuel in such an isolated market would drive some Fairbanks residents to burn more wood, even if they did so on the sly during ban periods.
A compromise that went into effect in September 2022 is a state regulation requiring low-sulfur in the Fairbanks area, but not ultra-low-sulfur fuel. While regular fuel has sulfur levels of about 2,000 parts per million, lower-sulfur fuel has half that. Ultra-low-sulfur fuel, in contrast, has no more than 15 parts of sulfur per million.

	Simpson said that the compromise has been effective in reducing the sulfur dioxide.
“What we’ve seen is that the SO2 in the atmosphere is cut in half. It’s really, really worked to clean up the amount of sulfur in the atmosphere,” he said.
Wood heating expected to endure
Could Fairbanks ever be entirely free of winter woodsmoke? It seems unlikely in the near future
The particulate-free source of energy used for heat elsewhere in Alaska – natural gas — has limited application in Fairbanks. The borough-owned Interior Gas Utility provides liquefied natural gas that is delivered by truck to about 3,000 customers. The utility touts the air-quality attributes of natural gas with a simple slogan on its website: “Breathe Easy.”
However, Fairbanks lacks the grid connections and economies of scale that make natural gas the dominant energy source in Anchorage and other parts of Southcentral Alaska.
To Hopkins, a wholesale switch to natural gas may be desirable from an air-pollution standpoint, but it is not realistic.

	“The problem is even if you get a gas line coming through Fairbanks, you’re never going to get infrastructure to a place that’s the size of Connecticut when you only have 100,000 people in the area. It’s too dispersed,” he said.
The challenging atmospheric inversions will remain, he notes. So will the winter cold, which means the appeal of wood and woodburning will endure among many residents.
Continued access to better stoves and better wood is a practical way to benefit both air quality and residents’ pocketbooks, he said.
“People see that it works. People see the financial savings to themselves,” he said.’

Though President Donald Trump has yet to explicitly order the Shasta Dam to be enlarged — something Republican lawmakers have been considering for decades — recent actions by his administration signal that he is moving in that direction. 
As CalMatters’ Alastair Bland explains, the prospect of raising the dam underscores the ongoing dispute between farmers, environmentalists and other key stakeholders over California’s water supply and its effect on the state’s fragile ecosystems. 
Increasing the Shasta Dam, such as raising the dam height by 18 feet, would deliver more water from the Sacramento River to Central Valley farmers.
So far Trump has signed executive orders instructing federal agencies to waive environmental rules with the aim to deliver more water to California growers. Earlier this month a congressional committee’s budget reconciliation bill also earmarked $2 billion “for construction and associated activities” that raise the capacity of the federal Bureau of Reclamation’s water storage facilities.One proponent of the dam expansion is the Westlands Water District, which provides water to San Joaquin Valley farmers who grow nuts, fruits, grains and vegetables. Increasing the reservoir’s volume would be good for the ecosystem, according to the district, because it would help threatened Chinook salmon spawn by keeping the water colder.
Barry Nelson, a policy advisor with the conservation group Golden State Salmon Association, disagrees. 

Nelson: “The idea that a Shasta raise would benefit salmon — particularly under this set of federal agencies — is absurd.”

Some state officials have also opposed expanding the dam in the past. In 2013 the California Department of Fish and Wildlife said raising the dam would have “significant and unavoidable impacts” on the Sacramento River ecosystem.
Members of the Winnemem Wintu tribe, who hold the Sacramento River as sacred, argue that a dam expansion would claim their last remaining territory, and could violate the state’s Wild and Scenic Rivers Act.

CA pushes back on Trump on in-state tuition

From CalMatters higher education reporter Mikhail Zinshteyn:
California says its policy of granting in-state tuition to immigrant students without legal status in the U.S. “complies with federal law,” seeking to repudiate a recent Trump executive order that directed his administration to find ways to bar states from allowing the practice.The California Student Aid Commission, which oversees state financial aid, issued a memo last week that said its policies are legal and notes that 25 states provide in-state tuition to immigrant students without legal status; some of these are so-called red states, such as Texas and Utah. The memo also cites past state and federal court rulings upholding in-state tuition policies.
California began granting in-state residency for immigrant students without legal status after a 2001 state law. An estimated 60,000 college students in California benefit from the law, which applies only to public institutions. The state is home to nearly 3 million public college and university students overall.
Trump’s order questioned why immigrant students without legal status can attend a public college with in-state tuition but out-of-state students cannot. His order relied on an interpretation of a 1996 immigration law.
A federal appeals court in 2023 dismissed a similar challenge echoed by Trump, writing that the 1996 law “has nothing to say about a rule like” in-state tuition for students without legal status. 



Get ready for the May Revise

Gov. Gavin Newsom is expected to unveil an update to his January state budget proposal later this week, dubbed the May Revise, laying out more detail on funding for colleges, prisons, environmental programs, health care and so much more. 
The governor’s preliminary $332 billion budget plan in January had a “modest” surplus of $363 million initially estimated for 2025-26. But Newsom cautioned even then that California’s financial outlook was muddied by Trump’s anticipated economic policies and the colossal damage from the Los Angeles-area fires. 
Now the state could be facing at least a $10 billion budget shortfall, reported Politico, in part due to a Medi-Cal budget gap and stock market declines in response to Trump’s tariff policies.
In an updated forecast of Californias tax revenue by the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office, revenues for 2025-26 are expected to be $7.8 billion less than projected in January. A combination of California’s “stagnant economy,” the stock market’s instability and “recent federal policy actions,” led the office to conclude that “the path to future growth could be narrow.”

Jason Sisney, budget advisor for the California Assembly, on future deficits: “State officials will find it difficult to avoid cuts to projected growth in health and social services programs, as well as higher education, housing, and natural resources programs, to begin lowering future projected deficits.”

Enlarging the dam would deliver more Sacramento River water to Central Valley farmers but a tribe could lose sacred sites and endangered salmon could lose habitat in wet years.





Near the southern flank of Mount Shasta, springs and snowmelt converge to form the McCloud River. This Sacramento River tributary, held sacred by the Winnemem Wintu tribe, teemed with Chinook salmon before Shasta Dam, built in the 1940s, blocked their annual migrations. 
“The winter run was the main sustenance source for the Winnemem Wintu throughout history,” said tribal member Gary Mulcahy. “We consider them the grandfather of all salmon.”     
For several years, Winnemem Wintu leaders have collaborated with state and federal officials to reintroduce the critically endangered fish to this wilderness waterway in a historic effort to revitalize the McCloud and reconnect with their past.
But a federal proposal to increase the height of Shasta Dam by more than 18 feet to provide more water to farmers now threatens the tribe’s land and could harm salmon runs.
Contemplated for decades and gaining traction among Republican lawmakers, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation’s proposed Shasta Dam and Reservoir Enlargement Project would boost the capacity of California’s largest reservoir.
Since President Donald Trump took office for his second term, the federal government has not mounted any public effort to raise the dam. But Trump has taken several steps in that direction, including signing executive orders instructing federal officials to waive environmental rules and deliver more water to California growers.
Last week, the dam project appeared to get a push in the House Natural Resources Committee’s budget reconciliation bill, with a designation of $2 billion “for construction and associated activities that increase the capacity of existing Bureau of Reclamation surface water storage facilities.” Though the budget language does not name Shasta Dam, experts say it’s precisely crafted to facilitate the project. 
“There’s no mystery here,” said Barry Nelson, policy advisor with the Golden State Salmon Association. “That language is designed to push the Shasta raise.” 
Raising the dam was the “number-one priority” water project for the first Trump administration, Nelson said. 
However, U.S. Rep. Doug LaMalfa, a Republican whose district includes Shasta and who helped draft the budget language, told CalMatters that while he endorses enlarging Shasta Dam, the reconciliation bill’s “funding is not for any specific project.” 
Last year, a bill that would have allocated funds for enlarging the dam while prohibiting state laws from obstructing the project died in the House. It was sponsored by 12 California Republicans, including LaMalfa.
The Bureau of Reclamation estimated in 2014 that enlarging Shasta Dam would cost $1.4 billion — roughly $1.8 billion in today’s dollars. Obtaining the array of state and federal permits for the dam could take years, and is likely to face court challenges.
The project would provide an additional 51,300 acre-feet of water per year to recipients — mainly farmers — of the Central Valley Project and the State Water Project, according to a federal estimate. That would increase the amount they receive on average by less than 1% , which Ron Stork, a policy expert with the group Friends of the River, referred to as “decimal dust.”

The dam project would claim some of the Winnemem Wintu’s last remaining territory and could violate the state’s Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, which explicitly prohibits constructing reservoirs on the McCloud’s final miles before entering Lake Shasta. 
State officials have publicly opposed the project in the past. In 2013, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife said raising the dam would have “significant and unavoidable impacts” on the Sacramento River ecosystem. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has similarly warned federal officials that the project would restrict high-water flows and reduce fish habitat.
State officials declined to comment for this story.  Bureau of Reclamation spokesperson Peter Soeth also declined to comment. 
Stork, a longtime opponent of the dam raise, said the Trump administration is liable to ignore the state law. Trump’s January executive order directed federal officials to deliver more water through the Central Valley Project “by increasing storage and conveyance … notwithstanding any contrary State or local laws.”
“We certainly expect some serious mischief here,” Stork said. “The president’s executive order more or less says, ‘Please find ways to accomplish my agenda by trying to get around state and federal law.’” 
Mulcahy, the Winnemem Wintu’s government liaison, said Lake Shasta flooded 90% of his tribe’s historical territory. “Village sites, sacred sites, cultural gathering sites,” he said. 
Increasing the dam’s height will do even more damage, he said, periodically inundating many important gathering places, including the Kabyai Creek burial ground, where dozens of tribal members were laid to rest after a vicious 1854 massacre by white settlers.
It would also flood a cleansing pool for Winnemem men, a riverside dancing mesa and a young women’s coming-of-age ceremony site called Puberty Rock. This, Mulcahy said, will fray some of the last remaining cultural threads holding together the tribe, which he said consists of about 140 members. 
“We wouldn’t be able to hold the ceremonies that are necessary to fulfill our spiritual and cultural needs,” he said. 
The Winnemem Wintu are not included on the official list of federally recognized tribes, which could limit their influence over the project.  
Polarizing farmers and environmentalists
Like many Delta and Central Valley water supply projects, the Shasta Dam raise has polarized farmers and environmentalists in a dispute over how it would affect Chinook salmon.
Environmentalists and fishery advocates say it will imperil already declining salmon populations, while project proponents, including the Westlands Water District, say it will help the ecosystem.
Westlands provides water, imported mostly from the Delta, to San Joaquin Valley farmers who grow 150,000 acres of pistachios and almonds — their main crops — as well as other fruits, grains and vegetables.

But General Manager Allison Febbo said the Shasta project isn’t directly about water supply. Rather, she said, it’s meant to help fish. Febbo explained that increasing the reservoir’s volume will keep its water colder, which is essential for spawning.
If the plight of the fish improves, Febbo said, regulations on water diversions might be eased — which would amount to an indirect benefit to water users like Westlands.
“We keep getting ratcheted down as the species continues to decline, so our water supply isn’t going to get any better until the species gets better,” Febbo said. 
LaMalfa also stressed that the project would be “a win-win” by increasing water storage and better insulating the reservoir’s cold-water pool.
“More water for people and more cold water for salmon,” the congressman said.

But Nelson, at the Golden State Salmon Association, said Shasta Dam has already “been absolutely catastrophic for salmon.”
“The idea that a Shasta raise would benefit salmon — particularly under this set of federal agencies — is absurd,” he said.
Completed in 1945, the dam blocked Chinook from reaching hundreds of miles of stream habitat. For the winter-run Chinook — whose unique life cycle involves residing and spawning in freshwater through summer — the ice-cold McCloud was their stronghold. 
“It can be 110 degrees in the canyon there, and you can be standing in the river in waders and your legs are so cold it hurts,” said Rene Henery, California science director with the group Trout Unlimited, as he explained the importance of the McCloud to the future survival of winter-run Chinook. 
“The idea that a Shasta raise would benefit salmon — particularly under this set of federal agencies — is absurd.”BARRY NELSON, GOLDEN STATE SALMON ASSN.
Today, the fish — which enter freshwater in the winter — cling to existence in a short stretch of river downstream of Lake Shasta, surviving thanks to the release of cold water stored deep in the reservoir. However, this resource frequently runs out in the summer as the fish lay and fertilize their eggs, which can lead to complete spawning failures in lethally warm water.
While a more voluminous reservoir could theoretically keep its water colder for longer, Henery said the changing climate is likely to complicate this equation. Filling the enlarged reservoir in a hotter, drier future is the main problem. 
“Dams don’t make water, so in a low-water year, raising the dam does nothing,” he said. 
In wet years, he added, the enlarged dam will harm fish by capturing water that would otherwise flood vital wetland habitat downstream, like the recently restored Yolo Bypass, west of Sacramento. “The inundation we get on the Yolo Bypass is what’s keeping salmon populations hanging on in the Sacramento,” Henery said. 
Jon Rosenfield, science director at the advocacy group San Francisco Baykeeper, added that “expanding the dam will capture more of the high flows (during wet years) that are now the only lifeline those fish have.”
Mulcahy said he is hopeful that the project — though currently revving with Republican horsepower — will soon run out of steam. Labor and material costs are rising, he said, and the longer the project goes unbuilt, the more expensive it gets. 
“They’re going to try and negate state law so that they can proceed however they want,” Mulcahy said. “But if we can last this one out, I think it may bury itself once and for all.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/050924_Shasta-Dam_DWR_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-12 09:05:03.915300

Ramírez,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/05/real-id-excludes-real-americans/,"A declined Real ID application effectively rendered a California man ""undocumented"" because the names on his passport didn't match his driver's license, a paradoxical byproduct of American assimilation.","Guest Commentary written by

Catherine S. Ramírez
Catherine S. Ramírez is a professor of Latin American and Latino studies at UC Santa Cruz, and the author of “Assimilation: An Alternative History.”


At 98, my father’s paper trail was long — in addition to his U.S. birth certificate, there were his discharge papers from his service in the Army Air Corps during World War II, his house deed, his children’s birth certificates, his Social Security, Medicare and business cards. 
Yet in 2023, when he applied for a Real ID identification card, a security-enhanced, federally accepted form of identification that airports require as of this month, his application was declined because the names on his passport (Vicente) and driver’s license (Vince) didn’t match. Instead, he was issued a California Senior Citizen Identification Card — which wouldn’t let him board a flight, enter a secured federal building or register to vote.  
My father’s succession of names testifies to the ways American culture coerces and seduces both natives and newcomers to comply with its norms, promising social and political inclusion and upward social mobility. But paradoxically, that same evolution, which pushed him from Vicente to Vince, from “Mexican” to American, rendered him effectively “undocumented” with his declined Real ID application.
Born in Nogales, Arizona, to Mexican immigrants in 1924, my father’s first language, like his original first name, was Spanish, a vestige of the viceroyalty of New Spain and the Republic of Mexico in southern Arizona. I suspect his American teachers changed his name to Vincent when he was a boy. By the time he was a teenager in East L.A. in the early 1940s, Vincent had morphed into Vince. 
“To Vince, a real swell dancer,” his girlfriend, Bea Shapiro, inscribed in his Garfield High School yearbook.  
That my father managed to achieve all that he did in life with little more than his Garfield High diploma evinced not only his fierce work ethic, but also the viability of the American dream in the 20th century. My father began life on the physical and symbolic margin of the nation in a small house that lacked indoor plumbing and ended his career as a senior transportation engineer at CalTrans. 
But his declined Real ID application effectively erased that biography, exposing a failure of assimilation, and laying bare Americans’ vulnerability to disenfranchisement, regardless of their distance from the immigration experience or their status as U.S. citizens. 
The Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act, or SAVE Act, has brought that vulnerability into relief. Last month, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the legislation requiring Americans to provide documentary proof of citizenship, such as a passport or birth certificate, to register to vote. The bill’s supporters, nearly all Republicans, maintain that it will help “restore public confidence in elections.” Even though citizenship is already a requirement to vote in federal elections and cases of noncitizens voting are statistically rare, President Trump has made the baseless claim that Democrats have recruited noncitizens to vote against him. 
The “illegal alien” voter is a phantasm, but voter suppression is real — and the SAVE Act threatens to further disenfranchise voters. More than 140 million U.S. citizens don’t have a passport, and more than 21 million don’t have a passport or birth certificate that’s “readily available.” Not unlike my dad, some 69 million women who’ve taken their spouse’s name don’t have a birth certificate matching their legal name. Only 18% of respondents to the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey had successfully changed the name on their birth certificate so that it aligned with their other documents. And because the SAVE Act mandates that prospective voters present documentary proof of U.S. citizenship at their local election office, isolated rural voters and anyone who doesn’t or can’t drive — young adults, older people, voters with certain disabilities — risk disenfranchisement. 
My father died before Real ID went into effect, so he never had to suffer the injustice of being turned away at a polling station or an airport, or, worse, of being deported because he lacked the right document. Still, his inability to get a Real ID is a warning of the limits, federal and otherwise, that millions of real Americans may now face.

Prior to moving to Randolph, John and his wife Mary lived on Tyler Street in Brattleboro for 56 years.John was born in Manhattan, Kansas, on January 22, 1929, the middle son of Paul Adelbert and Gladys Kelly Paul Carnahan. He attended Harvard University (Class of 1950) and Harvard Law School (Class of 1954) while serving in the Navy.Carnahan married Mary Elizabeth Faigle in August 1955. They moved to Brattleboro where John began working for the law firm Fitts & Olson. Less than two years later he became the Administrative Assistant to U.S. Congressman William H. Meyer, the first Democrat ever elected to the U.S. Congress from Vermont. Carnahan moved to Rutland, Vermont, and served as the Assistant U.S. Attorney for Vermont from 1961-1965. In 1965 he returned to Brattleboro as an associate with the law firm of Kristensen, Cummings and Price. Two years later he was appointed Windham County District Judge by Gov. Philip H. Hoff. In 1973 he rejoined Fitts & Olson as a partner; the firm was renamed Fitts, Olson, Carnahan, Anderson & Bump and later was known as Fitts, Olson, Carnahan & Giddings. He worked there until 1995, when he became a sole practitioner, retiring in 2004.Carnahan was especially active in the Democratic party. He was Democratic National Committeeman for Vermont, 1979-1988; Democratic State Chairperson, 1977; and the party’s unsuccessful candidate for Lieutenant Governor in 1984. He was involved in many campaigns over the years and hosted countless Democratic candidates who visited Brattleboro, introducing them to everyone he knew.A longtime and active member of St. Michael’s Episcopal Church, Carnahan was known for his quiet kindness. He generously gave his time to many organizations. He served on more than a dozen social service agency boards during his lifetime, including trustee of the Brattleboro Retreat from 1970-1994.Carnahan was also active in historical and cultural organizations. He was a trustee of the Brattleboro Museum and Art Center in the 1980s. He began serving as a trustee of the Vermont Historical Society in 1982 and served as its president (1993-1995). He was a founding member of both the Brattleboro Historical Society (1982) and the Estey Organ Museum (2002). He served on the Advisory Council for the Vermont Division for Historic Preservation and was a trustee of the Preservation Trust of Vermont. He helped establish the Friends of the Vermont State House. Carnahan was interested in the architecture and history of U.S. state capitol buildings and donated his extensive collection of state capitol postcards to the Curator of State Buildings in 2021.John was an avid newspaper reader. In their later years John and Mary could be seen walking daily to get multiple newspapers at Baker’s or Putney Road Market. They also enjoyed partaking of the musical offerings of various organizations that are in the Brattleboro area including the Brattleboro Music Center and the Friends of Music at Guilford.John had a lifelong desire to improve Brattleboro’s physical appearance. His children remember him walking home from work carrying trash he had picked up along the way! He was instrumental in the restoration and redesign of the Brattleboro Common bandstand in 1976 to open the front so that performers and speakers could be closer to their audiences. In the 1980s, he led the charge to move Brattleboro’s historic Wells Fountain 25 feet away from traffic and into a welcoming park where a gas station once stood in the heart of Brattleboro.John took great joy in his family, especially at multi-generational celebrations at the house on Tyler Street. He was predeceased by his brothers and his beloved daughter Sarah Kelly Carnahan in 2014. He is survived by Mary, his wife of 70 years, his son Paul (Eve) of Montpelier, his daughter Susan (William) Vodrey of Cleveland, Ohio, his son-in-law Alfredo Quintero of New York City, eight grandchildren, as well as nieces and nephews.

None of the sweeping changes in H.454, the associated risks, nor the hassles to school districts are necessary.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Former Vermont lawmakers: An open letter to the Vermont General Assembly.","This commentary is by a group of former Vermont lawmakers. Their names are listed below the text of the commentary.More than 50 years ago, Vermont recognized the hardship faced by homeowners whose property taxes were rising faster than their ability to pay them. Since then, state fiscal policy has moved, in fits and starts, toward a system where school taxes are based on Vermonters’ income, the best measure of their ability to pay. We, former Vermont legislators, urge you not to abandon a half-century of progress. Instead, we hope you will fulfill the promise of Act 60, which we helped pass in 1997, and ask Vermont homeowners with the most income to contribute their fair share to the cost of education by paying based on income. Vermont’s education funding system is committed both to fair taxation and local decision making, and we can strengthen both of those. Instead, H.454, the education reform bill that recently passed the Vermont House of Representatives, weakens them. Income-based school taxes ease pressure on homeowners with modest earnings that don’t keep pace with rising real estate prices and property taxes. For high-earning homeowners, income is a more accurate reflection of their means than a single piece of property, so taxes based on income are critical to fair school funding for all.H.454 as passed by the Vermont House takes the state in the opposite direction. The bill would repeal the law’s current provision allowing residents to pay some or all of their school taxes based on their income, which 70% of Vermont homeowners do. Instead, H.454 recommits the state to regressive property taxes that hit low- and middle income residents the hardest.To temper the negative impacts of the property tax for those with incomes of $115,000 or less, the plan puts in place homestead exemptions, which provide relief for some but still rely on property taxes. Lawmakers have considered homestead exemptions over the last 50 years and repeatedly rejected them as too complicated and failing to achieve the fairness of income-based taxes.H.454 does nothing to address the unfair tax break in the current funding system. Many of Vermont’s wealthiest homeowners pay school taxes on their property that are less than their income-based taxes would be. H.454 allows these homeowners to continue to pay property taxes instead of asking them to pay the same share of their income to support education as average Vermonters pay.H.454 also brings back a foundation formula — state-determined and state-funded grants that can be supplemented by local school districts — which Vermont tried before the state supreme court declared it unconstitutional in 1997. The constitutional problems can be overcome, and H.454 attempts to do so. But this, too, is something the Legislature tried decades ago and found unworkable because it was overly complicated and made tax rates unpredictable from year to year.None of the sweeping changes in H.454, the associated risks, nor the hassles to school districts are necessary. The sharp increase in taxes last year was due in large part to costs outside of school districts’ control and also to legislative missteps in the previous two years.And while the governor likes to say the message from the election was that schools are spending too much, that’s not the case. School spending in Vermont as a percentage of the state’s economy has been a stable 5.5% to 6% for decades.Unfair taxes anger taxpayers and alienate them from participation in decision-making about their schools — and that hurts students, teachers and communities. H.454 does not solve these problems. Rather, in reaching for elusive “efficiencies,” with promises of better education, the bill doubles down on school consolidation, which many Vermonters have rejected; that will alienate more citizens by taking budgetary decision-making out of communities’ hands.There are immediate, affordable changes to the existing law that would make the system fairer for the Vermonters hurt last year. Instead of rushing to new and unproven — or old, proven-unworkable — financing mechanisms and an unprecedented move away from local control, the Legislature should adopt those changes.We are proud that for 30 years Vermont has had the most equitable school financing system in the country, supporting schools that produce some of the highest test scores in the country. Not incidentally, our schools hold together many of the small rural communities that make Vermont an enviable place to live. H.454 risks destroying much of this. Vermont deserves better. Former Rep.

Now, state lawmakers have given the agency a new name, a new mission, new leadership and a boost in funding to expand its role. The sweeping law enacted in March puts New Mexico at the forefront of a growing movement to rethink states’ traditional model of wildlife management.
“We came from a place of extreme dysfunction,” said Jesse Deubel, executive director of the New Mexico Wildlife Federation, an environmental nonprofit that advocated for the new law. “Now, I truly do believe that we’re going to be a gold standard for wildlife management. Over the next few years. you’re going to see an unbelievable shift.”
New Mexico’s new approach expands the agency’s focus beyond hunting and fishing to protect more species and brings in new funding to reduce its reliance on license sales. Other states are watching closely. Lawmakers across the country have introduced bills to change their wildlife agencies, and many have cited the New Mexico measure as an example of what’s possible.
“That’s the biggest game changer,” said Michelle Lute, executive director of Wildlife for All, a national nonprofit focused on overhauling states’ wildlife governance. “That’s the legislation we’ll be pointing to as a model in future years.”
From Oregon to Utah to Florida, legislators have introduced bills that would overhaul their wildlife agencies’ funding, mission and governance.
While the proposals have had varying levels of success, New Mexico leaders say it took years of coalition-building to get their bill across the finish line. Wildlife advocates expect the issue to earn more legislative attention nationwide in the years to come.
State wildlife agencies focus on ‘hook and bullet’ work. Some see a new path.

Under the traditional model, state wildlife agencies have largely been funded by the license fees paid by hunters and anglers, plus federal excise taxes on equipment such as guns and fishing tackle. The agencies have focused most of their work on species like deer and trout, prized by the sporting groups that provide their revenue.
In New Mexico, as in most states, the commissions that govern these departments have been appointed by governors. They’re often filled by hunting and fishing guides, ranchers and political donors. Critics say this model results in panels that set policy to protect their economic interests.
Today, many wildlife agencies are struggling to stay afloat as fewer and fewer residents hunt and fish. At the same time, plummeting wildlife populations are compelling agencies to expand their work beyond traditional “game” species. And some wildlife advocates are demanding a new governance model that puts more scientists in charge.
This year, state lawmakers across the country have passed or considered a host of major wildlife management overhauls. Some would expand their agencies’ mission to focus on non-game species. Others would provide new funding streams to take on that additional work. And some would change the makeup of the commissions that dictate wildlife policy.
In New Mexico, lawmakers did all three at once.
The state’s agency had faced numerous problems over the years. Hunters and bird-watchers alike were frustrated with the agency’s leadership. In recent years, several commissioners have resigned or been forced out by Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham. At times, the panel has lacked enough members to form a quorum.
The agency’s budget was in trouble as well. The state had not raised license fees in nearly 20 years, keeping revenue flat even as inflation made the cost of its work more and more expensive.
“We were having to repurpose money from on-the-ground conservation just to make salary adjustments,” said Stewart Liley, wildlife division chief with the New Mexico Department of Game & Fish. “We were getting to a precarious spot.”
In 2023, lawmakers passed a bill to restructure the agency’s commission, which would have taken some power away from the governor. Lujan Grisham declined to sign the bill, killing the effort with a pocket veto.
 










We wanted to make it clear that this is our state wildlife agency, and it's the only one we've got.


– Jesse Deubel, New Mexico Wildlife Federation executive director




This year, lawmakers took a bigger swing. The package passed this session renames the Department of Game & Fish to the Department of Wildlife. It expands the agency’s authority to protect non-game species in need of conservation help.
“We wanted to make it clear that this is our state wildlife agency, and it’s the only one we’ve got,” said Deubel, of the New Mexico Wildlife Federation. “They’ve got a responsibility to work on any species in the state that has conservation need.”
Agency leaders say they were already conducting research and conservation work for non-game species. They viewed that aspect of the bill as a largely symbolic measure that “shined a light” on the need for more restoration work, Liley said. However, the law did provide more explicit authority for the agency to manage insects and regulate the direct “take,” or killing, of certain animals.
The measure raises license fees — a provision supported by many hunting and fishing groups — and allows for inflation-based adjustments in future years. Meanwhile, lawmakers included another $10.5 million from the state budget, spread over three years, to help the agency take on more non-game conservation.
“It seemed only fair that if we were going to ask the department to take on a broader role that they not finance that just through hunting and fishing,” said Democratic state Rep. Matthew McQueen, who was among the key sponsors.
Liley, the agency official, said the new money, along with a separate conservation fund established in 2023, will more than double the state’s investment in helping threatened species. The agency expects to hire up to eight new biologists who will conduct research, determine which species need aid and lead restoration efforts.
“This will help us get a better grasp of where we are with different species across the state,” he said. “There are absolutely projects we have not undertaken because of lack of capacity. This will allow us to do more surveys, to radio-mark birds, to [use that research] and say, ‘Let’s do forest restoration this way for pinyon jays.’”
The package will also change the agency’s governance. The current commission has seven seats, all appointed by the governor. Lujan Grisham’s appointees have included a car dealer, an Exxon Mobil lobbyist and a former lawmaker who owns an oil and gas business.
Under the new model, a bipartisan legislative committee will nominate three candidates for every seat, each of whom must be vetted to demonstrate their knowledge of wildlife. The governor must choose from among those three. One of the seats will be reserved for a wildlife scientist, one for a conservationist, one for a hunter and angler and one for a rancher or farmer.
“These changes add expertise and really important perspectives to the commission,” said Chris Smith, wildlife program director with WildEarth Guardians, an environmental nonprofit. “Our [current] commission was having structural problems and light scandal almost consistently.”
Backers’ one disappointment is that Lujan Grisham used a partial veto to strike a provision that would have protected commission members from dismissal by the governor. She argued that the proposed change relied too heavily on the slow-moving court system to remove commissioners, making it difficult to hold problematic members accountable.
Political appointees set state wildlife policy. Critics say that’s a problem.

Lawmakers say they’re still intent on protecting agency leaders from the governor’s whims, but pleased the rest of the package has gone into effect. While the measure passed with bipartisan majorities, some lawmakers objected to the idea of expanding the agency’s mission to protect species beyond those that can be hunted.
“With all due respect, I don’t want to pay for a butterfly,” said Republican state Rep. Harlan Vincent, according to KUNM. “I’m just being honest with you.”
And some groups are skeptical that the extra funding from the state budget will be enough to cover the agency’s growing conservation role.
“If New Mexico wants to expand the mission of the department, New Mexico needs to pay for it,” Tom Paterson, president-elect of the New Mexico Cattle Growers’ Association, said during a Senate committee hearing. “The necessary funds should not come on the back of the license fees that hunters and anglers pay.”
While the agency’s new funding and mission are now in place, its name change to the Department of Wildlife won’t take effect until next year. And its current commission will remain in office until Jan. 1, 2027. Lujan Grisham’s successor will then appoint new commissioners under the revised model.
The advocates who backed the New Mexico overhaul say it will take time and investment to make the new model work. They know other states will be watching closely.

Lawmakers backed the bulk of Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte’s multimillion-dollar vision to bolster and expand the system, which has experienced waitlists for care and has been working in recent years to reverse the loss of community-based mental health services and regain federal certification of the state psychiatric hospital, lost in 2022 after a spate of patient deaths. Legislators then went several steps further to fill what they saw as gaps in the governor’s proposals.
They agreed to build a new mental health facility in eastern Montana, add more beds at existing state facilities, fund more crisis beds in communities, revise some civil and criminal commitment procedures, and reimburse counties when criminal defendants ordered to state facilities are held in county jails.
“For our families that struggle in these systems, it gives us so much hope,” said Matt Kuntz, executive director of the National Alliance on Mental Illness’ Montana chapter, about the legislative action.
The state’s behavioral health system faced an array of problems going into the 2025 legislative session. They included shortages in community services, particularly in rural areas, created by deep cuts made in 2017 in response to a state budget shortfall, along with a backlog of criminal defendants waiting for evaluations and services at the state-run psychiatric hospital.
The prospects of the situation improving seemed dim for a long time, Kuntz said. “Then you have the governor’s office, the legislature, the counties, the county attorneys all working together to bring tangible solutions. And they got the votes.”
That support built over time as the state spent money on improvements needed to regain the Montana State Hospital’s federal certification and counties came under increasing pressure due to a lack of services and treatment beds. The legislature and governor committed to review the system in 2023.
In all, lawmakers approved about $124 million in state spending and as much as $40 million in federal funds during the next two years for behavioral health services, a new state-owned facility, and additional beds in existing facilities.
“The people that need our support, the people that can’t take care of themselves, the families that are struggling with their family member that can’t take care of themselves at some points in time are going to benefit from what we did,” Republican state Sen. John Esp said in summing up the legislature’s work.
The spending approved by the legislature goes well beyond the money Gianforte requested for behavioral health changes. He included 10 funding requests in his proposed state budget for the next two years that totaled about $43.5 million in state funds and $42 million in federal funds. The requests were based on recommendations from the Behavioral Health System for Future Generations Commission.
Lawmakers created that commission in 2023 to review state-funded services for people with mental illness, substance use disorders, and developmental disabilities. Legislators that year set aside $300 million to be spent in future years on recommendations made by the commission.
Even before the start of the session, some legislators questioned whether the governor’s budget did enough to address the lack of both community-based crisis services and forensic beds at the Montana State Hospital, which are for people in the criminal justice system.
Two bills introduced in January — House Bill 236 and HB 237 — sought to address lengthy jail holds experienced by some people waiting for mental health evaluations or treatment before their trials can proceed. Defendants generally obtain those services at the Montana State Hospital’s forensic unit.
Both bills failed. But testimony on the measures, as well as on the governor’s budget requests, drew attention to the backlog of people waiting in jails across the state. Legislators heard of prolonged delays — some stretching more than a year — that sometimes led to cases being dismissed because of concerns that the delays had violated the defendants’ constitutional right to a speedy trial.
By April, the legislature was considering possible fixes on several fronts.
During an April 15 hearing on Senate Bill 429 to revise criminal commitment procedures, Chad Parker, a state health department attorney, described the measure as “a very robustly negotiated bill.” Nanette Gilbertson, representing the Montana County Attorneys’ Association and the Montana Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association, said it contained elements “that I know were tough pills to swallow for both the associations I work for and the department.”
The bill would allow involuntary medication of defendants in county jails under certain circumstances — an idea state officials initially opposed — and prohibit the filing of a contempt charge if someone isn’t admitted to the Montana State Hospital for treatment because a bed isn’t available, which was important to the state to include.
Gilbertson told the House Judiciary Committee the bill was just one of several that, “taken in a package, are going to create immense change in the mental health and behavioral health system in the state of Montana.”
They include bills to reimburse counties for the costs of holding people waiting for state mental health services, allow short-term mental health holds in the community, improve delivery and payment for community services, and create more beds in state facilities for people committed through both criminal and civil procedures.
Legislators also approved money for a new mental health facility, expected to be built in eastern Montana, that will include more forensic beds.
Gianforte spokesperson Kaitlin Price said Gianforte would carefully consider the bills passed in addition to his proposals.
The governor’s original budget request focused primarily on community services. Legislators approved all but one, which would have created an electronic bed registry. The approved requests will revise reimbursement rates for developmental disability services, residential youth psychiatric treatment, and crisis and outpatient behavioral health services. They also will reopen clinics for early diagnosis of developmental disabilities in children, provide workforce incentives, and seek to improve delivery of services to people with developmental disabilities who have complex needs.
Esp, who served on the behavioral health commission and sponsored several of the bills, cautioned that the success of this year’s efforts will depend on whether future legislatures and governors spend the money needed to continue the new services.
“The problem we’ve always had around here is we look at things in two-year increments and towards the next election instead of looking at what’s the best policy for the state of Montana, long term,” he said.

“The Republican State Senate, Speaker Nathaniel Ledbetter, and I supported a bill allowing public school students to take off-campus Bible study classes as an elective, but lobbyists for the  Superintendents and School Board associations, which oppose the measure, blocked its passage in House committee today,” Ainsworth, a strong supporter of the legislation, wrote in a Facebook post.
And then Ainsworth went further.

The lieutenant governor posted a photo of the State Government Committee clerk’s notebook, where the vote was tallied, in the comment section of his Facebook post. The nos included Republican members, and Rep. Chris Sells, R-Greenville, chair of the committee, asked Ainsworth to take the photo down.
“I just stood up for my members … I’m gonna try to protect my people. I mean, they voted, how they voted. It was on video, and it’s in the record. I mean, it’s not like you can’t find it,” Sells said in a phone interview Friday. “But that was like adding fuel on the fire to me.”
The comment thread with the photo, later deleted, pointed to the divisions among Republicans over the legislation and passions that it raises. Republicans on the committee said in interviews last week they had several concerns over the legislation and the way it got in front of them after an identical bill was rejected by another House committee. 
“I had heard from three of my four superintendents that they were not in favor of the bill, as is,” said Rep. Russell Bedsole, R-Alabaster, one of three Republicans to vote against the bill in committee Wednesday.
Messages seeking comment were left Friday with Ainsworth and House Speaker Nathaniel Ledbetter, R-Rainsville, who put the bill in committee. 

Rejected twice

The Legislature passed a law in 2019 that allows school boards to adopt a policy on released time religious instruction (RTRI). SB 278, sponsored by Sen. Shay Shelnutt, R-Trussville, would have mandated that districts adopt those policies.
The bill passed the Senate Education Policy Committee on April 16 with one “no” vote, and passed the Senate 25-6 on April 22. 
But shortly after the Senate bill was filed, House members rejected HB 342, sponsored by Rep. Susan DuBose, R-Hoover, an identical bill, on a 9-4 vote. Rep. Terri Collins, R-Decatur, chair of the House Education Policy Committee, said in an interview she would not take the Senate version in her committee.
“I don’t know why we’d take up a bill that didn’t have the support,” Collins said on April 30. 
Collins cited opposition from education groups as part of the reason for the defeat. Education groups have cited a host of concerns, ranging from a lack of definitions of religion in the bill to liability questions to a lack of knowledge about both certifications and curricula in RTRI programs. 
The Alabama Association of School Boards has been a consistent opponent. Executive Director Sally Smith said in March she thought the program would create an uneven playing field for students.

“We just don’t think that would be a level playing field,” Smith said in March. “We don’t have any authority under the legislation to determine the rigor or whether it merits the same level of credit.”
Bedsole said superintendents in his district saw no need for the bill. 
“They were operating perfectly fine under the 2019 legislation that permitted them to enact policies to do the same thing,” he said. “The only lobbyists I spoke with were those who were proponents for the bill.”
Bedsole said he is supportive of religion in schools, but LifeWise Academy, a nonprofit that offers  RTRI and has lobbied for the legislation, could not answer his questions. 
“One of my specific questions is when we talk about religion, what religion was, the definition of religion and who would be considered a religion for the purposes of this bill,” Bedsole said. “Nobody had an answer that I felt like gave me any comfort in knowing that if a local school board created a policy and somehow it excluded a certain religious group that they wouldn’t be subject to a lawsuit.”
According to LifeWise’s sample curriculum, the organization teaches the Christian belief that “God created all things good” to a list of virtues that the nonprofit describes as “LifeWise qualities.” Sunnie Cotton, the Alabama director, said Wednesday the organization is operating in about 600 schools nationwide and is prepared to launch over 900 programs this year.
Rep. Marcus Paramore, R-Troy, who serves on both of the committees that rejected the bill, said Wednesday the superintendents in his district are not supportive of the legislation.
“I know this was in Ed Policy, which you and I both serve on, and we know what the outcome of that committee meeting was,” Paramore said to DuBose, who handled the legislation Wednesday. “So here we are in another committee, trying to get a bill that was voted down back out, and on the floor in a different format.”
Messages seeking comment were left Friday with Parramore and Rep. Mike Kirkland, R-Scottboro, the other Republican to vote against it. 

A suddenly called meeting

Ainsworth went on a radio show Friday morning and claimed members let lobbyists dictate their vote. 
“Liberal school superintendents used taxpayer-funded lobbyists to kill a bill allowing Bible study and character education as an elective course in public schools,” Ainsworth wrote in a Facebook post Friday morning. “It’s time to take a closer look at the political efforts of activist superintendents and how they are being funded.”
Since the beginning of March, DuBose has claimed that 4,500 Alabama parents signed a petition in support of the legislation. Ryan Hollingsworth, the executive director of the State Superintendents Association and consistent opposer, openly doubted those numbers during the public hearing on the bill Wednesday.
DuBose said in a phone interview Thursday that she did not appreciate the comment, but was unable to provide the list of names on the petition. She said the petition was administered by LifeWise Academy and was only sent out to people that already knew about the program. DuBose said Shelby County had 320 interested parents, Alabaster City had 56 and Pelham City had 13. 
“I stand behind those numbers,” she said. “They do exist … I don’t like when my integrity is questioned by saying it is unknown whether that list is accurate or not, or whether it really exists.”
The bill was re-referred to Sells’ committee on Tuesday by the House Speaker’s office. Bedsole said the meeting was called with 18 hours’ notice and he did not see the bills on the agenda until later in the evening, which Sells confirmed.
Typically, all committee meetings must be scheduled at least 24 hours in advance, but according to legislative rules, after the 20th Legislative Day meetings can be called with only six hours’ notice to members. Wednesday was the 29th Legislative Day. Sells said he called the meeting when the legislation was re-referred to his committee.
Bedsole said he was not aware that the House version of the bill failed in committee. The lack of notice, he said, contributed to his vote against it. 
“So my vote that you’ve seen is reflective of a bill that was brought to me with less than 24 hours notice, with a lot of unanswered questions,” Bedsole said. “I thought it deserved a lot more time and attention than trying to pass it out of committee in the last remaining days of our session.”
Rep. Mack Butler, R-Rainbow City, made the motion to approve the legislation. He was in the education committee meeting when DuBose’s bill failed and he said he was surprised by the opposition. 
“I just thought it was a very friendly bill for Republicans, because as a whole, we’re wholeheartedly in support of liberty and religious liberty,” Butler said in a phone interview Friday. “Several people were out that day, so on another day, it might have passed, but it went through the process.”
Ten of 14 House State Government Committee members were present on Wednesday. 
Next year?

Sells and Butler said they think the legislation will pass next year. Sells voted in favor of the bill, but said he is against the process in which the bill came to his committee. 
“We didn’t have long, you know, it was kind of dumped in our laps,” he said. “We’re not going to vote against Jesus, I promise you that… It’s the process. It’s not what it was doing. It’s the process of doing it.”
Sells also backed up the members of his committee that voted against the bill. 
“They don’t work for the lieutenant governor,” he said. “They work for the people in their districts.”
Bedsole said he felt the bill was rushed and he said he is worried about the unintended consequences of it.
“Sometimes in government, we are blamed for not considering unintended consequences. And this was one of those situations where I felt like it was a bit rushed on the House Committee, and I fear there would be some unintended consequences that we weren’t prepared for,” Bedsole said.
Bedsole said he would work with the sponsors to pass the bill next year once his questions are answered.
“I think it was in our best interest to get back to the table next year,” he said. “I’d be happy to be part of the conversation and address and hopefully get some answers to the questions I have.”

(Photo: Richard Bednarski/Nevada Current)Lawmakers appear open to advancing a proposal that would greenlight $1.8 billion in tax breaks to the film industry over 15 years because the proposal would give nothing away in the upcoming two years.
Assembly Bill 238 would massively expand Nevada’s film tax credit program to support the build out and operation of a 31-acre film hub currently referred to as the Summerlin Production Studios Project after the Las Vegas neighborhood where it would be located. Sony Pictures, Warner Bros Entertainment, and Howard Hughes Holdings are attached to the project.
Largest public subsidy in state history makes legislative debut

 
The bill, which received a policy hearing in early February, was heard by the Assembly’s finance committee on Friday.
AB 238 would set aside $120 million in film tax credits annually for 15 years — $95 million for productions at the Summerlin studio and $25 million for productions not tied to the studio. That’s a twelvefold increase over the state’s current film tax credit program, which is capped at $10 million annually.
But the increase wouldn’t kick in until July 2028. That means the Legislature does not have to consider the $95 million in tax credits as part of the biennium budget it is currently working on  Lawmakers would only have to consider a relatively small $206,000 fiscal note submitted by the Governor’s Office of Economic Development, whose Nevada Film Office wants additional staff to administer the program.
“This has no impact on the current budget,” emphasized Assemblymember Sandra Jauregui, who is sponsoring the bill with Assemblymember Danielle Monroe-Moreno.
But at least one lawmaker raised the possibility that economic uncertainties may linger beyond the upcoming biennium cycle.
“Let’s say that we get yet another Economic Forum with a similar outlook that we had last week,” said Assemblymember Natha Anderson, referring to a $151 million reduction in Nevada’s expected revenue forecast amid sharp economic volatility driven by Trump administration economic policies. “Is this date set in stone? Or will there be discussion about possibly pushing it back again?”
Jauregui responded that an amendment is currently being drafted proposing “additional guardrails.” She did not elaborate, saying the language is still being finalized.
Legislative staff noted that $110 million, the amount the $10 million program would expand by, represents about 1.8% of the state general fund after tax credits.
As lawmakers mull massive expansion of program, WWE offers glimpse of how film tax credits work

Lawmakers in the hearing discussed WrestleMania 41 and related events, which last month was approved to receive $4.2 million in transferable film tax credits. As the Nevada Current reported last month, Wrestlemania’s application illuminates how the program currently operates.
Assemblymember Shea Backus asked legislative staff what the WWE would have received under the provisions of AB 238. The bill, in addition to raising the annual cap, also changes the calculations used to determine the amount of transferable film tax credits each production can receive.
Chief Principal Deputy Fiscal Analyst Michael Nakamoto calculated that Wrestlemania would have qualified for $8.3 million in transferable film tax credits, nearly double what it received under the program as it exists today.
Backus noted that $8.3 million exceeds the amount WWE estimated it would spend on local labor and businesses. On its end, WWE estimates that its Wrestlemania events generate $200 million in economic activity for the host city.
Jauregui pushed back on the narrative of the bill as a giveaway, saying it requires investment of private dollars into the state and is a job creation bill.
“The legislation will generate $3 billion in annual economic activity,” she claimed. “That is Wrestlemania 15 times a year.”
Added Monroe-Moreno, “We have a responsibility to find ways to diversify our revenue streams in the state of Nevada. As the fiscal leader of this committee, I would have never put my name on a bill if I didn’t believe it provided a pathway for us to do that.”
AB 238 is one of two film tax credit expansion bills introduced this legislative session. The other is Senate Bill 220, sponsored by Democratic state Sen. Roberta Lange.
SB 220 received a policy hearing last month and was referred to the Senate Finance Committee where it has not been scheduled for a hearing. Lange could not be reached for comment on the status of her bill.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/SandraJauregui-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-05-12 08:08:49.344448

SPRINGFIELD — Amid the annual bustle at the Illinois Capitol during the legislative session’s midpoint, a sea of color and singing filled the rotunda on a sunny March day.

Attendees of the 2025 Native American Summit, organized by the Chicago American Indian Community Collaborative, were draped in regalia and leading a drum ceremony for the first time in an Illinois that was home to a federally recognized tribe.

And it was happening amid a backdrop of Native American groups working to secure passage of a bill that would ban what they say is offensive imagery in Illinois school mascots.



[jnews_element_embedplaylist scheme=""dark"" playlist=""https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNFV90vte2nwzxesrQ51ErZ64TaedQf0W&feature=shared"" playlist_limit=""4""]



“Our identity has been frozen in time, and it’s going to stay frozen in time as long as we’re portrayed as mascots and things of the past,” said Matt Beaudet, a citizen of the Montauk Tribe of Indians who was in Springfield to advocate for the bill’s passage.

Andrew Johnson, a citizen of the Cherokee Nation and executive director of the Native American Chamber of Commerce of Illinois, explained the importance of attire.

“We will refer to the clothes that we wear – the traditional clothes that we wear – as regalia. It is something that is honored. It has been passed down,” Johnson said. “There are reasons for wearing the particular items that are there. So, we have that term, ‘regalia.’ It's built and has the bedrock of respect and honor.”

How natives are often portrayed as mascots in school logos throughout the state, however, has a more detrimental effect of “costuming,” he said.

“It really is not a sense of honor there,” he said. “It is not a sense of history. In fact, it's a perversion of history to think that these mascots are maintaining any kind of that memory of Native people.”

Johnson and Beaudet are part of a working group convened by state Rep. Maurice West, D-Rockford, that’s at the forefront on Native American issues at the Capitol.

In the past several years, Native American advocacy groups have scored what they call major victories in state government.

The state has agreed to return tribal land in northern Illinois, required schools to teach Native culture, allowed high school students to wear cultural and religious items during graduation, and streamlined the process of repatriation and reburial of Native American remains and artifacts.

This year’s top priority would require K-12 schools to pick new logos and mascots by July 2026 to replace any that have Native American names and imagery by 2030. That measure passed the House 71-40 on April 10 and is awaiting action in the Senate in the session’s final three weeks.

If it becomes law, it will mark the latest in a series of policy wins for Native groups that have been working at the Capitol for measures they say go a long way toward righting historic wrongs.

The return of stolen land

The most recent bill to earn the governor’s signature returns stolen land to the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation. Gov. JB Pritzker signed that measure nearly a year after the Prairie Band became the state’s first federally recognized tribe in April 2024.

Illinois has a well-documented history as a removal state, meaning Native Americans were forcibly removed multiple times, including through the Trail of Tears. The Prairie Band Potawatomi’s land in DeKalb County was erroneously declared “abandoned” by the U.S. government and sold at auction in 1849 because Chief Shab-eh-nay had temporarily left the land to visit relatives in Kansas.

For decades, the nearly 1,500 acres had been state park land. State Sen. Mark Walker, D-Arlington Heights, helped usher the measure through the legislature before its ultimate passage in January following heated debate and a narrow 63-41 vote in the waning hours of session. Walker also sponsored the measure focusing on repatriation and reburial of Native remains.

“These two issues, the one about a reservation and the one about Indian burials, came to my attention as two really difficult issues to solve,” Walker said. “And they've been around the state probably 30-40 years.”

The legislative win for the Prairie Band Potawatomi was years in the making, a product of organized lobbying and coordination. Joseph “Zeke” Rupnick, tribal chairman of the Prairie Band and Shab-eh-nay’s descendant, was a mainstay at the Capitol in the lead-up to the passage of the measure.

“This moment reflects the power of collaboration and the shared desire to build a future rooted in justice and respect,” Rupnick said in a statement following Pritzker’s March signing of the bill. “Illinois has shown true courage and vision by leading the way in the Land Back movement, demonstrating that healing and reconciliation are possible.”

Even with the land transfer measure passed, the Prairie Band’s involvement in state policymaking isn’t going away.

“We, the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation, being the first tribe to have some of our unceded treaty lands reaffirmed here in the state, have tried to be very involved in issues here within the state,” said Raphael Wahwassuck, a council member for the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation.

Wahwassuck is also a member of West’s working group and is pushing to secure passage of the mascot ban, among other policy changes.

“I hear counterarguments about how 'oh we're honoring' or 'this is our tradition,' and I just don't empathize with those because there's better ways you can honor an individual or a group of people,” he said of the portrayal of Native Americans as school mascots.

Advocacy evolution

The mascot ban before the Senate is not a new proposal – even for its House sponsor. West, the Rockford Democrat, first tried to pass legislation in 2020 that would ban Native mascots in K-12 schools, but he changed his plans upon a call from Johnson.

While Johnson relayed to West that mascots are an issue, he and other advocates wanted to prioritize something else: requiring schools to teach Native history.

“The posture I have for my working groups is I'm the chauffer,” West said. “When I meet with them, they tell me what they want to do, and I simply share with them if there's a path forward, and if there is a path, we start driving.”

That measure, sponsored by West, was signed into law in 2023, with the requirement taking effect this school year.

Les Begay, a working group member, citizen of the Diné Nation and leader of the Indigenous People’s Day Coalition, said in general, Illinoisans don’t know much about Native Americans. That’s why measures such as the Mascot ban and history requirement are so important, the tribal leaders said.

“There's so many people in Illinois that have been born here that know nothing about Cahokia,” Begay said, referring to a state-managed UNESCO World Heritage site located in St. Clair County.



[caption id=""attachment_66071"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1140""] Pictured is the Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site in St. Clair County. (Capitol News Illinois photo by Beth Hundsdorfer)[/caption]



Cahokia Mounds, in Collinsville, is home to what was the largest pre-Columbian site north of Mexico. The site was abandoned before Europeans arrived on the continent, but at the height of its population in 1250, there were more people living there than in London, England.

Johnson was part of the successful push to pass the Native education measure in 2023, testifying to the importance of teaching Native history.

“This is one of the many examples where the lack of proper education has deprived our citizens of discovering the full extent of the complexity, interrelations and impact of the people who originally inhabited this land and who continue to live here today,” Johnson said at the time.

After Johnson reached out to West, he found people from other Native organizations throughout the state, along with citizens and representatives of federally recognized tribes, who wanted to collaborate.

“I might not be a Native American, but I'm a Black man with my own history, and I am able to empathize with how they are feeling, so that's what, that's what keeps me going,” West said.

For many, the policy pushes are the latest front in decades of advocating for Native culture.

When Begay studied at the University of Kansas in the 1970s, he was exposed to the American Indian Movement, an organization that gained national attention for occupying Alcatraz Island, the Trail of Broken Treaties and providing grassroots support services for Native Americans.

While members of the working group acknowledged the movement “crossed the line a couple times,” AIM and the era’s activism had a lasting impact on some.

“The AIM leaders that originally were based out of Minnesota, they came to the university where I was and spoke once, and I just – after that I just wanted to get more involved,” Begay said.

Begay worked on Native issues with people at Haskell Indian Nations University, a Native American college in the same city as the University of Kansas. In 2016, he joined the board of the American Indian Center, one of the largest centers for urban Native Americans in the country.

Since retiring, Begay has had even more time to work on issues he’s passionate about, like advocating to change the name of Columbus Day to Indigenous Peoples Day. Illinois passed a law in 2017 recognizing “Indigenous Peoples Day” as the last Monday in September each year, but it has not replaced Columbus Day on the official calendar of state holidays.

Beaudet, a lawyer, volunteered with the Native American Rights Fund in the 2000s, helping tribes and Native Americans with legal cases.

He said the issue of Native mascots is something that crops up for him every so often, like at Lane Tech College Prep where he sat on the school’s council and successfully helped advocate to get rid of their mascot, the “Indians.”

He also shared a personal example of the negative effects of Native imagery in Illinois school mascots. Beaudet was exposed to stereotypical depictions of Natives when he attended Archbishop Weber High School in Chicago, the home of the “Red Horde.” Beaudet said showing up for away games in high school brought racism with it.

[caption id=""attachment_66306"" align=""alignleft"" width=""150""] The Red Horde logo for the former Archbishop Weber High School in Chicago.[/caption]

“When we showed up, it was ‘massacre the Horde,’” Beaudet said. “They would have a Native mannequin hanging from the stands or being dragged, supposedly dead, across the field. So, it always brings up a moral, I guess to use the word, visceral response.”

Johnson, who worked for the American Indian Center from 2011-2015 as chief financial officer then eventually its executive director, moved to Illinois from California in the mid-1990s.

“Joining the American Indian Center and hearing what's going on in other places really, really piqued my concern with what students were exposed to, what they had to endure, and really cemented my efforts to try to do something about this,” Johnson said regarding the mascot ban.

He said Native issues have come a long way in Illinois.

“I have seen a difference over the last 10 to 12 years, where it was people saying 'I didn't even know there were any Natives in Illinois itself,' and saying that with all degree of seriousness related to it,” Johnson said.

Now, Johnson said, legislative moves are showing how much progress is being made.

Future advocacy

While the mascot ban is still unsettled, working group members are already individually considering legislation for next session, though there is no consensus yet at a group level.

Marne Smiley, a citizen of the Otoe-Missouria Tribe and a working group member, said she provides data and insight to the group as a reference about other Native Americans’ priorities. The data is collected through her role at the Chicago American Indian Community Collaborative, or CAICC, which has organized the annual Native American Summit since 2023.

According to one survey from CAICC, there are three issues Native people generally care about most: children, youth and families; mental health; and access to affordable housing.

Johnson said housing and codifying the Indian Child Welfare Act are two things he’ll likely be pushing for in the next legislative session.

The Indian Child Welfare Act, or ICWA, is a federal law that says Native families are the preferred placement for where Native children removed from their homes are placed. So, children would preferably be moved in with a family in their tribe or to an extended family member instead of putting the child in the foster care system.

Johnson said he’s interested in codifying ICWA in Illinois statute in case of changes to federal law.

A 2023 study from Children and Youth Services Review about the effectiveness of ICWA touched on how Native American children were “overrepresented in the foster care system.” A 16-state survey in 1978, the same year that ICWA became law, showed 85% of Native children in foster care were placed in non-Native homes.

Under another federal law, the Native American Graves and Repatriation Act, tribal nations like the Prairie Band Potawatomi work closely with places like the Illinois State Museum and universities to return or reinter human remains.

Begay said he’s interested in strengthening protections under NAGPRA on a state level.

Beyond NAGPRA, other Native interests could be advanced at the federal level as well.

U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin reintroduced legislation April 29 that would require the National Park Service to study Cahokia Mounds to determine whether it should become a National Park, a designation he’s been trying to secure for Cahokia for years.

Lori Belknap is the state’s site director at Cahokia, after having worked there for 18 years, first joining as a student and volunteer then eventually working her way up.

“So many people I've spoken to over the years, in all those different capacities, have said ‘I didn't even know this was here,’” Belknap said. “You know, they heard about it on TV or they came when they were a kid for a field trip, just a lot of different information.”

Belknap said the site has recently averaged about 200,000 visitors per year, despite funding challenges and the fact that the visitor’s center has been closed for mechanical updates.

“I know it's a sacred site to the Native culture, and we're just trying to do the best we can to honor that and be good stewards of the site, for the right now,” Belknap said.

(Photo by Leah Romero / Source NM)When Lynn Austin sat down with a microphone on his lapel and stories at the ready Thursday, he joined a statewide program of collecting oral history from New Mexico seniors. 
After a brief introduction, Austin talked about his move from Kansas to New Mexico. When asked about what brought him to the Land of Enchantment, he paused for a beat and replied wryly, “My car.” He laughed and went on to talk about his education at New Mexico State University and the motto he has lived by most of his life. 
“Just go for it,” he said. “Don’t hold back.”
The New Mexico Aging and Long-Term Services Department unveiled the “Talk to Me” program in October 2024 at the Annual Conference on Aging in Albuquerque. Brian Garcia, a contractor working with the ALTSD, told Source NM that the program has since expanded and he and his team have spent the last several months traveling to senior centers across the state to connect with older New Mexicans. They were in Las Cruces the week of May 6, and have also recently visited Farmington and Clovis.
Seniors sign up for a time slot online and then spend about 15 to 20 minutes sharing stories from their lives. Garcia has flash cards with prompts to encourage a conversation, with questions such as:
“What has given you purpose in your life? What gives you hope? What advice would you give to your younger self?” 
Participants can also talk about whatever they want.
The conversations are recorded, formatted and then sent back to contributors or their families several weeks later.


Join the conversation
If you or a loved one are interested in contributing to the state’s oral history project, check upcoming recording locations online at https://www.talktomenm.org/. 
Next session:

May 23, 2025 at 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.
Isleta Elder Center, 1005 Tribal Rd. 140, Isleta Village Proper, NM 87022



“We’re really trying to give senior New Mexicans around the state a platform to voice their stories and experiences,” Garcia said.
Austin told Source NM that he was interested in recording some of his stories because he likes to write short vignettes about people he’s met throughout his life and this project aligned with his interests. 
“There’s two reasons I came here. The one is to just fulfill the requirement, come and chitchat,” he said. “But the other one is… I write different things, I write what I call vignettes of life.”
Garcia added that the Talk to Me program is also a way to connect older New Mexicans with the senior centers in their communities and the services they provide for free, such as in-person meals, delivered meals, homemaking services, transportation, social events and more. 
Garcia said the plan is to return to towns later in the year to collect and record more stories as people become more aware of the program.

She wasn’t thinking about years-long wait lists for a child care provider. Or how the astronomical cost would sideline her career. 
But that’s the reality for Minnesota parents who face the nation’s third most expensive infant care, at $1,800 a month, behind Massachusetts and Washington D.C., according to data from the Economic Policy Institute. Child care for a 4-year-old is slightly cheaper, but still $1,500 a month, or $18,000 per year and unaffordable for a typical family in Minnesota, where the median household income is $87,556.
Fitzgerald, like many people when they have children, was forced to adjust her life accordingly.
Fitzgerald and her husband, who were living in St. Paul at the time, relied on his roughly $80,000 salary after she decided to leave the workforce to take care of her babies. They were born in quick succession, and both needed stays in the neonatal intensive care unit during the COVID-19 pandemic. Fitzgerald sought a respite by enrolling them in child care part-time.
“We had our first two kids so close together, it kind of gave me more one-on-one time with them,” she said. “They were both babies, and it was good for me to be at home and nursing one, and the other could go to daycare one or two days of the week.”
For her then-infant children to attend part-time at Tierra Encantada, a Spanish immersion child care, Fitzgerald said her monthly bill was $2,366, which was more expensive than her mortgage. Her parents had to chip in to cover the expense.
After a year and about $30,000 later, she and her husband moved to the outskirts of the Twin Cities metro, where they settled into a larger home and her husband secured a higher-paying job.
The high cost of Minnesota child care, Fitzgerald said, encouraged a series of life-changing decisions. She left the workforce. Her husband found a more lucrative job. They moved out of St. Paul. And, after a third child was born during this time, they undertook a medical procedure to ensure they wouldn’t have more children.
‘Broken system’
Ann McCully, executive director at Child Care Aware of Minnesota, said the Fitzgeralds’ experience is not unique.
McCully said Child Care Aware, which receives state and federal funding, works with some parents who will refuse raises at work so they can stay below the income ceiling on child care subsidies.
The situation is so dire, she said, that some families won’t have more children even if they want them. 
“What I’m hearing more than I ever have before is people saying, ‘We’re holding off on having a second child or having a child because we know we can’t afford child care,’” McCully said.
The problem, McCully said, is that the child care market is uniquely broken — there are seemingly no winners: Parents are paying bills that often surpass their mortgages; providers are barely breaking even; and child care workers are taking home low wages despite the importance and stress of their work.
Statewide, child care workers made about $15.65 an hour in 2024, according to Minnesota Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics. The earnings don’t cover the calculated cost of living for a single person, and positions in food preparation, dry cleaning and animal training all reported a higher wage than those in child care. The state Department of Employment and Economic Development connects the low wages to a shortage of qualified caregivers.
Expensive infant care has plagued Minnesota parents for decades, in part because of regulations that require caregivers to oversee a fewer number of infants for safety, McCully said. In Minnesota, the ratio is 4:1 for children up to 16 months old at licensed child care centers. 
McCully said it’s comparable to a single parent raising quadruplets. “Can you imagine?” she asked.
A decade ago, the Star Tribune produced Pulitzer Prize-winning reporting that detailed deaths in poorly regulated home-based child care centers. 
Minnesota is now among the strictest states for child care regulations, according to a report from the Knee Regulatory Research Center at West Virginia University, but the stringent requirements have led to higher prices.
The Minnesota Child Care Association earlier this year advised against a Republican proposal that would have allowed teenage workers and unsupervised volunteers to count for the adult-to-child ratio. The organization wrote that the proposed changes were dangerous, and lawmakers should instead provide resources so care centers can hire better qualified teachers and increase accessibility for care.
According to EPI, just 5.5% of Minnesota families can afford infant care, based on a federal standard that says a family should pay no more than 7% of household income on child care.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Think Small, a child care advocacy group, says they work with families spending as much as 40% or more of their income on child care. In one case, for instance, a south Minneapolis family spends $1,350 per month — $16,200 per year — despite an annual income of just $40,000. 
If Minnesota implemented a policy to cap a family’s child care expenses at 7% of income, the typical family would save $14,000 per year, and 29,000 more parents could opt for the workforce instead of staying home, according to the EPI analysis.
Former Gov. Mark Dayton in 2015 proposed universal pre-K, an estimated $348 million investment that would have granted every 4-year-old in the state access to early learning programs. At the time, parents were paying about $11,000 per year on child care — a figure that continued to grow in the years that followed. Dayton couldn’t harness legislative support.
Now, Gov. Tim Walz frequently touts his mission to make Minnesota the best state in the nation to raise children. He has signed into law free school meals, a Child Tax Credit and Paid Family and Medical Leave. 
But if expensive child care persists, he’ll struggle to turn that mission into a legacy. 
Alexandra Fitzsimmons, policy director at Children’s Defense Fund of Minnesota, pointed to “significant investments” made in 2023, when the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party controlled the Legislature.
The new money in 2023 increased the number of subsidized slots for lower income children by about 19,000, according to state data, bringing the total to an estimated 55,000. Some qualifying parents, however, say the process is a bureaucratic morass of paperwork that requires constantly having to prove you don’t make more than the income cap. And in any case, Minnesota is home to more than 330,000 children under age five, which means the subsidized slots aren’t available for most middle class families.
For the parents of young children, help is almost certainly not on the way this year. A few Minnesota lawmakers have proposed new spending, but the state’s grim budget outlook makes a significant investment in child care unlikely.
Minnesota also receives more than $200 million per year from the federal government to fund child care. President Donald Trump proposed cutting this funding in his first term, and Republicans are more focused than ever on cuts to social programs to pay for tax cuts, which means even that relatively modest federal help could be threatened. 
Status: Waitlisted
While affording child care is one challenge, finding an available spot at a reliable center is another. McCully said parents are planning their future children around available spots at nearby care centers.
“It’s certainly not the kind of family planning we wanted to be involved in,” she said.
About two years ago, Fitzgerald moved to Bayport, a small town near the Wisconsin border, where she and her husband found a better place to fit their growing family — her third child was born during the house hunt. Fitzgerald said she struggled to locate a reliable child care and faced lengthy waitlists.
“It took me a very long time to get in anywhere,” Fitzgerald said. “I was calling people, and this was two years ago, people were saying, ‘We are waitlisted until 2026, 2025.’ I was like, ‘Alright, so basically I had to get my baby on the list before they’re even born.’ It’s insane the lack of options that you have.”
Fitzgerald eventually scored a spot through a lottery draw. Without it, she estimated the monthly cost of full time child care for all three of her children to range from $3,500 at a church she previously used, to about $8,000 for a private option. Her mortgage is currently about $3,400 a month, she said.
A view from the inside
Bobby Schmitz, a parent in St. Paul, said he and his wife reserved a spot at Common Roots Montessori School when they were three months pregnant.
Schmitz’ son has been going to the same care provider since he was 16 months old, which is the earliest the Montessori school allows. Schmitz said he and his wife reserved his spot while scoping out the neighborhood provider — 19 months in advance.
“We just got lucky because of our ignorance, really,” he said.
  Tera Dornfeld and Bobby Schmitz push their son Linus Schmitz, 3, on the swings at the park after picking him up at daycare Friday, May 9, 2025.
Now they’re expecting a baby in July, and Schmitz said the school was among the first to know —  he’s already reserved a spot for his daughter in 2027.
In addition to sending his children to the Common Roots Montessori School, Schmitz joined its nine-member board last August as a way to give back. He said his responsibilities include approving the budget and ensuring the school is sustainably funded by using a mix of grants and other sources. The majority of the operational budget is covered by tuition, he said.
His involvement as a board member does not come with a discount for his 3-year-old son’s care, which Schmitz said costs about $19,000 annually.
Schmitz’s experience of the inner workings of the school educated him on how the child care industry is working with super low margins, and he said it’s clear no one is getting rich providing care.
“Being on the board, I see the conversations on what the tradeoffs are for every dollar and how laser focused [providers] are for how to make it the best place for the kids, and the best environment for staff,” he said. 
The cost is worth it, Schmitz said: “For me it’s a no-brainer to have my kids there because of the consistency, because of the thoughtfulness that I’ve seen. It’s hard enough to have a kid away from his parents all day long.”
Schmitz said paying one child care bill isn’t a “budget buster,” but he and his wife’s combined annual earnings of roughly $200,000 will be stretched when their daughter is enrolled and their annual bill increases.
Anticipating the additional cost, Schmitz said he is starting to save money now so they can pay for two kids in child care — he’s preparing to pay $40,000 a year.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MG_8910-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-05-12 09:05:03.915300

Benjamin Brown, a former civil rights organizer, was shot in the back in Jackson, Mississippi. 
Brown had walked with a friend into the Kon-Tiki Café to pick up a sandwich to take home to his wife. On his way back, he encountered a standoff between law enforcement officers and Jackson State University students, who had been hurling rocks and bottles at them. Brown was hit in the back by three shotgun blasts. No arrests were ever made, and the Mississippi Sovereignty Commission gathered spy files on the students who protested. 
Eyewitnesses pointed their fingers at then-Mississippi Highway Patrolman Lloyd Jones, who reportedly admitted his involvement in the killing. When some accused a Jackson police detective of killing Brown, Jones was quoted as replying that the detective “didn’t shoot that n—–, I did.” 
Jones was quoted as saying that he took the shotgun home, cleaned it, wrapped it in a blanket and placed it in an attic for a few months before returning it to service.

Benjamin Brown, a former civil rights organizer, was shot in the back in Jackson, Mississippi. 
Brown had walked with a friend into the Kon-Tiki Café to pick up a sandwich to take home to his wife. On his way back, he encountered a standoff between law enforcement officers and Jackson State University students, who had been hurling rocks and bottles at them. Brown was hit in the back by three shotgun blasts. No arrests were ever made, and the Mississippi Sovereignty Commission gathered spy files on the students who protested. 
Eyewitnesses pointed their fingers at then-Mississippi Highway Patrolman Lloyd Jones, who reportedly admitted his involvement in the killing. When some accused a Jackson police detective of killing Brown, Jones was quoted as replying that the detective “didn’t shoot that n—–, I did.” 
Jones was quoted as saying that he took the shotgun home, cleaned it, wrapped it in a blanket and placed it in an attic for a few months before returning it to service.

Attorneys for transgender young people and families and the state of Alabama recently agreed to dismiss a lawsuit challenging the state's ban on gender-affirming medical care.  (Vladimir Vladimirov/Getty Images)This much we know: Alabama’s gender-affirming care ban will be law for the foreseeable future.
Attorneys for transgender young people and their families sued to overturn it. But after a three-year battle, the plaintiffs and the state moved to dismiss the lawsuit. The attorneys for the families said their clients had “to make heart-wrenching decisions that no family should ever have to make, and they are each making the decisions that are right for them.”
To be sure, the broader legal landscape looks threatening. The U.S. Supreme Court seems poised to uphold a similar ban on gender-affirming care in Tennessee. One can hardly blame parents for giving up on an unjust legal system.
But Alabama’s attorney general wants you to think there’s something far worse going on. Shortly after the dismissal, Steve Marshall claimed to have uncovered a “medical, legal, and political scandal that will be studied for decades.”
OK. What it is it?
“Key medical organizations misled parents, promoted unproven treatments as settled science and ignored growing international concern over the use of sex-change procedures to treat gender dysphoria in minors,” the statement said.
This is not evidence. It’s not even anything new from the attorney general’s office. They have been making this argument in federal court for three years.
And doing a terrible job with it. During a hearing in 2022, the attorney general’s office called witnesses who had never worked with transgender children but harbored strong opinions about how to treat them. When the families called experts and medical professionals who knew something about gender dysphoria, state attorneys struggled to counter their arguments.
U.S. District Judge Liles C. Burke, a Trump appointee, soon blocked the law’s ban on puberty blockers and hormones for transgender youth.
But the partisan hacks above Burke tilted the table toward the state and away from common decency. U.S. Circuit Judge Barbara Lagoa lowered the standard of review in the case to pretend the state’s witnesses were as knowledgeable as the plaintiffs’, mocking the word “expertise.”
And empowering Marshall to make some questionable assertions.
European countries have reconsidered standards of care for transgender youth. But almost none of them have banned gender-affirming care outright like Alabama has. The NHS in England last year ended new prescriptions for puberty blockers following the release of the Cass Report, which has come under sharp attack from experts. But unlike Alabama, the NHS allowed children receiving puberty blockers to stay on them. A law formalizing the ban in the country never passed.
Health care organizations condemned the NHS’ decision.  Because the “unproven treatments” statement is misleading. Two dozen medical organizations endorse gender-affirming care as safe and effective, and it has a high satisfaction rate among patients.
“Certainly, the science is quickly evolving and will likely continue to do so,” Burke wrote in his May 2022 opinion. “But this is true of almost every medical treatment regimen. Risk alone does not make a medication experimental.”
That leaves us with “key medical organizations misled patients.”
Step back to the 2022 hearing on the law. Medical providers who work with transgender children testified under oath about the many steps in evaluating gender dysphoria. There are several rounds of counseling with parents and children before medication is even considered.
Some kids may not need medical intervention. Some do, which triggers further rounds of evaluation. Treatment exists on a spectrum. And doctors discuss risks with families.
“They are not 100% guaranteed to happen,” Dr. Morissa Ladinsky, formerly of UAB, told the court in 2022. “That has to be weighed with the entire team around the gravity of that person’s gender dysphoria.”
Doctors testified under oath that they give families the most complete pictures of treatment they can. If Marshall has evidence that they misled these families, he should enter it into the court record as these professionals did. As of this writing, he has not. Which suggests how flimsy the state’s case is.
The problem here isn’t parents protecting their children from assault by the state of Alabama. It’s the state terrorizing a small and vulnerable group of young people.
They banned them from playing sports. They cut off their health care. Every act aims to drive them out of the public sphere. And our leaders seem fine with the destruction they’re leaving behind.
So we will have to live with the ban for now.
But transgender people will still be here when the authors of these laws are gone. Eventually the ban will fall like any other attempt to restrain reality.
Yet how many children will suffer before that day? How many Alabama families will have to uproot and build new lives outside the state to get this critical care to their loved ones?
And when families can’t, how many tragedies will result?
That’s the scandal. And it’s the politicians, not the doctors, who bear the blame.

HB 8, sponsored by Rep. Barbara Drummond, D-Mobile, would ban the distribution of tobacco, tobacco products, electronic nicotine delivery systems, e-liquids, and alternative nicotine products through vending machines. It would also create a licensing and fee requirement for retailers intending to sell these products.
“These products are harming our young people. We’re not dealing with something that is a healthy product. This product is not a product that we should be inhaling into our lungs. So, we are just trying to protect our children,” said Sen. David Sessions, R-Grand Bay, who presented the bill to the body.

The bill passed the Senate by a vote of 28-5. The House concurred with Senate changes to the bill later in the day, sending the bill to Gov. Kay Ivey.
Similar bills meant to address concerns about youth access to vaping devices have been introduced over several years by Drummond. Drummond, who was present on the Senate floor during its passage, received a standing ovation from the chamber.

“Today, your hard work is paid off,” said Senate President Pro Tempore Garlan Gudger, R-Cullman, who has sponsored similar legislation in the past.. “The state of Alabama appreciates you. We all say thank you for taking care of our kids, the superintendents, all the school children throughout, and all the ones that are doing some bad stuff. They don’t even know they’re doing bad stuff because that study’s not out there, and there’s not any money to enforce this. This allows that to happen.”
Rates of smoking tend to be higher in Alabama, with just over 14% of Alabama adults being current smokers in 2023, with 9.5% smoking every day and 4.8% smoking some days, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). About 12% of adults smoke every day or some days nationally.
Rates of high school students using electronic vapes in Alabama are also higher than nationally and have increased since 2015, when about 2% of high school students used an electronic vaping device daily, according to CDC’s High School Youth Risk Behavior Survey data. By 2021, that increased to 8% of Alabama high school students reporting using vapes every day, compared to 5% nationally.
A University of Southern California 2025 study suggests that e-cigarette use in the past year declined in U.S. youths, but there was a significant increase in nicotine pouch usage from 2023 to 2024.
The bill would also establish the Tobacco Licensing and Compliance Fund; provide for an advisory board to the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board, and require tobacco retailers to post signage warning of the dangers of tobacco product use. The legislation also includes measures aimed at schools, directing the Alabama State Board of Education to develop a model policy for vape awareness, education and prevention programs in public K-12 schools. Local boards of education will be required to adopt policies based on this model.
During the Senate floor discussions, Sessions said he was concerned with the increasing use of vaping products among young people and the health consequences associated with them.  
“We have an epidemic going on in this state with our young people. They are getting sick,” he said, claiming young individuals have required hospitalization due to the use of counterfeit products.
The Senate also addressed concerns about the bill’s potential impact on businesses that legally sell tobacco and vape products. An amendment proposed by Senate Minority Leader Bobby Singleton, D-Greensboro and approved by the chamber allows the sale of FDA-approved products in convenience stores if these stores obtain the necessary permits and comply with verification requirements.  
“This amendment would definitely fall still under the laws of this particular bill,” Singleton said, saying that the amendment does not weaken the bill’s intended regulation.

‘”In 2023, close to 30 percent of Southwest Gas’ companywide damages were due to homeowners and contractors not calling 811 before excavation,” says the utility’s website.
“‘Call 811’ line marking service is free for residential and commercial digging jobs of all sizes and for all types of projects, and is the law.” 
While free to the caller, the service comes at a cost to the customer. 
From June 2022 to May 2023, line location expenses paid by customers totaled just under $11.7 million in Southern Nevada and about $2 million in the north. 
The utility won approval to recover those yearly costs as part of a $59.1 million general rate hike that went into effect last year. Now Southwest Gas is asking for authority to recover an estimated $3.5 million a year for the next two years. 
Southwest Gas contends it’s not technically seeking a rate hike, but rather permission from the PUC to establish a regulatory account “to track the actual level of line location-related expenses the Company incurs. This will allow the Company to recover its actual costs – no more, no less – at a future date after consideration by the PUCN,” spokesperson Amy Washburn said via email. 
In testimony provided to the PUC, utility executives contend the cost of line location has skyrocketed since 2016, with the utility recovering a smaller portion of the expense.  
  (Source: Southwest Gas filing with PUCN)
David Chairez, regulatory manager for the Nevada Attorney General’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, testified to the PUC that the utility’s holding company, Southwest Gas Holdings, “is doing very well… with net income of $261 million, an increase of $19 million” over the previous year, while its operation and maintenance expenses per customer are unchanged.
Chairez argues the PUC should deny the application to establish a regulatory asset for line locating expenses because it’s an attempt to engage in single-issue ratemaking –  legislative or commission actions that set or affect rates outside of a general rate case. The practice is permitted in some cases, such as when it’s required by statute, or because of a natural disaster, such as a hurricane, that results in unforeseen expenses for the utility. 
Opposition to single-issue ratemaking is based on the premise that a utility’s revenue requirement is calculated on aggregate costs, rather than one cost related to a single component of its operations. 
Rates are designed to cover a utility’s costs and provide for a fair and reasonable return on investment. Chairez argues the proposed rate solely benefits Southwest Gas shareholders. 
When requests from Nevada’s Consumer Advocate for single-issue ratemaking would have benefitted the customer, Southwest Gas and the PUC opposed it, Chairez testified, including when President Donald Trump, in his first term, lowered corporate tax rates from 35% to 21%, resulting in a windfall for the utility.  
The utility, which enjoyed the tax relief immediately, delayed passing the savings of Trump’s corporate tax adjustment to ratepayers for nine months until its next rate case, during which time customers were paying rates that were based on the utility having to pay a higher federal tax rate than it was actually paying. That cost Southern Nevada customers $7.2 million in savings and Northern Nevada customers $1.3 million by waiting, Chairez estimated. 
The Bureau of Consumer Protection’s position is at odds with that of PUC staff, who support the application. 
“Southwest Gas asserts it has experienced a dramatic increase in the level of line locate requests in recent years,” PUC staffer John Brownrigg testified, and recommended that regulators approve the utility’s request to account separately for the increased line location costs now, and include the expense in the utility’s next general rate case. 
Unlike electric utilities, Southwest Gas is not bound by law to file a general rate case every three years, but rather at its discretion. 
The average customer currently pays $15.20 a year for line location efforts. The utility’s request, if approved by the PUC, would eventually add about $5 a year. 
Chairez, in his testimony, notes Southwest Gas is required to comply with the ‘Call Before You Dig’ statute “and that obligation will not change if the PUC denies the request.”
Southwest Gas is also currently asking state lawmakers to allow it to engage in alternative ratemaking, a policy shift that could pose a cost burden to customers, according to opponents of the legislation, because it avoids the transparency of a general rate case.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-1179196470_WEB-e1746992717332-1024x667.jpg,,,2025-05-12 08:08:49.344448

A common counter to raising taxes on the rich is that they will simply flee their home states to jurisdictions with friendlier tax codes. While some tax migration is inevitable, the wealthy that move to avoid taxes represent a tiny percentage of their own social class. The top one percent are incentivized not to move because of family, social networks and local business knowledge.
Our findings support the case against tax flight: The number of individuals with a net worth of at least seven-figures continued to expand in both Massachusetts and Washington after tax hikes. The millionaire class has grown by 38.6 percent in Massachusetts and 46.9 percent in Washington over the past two years. The seven-figure clubs in those states saw their wealth grow by $580 million and $748 million, respectively.
Not only did millionaires not flee the states imposing new taxes, but the states became richer. The four percent surtax on million-dollar incomes in Massachusetts and the seven percent tax on capital gains of $250,000 or more in Washington State succeeded in raising revenue — $2.2 billion for FY 2024 and $1.2 billion in its first two years of implementation, respectively.
These new resources have been invested in educational programs that support early learning, childcare, and free school lunches and community college. In the case of Massachusetts, some of the revenue collected is earmarked towards public transportation.
That experience contrasts with the failure of the Great Kansas Tax Cut Experiment that began in 2012. The Sunflower State lagged behind its neighbors in a number of economic categories and experienced revenue shortfalls. The experiment was abandoned five years later.
Lastly, the brief looks at the revenue potential of a wealth tax aimed at ultra-high net worth individuals. We identified individuals with $50 million or more in wealth across four states and estimated how much different taxes could raise. These individuals have the liquidity to pay and, as my colleague and former tax attorney Bob Lord has argued, need to have their rate of accumulation curbed.  
A two percent wealth tax on this class of ultra-high net worth individuals has the potential to raise $7.4 billion in Massachusetts, $21.9 billion in New York, $700 million in Rhode Island, and $8.2 billion in Washington. This is a significant source of potential revenue that can be invested in a green transition, permanently affordable housing, and universal healthcare.
At the time of writing, legislators in Washington State are awaiting Governor Bob Ferguson’s signature to pass new taxes to help bring down their $16 billion budget deficit. Even a one-time three percent wealth tax could bring down the deficit from $16 billion to $3.7 billion.
We have witnessed a counterrevolution over the past 50 years where the nation’s wealth and income has concentrated at an extreme level in the hands of a small but powerful minority. They use their resources to increase their access to the state, buy up more assets, and squeeze the living standards of the working-class. We have the policy tools at our disposal to reverse this trend. Let’s put progressive taxation to work.

Are we in a recession in Connecticut? The short answer is probably not (at the moment), but we can’t be certain. 
Technically, only the National Bureau of Economic Research — a nonprofit, nonpartisan research group — can make the call on whether the United States economy is in a recession or not. And typically, it does so only after we’ve been in one for a while. 
A panel of eight NBER-selected economists, known as the Business Cycle Dating Committee, looks at a number of different data points and confers over whether the economy is expanding or receding — whether we’re in an “expansion” or a “recession.” The committee also assigns start and end dates for each recession. Retroactively, of course.
The most straightforward data point is the growth rate of gross domestic product, or GDP. GDP is the value of all the goods and services we produce, aka the size of our economy. If the GDP growth rate is negative for two consecutive quarters, it’s likely the economy is in a recession.
But that’s not a hard and fast rule. The committee also looks at the latest trends in jobs and unemployment; personal income and consumption; industrial production, wholesaler sales and other measures. The economists take all those data points — and more — into account in deciding whether the economy is in a recession and, if so, when that recession started. 
Answering the same questions at the state level gets a little fuzzier, since recessions are generally considered national events. But there are some resources available. The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia analyzes a handful of indicators to approximate economic conditions by state. You can also find charts of several relevant data points for the state on The Connecticut Mirror’s Economic Indicator Dashboard.
But what is a recession?
According to NBER, a recession is “a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months.” This isn’t uncommon, because economic activity is cyclical. Periods of expansion approach a peak and then fall back — and then begin expanding again. 
The U.S. economy has gone through 34 recessions since 1854. During a recession, GDP might decline by 2% up to as much as 5%.
The COVID-19 recession was unusual in its short duration, but the decline in economic activity was so widespread across industries, demographic groups, geographic regions — all aspects of the economy — that the committee determined it amounted to a recession. 
The Great Depression was essentially a very, very bad recession. GDP declined 29%, unemployment reached 25%, consumer prices and wholesale prices tanked and a third of the banking system failed. 
What happens in a recession?
Day-to-day life can get pretty tough for people, businesses, government bodies and other organizations. When the economy isn’t growing, negative performance in one area can exacerbate problems in other areas. For example, if employers cut jobs, personal incomes decline and people spend less money. That can lead to trouble for consumer goods companies, services providers and myriad other businesses.
When companies see their sales decline, that forces cost-cutting on everything from staff positions to research and development. Some employers might have to shutter departments, close down locations, declare bankruptcy or simply go out of business. With fewer businesses hiring, recently unemployed people face a harder time finding a new job. 
Recessions also reduce tax receipts, meaning state and local governments have less money to spend on their operations and staff. And they’re hard on investments: The stock market and real estate property tend to lose value, and many people see their savings and retirement accounts shrink. Philanthropy and charitable organizations usually pull back on donations. And financial institutions, wary of taking on risk, often raise criteria for lending money making it harder for people to take out loans.
International trade also tends to decline during a recession, and consumer prices may come down due to lower demand for goods and services.
When — and how — does a recession end?
According to NBER’s records, U.S. recessions have run about 17 months on average. But since the 1980s, all six have lasted less than a year. A recession ends when the economy has bottomed out, or reached a “trough.” That exact point in time is decided (that’s right!) by NBER. Retroactively, of course.
Fiscal and monetary policy can help to restore the economy back to an expansion mode. 
Congress makes fiscal policy — i.e., spending and tax cuts to stimulate economic activity. Some fiscal policies, like Unemployment Insurance, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Medicaid, are already in place to help people who find themselves in economic distress. During a recession, participation in these programs tends to rise, which boosts spending in the economy. New fiscal stimulus, like the American Rescue Plan Act, can take longer to disperse throughout the economy.
The Federal Reserve makes monetary policy decisions also designed to stimulate demand — namely, by lowering the federal funds rate. Lower interest rates mean lower borrowing costs for people and businesses, which can stimulate consumer spending and business investment.
Lately, the Fed has actually been keeping interest rates relatively elevated. That’s because there’s a lot of uncertainty about which direction the economy will take, amid changing tariff rates and other shifts in federal economic policy.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Recession_Timing_AP_2010-1024x671.jpg,,,2025-05-12 08:08:49.344448

(Photo by Jake Goldstein-Street/Washington State Standard)Problems with overcrowding have enveloped the Green Hill School juvenile detention center in Chehalis for nearly two years, leading to unsafe conditions for the minors incarcerated there and the staff tasked with overseeing them.
But Washington state lawmakers left Olympia last month without making substantial changes to address the crisis. The lack of progress was frustrating for lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. 
While a new facility opening this year in Aberdeen could offer some relief, the failure to pass significant legislation on the issue means Green Hill is on track to continue housing dozens more people than it is designed to safely hold.
State Senate Human Services Committee Chair Claire Wilson, D-Federal Way said she “really felt disappointed for the young people that we let down.”
The crowding at Green Hill comes as juvenile crime has ballooned and state law has transitioned to send young adults convicted of crimes to youth detention instead of adult prison until they turn 25. 
The facility, along with Echo Glen Children’s Center in Snoqualmie, is one of the state Department of Children, Youth and Families’ two prisons for juvenile offenders.
Last year, the crowding crisis grew to the point that the state agency transferred 43 young men from Green Hill to an adult prison run by the state Department of Corrections and temporarily stopped taking in new people at the facility, a decision that drew staunch criticism and litigation.
For months, the population at Green Hill, which houses boys and men ages 17 to 25, has fluctuated between 220 and 240, despite a safe operational capacity of 180. Projections show that number rising another 100 by the end of 2026, according to Department of Children, Youth and Families Secretary Tana Senn.
Meanwhile, the agency’s assistant secretary for juvenile rehabilitation, Felice Upton, is no longer with the department, as of April 21. The circumstances of her departure were unclear. The agency declined to comment. 
Upton also previously served as superintendent at Echo Glen. 
Legislators this year earmarked money for increased security at Green Hill School and for operations at the smaller, new facility set to open next month in Grays Harbor County.
Lawmakers considered major policy changes this year to tackle the overcrowding. Two bills focused on different aspects of the issue passed the Senate before stalling in the House.
Senate Bill 5278 would have set new guidelines for transferring young people to adult prison or placing them there in the first place if youth facilities are above capacity.
Senate Bill 5296, sponsored by Wilson, would have tried to direct more youth away from detention in the first place. The measure would’ve required judges to specifically find, based on a “preponderance of the evidence,” that custody in juvenile rehabilitation was necessary because community-based placement would have been inadequate.
The bill also would have required court hearings to determine if people in youth prison should remain in custody, and expand eligibility for alternatives to incarceration.
“We seem to be very willing, if you will, to put money into a system to move our young people from JR into DOC, but not at all as willing to think about what it would take to keep young people from coming into the system in the first place,” Wilson said.
Wilson pushed to pass the two bills in tandem, as a package.
But while Senate Bill 5278, sponsored by Sen. John Braun, D-Centralia, had bipartisan support, the debate over Wilson’s proposal was fiercely partisan. Even a handful of House Democrats worried about the more lenient approach her bill offered. 
In the end, Wilson’s legislation collapsed over these concerns, and Braun’s bill fell with it.
“There was a well-worked, bipartisan bill with a controversial bill, and to hold that bill hostage because you couldn’t get the votes in your own caucus for a controversial bill, it just seems wrong-headed or even mean-spirited, frankly,” said Braun, whose district includes Green Hill.
Debate among the Dems
More than two dozen House Democrats were so frustrated Wilson’s bill didn’t get a vote, they put out a joint statement entitled “Lessons In Failure.”
“For the young people trapped in a system that prioritizes incarceration over rehabilitation, this is more than a missed opportunity — it’s a moral failure,” they wrote.
State Rep. Lauren Davis, D-Shoreline, was one of the few in her caucus pushing back on Wilson’s bill. She thinks the state needs stronger consequences to deter minors from committing crimes, which often leave their peers as victims. 
“I do not believe it is just or compassionate to allow these young people to self-destruct,” she said, noting the bill doesn’t expand the community supports needed to help young people diverted away from incarceration.
The case of a 17-year-old released from custody by a King County judge despite a criminal history before allegedly killing two teens in March further stoked opposition.
Davis said she’s “not sure what part of this is acceptable to anybody, but it should be unacceptable to anybody, and this bill would have fomented more of that.”
Davis said her views on public safety have evolved since joining the Legislature in 2019. She’s seen policies she supported result in homicides and suicides and doesn’t want to repeat those mistakes.
Her resistance toward Senate Bill 5296 did not make her popular among her colleagues, she said. 
Eric Trupin, a University of Washington researcher who for decades has worked with incarcerated youth, lamented the bill’s failure.
“I think we had an opportunity to really move our juvenile justice system in a way that would really have improved outcomes for youths,” he said. 
Still, he said concerns about a lack of services for diverted youth were valid. 
Meanwhile, Senn said Wilson’s bill wouldn’t address the existing population concerns at Green Hill. 
The debate isn’t over. The bills will likely be back next year for the 60-day legislative session.
“We’ve been working on this one for a long time,” Wilson said. “So it will come back, and hoping that Senator Braun will be responsive to bringing 5278 with it.”
Scant progress
The Legislature did make small moves to address juvenile detention needs.
Gov. Bob Ferguson signed a bill last month seeking to protect those held in the state’s juvenile detention centers from having to spend extra time in custody over “prison riot” charges. House Bill 1815 also looks to retroactively vacate those convictions. 
An analysis found most of the prison riot charges statewide were prosecuted in Lewis County, where Green Hill is located. The new law could affect sentences or convictions for half a dozen or so detainees at Green Hill, Senn said.
Trupin said the bill is important for those individuals. “But it’s not systems changing like these other two bills were,” he said.
The new state budget sets aside $25 million to run the new 48-bed detention center on the grounds of Stafford Creek Corrections Center in Aberdeen, known as Harbor Heights. The facility is set to open in phases beginning in early June, starting with at least eight young men transferring there from Green Hill and filling to capacity by fall. 
Harbor Heights will serve as a six-month rotation for young men in juvenile detention who qualify for medium security status.
While at Harbor Heights, they would build skills and participate in cognitive behavioral therapy to tackle mental health concerns. They’d then return to Green Hill or be released from custody.
“The hope is that young people will see it as an opportunity to expand their own learning and their own growth and their own development” before returning to be mentors at Green Hill, said Wilson.
The plan has drawn pushback from critics worried the former Department of Corrections facility will be dehumanizing, but officials have emphasized the Department of Children, Youth and Families will be running it with more services than adult prisons can provide.
Green Hill and Echo Glen are getting about $3.5 million each for increased security.
“I don’t think it’ll hurt,” Braun said. “We’ve put a ton of money into Green Hill in the last five years, six years. I think it’s helping. I don’t think it’s solving the problem. Fundamentally, it’s just overcrowded. They are not delivering on the promise to give these individuals the types of services they need to get back on track.”
Lawmakers also earmarked $3 million for grants to county courts to serve youth in the juvenile justice system. Another $3 million was set aside to scout new medium-security juvenile detention facilities. A top prospect has been the minimum-security Mission Creek Corrections Center for Women in Mason County, which is slated for closure.
Any new facility would be at least four years out, Senn said.

(Photo by Laura Tesler/Oregon Capital Chronicle)The idea of Greater Idaho — splitting off most of eastern Oregon to join with the state of Idaho — isn’t going to fly. It won’t happen.
So here’s another idea:
The Autonomous Area of eastern Oregon. And Western too, for good measure.
This concept was not invented in the deep recesses of a pundit’s mind. It comes from a recently introduced piece of legislation by a Republican lawmaker in the state of Washington.
Washington has a regional dynamic similar to Oregon. The bulk of its population is west of the Cascades and as a region votes clearly Democratic, while the geographically larger but less populated territory to the east votes Republican — with all the correlating social and economic considerations that implies. Washington’s east side hasn’t organized a highly visible join-Idaho effort the way Oregon’s has, but the proposal has surfaced occasionally.
A related but different idea emerged in this year’s Washington legislative session. Rep. Rob Chase, R-Spokane Valley in House Bill 2085 proposed keeping Washington state intact, and its congressional representation unchanged, but splitting most governing within the state.
The bill described it this way: “The legislature intends to divide the state into two autonomous regions, the Puget Sound region and the Columbia region, by constitutional amendment. Each region would provide regional governors, regional legislators, and regional judges. The state of Washington will remain a single state for purposes of federal election, as proposed in New York Senate Bill 2023-S3093.”
Presumably, that would mean splitting the key regional elections (both autonomous areas would have governors and legislatures, for example) while both vote under a common system for federal offices. Laws and regulations and finances would be affected as well.
Chase said of this, “We would have better representation that takes into account the ideals, principles, priorities, beliefs, and values found in the populace that it serves. Isn’t this what our Founding Fathers envisioned when establishing our Democratic Republic?”
This approach isn’t something familiar to American government: There are no formal “autonomous regions” in the United States. They’re more common in other parts of the globe, however, including the Caucasus, China and even a slice of Finland. Greenland, famously, is an autonomous region: Largely self-governing but under the national umbrella of Denmark.
On an American state level it’s an ambitious idea, but it may be within the purview of the state legislature. It probably would require a state constitutional amendment, but — because states do have some leeway in setting up their own governments — it might not require federal approval. If the legislature and voters approved, it probably (we’d have to see what the courts would say) could happen.
The bill didn’t go anywhere in the Washington legislature this year, nor should we expect any voter action. Chase said he introduced it now mainly to get a head start for a future push.
But the Greater Idaho folks have no doubt heard of it, and the idea of a similar bill introduction in Salem may be floated soon if it hasn’t been already. The process might even be simpler in Oregon: While Washington requires constitutional amendments to come from the legislature, Oregon allows them via citizen initiatives.
So how might this play out in Oregon?
Imagine the Greater Idaho group or some other organization petitioning for a constitutional amendment to be approved, or not, by the voters. This would have a considerable advantage over the kind of long-term and probably hopeless slog to change state boundaries. If structured carefully, the issue might be resolved in a single election through a change in the state constitution. If it passed, it would happen through the approval of the voters, which would give the idea powerful legitimacy statewide.
Getting most Oregonians to vote in favor, of course, would be difficult.
You’ll also notice the reference to “structured carefully.” Plenty of tricky issues would have to be addressed. We might be talking about three governors in Oregon, one for the whole state and one each for the east and the west. How do they relate to each other, and to the federal government, and what relative powers would they have? You could ask similar questions about the Legislature. Would there still be a statewide legislature, and if so, what could it and could it not do?
What might be the differences in tax and spending? What about federal money coming to the state of Oregon: How would it be divided? How would law enforcement and safety agencies coordinate? If criminal and other laws were different (which would seem to be part of the point of having an autonomous region), what about extradition? What would be the authority of whatever remained of a statewide Oregon government, because there would have to be one if only to deal with other states and the feds.
The autonomous idea is more complex than it first sounds. If Greater Idaho is watching the action across the Columbia, they may want to pay attention to how legislator Chase started to field the questions that are sure to multiply.

(Getty Images)For decades, Indiana’s Community and Home Options to Institutional Care for the Elderly and Disabled program — CHOICE, for short — has sought to keep Hoosiers out of long-term care facilities through home modifications and services like meal delivery or transportation. 
After the 2025 legislative session, it will also become a “Medicaid diversion program” in two pilot areas. 
CHOICE’s supporters don’t see the new duty as an expansion of the program, but rather codifying something it’s already doing. 
“The CHOICE program has always been a Medicaid diversion program,” said Rep. Ed Clere, R-New Albany. “This year’s legislation makes that explicit.” 
  Rep. Ed Clere, R-New Albany, speaks in committee on Tuesday, Jan. 23, 2024. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
Created in 1987, CHOICE is funded entirely with state dollars, but pivoted in 2014 to focus on preventative services with updated eligibility guidelines. Additionally, the program offers services on a sliding scale, meaning that there are no income restrictions on eligibility. 
“I don’t think it should be the policy of the state to wait until people are on the brink of losing independence and in poverty before we help them try to stay in their home or in another community-based setting and avoid institutionalization,” said Clere. “… since its inception, the CHOICE program has helped countless Hoosiers maintain their independence and, as a result, their quality of life.”
Dollars are funneled through the state’s Area Agencies on Aging, which are scattered around the state. The two pilot areas will be in the eastern and western parts of the state, in areas surrounding Richmond and Terre Haute, respectively. 
Thrive West Central, in Terre Haute, will spend the next year setting the pilot up and identifying ways to prolong a Hoosier’s independence, with a special focus on fall prevention and chronic disease management. 
“We think this is a fascinating study and we think it’s great for older Hoosiers,” said Ryan Keller, the executive director of Thrive. “We think this could change the trajectory of our folks, of our aging people, going on Medicaid.” 
Other important provisions of the new law, which goes into effect in July, add dementia education services for caretakers and allows the overseeing agency to study the feasibility of realigning Indiana’s senior care organizations. The state currently has 15 providers covering 16 areas, but the geographic area and population of each varies widely. 
 Could the program decrease Medicaid costs?

Nursing homes and other institutional forms of long-term care made up 19% of the state’s Medicaid expenses in 2024, despite the fact that only 2% of the state’s enrollees used those services. 
According to the 2025 CHOICE report, the annual cost of a CHOICE enrollee is $5,203 per year. In comparison, the average nursing home resident costs the state $28,343 annually — though such care is the most expensive form of long-term care. 
Of the 5,631 Hoosiers who used CHOICE in 2024, 3,439 were Medicaid eligible.

Earlier this year, student teams at Butler University analyzed Medicaid patient data provided by the Family and Social Services Administration with the goal of identifying underlying cost drivers. 
The students identified falls as a major health concern, concluding that more than 30% of Indiana’s seniors experienced falls annually. Injuries from such events are one of top reasons why someone transitions from independent living to institutional care. 
As outlined in a release from collaborator Parkview Health, if half of the state’s seniors participated in annual fall assessments, that alone could save the state an estimated $115 million and prevent 41 deaths each year. 
To Hannah Carlock, a vice president with RJL Solutions currently serving as interim CEO of the AAAs association, CHOICE is a natural solution to reduce Medicaid enrollment and costs.
“We’re seeing more and more people declining on Medicaid, so why don’t we really bolster the CHOICE program?” she asked. “… it’s very cost effective and, clearly, being at home you have a better quality of life.” 
In particular, CHOICE has been used as an option to prolong someone’s independence before they might need Medicaid waiver services — an especially crucial offering as thousands continue to languish on the state’s waitlists. 
In addition to falls, the Medicaid diversion pilot program seeks to target chronic disease management, such as heart disease or diabetes. 
“Even though you may have chronic, congestive heart failure or you have diabetes … those diseases can be managed to a certain degree,” said Keller. 
Carlock, Keller and Clere pointed to specific, small interventions that can help aging seniors such as:

Eliminating trip hazards like throw rugs
Putting grip pads under rugs on slippery surfaces, like tile
Putting washers and dryers on the main floor so people don’t have to carry heavy laundry baskets down a flight of stairs
Grab bars in bathrooms
Methods to track medication usage
Connecting someone to transportation and meal services

“Those two key categories just seem very natural, very intuitive, and they’re all things that are controllable in our environment,” Keller said about the Medicaid diversion pilot. “This is where we feel like we have the greatest control to go and start a dedicated diversion program so we can slow, delay or prevent folks from having these kinds of preventable accidents.”
“We really do believe that, with small interventions on the preventative side of things, that it can have huge, lasting echoes of cost savings on the backend,” he continued.
Evaluating the effectiveness of the program, and the final report, will be done by Notre Dame University’s Wilson Sheehan Lab for Economic Opportunities, with specific parameters set to be defined in the coming weeks.
 How will we pay for it?

Clere’s House Enrolled Act 1391 didn’t initially include “Medicaid diversion” specifically, but emerged after discussions with Clere’s peers in the General Assembly. The prospect of decreasing the state’s Medicaid commitment — Indiana’s fastest-growing and second-largest expense — became even more appealing in the last week of session after lawmakers learned of a $2 billion budget shortfall. 
But, like nearly every other spending category, CHOICE got a 5% cut in the final budget — falling from $48.8 million each year to $46.2 million. AAAs got $29.3 million of those dollars in 2024.

CHOICE is overseen by a board that meets every other month and will convene on Thursday, May 15 at 1 p.m. To learn more about the board, including its vacancies, livestreams and meeting minutes, visit the state’s website.

The senior care organizations charged with overseeing the pilot program will have to work within their existing budgets to get the project off the ground — though private partnerships could buoy their efforts. 
Keller pointed to one potential avenue for funds: the nearly $2 million AAAs left unspent in the last year. Such a reversion occurred due to the “unpredictability” of a community’s needs, Keller said, as demand varied from month-to-month. 
But AAAs will also have the chance to save some needed funds under another part of Clere’s bill: striking the requirement for some service providers to be Medicaid approved. 
With the change, “CHOICE dollars will go five times as far,” Keller said. 
Keller used building a ramp as an example. Though his community, and many others, have volunteer groups to provide free labor, they’re not approved as a provider by Medicaid. That means no CHOICE dollars can be used to purchase the needed materials. 
A Medicaid-approved provider might charge somewhere between $15,000 and $20,000 for a job that another group would do for $3,000, he said. 
“Nothing’s different … it’s the same boards, the same screws, same everything. But that’s the cost difference,” Keller said. 
Clere said that identifying which services to decouple from Medicaid approval and partnering with Notre Dame was part of the collaborative legislative process, noting that the proposal was amended a handful of times before becoming law. 
“I’m confident (decoupling) will lead to a lot more options and competition, which will provide opportunities for additional cost savings,” said Clere. 
Clere, who has been a member of the CHOICE program’s board for well over a decade, admitted that it’d become a “big part of (his) legislative focus and work.”
“I’m very passionate about it. I’ve seen the difference it can make in the lives of individuals and families,” he said, “… I’m excited about HEA 1391 and everything it represents and all of the good things that are going to come from it.”

(Getty Images)We are living in interesting times. Maybe you’ve noticed. And I’m not just talking about the vehicles in the Statehouse parking lot, or the hot history takes on social media. Hopefully, you’ve also detected the great reshuffling of priorities taking place right before our eyes.
Less money from the federal government and pervasive economic uncertainty are wreaking havoc on the state budget. Property tax relief is putting pressure on local governments to find new revenue or reduce services. And Medicaid growth is forcing smokers to pay more for their already expensive habit.
The shakeup has even come to a courtroom near you. Under the recently passed HEA 1144, some locales, notably the ever-expanding Hamilton County, will get new judicial officers. Others, like the demographically challenged Blackford County, will see theirs taken away.
All this rebalancing shows policymakers engaged in the perennial contest between trade-offs and solutions.
Thomas Sowell described the history of this contest in his classic A Conflict of Visions. According to Sowell, optimizing trade-offs is the mission of those who operate under what he terms the constrained vision of human nature, which sees us all irredeemably imperfect and lacking the capacity for solutions. The yin to this yang is Sowell’s unconstrained vision, which sees humankind as perfectible and its challenges as ultimately solvable.
Indiana lawmakers approve reduced court eliminations

HEA 1144 shows the constrained view ascendant. Lawmakers like Rep. Chris Jeter and Sen. Liz Brown recognize it is unsustainable to continually add courts without examining the system in its entirety. We can’t materialize judicial officers from thin air. So, when judges in overworked counties ask for more resources, it makes sense for lawmakers to find a way to pay for it. The simple trade-off is to cut underutilized courts.
But the unconstrained vision should not be ignored. It is indisputably a world of finite resources. There is only so much time, so much money, and so much energy to go around. And yet, over tens of thousands of years, our species has demonstrated an
uncanny ability to expand the realm of the possible. Lives have been lengthened, wealth has been created, and new sources of power have been tapped.
In the fullness of time and imagination, there may be solutions after all.
The judicial utilization problem perfectly illustrates a policy challenge that would benefit from both the constrained and unconstrained views. According to the 2024 Weighted Caseload Measures, the judiciary is operating at 102% capacity, meaning we collectively have almost exactly the right number of judges we need. It’s just that some courts are overloaded while others are underused. The simple solution is to put the underused courts to work.
I’m guessing the put-the-judges-to-work solution looks a lot better to most Hoosiers than the eliminate-the-judges-in-my-county trade-off. And fortunately, we have a model that will allow us to actively pursue the solution without settling for the trade-off.
Historically, judges “rode circuit,” traveling on horseback from town to town to hear cases. This allowed sparsely populated areas to pool their resources and create a justice system they couldn’t otherwise afford in their small frontier communities. A
vestige of this system survives in Indiana to this day: our smallest community, Ohio County, shares a circuit court with its much larger neighbor, Dearborn County.
Share and share alike
In our more urbanized society, the design problem is different, but the circuit court solution is still relevant. Today, it’s not about pooling resources but about projecting resources where they’re needed. Still, sharing what we have is the solution.
The Supreme Court has already divided the state into 26 administrative districts. With small rule changes, the judges in these districts could be allowed to hear cases across county lines. No horses required. Instead, through the magic of Zoom and the miracle of electronic filing, our existing judicial officers can do the work in their existing chambers.
In the end, Sowell’s dichotomy is a brilliant way to think about the ongoing battle of ideas, but, as he admits, not everyone has chosen a side. So, it is odd that it has become something of a mantra to say that there are no solutions, only trade-offs. Let’s
wait before we carve that in stone. Certainly, we are constrained, but we are not stagnant. Most importantly, we are not doomed to false choices.
For this reason, and with all due respect to Sowell, I prefer another classic work on trade-offs and solutions: Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. When confronted with a scenario designed to guarantee failure, Kirk famously changed the conditions of the
test. Spock sacrificed himself for the benefit of his crew. They both rejected the no-win scenario. So should we.
Judging from recent comments, legislators may be on the same page. In his remarks on final passage of HEA 1144, Rep. Jeter acknowledged that there would be an ongoing effort to get our judges “in the right spots.” If that effort comes to fruition, and if
lawmakers change the conditions to make that possible, they may be more unconstrained than they think. They may be ready to boldly seek out new solutions like those that worked before.

Michigan Democrats introduced their first pieces of legislation to respond to what they consider overly aggressive Republican proposals to improve election security.
As proposed, the package of bills under the Michigan Election Security Act won’t close the voter registration loopholes that may have allowed at least one noncitizen to cast a ballot that counted last year. And the bills omit the measures Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson suggested in February as a way to prevent noncitizens from casting ballots in Michigan’s elections.
In fact, the initial bills do little to directly address the threat of noncitizen voting, which Republicans have made a top priority since taking control of the House in January.
So what would these new bills do? And what comes next?
 What is in the Michigan Election Security Act?

The Michigan Election Security Act, or MESA, is made up of three bills. They are the first of several in what will be a larger package of election proposals known as the Security, Accountability, and Nonintervention in Elections plan, or SANE, said Rep. Stephen Wooden, a Democrat from Grand Rapids.
“This first phase, in many ways, were the low-hanging fruit — things that have been discussed in the past, that didn’t make it through lame duck last session, that for one reason or another didn’t gain legs in previous terms but are worth revisiting,” Wooden told Votebeat on Tuesday.
The later phases will include bills more focused on noncitizen voting, he said, although what is in those bills will depend on the findings of Attorney General Dana Nessel’s investigation into 15 additional noncitizens who may have voted in 2024. (A spokesperson for Nessel confirmed that the investigations are ongoing but didn’t comment further Tuesday.)
The three MESA bills were written by the three Democrats on the House Election Integrity Committee, with additional sponsors including Rep. Penelope Tsernoglou, a Democrat from East Lansing who chaired the House Election Committee last session, when Democrats controlled the House, and more than 20 other Democrats.
The first, HB 4461 from Wooden, is the one that most directly addresses the threat of noncitizens registering and voting in Michigan.
Wooden’s bill would create new obligations for the secretary of state to help keep the voter rolls free of noncitizens. It would require the secretary to verify the citizenship of any registered voter who “during a transaction with the secretary of state” provides documentation suggesting they aren’t a citizen. The state would have to check the person against state vehicle databases or “any other relevant program.” If that person is found not to be a citizen, the secretary of state would have to notify that person that their voter registration will be canceled within 60 days unless they provide proof of citizenship.
The second bill, HB 4462, comes from Rep. Matt Koleszar of Plymouth. It would allow the secretary of state to remove someone from the voter rolls after they haven’t voted in 20 years. Benson has been working on a similar effort, but it is not a codified requirement.
HB 4463, from Rep. Mai Xiong of Warren, would require the secretary of state to review the instructions on voter registration forms every even-numbered year. The form would have to clearly state that U.S. citizenship is required to register.
Noncitizen voting has become a key target of legislative efforts in recent years, but it remains very rare. In Michigan, there are only 16 known cases of suspected noncitizens casting ballots during the 2024 general election, a tiny fraction of the more than 5.7 million votes cast across the state. The rate matches closely what audits in other states, including Ohio and Georgia, have found.
Republicans have argued that any incidence of noncitizen voting demands a response. In Michigan, they proposed House Joint Resolution B, a constitutional amendment that would require all newly registering voters to show documents proving their citizenship, and require those already registered to confirm their citizenship if the state can’t independently verify it.
Conservatives have hailed it as a commonsense approach to ensure that only citizens vote in U.S. elections, but Democrats and voting rights groups have warned that such a requirement could disenfranchise thousands of eligible voters, including those who don’t have easy access to citizenship documents.
HJR B failed to gain the two-thirds majority required for it to move out of the House last week, but it could come up for a vote again. Meanwhile, a group known as the Committee to Protect Voters’ Rights is pushing to get a nearly identical measure on the ballot next year through a petition drive.
 The bills’ prospects in a divided Legislature

Wooden said future proposals from Democrats will aim to address the problem “at the root, rather than the large chainsaw approach like HJR B.”
But passing Democratic-led election bills in a Republican-controlled House won’t be easy. Wooden said he would welcome bipartisan support, but the MESA bills don’t have it yet.
He said he has “nothing but a cordial relationship” with Rep. Rachelle Smit, the Republican from Martin who leads the House Election Integrity Committee and oversees all elections-related bills. But even Tuesday morning, the two sparred during a committee hearing over how elections work in Michigan.
Smit’s office did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday.
Benson, whose office helped shape the bills, lauded the proposals in a news release as “important provisions that will strengthen our ability to keep our voter rolls up to date, help election officials more effectively identify and remove ineligible voter registrations, and provide additional tools to make sure eligible voters can easily register and cast their ballot.”
But Republicans don’t seem as confident that the bills will do enough to address concerns about election security. Rep. Bryan Posthumus, a Republican from Rockford and the main sponsor of HJR B, said he was glad Democrats were taking election security seriously but that he didn’t think the proposed bills went far enough.
He said Michigan needed “guardrails” to prevent noncitizens from being able to cast a ballot. He said he would be willing to work with Democrats on their legislative package.
“There are a million things that we can do to further secure our elections in a positive manner that doesn’t make it more difficult to vote,” he said. “I’m happy to have those conversations with whoever wants to have them, but that doesn’t change the fact that we need to require only U.S. citizens vote in our election with photo ID when casting a ballot.”

Are their minds so weak that mere exposure to certain books will infect them with what Elon Musk calls “the woke mind virus”?
They don’t want you inoculated against measles, but they’re doing their damnedest to inoculate Americans against knowledge.
Novels upset them; poetry upsets them; science upsets them; history upsets them; art upsets them; questioning of authority upsets them.
Universities really, really upset them — all that interrogating norms; all that challenging orthodoxy; all that critical inquiry.
To that end, Donald Trump’s going to war with Harvard, Columbia, Johns Hopkins, even Penn, his alma mater.
Ron DeSantis beat him to it: The governor’s been trying for years to regulate speech, impose restrictions on what teachers can teach, and decree which books the state of Florida finds “acceptable.”
While he’s had some success in K-12, enabling Moms for Liberty and their ilk in their book-banning crusade and threatening educators with dire consequences if they mention the existence of gay and trans people, some judges, unsurprisingly partial to the First Amendment, have slapped him down.
DeSantis, nothing if not energetic in his rage, is now determined to shield our precious college students from Dangerous Thoughts.
Choose the administrators. Choose the presidents. Control the universities.
The University of Florida needs a new dean of Liberal Arts and Sciences — with 40 majors and more than 10,000 students, it’s the largest college at UF.
They got as far as interviewing four highly qualified candidates: two mathematicians — UF’s own Kevin P. Knudson and Maggy Tomova, dean of UCF’s College of Science; Ryan Schroeder, dean of Georgia Southern’s College of Behavioral and Social Sciences; and Robert Brinkmann, a professor of Geology and dean of Liberal Arts and Science at Northern Illinois University.
‘Radical DEI progressives’
But two weeks ago, the governor blew up the search. Demanded UF stop it.
Seems the finalists, admired scholars and seasoned leaders, are crypto-Marxist, Trump-hating eggheads bent on destroying America.
An anonymous social media account calling itself “Commies on Campus” ran shrieking to Bryan Griffin, DeSantis’ communications director, calling all four “radical DEI progressives.”
The Commies posted slick, selectively edited videos of candidate interviews, slamming Brinkmann for stating the obvious: “We have people in charge of things in our country that don’t have any business being in charge of those things,” and Knudson for being proud that as head of UF’s Honors Program “we were able to increase the number of African American and Hispanic students in the program.”
As if that’s somehow shameful.
Kent Fuchs, UF’s invertebrate of an interim president, sent out a memo pretending “terminating the search” was the only thing to do, what with the university also in the middle of hiring a permanent president.
Fuchs has never said no to DeSantis.
He does as he’s told, facilitating the hiring of our data-challenged surgeon general at UF’s medical school and trying to stop professors from testifying on voting rights.
Academic freedom doesn’t matter; the professors’ expertise might pose a “conflict of interest to the executive branch of the state of Florida.”
As if serving the interests of the executive branch should somehow be the mission of a university.
UF remains a distinguished institution, though slipping in national rankings of public universities. It was No. 5 a couple of years ago but is now No. 7.
Still pretty good, especially given DeSantis’ obsessive attacks on higher education in the state.
But allowing some trifling X account to dictate policy at Florida’s flagship university won’t exactly burnish UF’s reputation.
All-purpose insult
Whoever the “Commies on Campus” may be, they weren’t paying attention in political science class.
They call anything they don’t like “communist:” LGBTQ, feminism, secularism, programs for the poor, addressing the climate crisis, taxing the rich, giving anyone without one of those useful White Man Cards a fair shot in life.
“Communist” is MAGA’s all-purpose insult.
Read a book, kids: While real live commies like the ones in North Korea, Cuba, or China may think religion is the opiate of the masses and rich folks (except the leaders of these countries) shouldn’t exist, they’re not keen on stuff like feminism, they persecute gay people, and they sure as hell don’t favor DEI.
Ask the Uighurs.
Yet DeSantis, a man educated beyond his intelligence, takes what these nameless chuckleheads say at face value.
There are in fact a number of well-regarded Marxist scholars at American universities. Yale, the governor’s alma mater, has a reading group studying Marxism and Cultural Theory.
Nevertheless, DeSantis emerged from the Red Menace of New Haven untainted.
He’s also unimpeded by understanding what universities are supposed to do.
An academic’s job is to research everything from the Roman Republic to astrophysics to Norse sagas to gene structure to the ideology of slavery to economic and political systems, which requires reading across the spectrum from “Das Kapital” to “The Road to Serfdom“ and presenting their data and knowledge to students.
We call this “education.”
It’s embarrassing how MAGAs deem Hungarian (or Putinist) authoritarianism OK, even admirable, while “communist” is the gravest of insults and socialism is a mortal sin.
Perhaps they’re unaware socialism is viewed favorably by around 36% of Americans.
That’s almost the same number who say they strongly support Donald Trump.
Ideas are not viruses
The point is, ideas are not viruses: Mere exposure to communist thought doesn’t turn you into a communist, any more than reading James Baldwin’s “Giovanni’s Room” makes you gay, any more than reading “The Wealth of Nations” ensures you’ll become a rabid capitalist.
But MAGAs don’t do high-level thinking: It makes their heads hurt. They simply react.
Loudly. Ignorantly. Irrationally.
Commies on Campus now has a new project: trying to influence who will become the new president of the University of Florida.
UF has announced a finalist.
 One finalist. Chosen in secret.
He is Dr. Santa Ono, a Canadian American immunologist.
The Commies say he’s some kind of woke monster who, as president of the University of Michigan, created “THE LARGEST #DEI EMPIRE in the country.”
Their evidence? Christopher Rufo, the febrile New College trustee last heard claiming immigrants were eating cats and dogs, calls Ono “left-wing” and points to a 2023 commencement address in which he made the unimpeachable statement, “The climate crisis is the existential challenge of our time.”
Florida gubernatorial candidate and Trump acolyte U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds, never losing a chance to ingratiate himself with MAGA voters, demands UF “go back to the drawing board.”
Donalds’ hair is on fire because Ono once said, “Racism is one of America’s original sins.”
Deep breath, people: 1. Both of Ono’s statements are perfectly true; and 2. Rufo, Donalds, and the Commies need to update their intel.
Ono has changed his tune. No longer a champion of diversity, he’s now singing from the DeSantis Hymnal, declaring himself in “total alignment” with the governor’s anti-woke crusade.
“I have the same views as this governor,” Ono said.
Bend the knee
During his three years at Michigan (the shortest tenure of any president in the university’s history), Ono initially won praise for prioritizing sustainability and anti-racist projects. Students say he was personable and accessible.
Then Trump happened, and, like too many university administrators, he bent the knee, shutting UM’s DEI office, cracking down on student protest, and creating, as one faculty member said, “a surveillance state.”
Seems he deployed plainclothes officers police to trail and photograph people on UM’s campus.
No wonder DeSantis likes this guy.
Santa is a real scholar, a proper scientist, with academic and administrative qualifications that could have been a great fit at UF. He’s streets ahead of DeSantis’ last hand-picked president, the empty, in-over-his-head Ben Sasse, whose one discernable talent was spending other people’s money.
In a Trump-free world, Ono might have become the leader who could protect the institution. He might have pushed back against the governor’s determination to reduce Florida’s universities to football factories with libraries curated by the likes of Christopher Rufo and courses insisting on the divine greatness of America.
Alas, Ono has made clear that’s not him, not anymore.
This is what you get when one incurious, anti-intellectual, and perpetually angry man chooses university presidents in secret.
This is what you get when there’s only one finalist.
Yes, the trustees officially make the job offer, but there’s no chance they’d hire someone DeSantis didn’t like.
This is the reality of higher ed in Florida today.
FIU has one finalist for president. No shock that it’s DeSantis’ former lieutenant governor and Interim President Jeannette Nuñez.
In its presidential search, FAU announced three finalists. Maybe this would be a real contest?
Two had Ph.Ds. and solid higher ed experience. One was a Republican political hack.
You can guess who got the gig.
A ‘plant’ at FAMU?
Florida A&M, still in the process of choosing a president, has four finalists.
Promising, right?
There were initially three on the shortlist, all with extensive university experience. Then a fourth candidate, a woman with ties to top Republicans, appeared.
She’s Marva Johnson, a communications company executive, appointed by then-Gov. Rick Scott to the Florida Board of Education and chosen by Ron DeSantis for the Florida Scholars Academy Board of Trustees.
Commies on Campus have not yet weighed in on this one.
FAMU alumni say she’d be a terrible choice, calling her “a plant” and likening her to a Trojan Horse hostile to the university’s mission.
But what the alumni want, and what the university wants, probably won’t matter.
What DeSantis wants matters.
As everyone in the unfree state of Florida knows, all animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.

Acting U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey Alina Habba recently introduced the “election integrity task force,” a team of federal prosecutors dedicated to enforcing President Trump’s sweeping and unlawful executive order on elections.
Notably, a federal district court has already temporarily blocked key aspects of the executive order, including a provision intended to require voters to show a passport or other citizenship documentation to register to vote in federal elections.
Other components of the executive order, which are also the subject of ongoing legal challenges, would give Elon Musk’s DOGE and the Department of Homeland Security full access to voter files and sensitive voter list maintenance records from every state; penalize states, like New Jersey, that count valid and timely-cast mail-in ballots received after Election Day; decertify voting machines across the country; and more.  Through this executive order, President Trump seeks to seize control of the country’s election infrastructure, usurping the powers of Congress, the states, and the Election Assistance Commission – an independent, bipartisan federal agency.
Like the executive order, the task force is not aimed at a real problem, and instead is premised on false, nativist, and thoroughly discredited narratives about fraudulent voting.
New Jersey elections are fair and secure, and extensive research shows that voter fraud is exceptionally rare. Instead of committing itself to the critical task of protecting the right to vote, the task force trades on the myth of fraud to stoke fear and prejudice while establishing a pretext for voter suppression.
In addition to purportedly addressing phantom issues like registration fraud, non-citizen voting, and double voting, the task force claims to promote “information sharing” to “remove individuals who are not eligible to vote from State voter lists.” This proposal raises serious privacy concerns and threatens aggressive voter purges, which often rely on outdated and unreliable information and ultimately disenfranchise eligible voters.
State and federal laws and the Constitution place firm limits on who can make the types of election administration changes President Trump’s executive order seeks to enact, as well as when and how. The ACLU-NJ and our partners are ready to enforce these protections and to defend the right to vote against new attacks, including from the Trump Administration and the task force.
We will also keep working to advance policies, like the New Jersey Voter Empowerment Act, that provide essential tools for eradicating discrimination in voting. This bill would restore and modernize the protections of the federal Voting Rights Act, which have been steadily eroded in recent decades.
The right to vote is the foundation on which all our other rights and liberties rest. Whether bluster or blueprint, the task force is a threat to our democracy. The ACLU-NJ will continue to fight for voters whatever comes our way.

While state workers and the judge discussed, rapid fire, the fate of her family, she prepared to make her case.
She completed the parenting course the state required, and enrolled in more classes — on topics ranging from healthy relationships to helping kids through divorce — which she thought would show initiative. She gathered character references from professionals who had worked closely with her family for years. She continued seeing a therapist and psychiatrist who helped her recover from postpartum depression.
Staff from the state child welfare agency and juvenile office wanted her to go to a different therapist of their choosing but had not provided her with a referral. 
Now, she was ready to explain the situation to the judge, with a thick folder of documentation to back up her account. She raised her hand. 
But the judge told her the docket was full and the hearing wasn’t the correct type for presenting new evidence, using legal terms that were unfamiliar to Knight. The judge heard only the state’s position — that Knight hadn’t completed her services as required — and sided with what the state workers had proposed, leaving the kids in foster care, before moving on to the next case.
Knight left court deflated and confused. 
It was August 2024, and Knight was without an attorney as she fought to reunite with her children — as she would be for months.
“I can’t tell you how nerve-wracking it is, that you have nobody on your side,” she said.
Missouri’s system for providing legal representation to families ensnared in the foster care system is highly decentralized, relying on county-level funding and operating with little state oversight, a months-long investigation by The Independent found. 
The result: some parents, like Knight, go without representation, while those who do get assigned an attorney often find them too overworked and underpaid to provide meaningful advocacy.
Knight’s three oldest children were taken from her in April 2023 on allegations of physical abuse, emotional abuse and neglect that Missouri’s child welfare agency, called Children’s Division, later found to be unsubstantiated. The following year she gave birth to another child, who was removed on an allegation of sexual abuse, which was also found to be unsubstantiated.
For years, she has worked with children. And in a development Knight finds confounding, last fall she passed an extensive background check run through the Department of Social Services — which oversees Children’s Division — allowing her to work with foster children at a residential care facility. 
“I’m good enough to work with other people’s kids, other foster kids within the court system who are a ward of the state,” she said, “but I’m not allowed to have my own.”
Knight’s case has dragged on, and she fears that the longer her kids remain in state custody, the lower their chances of reunification become. 
“I don’t have anybody on my side,” she said. “I’m literally just left alone to basically fend for myself, which is impossible when it comes to these kinds of cases.” 
The attorney initially appointed by the court to represent Knight withdrew and her subsequent request for a replacement was denied by the court. In September, she picked up a second job to hire an attorney, who she has so far paid over $6,000. She works overtime whenever she can. She’s not sure how much longer she’ll be able to afford to keep paying him, at $375 an hour.

The U.S. Constitution guarantees the right to representation for those facing criminal charges. But there is no such federal right in civil court, where foster care cases unfold. The consequences — family separation — can feel as severe as incarceration.
The outcome can depend on where you live, even within a state. 
In some Missouri counties, more than 80% of foster care cases involving a biological parent list no attorney for the parent, while in other counties, that rate is under 10%. That’s according to data produced by the Office of State Courts Administrator — which provides administrative, business and technology support to Missouri courts — in response to a request from The Independent. 
State law grants judges in Missouri more discretion than in most other states when deciding whether to appoint counsel for indigent parents. Once appointed, quality and pay vary widely. 
A survey of Missouri’s 46 judicial circuits by The Independent shows some counties pay parents’ attorneys as little as $25 per hearing, and some attorneys carry hundreds of cases at a time. Attorneys told The Independent in some counties parent representation is considered pro bono work because the pay is so low. 
There is no required specialized training in the state to be a parents’ attorney, though there is required training for similar positions, such as guardians ad litem — attorneys tasked with representing foster kids’ best interests. There are no state Supreme Court-adopted standards of practice. Parents’ attorneys in most counties in the state are solo practitioners who agree to take on some of these cases in addition to the rest of their caseload. They don’t always have expertise in this complex area of law. 
No counties had, as of last month, spent federal funding that has been available for parent representation since 2019, a spokesperson for the Department of Social Services told The Independent — and just one county is in the process of doing so.
Courts reached by The Independent all said it’s routine to appoint an attorney for indigent parents, when requested. Parents who spoke to The Independent about their struggles navigating the process, and advocates who work with them, said it isn’t always so straightforward. 
Some parents said they didn’t know they could qualify, were rejected even though they were too poor to afford a lawyer out-of-pocket, or received representation only for the initial part of their case. Others said they were appointed attorneys who were impossible to reach outside of court and didn’t seem to be advocating for them.
“Each individual county and circuit gets to do it however they want,” said Claire Terrebonne, who was a parents’ attorney in Kansas City for over a decade, and has pushed for systemic reform in the state. “It was really when I looked outward that I became so shocked about how we do things here.” 
Allison Green, chief legal officer for the National Association of Counsel for Children, which advocates for robust family defense, said access to quality counsel for parents and kids is “absolutely critical” for a healthy and functional child welfare system.
“A common misconception is that foster care is only a social service discipline,” she said, “when actually foster care implicates the civil rights of children and parents and families.”
The system should function, Green said, to make sure that families “are only separated when it’s absolutely necessary to do so, and that they are provided the services that federal and state law requires in order to reunify them.” 
Several states in recent years, including Oklahoma, have moved toward centralized systems of family representation, similar to statewide public defender offices, to ensure consistent, high-quality representation that is uniformly funded. 
This issue has gotten scant attention from the Missouri Legislature, though this year one section of a wide-ranging foster care bill takes steps toward understanding the system, by establishing a commission to study parents’ and children’s legal representation throughout the state, and directing the commission to recommend practice standards and training requirements. That bill passed — close to none of the discussion during hearings dealt with parents’ representation — and awaits Gov. Mike Kehoe’s signature.
Clark Peters, a professor of social work at the University of Missouri-Columbia whose research specializes in foster care, said the stakes of high-quality parent counsel are enormous.
“We sometimes lose sight: a day without your child is tremendously difficult for parents and for children,” he said. “To go months?  I mean, it’s kind of unthinkable…We’re talking about child well-being and family integrity. What is more important than that?” 
 ‘By yourself, it’s impossible’ 

 Amanda Garretson’s wall is decorated with art created by her younger daughter, who was in Children’s Division custody for over a year (Clara Bates/Missouri Independent).
States vary widely in how they organize their systems of family defense and the rights afforded to accused parents, as there is no federal right to an attorney for parents in child welfare proceedings. Most states have a statutory right to counsel. Missouri is among a few that has a statutory right with discretion, meaning judges can decide on a case-by-case basis. They must determine that appointment is necessary for a “full and fair hearing,” as well as determine that the parent desires counsel and is indigent. 
There’s little consistency in how judges determine whether a parent can afford an attorney on their own, or whether they need one. 
If a case reaches the termination of parental rights stage, state law requires a lawyer be provided, and the state, rather than county, pays for it. But by that point, advocates say, it can be too late: If the parent hasn’t been zealously represented all along, with a lawyer doing things like helping document all the efforts they’ve taken to reunify, and connecting them to resources, they won’t have a strong defense. 
Federal law says that if the child has been in foster care for 15 out of the most recent 22 months, the state generally should file a petition to terminate parental rights. 
Kathleen DuBois, who represented parents for over two decades as an attorney with the legal aid organization in St. Louis, said the threat of termination of parental rights means an attorney should be appointed at the outset and the state should foot the bill.
“To me, the case is a termination from the time that the child is taken,” she said. “So you should treat it as a termination of rights from the very beginning and pay for counsel for the parent from the very beginning without putting all these conditions on it.” 
DuBois remembers a client who had previously been represented by a court-appointed attorney with so many cases that he had no idea who the client even was.
“That’s pretty shameless to tell somebody that you can’t even figure out who they are,” she said. “…But people are acting like this is just an ordinary process, and it’s not. It’s the civil death penalty.”
DuBois said as an attorney, she would help parents connect to necessary services, some of which Children’s Division may not have known about, and explain to her clients the importance of complying. Parents’ attorneys help translate the parents’ efforts to the court and the court’s requirements to parents; they also help explain and protect parents’ rights, and advocate for the placement and visitation wishes of the parent.
A statewide, uniform infrastructure with robust defense, she said, “would certainly get better justice.” 
 Amanda Garretson plays at home with her 3-year-old in Springfield (Clara Bates/Missouri Independent).
Amanda Garretson, a mother of two daughters in Springfield who has grappled with addiction, homelessness and mental illness, experienced the difference having an attorney can make. 
Her older daughter was taken into state custody in late 2019, after Garretson attempted suicide.
“I wasn’t harming my child. I was there because I was depressed,” she said. 
She assumed because she couldn’t afford an attorney, she wouldn’t get one, and doesn’t remember ever being told otherwise. Garretson missed the first court hearing, but at meetings thereafter, she doesn’t remember anyone on her support team, including caseworkers, ever telling her she would qualify or what the role of a lawyer would be in these complex arrangements. She felt overwhelmed by all the new phrases — from family support team meeting, to jurisdictional hearing and shelter hearing — and “scared to death” with no one to explain them.
She said she felt the state workers were treating her as “guilty until proven innocent.”
She knew she needed counseling and that with the right support she could recover. Instead, she said the process of trying to get her daughter back, and a sense no one was fighting for her, caused her to “fall hard into addiction” and become homeless.
In 2021, her daughter was adopted and Garretson’s parental rights were involuntarily terminated. Garretson still hopes one day to reunite with her.
“I didn’t have anyone on my side, and I just, I didn’t know what was going on,” she said. “I didn’t know the procedures. They’re like, ‘Well, you should have researched it.’ When you’re that far into a trauma mode, you’re grieving your child like they’re dead.” 
“I know 100% that it would have been a whole lot different if I had any ounce of support on my side,” she said.
She contrasts that experience with the case of her younger daughter, who was born in 2021. Her daughter was taken into Children’s Division custody for over a year on allegations of drug use that Garretson denied, after they were in a car accident.
That time, Garretson was given a court-appointed attorney who helped explain what was happening, and she said fought hard for her. Still, as the case stretched on, she decided to pay $2,500 she scraped together for a private lawyer. She thought the judge would take her more seriously and close the case more quickly, and she worried if the Children’s Division case stayed open, it would affect a separate, family court case.
Her Children’s Division case was finally closed earlier this year and she has her younger daughter back.
“By yourself,” she said, “it’s impossible.” 
Families in poverty are more likely to have their kids taken into foster care; they’re also least likely to be able to afford to pay high-quality attorneys out-of-pocket.
“What happens if your children were with strangers for months? And what would you do? Of course, you would hire an attorney,” said Peters, the University of Missouri professor. “And the fact is that poor litigants, residents of Missouri who can’t afford it, they should get those. Not just a warm body, but somebody who’s going to fight to make sure that their child and that family gets to the other side of this legal matter in the best shape they can.”
 A high rate of removal, lingering in the foster care system

Missouri has long taken kids into foster care at a rate higher than average and kept them there for more time. 
There were 11,085 kids in foster care as of March, down from a peak of 14,265 kids in 2021. The entry rate is still higher than the national average.
Only 44% of Missouri foster children were reunited with their families within a year of entering state care, according to the most recent data in the agency’s budget, covering fiscal year 2024. 
The federal benchmark is 75%.
Baylee Watts, spokesperson for the Department of Social Services, wrote by email that the agency “is committed, and all team members are expected, to actively support reunification efforts when safe and appropriate, in alignment with both statutory mandates and best practices in child welfare.”
Studies show high-quality representation for families improves the speed of kids going home with no evidence of an increased rate of maltreatment or reentry into foster care. There are also potential cost savings.
Advocates say robust legal representation could allow the state Children’s Division to devote its limited resources to the most severe cases.
Richard Wexler, director of the advocacy group National Coalition for Child Welfare Reform, said there is a “deep contempt for families” in the system by those who assume horror stories about child abuse are the norm, which is “nothing like what most of these families are like.”
Over half of substantiated cases in Missouri involve neglect, a category often conflated with conditions of poverty, including housing instability and lack of supervision due to an absence of child care.
“The fact that some families are literally defenseless is a travesty. They are facing consequences vastly more serious than many criminal offenses when they have a constitutional right to a lawyer,” Wexler said.
 System for lawyers varies by county

 Daniel Kuehnel outside his home in Arnold in February (Clara Bates/Missouri Independent).
Daniel Kuehnel, a father in Arnold whose two kids were taken into foster care in 2022, said he had no idea he could have qualified for a free lawyer. He was accused of physical abuse and emotional abuse, which he denied, amid a contentious divorce and custody battle. Earlier this year, Children’s Division closed the case and he has full custody of his son. He sees his daughter, who lives with a relative, each weekend.
He didn’t attend the first court date — an emergency placement hearing — because he was “freaking out all night,” terrified, he said, after finding out the state had removed his kids the afternoon prior. He had left the house to pick up his son from his bus and run into two police officers and two investigators, he said, and found it impossible to prepare for court less than 24 hours later.
He would likely have qualified for a court-appointed lawyer as indigent because he was receiving food assistance through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. He was working in maintenance at the time and is now living on veterans’ disability payments.
“I didn’t know a lot of this stuff,” he said. “Nobody informed me of nothing.”
For the first month, he didn’t have an attorney and felt “hopeless.” 
His now-spouse, whom he met a few months after the case opened, was willing to lend him money to pay for an attorney, which Kuehnel said made all the difference in his case. 
He ultimately paid around $40,000 to three attorneys, trying to keep his family together.

His final attorney really fought for him, he said. The state closed his case earlier this year.
“In the system, it’s about money,” he said, “and if you got the money, that case is going to get handled.” 
In Jefferson County, where Kuehnel lives, there was no attorney listed for parents in 46% of foster care cases from 2020 to 2024, according to data the Office of State Courts Administrator produced in response to a records request from The Independent. 
Jefferson County’s juvenile office didn’t respond to several requests for comment. But court officials in other counties told The Independent there could be a variety of reasons for parents not having an attorney listed, ranging from the parent not wanting one because they don’t trust the system to a parent not engaging in the process at all. 
The issue of parents lacking counsel appears to be a problem throughout the state to varying degrees. In Christian and Greene counties, where Knight and Garretson live, state court data shows just single-digit rates of parents going without attorneys. The chief juvenile officer for Greene County, Bill Prince, said the court “makes every effort” to provide eligible parents with attorneys, including by offering the application for counsel as soon as the court makes contact with the parent, and inquiring about the issue at each hearing in which the parent appears without counsel.
The presiding judge of Christian County, Laura Johnson, wrote in an email to The Independent that it’s “highly unusual” for parents to proceed without an attorney. She said generally speaking that it’s unusual for a court-appointed attorney to withdraw and when it happens, it’s most often because the parent chose to end that relationship.
“If a parent chooses to ‘fire’ a court-appointed attorney, the court usually does not appoint another attorney for that parent,” Johnson wrote, but if the attorney withdraws for a reason “not within the parent’s control…then another attorney will be appointed.”
Knight, the mother who is trying to reunite with her children in Christian County, insisted she didn’t fire her attorney, though she said their relationship was strained because the two disagreed over whether Knight should have her providers and advocates come to the monthly case management meetings. Court records show the attorney filed a motion to withdraw from Knight’s case in July 2024, citing an “irreparable breakdown” of the attorney-client relationship.
 ‘No matter how hard I try’

Knight said as the state continues to keep her kids in care, it’s the kids who suffer the consequences. She wishes earlier in her case, she could have conveyed to the judge all she’d wanted to — if she’d had a zealous court-appointed advocate.
Her four-year-old daughter has been moved seven times since she was taken into foster care in April 2022. Knight said she’s developed behavioral issues Knight attributes to the trauma of separation and being tossed around from home to home.
“When I was able to see her, she would always beg the caseworker, ‘Please, let me go home to my mom,’” she said.
Now, her daughter is in care with a foster family and Knight doesn’t know where in Missouri they are or who the family is. Two of her kids are in another stranger’s home. 
She’s losing sleep over her absent children and her hair is falling out. 
Johnson, the Christian County presiding judge, wrote in an email that she cannot comment on pending cases. But the reason cases would remain open, generally, after Children’s Division finds child abuse or neglect allegations to be unsubstantiated, is because the juvenile courts have an “independent statutory duty” to find a safe, nurturing and permanent placement for a child removed from their home, which requires hearings and sometimes treatment plans, she said. The juvenile court cannot return the child to their home until all statutory requirements are met, Johnson said.
The Department of Social Services can’t comment on specific cases, said Watts, the agency’s spokesperson. She said that although an investigation may conclude as unsubstantiated, “and a person deemed eligible for employment, that does not resolve or override the juvenile court proceeding, the outcome of which is ultimately determined by the juvenile court judge.” She added that sometimes additional concerns come to light after the investigation of the initial allegations, so the absence of substantiated findings “may not alleviate all of the concerns present in the foster care case.”
Knight requested a copy of her case file from the Department of Social Services last July, and still has not received it — which the agency in a message to Knight attributed to a backlog of requests.
Knight says the state continues portraying her as mentally unstable, though therapy notes and records from private social services groups Knight has worked with — the notes she wanted to convey to the judge that day last summer — provide a different picture. 
 Knight’s children play together in 2022, the year before they were taken into foster care (photo submitted).
Her therapist last year wrote that Knight “has immense love for her kids and this is the reason she has fought this hard in this case.” Knight’s behavior leading up to when her kids were taken — which involved yelling at her baby and telling her parents she wanted to die —  was consistent with postpartum depression, she wrote.
The therapist said she was worried about “long-term trauma…for not only Megan but her children.” She recommended that reunification be the goal “due to mental health concerns being a primary cause of children’s removal, and current mental health of the client being observed as stable and appropriate for life circumstances.” 
A parent advocate from a nonprofit last year wrote to the court that despite “all of Megan’s efforts and her willingness to be transparent with the team, seek any services requested and show growth in setting healthy boundaries in her relationships,” her efforts to get her kids back continued to stall, and the state workers seemed intent on pursuing termination of her rights.
The Office of Child Advocate, the independent oversight arm for the Children’s Division, investigated Knight’s case and found “policy and procedure concerns” it conveyed to Children’s Division including the state workers’ “derogatory” comments about the family, according to a findings’ letter sent to Knight in January 2024.
“It would be best practice for all team members to be supportive of reunification,” the agency, which investigates complaints against the child welfare system, wrote. The agency added that it was “unclear what services or accommodations were being provided” to Knight to help with her documented mental health diagnoses including depression and anxiety.
A social worker through a nonprofit wrote in a report to the court last year that Knight will “continue to parent effectively, with ongoing mental health support following case closure.” 
Knight said those sources have been discounted in her case, even after her current lawyer was finally allowed to introduce them. She worries the case is too far gone.
While she attended therapy throughout most of the process, the state is requiring her to work with a therapist of their choosing. Knight has waited nine months to be assigned a state-approved therapist, and her caseworker told her in a text last month that they are still looking.
Watts, the spokesperson, said the Department of Social Services “acknowledges that in some areas, finding service providers who accept state-approved rates can be difficult, potentially delaying reunification efforts even when a parent is compliant and motivated,” and that Children’s Division “strives to find appropriate services for parents” including by looking beyond the local area or using remote services.
In February, Knight found out she is pregnant. When she told her caseworker, she said she was told the baby would likely be removed, too, due to her open case. 
“I’m just lost beyond words, really. It’s like, no matter what I do, no matter how hard I try, no matter how honest I am, it just gets thrown in my face,” Knight said. 
“Never in my life did I think I would be in this situation.”

School-based health services nationwide are partially funded through Medicaid, and some advocates worry about potential cuts. (Photo by Jon Cherry/Getty Images)Even as Republicans in Congress walk back their most aggressive proposal to slash federal Medicaid spending, they are weighing other options that could force states to cut services for children and other vulnerable populations.
U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters last week that his caucus won’t reduce the 90% federal funding match that states get to cover working-age adults who became eligible for Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. However, the GOP is still considering capping federal spending by setting a fixed amount for how much states receive for every Medicaid enrollee.
That move would fundamentally change the nature of the program, which has been an open-ended entitlement since its passage 60 years ago.
Another Republican congressional proposal would limit states’ ability to increase Medicaid payments to doctors and hospitals by using tax revenue they collect from health care providers. States draw down additional federal dollars by utilizing the strategy, and the extra money helps many hospitals stay afloat.
Any federal cuts to Medicaid — large or small — would strain state budgets and likely lead to service cuts and coverage for fewer people, according to a new analysis released last week by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
The agency predicted that to make up for lost federal dollars, states would have to reduce payments to health care providers, curb benefits or reduce enrollment. Some advocates also suggest that states might seek savings in other areas of their budgets, such as K-12 education.
Child health advocates say any of those actions would have a significant trickle-down effect on children and their caregivers. They’re concerned states would have to reduce or even eliminate services that help tens of millions of children access routine care that’s critical from birth, such as vaccinations and physical exams.
Half of U.S. kids
About half of the nation’s 72.8 million children are covered by Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, known as CHIP, another joint federal-state program that covers children from families who earn too much to qualify for traditional Medicaid.
“I think what is missing from some of these debates is [Medicaid] is not only the primary payer for children’s health, it’s also supporting the safety net for children’s health, by paying for hospitals, clinics, physicians and offices,” said Heather Howard, a former New Jersey health commissioner who is now a faculty affiliate with the Center for Health and Wellbeing at Princeton University.
“It’ll mean that hospitals will close in rural areas, but even in urban areas, we’re going to see, as hospitals see their funding cut, they’re going to have to pull back on services,” Howard added. “And that clearly is going to impact kids.”
Mississippi pediatrician Dr. John Gaudet said the importance of Medicaid for children begins at birth; Medicaid covered 41% of all U.S. births in 2021. The program also covers a benefit package called Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment, which covers an array of critical services meant to take care of childhood mental and physical health, such as dental and vision care, vaccinations, lab tests and physical exams.
The program serves children struggling with severe emotional distress, as well as physical disabilities. Medicaid pays for long-term and home-based care services.
Gaudet says he’s afraid that a variety of child-related services could be affected by federal Medicaid cuts.
“As a pediatrician, I’m very concerned about prevention and wellness, because that’s going to give you more return on your investment in the long run, if you can prevent an illness rather than wait until it gets more severe and then you’re having to treat it,” Gaudet said in an interview.
School health services
Medicaid cuts also could affect the health services offered in schools.
Between $4 billion and $6 billion in annual Medicaid spending helps pay for school-based health services, including routine health screenings, preventive care, mental health care and physical, speech and occupational therapies.
Children from underserved communities disproportionately rely on school-based health services, according to Abuko Estrada, vice president of Medicaid and child health policy at First Focus on Children, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit group.
“We’re not only talking about things like higher emergency room utilization for kids or increased hospitalizations for preventable conditions,” Estrada said in an interview. “We’re also talking about lost educational opportunities, potentially reduced future earnings in adulthood, and perpetuating cycles of poor health that ultimately cost the nation far more than it would potentially save.”










As hospitals see their funding cut, they're going to have to pull back on services. And that clearly is going to impact kids.

But Brian Blase, president of the Paragon Health Institute, a conservative policy group that is working with Republicans to imagine Medicaid cuts, wrote in an email to Stateline that the ideas circulating on Capitol Hill wouldn’t harm children at all. Rather, he said, the proposed cuts would shift the funding focus away from working-age adults toward children and more vulnerable populations.
“In my view, it is a moral imperative for Congress to protect the program for the truly vulnerable and end Washington’s discrimination in favor of non-disabled, working-age, childless adults,” wrote Blase, who was a health care adviser to President Donald Trump during his first term.
Chris Pope, a senior fellow at the conservative-leaning policy group the Manhattan Institute, said he doesn’t think Republicans in Congress will be able to cut much from Medicaid.
Republicans couldn’t get the votes to make major changes when they tried in 2017, Pope noted, and they have even fewer votes this year. “Unless they can get every Republican to sign off on cuts,” he said, “it’s just not going to happen.”
Republicans in Congress are trying to find roughly $2 trillion in savings to offset the cost of extending tax cuts enacted during the first Trump administration and to make additional tax cuts. The U.S. House committee that oversees Medicaid is supposed to come up with $880 billion of that total.
Despite Johnson’s assertion that reducing the federal Medicaid match for working-age adults is off the table, some fiscal hawks in his own party aren’t ready to give up the idea, which would save more money than any other proposal.
“It’s necessary to stop robbing from the vulnerable to fund the able-bodied,” U.S. Rep. Chip Roy of Texas wrote on X shortly after Johnson’s comments were reported.
In a May 7 letter to House Republican leaders, 32 GOP representatives vowed to find $2 trillion in cuts, calling the House budget framework “a floor for savings, not a ceiling. We must hold that line on fiscal discipline to put the country back on a sustainable path,” the letter said.

And the Senate — thanks to Republican infighting — has failed to reach the finish line three years in a row.  But this year the GOP supermajority is finally getting along. […],"Senate President Pro Tem Cindy O'Laughlin, a Republican Shelbina, talks with reporters May 2024 (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Will the Missouri Senate actually make it to 6 p.m. Friday? 
That’s the constitutional deadline for the legislative session to adjourn for the year. And the Senate — thanks to Republican infighting — has failed to reach the finish line three years in a row. 
But this year the GOP supermajority is finally getting along. And as lawmakers enter the final week of the 2025 legislative session, Senate Republicans hope that unity will allow them to roll back abortion rights and a new paid sick leave law over the vehement resistance of Democrats. 
Whether or not the session goes off the rails again this year — and kills a litany of largely bipartisan bills in the process — will largely be determined by whether Republicans and Democrats can strike a deal on two issues that touch on key ideological differences. .
“My philosophy has always been, if you just sit down together, you can figure it out,” said Senate President Pro Tem Cindy O’Laughlin, a Shelbina Republican. “So that’s what I’m doing. I have a really good relationship with the Democrats, and everyone is negotiating in good faith.”
If those negotiations fall apart, the GOP could turn to the nuclear option. 
Republicans hold 24 seats in the 34-member Senate. It takes only a simple majority of 18 votes to end a filibuster using a procedural maneuver known as “calling the previous question,” or PQ. 
But Senate leaders have historically been hesitant to utilize the PQ because it generates lasting bitterness — and sparks retaliation. If past is prologue, Democrats would respond by turning to procedural maneuvers of their own to grind the chamber to a halt and make any progress all but impossible.  
That scenario would also kill any bills still pending in the Senate with the bad blood and gridlock generated possibly spilling into the next legislative session. 
That’s why since 1970, the Senate has only used PQ 18 times. The last time was in 2020. 
“The last thing either side wants is a PQ,” said Senate Minority Leader Doug Beck, an Affton Democrat. 
In November, both issues at the heart of the Senate’s final week won approval on the statewide ballot. 
Proposition A, which won 58% of the vote, mandated employers with business receipts greater than $500,000 a year to provide at least one hour of paid leave for every 30 hours worked. Employers with fewer than 15 workers must allow workers to earn at least 40 hours per year, with larger employers mandated to allow at least 56 hours.
That law went into effect May 1. 
Amendment 3, which won with 52% of the vote, legalized abortion up until the point of fetal viability — generally seen as the point at which a fetus can survive outside the womb on its own, or around 24 weeks. It also protects access to other reproductive health care, like birth control.
Since it passed, a judge blocked a litany of Missouri abortion regulations, opening the door for access to the procedure for the first time in years. 
Senate negotiations on both issues have persisted for weeks. And despite some public discord, both sides enter the waning days before adjournment confident a deal can be reached. 
“I know that there’s a lot of ideology going around and lots of things being thrown at each other, but actually the vast majority of people are somewhere in the middle,” O’Laughlin said. “And if you listen to everyone in their perspective, you can figure it out.”
 Missouri House Speaker Jon Patterson discusses the final weeks of the 2025 legislative session (Rudi Keller/Missouri House).
While the possibility of a PQ is the biggest minefield lawmakers are trying to navigate in the final week, disharmony between the House and Senate could also prove explosive. 
On Friday, lawmakers completed work on the state’s $53 billion budget. But in a stunning move, the House refused to allow a vote on a $530 million construction package approved by the Senate earlier in the day. 
Senate leaders were not told of the House’s decision in advance, and the move sparked outrage and accusations of betrayal. 
“The phone calls I’ve been receiving from my Senate counterparts do not lead me to believe that next week is going to be productive if you have a House bill in the Senate,” Senate Appropriations Chairman Lincoln Hough, a Springfield Republican, told the Kansas City Star soon after the House vote on Friday.  
House Speaker Jon Patterson, a Lee’s Summit Republican, downplayed the possibility of the move causing friction between the two chambers in the final week, telling reporters that he doesn’t expect the Senate to upend a session that has been marked by GOP unity. 
“I have nothing but great things to say about how the Senate has been working this year,” he said. “I think they’ll continue to work like that.”
His Democratic colleagues aren’t convinced Patterson’s prediction will prove accurate. 
House Minority Leader Ashley Aune, a Kansas City Democrat, said she would not be surprised to see “an even greater battle emerge between the chambers in the last few days of session over this particular situation.”
Another possible stumbling block: with only five days left before adjournment, the governor’s office and House leaders are pondering a push to provide $300 million in state funding to help build a new baseball stadium in Clay County. 
The aim is to keep the Kansas City Royals from moving across the state line, where Kansas lawmakers created an incentive packaging to convince the team to leave Missouri when the lease on its current stadium expires in 2030. 
But the plan has never been presented as a formal bill and never had a public hearing or debate — a reality that could cause real problems in the Senate, where any resistance could prove fatal.  
State Sen. Joe Nicola, an Independence Republican whose district includes the Royal’s current stadium in Jackson County, said he would have serious concerns about any plan that would move the team to another county. 
But Nicola hasn’t been consulted on the stadium funding plan percolating in the House, so he didn’t want to comment until he had a chance to study it closely.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/051724_olaughlin1-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-05-12 07:05:10.087379

Stand up, fight back"" (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Debate about abortion is often divorced from reality. But I was still stunned by the stream of elaborate and hurtful lies from Missouri lawmakers at the recent hearing on the bill to overturn Amendment 3.
House Joint Resolution 73 is an attempt to reinstate the abortion ban that Missouri voters rejected when we passed Amendment 3.
The bill itself, which would put the legality of abortion back on the ballot, is written to be as misleading as possible. For example, it contains a ballot summary that doesn’t tell voters that it would put the ban back in effect. It instead asks voters if they want to protect treatment for miscarriages and ectopic pregnancies.
But the hearing was amazing for the way Republican legislators openly infantilized and lied about Missouri voters, women and doctors.
The bill sponsor, Republican state Rep. Brian Seitz of Branson, opened with testimony tightly packed with falsehoods and paternalism: “The preeminent facet of this legislation is that it protects women. What Amendment 3 took away from them, this legislation seeks to restore.”
The implication is that I, like all women, need to be protected from my choices about my family, life and health care. I also need to be protected from the vote that I cast in November to take away the state’s authority to make those decisions for me. This is because I, like the majority of Missouri voters, lack the intelligence to have understood what I was voting for on a widely and fiercely debated issue.
This theme of “protecting” women is also about justifying medically inappropriate abortion regulations. These regulations are sold as health protections but are actually intended to be impossible to comply with, so that abortion clinics can’t operate. These are “targeted regulation of abortion providers,” or “TRAP” laws.
Amendment 3 forecloses that backdoor ban strategy by putting the burden on the state to prove that a regulation actually has a health benefit. Amendment 3 also bars discrimination against abortion care. It’s easy to tell when a law discriminates against abortion care by looking at whether the same regulations apply to miscarriage care, because abortion involves the same procedures and medications.
Seitz went on to make the particularly fanciful claim that “this legislation seeks to align itself with the will of the voter” because “the people expressed that they wanted exceptions.”
We did not express that we wanted exceptions. Amendment 3 had nothing to do with and no mention of exceptions. 
What voters said is that we don’t want abortion to be banned in Missouri anymore. 
The claim that what voters really wanted was for abortion to continue to be banned but with exceptions for those victims of rape and incest who can jump through all the hoops our anti-exceptions legislature has in store for them is a fantastical lie. 
“Incest” refers to a child raped and impregnanted by a family member. 
Even House Speaker Jon Patterson of Lee’s Summit (who is a doctor and was the lone Republican to vote against the bill) acknowledged that a child who is being sexually abused is not likely to realize she is pregnant by the 12 week cut off for the victim exception in HJR 73. And if this child does realize what is happening to her before 12 weeks, how is she supposed to end her pregnancy if there are no functioning abortion clinics in this state?
The hearing devolved into legislators interrogating testifying pastors about when life begins and berating doctors who testified that their patients were harmed under the ban.
State Sen. Rick Brattin, a Republican from Harrisonville, responded vehemently to a doctor recounting how the ban had caused harm to her miscarrying patients, including one who bled for four weeks after being denied a procedure to evacuate her uterus. 
Brattin, like lawmakers across the country, blamed doctors for not understanding the law.
“Negligence of the law is no excuse” he said repeatedly. I’m pretty sure what he meant to say is “ignorance of the law is no excuse,” which he illustrated with the classic example that not knowing the speed limit is not an excuse for speeding.
But I think Brattin hit on an accidental insight with “negligence of the law is no excuse.” 
Lawmakers need to own the outcomes of the laws they pass.
Doctors provide care based on what their lawyers say they can or cannot do. As ProPublica has documented in Texas, many hospital lawyers are telling doctors they can’t provide miscarriage care until the patient shows signs of infection or other life threatening complications when fetal heart tones can still be detected. 
Others are providing no guidance or legal support at all, leaving doctors to navigate the risk of criminal prosecution unaided. ProPublica has reported on the deaths of five women denied abortion care. Another 20 women who survived have sued Texas.
Missouri’s medical emergency “exception” language in both the now enjoined ban and HJR 73 is nearly identical to Texas’ — but worse. 
It required not just that a patient be at “a serious risk of substantial impairment of a major bodily function,” but that the impairment be “substantial and irreversible.” And the exception wasn’t actually an exception. It was a defense to the crime of providing any abortion that the doctor would have the burden of proving at trial. 
Missouri has fewer reported stories than Texas of women injured because we are a small state that borders states where abortion is legal. But we know it happened here, too. 
When Mylissa Farmer was miscarrying she was sent to a Kansas hospital three hours away for treatment. She was turned away in Kansas where abortion is legal but heavily restricted. When she was finally able to get an abortion in Illinois, she was in excruciating pain and had an infection. 
The rate of sepsis among pregnant women, which can be fatal, has increased by 50% since Texas banned abortion. There’s no reason to think women here weren’t similarly endangered when Missouri’s ban was in effect.
And yet, Brattin yelled that the ban’s emergency exception had been perfectly clear. It wasn’t the law but doctors’ ignorance of it that caused women who had lost their babies to bleed for weeks. 
Let’s accept, for the sake of argument, that lawmakers didn’t intend to imperil pregnant women. Intent doesn’t matter. As Brattin put it: “negligence of the law is no excuse.” 
And at this point, it’s not negligence but deliberate indifference, given that injuries have been widely reported and a doctor told Brattin to his face that she had treated patients who were denied miscarriage care. The harm is known, but he and his fellow Republicans do not care. 
Miscarrying women are justifiable collateral damage in their attack on the main target: women and girls who do not want to continue their pregnancies. They want the opposite of safer abortion. They want to reinstate the ban so that we have to have later, more complicated or invasive procedures after traveling out of state, or to self manage with abortion medication from the internet without local medical supervision. 
They want anyone who needs an abortion to suffer as much as possible.
It’s not protection, it’s punishment.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/041525_protest3-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-05-12 07:05:10.087379

For the more than 850,000 Indiana children who are infants through 9 years old, only 763 licensed child care centers exist to take care of them when their parents cannot. Because of this, a CNBC study ranked Indiana almost at the bottom for quality of life, with the worst access to child care in the country.
At the beginning of the 2025 legislative session, Indiana Senate Democrats prioritized child care in their agenda, writing that they hoped to fully fund the Child Care Development Fund (CCDF), a child care subsidy for low-income families. But with the session ending April 24, their goal did not come to fruition in the supermajority Republican General Assembly.
  Vanessa Green Sinders, president and CEO of the Indiana Chamber.
A 2024 study by the Indiana Chamber of Commerce found that over half of Hoosier parents miss work or class because they cannot find child care. Absenteeism and employee turnover caused by this struggle creates an estimated $3.05 billion in losses for Hoosier employers each year.
Vanessa Green Sinders, president and CEO of the Indiana Chamber, told TheStatehouseFile.com in January that child care desserts like Indiana deter potential workers from coming to the state.
“We are such a great state to do business in, and we have so much economic development going on, … but that enthusiasm and that economic development is going to take more workforce,” Sinders said.
The Indiana General Assembly did not allot funding in the state budget to give Hoosiers universal, affordable child care through the CCDF, On My Way Pre-K or any other program. Instead, lawmakers wrote piecemeal legislation that addressed small parts of the larger problem.
 Legislation 
— House Bill 1253 was signed into law by Gov. Mike Braun on May 1.
During a House meeting late in the legislative session, which ended April 24, bill author Rep. Dave Heine, R-Fort Wayne, said the Senate amended the bill to no longer require children who receive child care at a school to be a child of an employee. The Senate also changed the bill to allow multi-site child care centers, like a YMCA, to be able to operate under one license.
“It really will make it easier for them to expand but also, importantly, maintain the ability of the state to, you know, inspect and hold accountable those individual sites without jeopardizing the functioning of the entire enterprise,” Sam Snideman, vice president of government relations for United Way of Central Indiana, told TheStatehouseFile.com.

The most important Senate amendment, in Heine’s opinion, was the addition of language that allows in-home child care centers to continue operation as class two structures as long as they are licensed in that category before July 1.
“This is very important language that was added because right now, we have 43  child care facilities providing child care to approximately 800 children that could be at risk of closing down if we did not add this language,” Heine said in the House meeting.
— Senate Bill 463, also signed by Braun May 1, would give a tax credit to employers who offer near or onsite child care to their employees.
Snideman said adding this option would make employers who opt into the tax credit more competitive in Indiana’s job market because employees with kids might choose to work there for child care.
The new law will also expand the Micro-Facility Pilot Program, a project that allows existing child care centers to open small, non-residential ones that serve three to 30 children.
Sinders said the Indiana Chamber supported SB 463 and HB 1253 because they attempt to make child care more affordable and accessible in Indiana.
— House Bill 1248, signed into law April 10, sets aside CCDF funds for foster families who receive last-minute placements.
“We don’t want to disadvantage those folks who are doing, you know, really important work or, you know, quite honestly disrupt the care for kids who are already facing tremendous challenges.” Snideman said.
— House Bill 1102, another child care bill that reached the governor’s desk, receiving his signature April 3, will allow schools to enter contracts with religiously affiliated, nonprofit pre-K sites that offer child care. Snideman said this will create more potential providers for Hoosier families.
Snideman believes the reason Indiana has not invested fully in CDDF and other government-funded child care initiatives is because the issue is so broad. But both he and Sinders believe there’s room for optimism.
“I think about it from a positive perspective,” Sinders said. “The legislature is willing to continue to work on this issue and continue to try to make progress. … Every bite at the apple helps get you to the solution.”
Snideman is even more confident about the possibility of universal child care in Indiana’s future.
“We are committed to expanding opportunities for Hoosiers in this space,” he said, “which means we will be committed to this long, incremental process of us getting to a place where eventually, you know, every family in our state who wants and needs to send their kids to pre-K or to child care will have that opportunity.

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Malyka Myada represents one of the 45,000 Maryland state child care scholarship recipients who not only pay for a protected space for their children, but also education programs and before- or after-school care.
Thanks to the scholarship, Myada pays about $540 a month for her two children, ages 3 and 1. Without it, she said Friday, it would be at least $2,000. Because her two children are already in the scholarship program at Greenway Learning Center in Greenbelt, Myada’s third child, who’s a month old, will also be able to receive full-time child care at eight weeks.
“The scholarship helps, but it’s like paying rent,” said Myada, a 24-year-old single mother of Greenelt. “My children have a safe space. It’s a nice place.”
But for the moment, access to that safe space has been put on hold by the state.
Faced with a sharp rise in children in the program — and costs for it — the state imposed a freeze on new enrollments May 1. New parents can still apply for a child care scholarship, but will be placed on a waiting list until enrollment declines. Officials hope to lift the freeze by September, when the number of recipients is expected to decrease to 40,000.
Child care providers and early childhood advocates such as Patti Smith hope that happens. It not, centers such as the one in Greenbelt could have empty seats as children leave to enroll in prekindergarten or kindergarten in the public schools.

“We hope that the freeze is melted through the summer,” said Smith, director of the center in Greenbelt, where 20 of the 44 infants, toddlers and preschoolers are on scholarship. “Education starts when children are infants. When they crawl, they work their muscles. That is all helping with fine motor skills.”
State officials also saw the importance of early childhood education, expanding income eligibility to allow more families to qualify for the scholarships. For instance, a family of four can earn up to $112,000 per year and qualify for assistance.
Sarah Neville-Morgan, assistant state superintendent in the state Department of Education’s Division of Early Childhood, said in an interview Thursday that scholarships have jumped from 21,000 in 2023 to more than 45,000 today.
Because of its popularity and growth, officials worried the program could exceed its $270 million budget this fiscal year. But Neville-Morgan notes that, even in a tight budget year and an uncertain future under the Trump administration, the state added another $100 million to the program budget next year
“That needs to be celebrated. It shows how Maryland is investing in its children,” Neville-Morgan, who began her position in the department last month, said about the growth of the program.
“You’ve seen a current, proposed budget from the federal level that doesn’t fully support children and families,” she said. “We are lucky enough to live in a state that does prioritize children and families.”
She continued: “We’ll have to continue to look at what are those resources, and where are we getting them, and then how do we prioritize as we move forward.”
Even though current parents and providers will continue to receive funding, incorporating an enrollment freeze still doesn’t sit well with longtime early childhood educator Evelyn Owens.
“I think it’s terrible,” said Owens, a mentor teacher at Downtown Baltimore Child Care, who’s worked there for four decades. “What about those parents who could use that scholarship now? Early childhood education is necessary.”

Early learning
On Thursday, Owens and another teacher, Keonna Akoma, worked with a prekindergarten class of about 15 students.
Akoma sat on the carpet with Anthony Johnson, 5, to help connect magnetic tiles that resembled a large box. When Akoma was about to place a red tile on top, Johnson tucked underneath and curled up.
Four students in blue aprons were dipping cups, bowls and other utensils inside a large sink with water and suds.
Three girls played upstairs in a play area that included a poster of fruits and vegetables, dolls, a highchair, a bench with a doughnut pillow and other toys.
Zane Romero and Kai Down, both age 5, used real hammers to bang on real nails in the wood working area.
When all the children were asked to come to the carpet and sing a song, Emmeline Calahan Montanez, 5, tugged on Owens’ shirt.
“I never got a turn,” Emmeline said to Owens.
“Let me correct you on that. You did a get turn,” Owens said.
“Oh yeah, I forgot,” Emmeline said with a smile and walked to the carpet.
Nikeiha Wallace, director of the center, said the prekindergartners who began in August represent the first pre-K class at the center.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The expansion of prekindergarten services in public schools and child care providers is part of the “mixed-delivery system” in the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future education reform plan.
A total of 67 children are at the center, two of whom receive a child care scholarship.
According to the center’s website, monthly tuition ranges from nearly $2,400 full-time for a parent with a child at 12 weeks, to $1,800 for children 37 months and older.
“That $1,800 a month is one of the lowest ones [tuition], so with that scholarship it helps parents receive high-quality education,” Wallace said.
Myada from Greenbelt wants to go back to school and get a cosmetology license. In the meantime, and with three children, she’s looking for at least part-time work to fit her schedule. To earn some money, she will do delivery service for Door Dash and Stub Hub.
“I want to build a career and become more stable for my kids,” she said. “Having that scholarship will help me build toward that.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Hammer-and-nails-5-8-2025-1024x722.jpg,,,2025-05-12 07:05:10.087379

A report from the Midwest Economic Policy Institute says Wisconsin's apprenticeship programs could grow faster with some changes in state laws. (Photo courtesy of the Wisconsin Laborers' District Council)Wisconsin saw the number of construction apprentices grow in the last decade, but a new report suggests that growth might have been stronger with some changes in Wisconsin law.
One change would be to restore the state’s prevailing wage law on government construction projects. The other would be to repeal Wisconsin’s “right-to-work” law — a measure that prevents unions from requiring all workers that they represent to pay union dues.
The report was produced by the Midwest Economic Policy Institute, based in  La Grange, Illinois, and conducted jointly with the Project for Middle Class Renewal at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
“While increased public investment in the construction sector is having a positive impact on the apprenticeship system, it is clear that state policy interventions that erode workforce institutions that prioritize training have had the opposite effect,” U of I professor Robert Bruno, director of the Project for Middle Class Renewal, said in a statement.
Bruno said that in addition to reinstituting Wisconsin’ prevailing wage law and repealing the right-to-work law, states can increase their investment in pre-apprenticeship programs to boost the foundational skills for skilled trades workers. He also has suggested tax credits to give more employers an incentive “to invest in our long-term domestic labor supply.”
Looking at data from 2022, the study’s authors found that unionized construction companies account for 22% of the construction market in Wisconsin. Despite that, apprenticeship programs operated jointly by employers and unions enroll 77% of construction apprentices and account for 96% of the money spent in Wisconsin on apprenticeship programs.  
When it comes to training, “the unionized segment of the construction industry punches above its weight by a great deal,” MEPI economist Frank Manzo IV told the Wisconsin Examiner.
Funding advantage
Wisconsin also has certified construction apprenticeship programs operated by employers alone, but MEPI found that they enrolled only 23% of apprentices.
The investment in apprenticeship programs was similarly lopsided, the report finds. The spending on joint union-management programs totaled $64.3 million in 2022, compared with $2.9 million spent on the employer-only programs.
One reason for that gap is funding, Manzo said. Construction union labor agreements include a provision to cover the cost of apprenticeship programs as part of each worker’s total hourly wage and benefits.
“They’re funded by cents-per-hour contributions from employers that are used to train the next generation of skilled trades people,” Manzo said. “So, there’s always money for registered apprenticeship programs.”
By contrast, employer-only programs “rely entirely on voluntary contributions from those employers,” he said.
  Kent Miller, Wisconsin Laborers’ Union Council President/Business Manager
The study comes as the administration of Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers is proposing an administrative rule requiring that contractors employ apprentices as 10% of their workforce on state projects.
“These are all areas right now when we’re looking at how we can provide quality, middle class jobs,” said Kent Miller, president of the Wisconsin Laborers’ District Council. The union represents a broad cross-section of construction workers.
“I’ve heard many times from members how an apprenticeship helped them get their first home,” Miller said. “As much as we can invest in Wisconsin workers it pays dividends down the road. That’s why the private sector union construction industry is making these investments in worker apprenticeship programs.”
Demands for skilled labor
MEPI’s study grew out of the nonprofit institute’s review of how states are responding to an increasing need for skilled labor.
“The construction industry is facing high demand for qualified tradespeople to modernize infrastructure, energy systems, domestic manufacturing facilities, and that’s really happening across the Midwest — across the Rust Belt,” Manzo said.
The research team expected to see Wisconsin among faster-growing states in apprenticeship enrollment. But while apprenticeship numbers have increased by nearly 50% from 2016 to 2024 in the state, “we found that this growth has actually lagged neighboring states that maintained policies that promote workforce training investments and policies that promote workers’ rights,” Manzo said.
The clearest correlation the researchers found was whether states required contractors to pay prevailing local wages on state-funded construction projects.
Just as a federal law known as the Davis-Bacon Act requires construction projects on federal facilities to pay prevailing wages, a number of states have similar laws for state and local government projects.
Contractors are hired for government projects typically based on the lowest bid. Prevailing wage laws require bidders to meet local wage standards, keeping them from cutting wages in order to win the contract.
The requirements “level the playing field,” said Miller, the Laborers union president. “It prevents out-of-state contractors from coming into Wisconsin, low-bidding taxpayer-funded projects, doing shoddy work and taking taxpayer dollars that we’d like to see stay here in Wisconsin.”
Wisconsin repealed its state prevailing wage law in 2017, however.
Encouraging training investments
The MEPI researchers found that in four nearby states — Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota and Ohio — the number of construction apprentices increased by just over 63% from 2016 to 2024. All four states have maintained their state prevailing wage laws in that period, according to the report.
  Frank Manzo IV, Midwest Economic Policy Institute
Prevailing wage laws “ensure that all firms — regardless of union status, by the way — would commit to these cents-per-hour contributions into registered apprenticeship programs while performing work on public works projects,” Manzo said.
Wisconsin’s “right-to-work” law, enacted in 2015, might also be holding down apprenticeship growth, the study’s authors suggest. Such laws forbid employers and unions from negotiating contracts that require all union-represented employees to either pay union dues or pay a fee towards the costs of the union’s work representing employees.
The law “is a government regulation that forces unions to represent nonmembers for free and erodes worker bargaining power by reducing the resources that unions would otherwise have to organize and provide resources and advocate for investments in training, job site safety and job quality,” Manzo said.
As he has in every budget he proposed, Evers included in his 2025-27 budget plan provisions to restore the state prevailing wage and end the right-to-work law. Both were among more than 600 items that the Republican majority of the Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee removed on their first day of budget deliberations Thursday.
Restoring Wisconsin prevailing wage law and repealing the right-to-work law would create an economic environment in which skilled trades workers know they will be supported, said Jacob Heger, an MEPI research analyst and coauthor of the report.
“They can go into these apprenticeship programs, they can get the quality training that they need and then they know that in public policy they’re backed up by what’s on the books [in state law], and that the people in their state capitols have their backs,” Heger said.

(Photo by Johner Images/Getty Images)(This image cannot be republished without a Getty subscription)OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma’s suicide rate is over 60% higher than the national average and ranks in the top 10 states for suicide and suicidality, a report found. 
The Healthy Minds Policy Initiative found that nearly 8,000 Oklahomans died by suicide between 2013 and 2022, which equates to “two lives lost per day over a decade.” Most were gun-related deaths. Oklahoma’s rate of 21 suicide deaths per 100,000 people is well over the national rate of 14 for every 100,000, according to the report. 
Zack Stoycoff, executive director of the nonpartisan group of policy and mental health experts, said there are “common sense solutions” like reducing access to lethal options and increasing mental health screenings. 
“I think what we could learn from this is what circumstances are contributing to suicide and how complex that issue is,” he said. “… When we talk about the epidemic of suicide, we’re talking about the suffering and the circumstances that lead to suicidality and not just the deaths themselves.”
Stoycoff said 10,000 people a year are hospitalized because of suicidality, which is suicidal ideation or intent. Hospitalizations for suicide-related visits cost Oklahoma $139 million in 2022, according to the report. 
 
There are resources for those considering suicide.
988 is the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. LGBTQ+ youth can also call the Trevor Project lifeline 24/7 at 1-866-488-7386 or call Rainbow Youth Project at 317-643-4888.


	Areas of Oklahoma with poor broadband access correlated with higher rates of suicidality, the report found. Many of these counties were in southeast Oklahoma. Pushmataha County had the highest suicide death rate. 
Stoycoff said this relates to a lack of access to services and communities, but that Oklahoma is doing “pretty well” expanding broadband access.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported in 2024 that suicide rates were 44% lower in counties where most homes have broadband internet access. 
“Suicide does affect everybody, but in Oklahoma, suicide is a rural issue,” Stoycoff said. “I mean, we’re seeing that the largest suicide rates are in rural counties, and we have to look at how to expand our reach of services in rural counties.”
The report from Healthy Minds, released in conjunction with the start of Mental Health Awareness Month, also detailed trends in suicide rates by age, gender, race, contributing social and environmental factors, and history of mental health problems and treatment. 
Around 43% of people who died by suicide in Oklahoma between 2013 to 2022 had a known problem with mental health and a third were perceived, by themselves or others, to be depressed. Just over a quarter were in treatment for a mental health or substance use problem at the time of their death. 
Universal screening for mental health issues and suicidality could be a way to catch these issues early, Stoycoff said. 
“When you go to a health care provider or primary care physician, they’re going to check your vital signs. You can do blood pressure and weight, and we’re going to use those as measures of how well you are,” he said. “What we need to treat mental health as a vital sign. It needs to be part of how we practice medicine, because primary care is care for the entire body and the brain is part of the body.”
The report found that over 7% of Oklahomans between 15 and 24 years old made plans to attempt suicide, and 4.5% of children, ages 12 to 17, attempted suicide in 2021 and 2022. 
The rate of deaths by suicide for Native American Oklahomans surpassed white Oklahomans for the first time in 2020, the report stated. 
“The Legislature has generally been very supportive in passing positive legislation in recent years,” he said. “I think we can also appreciate the effort of mental health nonprofit providers who have expanded access to services. Many more people are being treated for mental health needs now than we’re being treated even a decade ago. That doesn’t mean that the need has gone down, it means the providers are trying to step up to meet the rising demand.”

(Photo by Jill Utrup/U.S.Fish and Wildlife Service) A proposed change to the federal Endangered Species Act would send Arkansas preservation efforts backwards amid an ongoing crisis, one state wildlife expert said.
Terri Lane, director of the Arkansas Wildlife Federation, said a recently proposed rule from President Donald Trump’s administration “removes an important level of protections, paving the way for increased habitat destruction.”
The rule, which is open for public comment through the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service until May 19, would rescind the regulatory definition of “harm” in the Endangered Species Act of 1973, which has provided a framework to conserve and protect endangered and threatened species and their habitats.
The current definition of harm under the federal law includes habitat modification, and the proposed rule would remove that protection. According to information posted by the Federal Register, “harm” runs contrary to the best meaning of the statutory term “take.”
Nationally, environmentalists have said the proposed rule would gut habitat protections under the Endangered Species Act.
The Arkansas Game and Fish Commission tracks the state’s nearly 40 endangered species, including the hellbender — the largest salamander in North America — a number of fish, birds, bats and mollusks. An alligator and one beetle also make the list.

AGFC’s Arkansas Wildlife Action Plan, which is required of the state agency as part of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s State Wildlife Grant program, identifies nearly 380 species of greatest conservation need in Arkansas. The plan was last updated in 2015, and its nearly 1,700 pages provides extensive detail on the state’s ecoregions, habitats, and the projected effects of climate change.
Nick Goforth, wildlife diversity program coordinator for AGFC, said, regardless of any changes to the Endangered Species Act, “we will continue to work collaboratively and consult with the [U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service] to do what’s best for Arkansas’ wildlife and native habitats.”
Goforth said the agency is aware of the proposed changes to the federal law, but officials are still assessing how it would affect Arkansas’ endangered species and their role in implementing the Endangered Species Act.
‘Grassroots efforts must increase’
“Wildlife are in crisis,” said Lane, who has led the Arkansas Wildlife Federation, a decades-old independent watchdog organization, for the last two years. “They depend on a network of quality habitat to survive. In the short term, this rule change moves us backward in the fight to save already vulnerable species from further decline or extinction.”

Lane emphasized the importance of biodiversity, and said that complex interactions keep ecosystems healthy.
“The ecosystems upon which all life depends, including our own,” she said.
Looking further ahead, Lane said long-term effects would include a shift from collaborative efforts to solely the private sector. She predicted the rule change would increase the wildlife and biodiversity crisis, thus requiring more efforts, funding and regulatory protections in the future.
“Rule changes like this, particularly at a time when the agencies tasked with wildlife recovery are experiencing dramatic cuts to their budgets and workforce, mean that our grassroots efforts must increase,” Lane said. “The private and nonprofit sector must step in and fill the gaps, working with broad coalitions, sounding the alarm and finding solutions where species are being impacted.”
Trump, who recently celebrated the 100-day mark of his second term, has made scathing cuts to environmental programs nationwide. In Little Rock, AmeriCorps staff lost their funding; along the Buffalo National River, a visitor center closed in February after a wave of firings; and in Fayetteville, a major solar project at the University of Arkansas is stuck in limbo.
Slashes to programs championed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration are expected to have an adverse effect on Arkansas food banks and farmers alike as they lose a major funding source for protein.
Currently, however, the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund seems unaffected. AGFC has received a number of these grants over the years, specifically for habitat preservation for the state’s endangered species.
Last June, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service awarded the state with a $2.2 million grant to protect the yellowcheek darter, a small freshwater fish, and other species. The AGFC and The Nature Conservancy — a national environmental group with offices in Little Rock and Fayetteville — provided matching funds and increased the total investment to nearly $3.1 million.

In Arkansas, allocations from the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund have been used to purchase more than 10,000 acres for the conservation of a variety of species. In 2020, more than 1,100 acres at the Beryl Anthony Lower Ouachita Wildlife Management Area were purchased for conservation of the red-cockaded woodpecker.
AGFC also offers conservation incentive programs to private landowners, but spokesperson Keith Stephens said they were more geared toward game animals than endangered species.
In a statement, Goforth said the state agency supports federal changes that aim to streamline the process of protecting endangered species.
“While the AGFC values the [Endangered Species Act] and the protections and benefits it offers, we are in support of any favorable reforms that would aim to address the challenges in its implementation and would work to streamline consultations and other processes, while both ensuring that its goals and objectives can be met more efficiently and effectively and also maintaining the existing protections for those listed species and their habitats, which are essential to their continued existence and recovery,” Goforth said.
Several organizations in Arkansas focus on the livelihood of the state’s endangered species, including the Arkansas Natural Heritage Commission. Data gathered during on-the-ground field surveys to locate and evaluate endangered species help identify ecologically significant land most in need of protection, according to its website.
Spokesperson Danyelle McNeill deferred all questions about how the proposed rule may affect Arkansas animals to federal agencies. Answering for Director Jennifer Ballard, McNeill said the commission’s scope of services has currently not changed.
Taylor Pool, acting assistant regional director for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s southwest regional office, did not reply to specific questions about the proposed rule change.
“At this time, we have nothing for you,” Pool said.

(Getty Images)This story was first published by Idaho Reports on May 9, 2025.
Earlier this year, Idaho legislators passed a bill to allow some cases of lewd conduct with child under age 12 with aggravating circumstances to be punishable by death, despite knowing the U.S. Supreme Court had ruled a similar law unconstitutional.
The bill did not allocate any additional money for the Idaho State Public Defender’s Office. Instead, the fiscal note says the office will have additional expenditures should a defendant be assigned a public defender by the court.
This could be a major flaw. The challenge is more about more than just money. It’s about meeting what is required by law and agency rules – and when the death penalty is a possible sentence, those requirements are stricter than other criminal defense cases.
The Sixth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution entitles all criminal defendants to a public attorney if they cannot afford one. But prior state rule and national legal guidance say defendants who are facing the death penalty require more representation. The court grants those defendants a lead counselor and co-counselor, sometimes referred to as the second chair attorney.
In 2024, prosecutors filed 382 charges of lewd conduct with a child under the age of 16, according to Idaho Supreme Court data. That doesn’t mean all of those led to convictions, and not all of those victims were 12 or younger.
Compare that to the 30 first-degree murder charges filed in 2024, according to Idaho Supreme Court data. Until House Bill 380’s passage, first-degree murder was the only crime punishable by death in Idaho.
Not all 30 of those charges would have been death penalty cases, as some would not have had necessary aggravating circumstances or a plea agreement could have been reached. Still, that’s less than one tenth of the charges filed of lewd conduct with a child under the age of 16.
 The Public Defense Commission and capital qualified defending attorneys

Under the Public Defense Commission’s now expired rules, any defendant who is charged with a crime that is potentially punishable by death required representation from a “capital qualified defending attorney.” The new Idaho Office of the Public Defender hasn’t yet adopted rules.
Capital qualified attorneys have advanced familiarity with the laws around capital mitigation and jury selection methods. They also meet or exceed American Bar Association Guidelines and criminal defense experience.

In an April interview with Idaho Reports, State Public Defender Eric Fredericksen said his understanding was that the Public Defense Commission’s rules became defunct after his office opened, but added he was not part of that decision-making process.
The Public Defense Commission first established rules in 2016 regarding caseloads and training for public defenders after a massive lawsuit, Tucker v. Idaho, found Idaho’s public defense system to be insufficient. The lawsuit is what led Idaho to the eventual establishment of a statewide public defense system. Until the Idaho Office of the Public Defender opened in October 2024, individual counties funded public defense.
Under the commission’s rules, lead counsel in a capital case needed at least 10 years in criminal defense and felony jury experience and have served as lead or co-counsel in at least one tried capital case to verdict, among other requirements.
Co-counsel must have at least five years in criminal defense and felony jury experience and have served as lead or co-counsel in at least one tried capital case to verdict, among other requirements.
The new Idaho Office of the Public Defender has been following the guidelines of the National Legal Aid and Defender Association, but has no formal state rules of its own. Those association guidelines require less criminal defense experience than the state’s former rules, but still more than non-capital felony defense standards.
A handful of national organizations offer trainings for capital cases, but Fredericksen notes that making the case for life, as it’s often referred to by defense attorneys, is different in murder cases than it would be for lewd conduct cases. There’s a playbook for defense attorneys in capital murder cases. Having the death penalty on the table for lewd conduct creates a different scenario.
Why the extra rules? A person’s life is on the line.
 How many capital case attorneys does Idaho have?

As of April 23, Idaho had 13 attorneys who are qualified to be lead counsel on a capital case. Five are employees of the State Public Defender’s Office and eight are private attorneys. There are an additional 18 Idaho attorneys who qualify to be second chair on a capital case.
That means there are only 13 potential lawyers qualified to represent the people charged under the new crime of aggravated lewd conduct with a minor younger than age 12, on top of the other capital cases that may already be on their plates.
Prosecutors won’t necessarily seek the death penalty as punishment against every person who is charged with lewd conduct with a minor under 12, but the defense attorneys have an obligation to begin preparing as if it were at the time the charge is filing.
“The moment the charge of (aggravated lewd and lascivious) with a minor under 12 is filed, regardless of whether a death notice is filed, we will begin treating it as a death penalty case,” Fredericksen said. “So, two attorneys will be handling the case, find a mitigation expert, we find an investigator. You have to start that work on Day 1 because the prosecution starts that work on Day 1.”
 How much will additional death penalty cases cost the state of Idaho?

Rep. Bruce Skaug, R-Nampa
Rep. Josh Tanner, R-Eagle
Fredericksen’s office remained neutral on the bill. He did write to sponsors Rep. Bruce Skaug, R-Nampa, chairman of the House Judiciary, Rules and Administration Committee, and House Assistant Minority Leader Josh Tanner, R-Eagle, on March 14, stating that he did not have data on how many of the victims in cases they represented were 12 or younger, nor did he have data on how many of them had aggravating circumstances.
On March 18, the State Appellate Public Defender Erik Lehtinen wrote a letter to Senate Judiciary and Rules Committee Chairman Todd Lakey, R-Nampa, and cc’d the bill’s co-sponsors and Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee co-chairs Sen. Scott Grow and Rep. Wendy Horman, R-Idaho Falls, about concerns about the bill’s potential impact on his office’s budget. Idaho Reports obtained a copy of the letter.
The State Appellate Public Defender’s Office handles cases post-conviction for appeals. Lehtinen estimated his office would receive, on average, two capital lewd conduct cases a year, in addition to the capital murder case appeals his office already handles.
“I estimate that once the new death penalty scheme fully ramps up, the SAPD would require at least $2,948,000 in additional ongoing funding – a 72.2% increase to the SAPD’s current annual appropriation,” wrote Lehtinen in his March 18 letter. That number included 14 new employees, litigation expenses and conflict costs. Lehtinen noted it did not include one-time costs, such as computers for the employees, or paying Idaho State Bar dues.
“This increase in capital cases would require the SAPD to hire at least 14 additional full-time employees in its Capital Litigation Unit: four lead attorneys, four ‘second chair’ attorneys, two investigators, two mitigation specialists and two administrative assistants or paralegals,” Lehtinen wrote.
Fredericksen told Idaho Reports that because public defense is so reactive to what the prosecution does, he couldn’t give a fiscal impact estimate. His office has begun accepting applications for attorneys who may have enough experience to become death penalty qualified.
But if half of the lewd conduct charges filed in 2024 involved children under age 12, he said, Idaho doesn’t have enough public, private, and civil attorneys to handle that case load.
The Idaho Legislature approved an $83 million budget for Fredericksen’s office for fiscal year 2026. About $32 million of that is an enhancement budget for needed personnel costs, institutional offices in Elmore, Shoshone, Jerome and Benewah counties and more funding for contract attorneys. The budget doesn’t specifically single out allocations for more death penalty-qualified attorneys.
 Bill creates new crime: aggravated lewd conduct under 16

When the new law goes into effect on July 1, it will create a new crime called “aggravated lewd conduct under 16” which creates a new mandatory minimum of 25 years for the crime of lewd conduct with a child ages 13 to 15. The option of pursuing the death penalty would be left to the individual county prosecutor in cases where the child is 12 or younger. The crime of lewd conduct with a child under 16 is already punishable by life in prison.
The bill outlines a series of 17 aggravating factors that make a suspect eligible for the death penalty, including the victim being kidnapped or trafficked, or the suspect engaging in the act three or more times.
If a jury, or the court if a jury is waived, finds two aggravating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt and if the death penalty is not sought, the court shall impose a life sentence with a minimum period of no less than 30 years in prison.
Public defenders who testified in committee took issue with some of the items listed as aggravating factors, including if the defendant was in “a position of trust” over the victim because that could be applicable to many sexual assaults of children. Public defenders also objected to including “force or coercion” as an aggravating factor, as children cannot legally consent, so every case could arguably be “force or coercion.”
In committee, the Idaho Prosecutor’s Association supported the list of aggravating circumstances, saying they were based off Florida and Tennessee’s laws.
“I think it’s fair to say that with the nature of the aggravating factors, a prosecutor could make a decision that just about every case would meet those aggravating factors,” Fredericksen said. “Right or wrong, they could make the case to move forward with the aggravating factors under the statute.”
 Is Idaho’s new law constitutional? A former Supreme Court ruling offers clues. 

Idaho legislators passed this law knowing that in the 2008 decision Kennedy v. Louisiana, the U.S. Supreme Court determined that the Eighth Amendment prohibits the death penalty for non-fatal sex crimes, even if the crime involved brutality and young children.
Still, Florida passed a similar law in 2023, but to date, no one has been sentenced to death for child sexual assault. Instead, prosecutors have reached plea agreements with lesser punishments than executions, such as life in prison.
Tennessee passed a law similar to Florida’s in 2024, but it hasn’t yet been used.
During the session, Skaug repeatedly called the Idaho bill a “test case” as the makeup of SCOTUS has changed since 2008. He also believes prosecutors will only use the charge for “the worst of the worst.”
Of the four justices who dissented in Kennedy v. Louisiana, three – Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas – are still on the bench. None of the five in the 2008 majority are currently serving.
Regardless of the current court makeup, if someone is sentenced to death under this new law, it will almost certainly end up challenged in court.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)May is the annual month designed to raise awareness for mental health issues. But unfortunately Oklahoma’s mental health agency is shining the wrong sort of spotlight on the issue.
Instead of focusing on how to improve outcomes for the 1 in 4 Oklahomans who suffer from mental illness, all eyes are on the massive amounts of financial disarray at the state Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services jeopardizing both employees and patient care.
Provider contracts have been cut or canceled. There’s been revelations that officials can’t figure out how to use their appropriated money to make payroll. The agency’s interim chief financial officer couldn’t answer basic questions about payroll costs or why the agency only needed $6.2 million to fill a $43 million shortfall. And, they haven’t been able to produce a budget for the upcoming fiscal year. 
The list goes on and on.
And it seems like every time our state mental health officials open their mouths, it exposes a new level of ineptitude.
Last week, Mental Health Commissioner Allie Friesen practically begged lawmakers to figure out her own agency’s budget woes when she’s supposed to be able to discuss the nuances of its over $600 million budget. 
Is it any wonder that lawmakers are growing increasingly frustrated?
Friesen, meanwhile, is pointing the finger at her predecessors.
She’s supposed to have been leading this agency since she was appointed by Gov. Kevin Stitt in January 2024. 
But in blaming her predecessor, Carrie Slatton-Hodges, Friesen is pointing her finger at  Stitt, who appointed Slatton-Hodges and touted her as being a great fit.
I could see blaming her predecessor if Friesen was hired last month, but she’s been at the helm for over a year now. 
What has she been doingr?
Earlier this month I found myself chuckling grimly. As lawmakers were scrambling on a Friday to address revelations that the agency couldn’t pay its 2,000 employees, Friesen’s team put out a press release celebrating the resurrection of its halted naloxone vending machine project.
That’s the same program that Friesen abruptly shuttered in September because she said it wasn’t cost effective.
Offering free medication that reverses drug overdoses in vending machines as a way to help save lives and reduce the stigma is definitely a worthwhile program, and might be critical to the agency’s mission.
But so is paying the employees who are core to meeting a state agency’s goals.
Maybe that’s part of the issue. Perhaps Friesen doesn’t know what the core functions of mental health are and how to prioritize programs. Or maybe hers is an agency that doesn’t know how to live within the confines of a budget — or perhaps that it even has a budget.
After all, Friesen didn’t prioritize launching a search for a permanent, qualified CFO, until a day after lawmakers humiliated her interim one.
During public hearings, lawmakers flagged that the agency hired 20 employees with salaries of at least $100,000. A dozen employees saw their salaries raised to that level.
Lawmakers discovered that Skip Leonard, the agency’s now former interim CFO, was making $165 an hour — or up to $343,000 a year — despite not being a certified public accountant and having no experience running finances for a state agency. 
At another hearing, Friesen brought with her an employee she hired just over a month ago to work in her “operational excellence division.”
There is no “operational excellence” going on right now.
It all gives the impression that Friesen is just creating random jobs or promoting people into high-paying jobs without an ounce of cents — literally.
Hiring people at high salaries for state jobs might explain why the agency suddenly can’t make payroll. Creating random divisions that seemingly go beyond the agency’s core mission is a head scratcher.
There’s no excuse for this level of ineptitude. It seems like it might be time to go back to basics and get better at providing the core services before looking at adding in shiny objects that look pretty but aren’t necessary to function.
It boggles the mind that Stitt – who, like other Republicans, promises to run state government like a business – continues to defend Friesen.
If anybody else ran a business in such a haphazard way, their governing board would fire them.
So let’s hope that Stitt knows something the rest of us don’t and that he can get the wheels back on this clown car before it hurts the people who rely on it most — our mentally ill and the people that care for them.

State attorneys general are urging concerned customers to delete their data, while experts warn that state and federal laws may not fully protect their privacy. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)The fate of more than 15 million customers’ genetic data remains in limbo after popular DNA testing company 23andMe filed for bankruptcy in March. The data is up for sale, stoking fears about how it might be used and prompting attorneys general from more than a dozen states to warn 23andMe users: Delete your data.
“Your genetic data is your most personal, confidential data, and you should be able to protect who has access to it,” North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson, a Democrat, said in a March statement.
“You have the power to delete your data now — please act quickly.”
Dr. Adam Brown, a Washington, D.C.-based emergency physician and the founder of a health care strategy firm, deleted his information on 23andMe as soon as he learned of the bankruptcy filing, he told Stateline.
For him, the bankruptcy begs a vital question that federal and state laws don’t fully address: What happens to your genetic data when the company holding it collapses?
Federal protections are flimsy. States have beefed up their genetic privacy laws in recent years, but many experts say they don’t go far enough.
23andMe has said the bankruptcy will not change how it stores, manages or protects its trove of sensitive customer information. In a news release issued shortly after the bankruptcy announcement, the company said any potential buyers would have to agree to comply with 23andMe’s consumer privacy policy and all applicable laws. When contacted by Stateline, the company declined to comment beyond what it has published in news releases and information it posted for customers on its website.
But once the data is in the hands of another company, that company could change its privacy policy at any time, experts noted.
“Once you get to the point of bankruptcy court, there may not be those same guarantees or the same ethos a new company may have around privacy protections for consumers,” Brown said.
“I want people to understand there actually are not a lot of data privacy protections for consumers, especially for these direct-to-customer-type businesses.”
 HIPAA doesn’t help

Companies such as 23andMe offer their users potentially game-changing revelations about their health and ancestry. The process is simple: Mail in a saliva sample and the company uses it to build an individual genetic profile that can reveal not only a person’s family connections, but also health insights such as their risk of developing a disease like cancer or Alzheimer’s.
This valuable personal data underpins a direct-to-customer genetic testing market that was valued at $1.93 billion globally in 2023 and is expected to grow, according to market research firm Grand View Research.
23andMe was an industry giant until its stock price plummeted following a massive 2023 data breach that affected the accounts of nearly 7 million customers. Then came the $30 million class-action lawsuit settlement.
The company declared bankruptcy in late March of this year, and announced it’s up for sale.
A flurry of alerts from state attorneys general around the country soon followed. AGs from states including Alabama, Arizona, California, Kentucky, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Texas issued similar press releases that recommended customers ask the company to delete their genetic profile and destroy the saliva sample used to create it.
“We have robust state privacy laws that include data deletion rights, and I would encourage any Texan concerned about their data to exercise the right to have their data securely deleted,” Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, said in an April statement.
The fear is that a new 23andMe owner could choose to use or share sensitive personal genetic data in ways the company’s current privacy policy doesn’t allow. There’s worry it could be used, for example, to inflate people’s life insurance premiums or expose them to employment discrimination.
And there aren’t many guardrails to prevent that from happening.
HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, doesn’t apply to companies like 23andMe. The landmark federal law protects patients’ sensitive health information when it’s handled by doctors, hospitals and health insurers. But direct-to-customer companies such as 23andMe or Ancestry aren’t considered health care providers, and their non-invasive saliva collection kit isn’t considered a medical test.
The main federal law that protects people from discrimination based on their genetic information is nearly 20 years old. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) was passed in 2008, long before the rise of at-home testing kits. It applies to employers and health insurers, but not to life insurance companies, mortgage lenders and other non-health entities. And it doesn’t explicitly protect epigenetic information, which is information about the way a person’s genes — and by extension, health — are affected by outside factors such as smoking, disease or stress.
 What states are doing

In the past five years, at least 14 states have passed laws regulating direct-to-consumer genetic testing offered by companies like Ancestry and 23andMe. There’s variation, but generally the laws require companies to get customers’ express consent before using or sharing their data, and allow customers to request their genetic data be deleted and biological samples destroyed.
It’s a good start, but doesn’t go far enough, said Anya Prince, a University of Iowa law professor whose research focuses on health and genetic privacy.
Many of those state efforts were built around a model law developed by the Coalition for Genetic Data Protection, an industry group with two member companies: 23andMe and Ancestry.
As DNA testing kits exploded in popularity and attracted increased scrutiny from lawmakers, the coalition pushed to influence legislation and set industry standards. The privacy protections in the laws mirror what 23andMe and Ancestry were already doing with their own privacy policies, experts say.
“They do have some really sensible privacy protections,” said Prince. “It’s great that people can delete their genetic data, and it’s great that law enforcement needs a warrant to access it. But if a privacy advocate had written a model law, there would be the potential for more and broader protections.”
For example, she said, many of the state laws address privacy requirements just for direct-to-consumer DNA testing companies. If 23andMe’s data is bought by, say, a pharmaceutical company, those state laws no longer apply.
The coalition now appears to be inactive, its website defunct.
Since 2020, more than a dozen states have passed some version of a genetic information privacy law, including Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Kentucky, Maryland, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Wyoming, based on a Stateline analysis. This year, the Indiana legislature passed a bill that’s now headed to the governor’s desk. Bills have been introduced this year in other states, including West Virginia.
Prince said state laws rely too heavily on consumers to self-manage their data privacy. They’re expected to understand a company’s policy, when studies have shown the public often doesn’t read privacy notices nor fully understand how companies use their data. Further, many state laws don’t address how third parties, such as law enforcement, can access and use consumer genetic data.
It’s also not always clear how the laws will be enforced, or who’s responsible for oversight.
“In general, I think there’s a disconnect between how people think their privacy is protected and how it’s actually protected,” she said.
But a few states have enacted laws that are more robust. California, for example, has a genetic information privacy law, but also has a general data protection law, as well as a state version of the federal GINA law that extends genetic anti-discrimination protections into areas including housing, education and licensing.
Florida has beefed up its DNA privacy laws in recent years, making the using or selling of an individual’s DNA without informed consent a felony punishable by up to 15 years in prison and up to a $10,000 fine. Florida was also the first state to prohibit life, disability and long-term care insurance companies from using genetic information to determine coverage.

(Stock.adobe.com photo by smolaw11)Here’s an oddity. For all that has been said about the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future, there has been hardly a word about class size. The subject has not even been debated.
That’s a shocker. Common sense supports lower class sizes: The fewer the students in class, the more attention teachers can pay to individual student needs. Teachers almost unanimously think “smaller classes would strongly boost student learning.”
So why the omission in the Blueprint?
For one thing, the Kirwan Commission ducked the issue, largely under the influence of its chief consultant who didn’t think class size matters much if at all.  For another, for decades, the importance of class size has been a raging battleground between liberals on one side (it matters) and conservatives on the other (it’s a poor use or waste altogether of scarce funds).
The controversy also endures because research is mixed. One summary of the research concludes “Students often do better in smaller classes. But there’s no agreement on exactly how much better, and it remains an open question whether or not class reduction is a particularly good use of funds that could go elsewhere.”
The uncertainty is not surprising, given the many possible variations of the policies that are being researched. For example, class sizes may differ by the actual class-size limit, by grade level, and by targeted student population (usually students who are of color and low-income and in early grades).




Your opinion matters
Maryland Matters welcomes guest commentary submissions at editor@marylandmatters.org.
We suggest a 750-word limit and reserve the right to edit or reject submissions. We do not accept columns that are endorsements of candidates, and no longer accept submissions from elected officials or political candidates.
Opinion pieces must be signed by at least one individual using their real name. We do not accept columns signed by an organization. Commentary writers must include a short bio and a photo for their bylines.
Views of writers are their own.




Still, there is clear evidence behind selective limits on class size. Northwestern University economist Diane Schanzenbach sums it up: “The payoff from class-size reduction is greater for low-income and minority children, while any increases in class size will likely be most harmful to these populations.” Smaller classes in the early grades, in particular, matter a lot.
That’s the state of the research, but what’s going on with state and local policies that govern class size? According to a survey by the National  Council on Teacher Quality,  90% of local school districts have class-size limits, “with state policy playing a direct role.” A majority of states have such policies; however, they’re all over the map in their exact requirements.
Regrettably, Maryland is one of the states without any kind of statewide class-size policy. We have regulations on staffing ratios in child care settings, but no statewide law imposing hard caps on pre-K to 12 classrooms. In the absence of a statewide policy, local school districts vary widely in their approaches. Unfortunately, there is no summary of the different local policies or reports on whether class-size policies are being implemented with fidelity.
The most common argument against class-size reductions is the shortage of teachers. No doubt shortages are severe, and in the past session of the General Assembly, Gov. Wes Moore blamed teacher shortages for his attempt to slash funds in the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future intended to hire more teachers for “collaborative time” — to reduce the number of hours teachers spend teaching the whole class, allowing more time planning and tutoring. (His proposals were partially adopted – causing the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars that could have been redirected to fill big holes in funding throughout the Blueprint.)
Moreover, teacher shortages could be significantly reduced by recruiting more teacher who only tutor small groups of students. Many teachers would be attracted by the chance to be full- or part-time tutors, rather than regular classroom teachers.
One other fly in the class-size ointment.is worthy of mention. Champions of smaller classes must overcome the frequent assertions by former U. S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan and others that it’s better to have a great teacher than a small class. But that’s a generalization that hides the reality that some class sizes are now huge, often as high as 35 students; and classes with many low-performing students, especially in the early grades, must have low teacher-to-student ratios to meet student needs.
What should Maryland do?

End the long failure to study and debate a statewide class-size policy. Let voices on all sides of the debate be heard.
Join most other states in allowing union bargaining over class size. According to the Maryland State Education Association, we are one of only nine states where class size is not negotiable at the bargaining table. MSEA has tried without success to get the General Assembly to change this.
Focus on class sizes in the pivotal kindergarten to third grades.
Fill up and speed up the teacher pipeline through incentives and focusing on tutor recruitment.
Enforce existing and future class-size requirements. Too often, the laws are “policy without consequences” because of non-compliance by school districts.

If there’s a political will to reduce class sizes, there’s a way. Policymakers should follow the research and selectively lower class sizes based on evidence of where there will be maximum payoff.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/AdobeStock_268991911-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-12 07:05:10.087379

Before making its final decision, the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality will accept public comments through May 21.
The post Wyoming intends to approve Microsoft data centers’ emissions permit for 128 backup diesel generators appeared first on WyoFile .","State air quality regulators are seeking public comment on Microsoft’s proposal to install a battery of 128 diesel-fired electric generators associated with new data and computing facilities it plans to construct five miles southeast of Cheyenne.
Microsoft, which already operates a handful of data centers in and around Cheyenne, has a contract with local electric provider Black Hills Energy. The diesel generators are likely only for backup power, Cheyenne Mayor Patrick Collins told WyoFile, “in case power is interrupted for whatever reason.”
The company must obtain an emissions permit from the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality’s air quality division, as well as approval from the agency for a series of associated storage tanks that would hold up to 1.8 million gallons of diesel fuel, according to state documents.

The DEQ issued a notification in April saying it proposes to approve the permit, but will first consider public comments, which are being accepted through May 21. Unless an “aggrieved party” requests one, the DEQ does not intend to hold a public hearing on the permit application, according to the agency.
The permit would allow certain levels of emissions that include pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which are sometimes associated with ozone or haze, according to filings with the state.
Microsoft proposes to build four more facilities in the area, according to Collins. The company’s data centers in Wyoming now employ 85 people, according to a Microsoft fact sheet. It expects to employ 335 full-time workers by the end of 2026. The company has pledged to become carbon-negative by 2030.

Organizing is a routine part of legislating, so why is it a problem when the Wyoming Freedom Caucus does so, Rep. Rachel Rodriguez-Williams asks.
The post When conservatives organize, the left cries foul appeared first on WyoFile .","Every morning of the legislative session, Wyoming lawmakers receive a flood of emails, texts and hallway ambushes from lobbyists, associations and interest groups offering their “vote recommendations.” This is a routine part of legislating. Yet, when conservative legislators in the Wyoming Freedom Caucus coordinate successfully on policy and receive support aligned with our principles, suddenly, the pearl-clutching begins. 

Opinion

The accusation that members of the WYFC are “told how to vote every morning” is not just wrong — it’s a smokescreen. Vote recommendations are everywhere in the Capitol. The liberal County Commissioners Association regularly sends out its preferred positions — including opposition to property tax relief and opposition to a bill that would require government meetings to be streamed online. Wyoming AARP has aggressively lobbied against common-sense election integrity reforms, such as Voter ID requirements. The Wyoming Education Association begged lawmakers to vote against school choice. Every day during the session, lobbyists line the hallway outside the House chambers, ready to pounce on lawmakers from all sides of the political spectrum with talking points and pressure tactics. 
No one seems bothered by these daily attempts to influence policy — unless, of course, those recommendations come from a conservative source. That’s the double standard. No one complains when a lobbying group on the left hands out voting guides, tracks scores or testifies in committee meetings. No one bats an eye when progressive organizations coordinate efforts across the state. But when a group of conservative lawmakers stands up, says “we’re organized,” and follows through with a consistent commitment to limited government, individual liberty and fiscal responsibility — suddenly it’s a scandal. 
This criticism is intentional deception. Those who rail against the WYFC aren’t truly upset about vote recommendations — they’re upset about the votes themselves. They’re angry that conservatives are gaining traction in Wyoming, exposing government overreach, and pushing back on policies that tax too much, spend too freely and trample on citizens’ rights. So instead of engaging on the actual issues, our critics resort to tired attacks and manufactured outrage. 
The bottom line is this: vote recommendations only became a problem when conservatives got organized and successful. Like all the other parroting attacks on the Freedom Caucus, this latest round of complaints is just another tactic from the left, and Republicans who collaborate with them, to hide their deep and unpopular disdain for the policies and freedom we stand for. 
We won’t be distracted. We’ll keep fighting for the people of Wyoming — and those who elected each of our members will tell us how to do it.

Neubauer takes questions from reporters alongside Senate Minority Leader Dianne Hesselbein in Jan. 2025. (Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)Wisconsin Assembly Minority Leader Greta Neubauer is joining the Board of Directors for the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee (DLCC) — the national organization dedicated to electing Democrats to state legislatures.
The Racine Democrat, who has been in the Legislature since 2018 and has led Assembly Democrats since 2021, joins the board as Wisconsin Democrats seek majorities in both chambers for the first time in many years in 2026.
Neubauer said DLCC President Heather Williams asked her to join the board and it’s a sign of the organization’s “deep commitment” to Wisconsin and understanding that a trifecta could be possible in 2026. 
“They want to be a part of helping us flip this state blue,” Neubauer said. “DLCC of course is focused on the national strategy of supporting democratic legislatures to win majorities in legislative chambers. They have had great success in the last few years… so I’m excited to be part of that national strategy work.” 
Williams said in a statement that “all eyes should be on the states in 2025” and Neubauer is a leader to watch. 
“As state Democrats continue to overperform in special elections and counter the chaos in Washington, we are laying the foundation for Democratic success up and down the ticket,” Williams said. “Our board members represent some of the sharpest minds in politics, and I’m excited to partner with them to build our plan for victory for cycles to come.” 
In the past, the DLCC has invested in helping Wisconsin Democrats win and outlined strategies for winning targeted seats.
Neubauer said it has been helpful getting to know leaders in other states where Democrats have successfully flipped control of their legislative chambers including Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania. She said she has learned a lot from those leaders and is trying to bring those lessons back to Democrats in Wisconsin, especially when it comes to preparing to be in the majority. 
“When we do win, we want to take advantage of the opportunity and pass policy that is going to materially improve people’s lives very quickly, so that’s been really helpful to me to speak with them about how they prepared to govern, how they worked with their caucuses,” Neubauer said, adding that Democrats have 10 new Assembly members this year and hope to grow that number now that the Legislature has passed new maps that no longer overwhelmingly favor Republicans. “The level of program that we run during the campaign cycle, the amount of money we need to raise and candidates we’re supporting has grown significantly since we got the fair maps. I’m getting all sorts of advice from those leaders both about governing and about effectively campaigning, winning majorities.” 
When it comes to its targets for 2025-26, Wisconsin is one of five of the DLCC’s “battleground” states where legislative majorities are determined by the slimmest of margins. 
New legislative maps were put in place last year by the state Legislature and Gov. Tony Evers after the Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled the old maps were an unconstitutional gerrymander. Democrats in Wisconsin haven’t held a legislative majority in the Senate or Assembly since 2010, and under the old maps, Senate Republicans were able to win two-thirds of the seats, while Republicans held a 64-35 majority.
Under the new maps, Democrats in 2024 were able to pick up 10 Assembly seats and now hold 45 of 99 seats. They also added four Senate seats and now hold 15 seats out of 33 in that chamber.
Wisconsin’s 2026 elections will be the first time that control of the Senate will be in play as only half of the body was up in the last election and Assembly Democrats will again be working to try to win a majority.
“It is absolutely doable, but it is going to take quite a bit of work,” Neubauer said. 
Democratic lawmakers, she said, are taking a few approaches to getting things done for voters ahead of the next elections. This includes working across the aisle in the budget process to get investment into programs that Wisconsinites rely on, including child care and public schools and ensuring “Republican attacks on our rights and freedoms are not successful” by upholding the governor’s veto. 
Neubauer said her party is also “focused on that long-term vision and communicating what we will do when we have a Democratic trifecta — how we will change the state, how we will make Wisconsin a place where everyone has the ability to thrive, wants to live, raise a family, retire.” She noted that Democrats introduced a package of bills in January to address prescription drug access, ensure students have access to food in school and help improve housing, but Republicans haven’t shown interest in them. 
“We have a big and deep policy agenda that we’ve been working on for over a decade that we are ready to implement, and so we just have to get out and communicate about it,” Neubauer said. “And that of course looks like fanning out across the state, both in districts we represent and other communities, and talking about the work that we need to get done.” 
Neubauer said they are going to continue to work to lower costs, especially as “Trump engages in reckless, irresponsible trade wars and weakens the economy for no good reason.” She said state legislatures are essential in pushing back on his agenda.
The first part of Trump’s term in office could have an effect on Wisconsin Democrats’ chances as well, Neubauer said. 
“We have a number of Republican legislators who have really tried to position themselves as being moderate. They go home to their districts and they emphasize the bipartisan proposals that they’ve signed on to or tried to get passed, but what they don’t talk about is their voting record being in line with Republican leadership almost 100% of the time,” Neubauer said. 
Neubauer said that Wisconsin Republicans haven’t distanced themselves from Trump’s  agenda. 
“The first several months of the legislative session here in Wisconsin, we saw Republicans focused on culture wars rather than lowering costs for working families, making their lives easier, investing in our schools — the things that we all hear about when we run into our constituents at the grocery store,” Neubauer said. “Republicans are going to have to answer for Donald Trump and his attacks on Wisconsin families next year, and that is going to be difficult for them to do in extremely purple districts.”
Wisconsin’s gubernatorial election is also coming up in November 2026. Evers hasn’t said whether he’ll run for a third term, saying he’ll likely decide after the next budget is done. Republican Josh Schoemann, who serves as the county executive of Washington, is the first candidate to announce his campaign.
“We’re all eagerly awaiting that decision,” Neubauer said of Evers’ choice whether to make a re-election bid. “[I] always look forward to working with the governor.”
Neubauer is one of seven legislative leaders joining the DLCC board alongside California Speaker of the Assembly Robert Rivas, Colorado Senate President James Coleman, Illinois Speaker Pro Tempore Kam Buckner, Michigan Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks, Oregon Speaker of the House Julie Fahey and Virginia Speaker of the House Don Scott. 
New York Senate President Pro Tempore and Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, who also serves as the DLCC chair, said in a statement that she is thrilled Neubauer is joining. 
“There has never been a more important time to ensure we have battle-tested, experienced leaders at the helm of Democratic strategy in the states as Donald Trump upends Washington and our economy,” Stewart-Cousins said, adding that Neubauer “embodies the diverse expertise needed to drive and elevate our strategy to build durable state power through the end of the decade.”

Sims organized the event with Dr. Wesley Pidcock, Saint Alphonsus Regional Medical Center’s intensive care unit medical director. Both doctors are involved with Idaho Clinicians for Climate and Health, an organization that aims to reduce climate change’s impact on human health.
“Being able to come together as health systems around a shared mission to educate and foster dialogue around sustainable practices in healthcare is fulfilling and exciting work, and we are driven by its ability to protect and enhance the long-term health of our community,” Pidcock said in a written statement.

Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, thanks supporters after being elected speaker of the House at the Virginia State Capitol on Jan. 10, 2024. (Photo by Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)Virginia House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, is joining the board of directors of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee (DLCC), the national party’s state-level strategy arm, just as Virginia enters one of its most consequential election years in recent memory.
The DLCC  will draw on Scott’s experience — alongside that of six other new board members from around the country — to help shape its plans to support state legislative races this year and beyond.
With all 100 seats in Virginia’s House of Delegates seats and the state’s entire executive branch up for election this year, DLCC President Heather Williams emphasized that “all eyes are on Virginia.”
Speaking by phone on Friday, Scott described the commonwealth as both an “incubator for democracy” and a “bellwether for the rest of the country.”
Virginia holds its gubernatorial elections the year after each presidential contest, which offers national observers a fresh barometer on public sentiment. This year, Democrats are framing the races as a referendum on President Donald Trump and his influence over the Republican Party. 
But Scott stressed that all elections are also inherently local. Each House race will also revolve around  hallmark issues for Virginia Democrats — including advancing three constitutional amendments on voting rights, reproductive freedom and marriage equality — alongside regional issues like infrastructure and the economy. 
“People are really concerned about kitchen-table issues,” Scott said. 
His appointment to the DLCC’s board of directors comes on the heels of the organization announcing a seven figure investment in Virginia’s elections this year. The state is one of several battlegrounds identified in the organization’s 2025-2026 Target Map, which also includes North Carolina, Georgia, and Arizona. The committee aims to help Democrats flip legislatures or build stronger democratic bases. 
Others joining Scott on the DLCC board include legislative leaders from California, Colorado, Illinois, Michigan, Oregon and Wisconsin. 
“Our board members represent some of the sharpest minds in politics, and I’m excited to partner with them to build our plan for victory for cycles to come,” DLCC president Williams said in a recent statement.  
While the DLCC’s core mission has always been state legislature races, this year the group also plans to boost the eventual Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor. While the state Senate — where Democrats hold a slim majority — is not on the ballot, the next lieutenant governor could play a key role in breaking future ties. 
As the DLCC falls under the Democratic National Committee umbrella, the overarching organization has also recently announced a funding focus to help boost state elections. DNC chair Ken Martin announced last month that the organization will transfer more than $1 million per month to its state and territorial parties over the next four years.
“When we organize everywhere to compete everywhere, we can win anywhere,” he said on a press call during the announcement. “The role of political parties is to build infrastructure everywhere.”
That infusion comes as Democrats are running candidates in all 100 House districts. Some are incumbents or former candidates returning for a rematch in competitive districts; others are fresh faces stepping up through recruitment efforts. 
Much of that  recruitment has been led by  Dr. Fergie Reid Jr., whose father, Dr. William “Fergie” Reid Sr., became the first Black elected official in Virginia after  Reconstruction. Reid Jr., a retired physician, has spent the past decade working to ensure Democrats contest every district — from the safest blue districts to the reddest red — to help build a base and spark party enthusiasm. 
“Dad turned 100 a few weeks ago. There are 100 districts in the state house,” Reid recently told The Mercury. “My goal is not to let what happened in 2021 happen again, especially on Dad’s 100th year when he’s watching. He’s been calling me every night to make sure that we get in 100 districts.”
Meanwhile, Scott, the first Black House speaker in Virginia history, hopes to share what his home state has learned with Democrats in other states. In  2023, Scott helped his party claw back its majority in the House of Delegates, which set the stage for his ascension to speaker. 
“The number one thing that we’ve learned is that we have to meet people where they are,” Scott said. “Most people are trying to figure out how they put food on the table, how they afford the things that they need, whether they have good schools for their kids, and whether it’s safe to live in the community, and that’s what we’ve been focused on.”

This year, volunteers are prepping for an event with fewer National Park Service staff amid federal funding cuts. (Photo provided by National Park Service)The third full weekend in June is always the busiest part of the summer at Fort Union Trading Post near Williston, North Dakota.
This is when the National Park Service historic site hosts its Rendezvous, which draws about 3,000 visitors.
This year, however, the event has been in flux as organizers adapt to ever-changing federal funding streams and staffing models. Within the span of a few days, Rendezvous 2025 was canceled and then added back to the summer schedule.
“It’s whiplash for all of us involved,” said Megan Halvorson, executive director of the Fort Union Association, a nonprofit that promotes and supports the historic site. “There are a lot of unknowns.”
Rendezvous is Fort Union’s biggest event. Over five days, more than 100 living historians recreate what life was like in the 1800s when trappers and traders gathered at the post to exchange furs and goods. 
Rendezvous was canceled in early April because of a shortage of summer staff at the historic site, Halvorson said. But once the cancellation was announced, the regional National Park Service office said the event needed to go on, she said.

The event relies heavily on volunteers but needs National Park Service staff to oversee those volunteers, she said. Historically, Fort Union has hired six rangers to cover the busy season. In addition, rangers from other national park sites have been assigned to help with the Rendezvous weekend.
Because of federal hiring freezes earlier in the year, the park service fell behind in its seasonal hiring and Fort Union was able to secure only one long-term ranger plus three short-term rangers for this summer, Halvorson said.
That’s not enough staff to make sure the event runs smoothly and safely, she said.
The park’s superintendent referred all questions to the National Park Service regional office. Calls to the regional office were not returned.
Fort Union’s experience is not uncommon, said Bill Wade, executive director of the Association of National Park Rangers.
A cycle of firings and reinstatements and buyouts has led to a loss of permanent employees. The total number is unclear, Wade said, because National Park Service employees have been told not to speak about personnel issues. 
Still, his association estimates up to 2,500 employees have left the park system. And while the service was eventually authorized to hire more seasonal employees than usual, that permission came late.
“It takes a while to get those people trained and on board,” Wade said. “What we’re seeing is some positions may not be filled early in the season.”
In addition, he said the recent chaos and confusion has led to low morale among those who have stayed. 
“There’s anger and fear among employees who are just trying to do their job,” he said. “We’re expecting there will be more disruption and significant impacts on park resources in the future.”
Halvorson says more than 10,000 visitors come through Fort Union each year. She and other members of the Fort Union Association provide as much support to the historic site as they can. The association runs a park store and members are organizing a fundraiser to help hire additional staff.
Still, Halvorson said people who value National Park Service sites need to contact their local congressional representatives. That’s the best way to support them, she said.
In the meantime, the association will recruit even more volunteers to make sure Rendezvous goes smoothly.
“We’ll find people to fill gopher holes and set up awnings. We’ll ask our local civic organizations for help in setting up picnic tables and garbage cans,” she said. “We’ll do what we can to make sure it goes on.”
Those who visit Fort Union for the big June event will see blacksmiths crafting nails and horseshoes. They’ll watch demonstrators spin wool into yarn and learn how traders used Plains Indian Hand Talk to speak with each other. They’ll see a keel boat, which was the primary way of transporting goods up and down the river.
“It will feel alive out there,” Halvorson said.

Women should keep this number filed away, especially those who live in remote rural areas of the Gem State. This is the number to call if you want to get out of an abusive relationship, which may include domestic violence or sexual assault.
That’s the number of the Women’s & Children’s Alliance hotline, where a friendly voice will hear your story and direct you to resources in your area. The WCA fields almost 4,500 calls a year, so don’t think you are alone with this situation.
Bea Black has heard her share of stories during her 17 years as WCA’s executive director, and she cringes at just about every one of those tales.
“It’s chilling what individuals can do to others,” she says.
While listening to horror stories is not the most pleasant aspect of her job, what she does afterward keeps her going to work every day. With a team of 56 who come to the rescue of women and children going through some form of domestic abuse, Black’s role is to promote those efforts.
“These are the real heroes of the story about the WCA. These are the ones helping the people during the worst times of their lives,” she says. “For me as the spokesperson, I have the opportunity to provide education about our services and how those services impact the people in our community.”
Of course, that’s only a snapshot of what she does. A CEO can make, or break, an organization and Black’s record is one of resounding success. She’s not an expert in the field of domestic abuse (her background is as a CPA and entrepreneur), but her work history has helped give the WCA a strong footing. She also knows enough to let the field experts do their jobs.
Within the WCA, there are the “technicians” (guardian angels) who sit with the children and moms who are going through monumental pain. The court advocates who tirelessly work on obtaining restraining orders. The counselors who help clients process their trauma. And the case managers who help figure out what’s next in the victims’ lives, starting with the basics.
Black lists some of the questions: “Do I need a job? Do I need to learn how to drive, because I’ve never been allowed to handle a vehicle? Do I need to get a GED, because I never finished school?”
Then, there are people who work at the WCA shelter – supplying a safe temporary home for abuse victims. Women and children can stay up to seven months, but the average stay is 90-120 days. The WCA also works with other community agencies to provide low-cost housing. 
“We have two buildings with a total of 30 rooms. At the end of last month we had 27 women and 20 kids that were sheltered. In a year, we serve over 200 women and children,” Black says. “Our mission is safety, healing and freedom from domestic abuse and sexual assault.”
The WCA doesn’t win them all. Some women, for whatever the reason are unable to break the cycle. And some abuse cases are not as clear-cut as others.
“We use the term ‘abuse’ because it’s a broader term. Domestic abuse is more ambiguous, because in many cases there are no black eyes or broken arms. There often is no outward sign of abuse, but it’s there. It’s all about control and the eventual outcome depends on how fixated that control is,” Black says.
“Not everybody is going to be able to break the cycle and move forward,” she says. “It takes an average of seven attempts for someone to leave an abusive situation. It’s like breaking a bad habit, such as smoking or alcohol abuse.”
But it’s the success stories that make the WCA such a valuable lifeline. Black tells a story about a mother and three daughters who moved into the WCA shelter, and some of the challenges that went with that transition. 
“I could hear the difference in their voices and the ways they interacted,” she said. “When the girls started counseling, there was anger and unpleasant interaction – particularly with the older ones. The mom gained some culinary skills and ended up taking a job in a grocery store, and you could tell that the kids were much happier. They were admiring what their mom had done.”
The work and challenges of the WCA are incredibly difficult, as Black will attest, but the victories are worth celebrating.
“I tell people that I have the best job in the world,” Black says.

SoMa Pride will return this June 7 “no matter what,” organizer Elizabeth Michael said — even if a funding shortage forces it to downsize.
The SoMa 501 nonprofit, of which Michael is executive director, launched a crowdfunding campaign in March with a goal of $20,000 to “bridge the gap” after losing “a few major funding sources.” As of Wednesday, the campaign had raised $2,320 from 42 supporters.
SoMa Pride is co-hosted by Central Arkansas Pride, which also hosts LGBTQ+ events in October, and SoMa 501. Organizers for June’s events are not alone in their crowdfunding efforts; NWA Equality, which runs Northwest Arkansas Pride, raised over $30,000 in early April to make up for lost event sponsors.
Even so, most of Northwest Arkansas Pride’s sponsors have maintained their support, which director Richard Gathright said he appreciates.
“When I started doing this in 2018, our budget was $50,000, but as we’ve grown and expectations have grown, the event’s now a little over $300,000 to put on,” Gathright said.
Michael said she won’t “point fingers” at any entities that rescinded funding, and she noted that Arkansas’ situation is not unique. Pride festivities in major cities nationwide this year have lost major corporate sponsors, such as Anheuser Busch in St. Louis and Target in Minnesota’s Twin Cities. The changes have come as state and federal officials have targeted LGBTQ+ rights and diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives.
Arkansas Legislative Black Caucus voices disappointment in Walmart’s DEI rollback

Walmart rolled back its DEI policies last year, but Gathright said the Bentonville-based retailer has never been a Northwest Arkansas Pride sponsor.
Gathright and Michael both said the funding shortages are related to the current precarity of federal funds. President Donald Trump’s administration has frozen the disbursement of grants for diversity initiatives and federal funding for hospitals, among other things. Gathright said Northwest Arkansas Pride regularly gets support from local hospitals.
Michael called economic struggles and the political climate “a perfect storm” for Pride organizing, but noted that several entities continue to support the cause, including the Little Rock Convention and Visitors Bureau.
SoMa is short for “South on Main” and encompasses Little Rock’s business district on Main Street just south of Interstate 630. Some of those businesses are LGBTQ-owned, and a Pride flag is painted on the pavement at the intersection of Main and 12th streets.
Both SoMa and Northwest Arkansas’ Pride festivities will include a parade and performance art such as live music. SoMa Pride might have fewer performers than last year if it doesn’t meet its fundraising goal, Michael said.
The event had two stages last year but is expected to have only one this year. Even so, the organizers had booked four musical acts as of Wednesday, Michael said. She added that SoMa 501 could raise money with a Pride “pre-party” or similar events, weather permitting, so “all hope is not lost.”
 LGBTQ+ persistence

Pride events and the LGBTQ+ community nationwide have not always had the amount of support from businesses, corporations or politicians that they have had in recent years, said Evelyn Rios Stafford, a Washington County justice of the peace from Fayetteville. She is Arkansas’ first and only out transgender elected official, and she said she has been attending Pride events since the early 1990s, and not just in Arkansas.

“Whether there’s corporate sponsorship or not, people were able to make that happen 30 years ago,” Rios Stafford said. “If we have to go back to that grassroots kind of organizing, I think that’s still worthwhile. I think visibility today is now more important than ever.”
Northwest Arkansas Pride has drawn tens of thousands of attendees each year for the past few years, and state Rep. Tippi McCullough, D-Little Rock, said the magnitude of the event gives her “chills just thinking about it.”
McCullough is the only out LGBTQ+ member of the Arkansas Legislature. She has seen support for LGBTQ+ Arkansans “ebb and flow” over time, she said, and she appreciates the growth of Pride festivities outside Central and Northwest Arkansas, the state’s most populous areas, and Eureka Springs, which is known as a haven for LGBTQ+ people.
McCullough’s hometown of Hot Springs will host a Pride parade June 7, and Batesville, Fort Smith and Russellville had Pride celebrations in 2024. Saline County scheduled but later canceled a Pride event last year.
“Every LGBTQ person in Arkansas should know that there is a community out there, that there are people like them and that there are people who care about them,” McCullough said.
The Legislature has passed several laws in the last few sessions that McCullough and other Democrats have criticized as unfairly targeting LGBTQ+ people. One such law from the session that just ended will allow Arkansans to sue for damages if they encounter someone in a bathroom, changing room, shelter or correctional facility who does not align with the “designated sex” of the space. Another law would protect Arkansas government employees from adverse employment action if they refuse to do something within the context of their jobs that conflicts with their “sincerely held religious beliefs,” such as providing a marriage license to a same-sex couple.

Discriminatory legislation can be “a Catch-22,” McCullough said.
“These bills being brought up every year helps, in some ways, to fuel Pride events, because there’s such a reason to make sure that we have them,” she said.
Gathright and Michael agreed that persistence and togetherness in the face of adversity are not just helpful but necessary for LGBTQ+ Arkansans.
“Something that was really heartwarming for me last year was to hear stories of 16-year-olds from rural Arkansas who came to SoMa Pride and said this is the first time they’ve been around other people like them, and the first time they felt safe and welcome being who they are,” Michael said.
Miss Major Griffin-Gracy, a well-known transgender advocate who lives in Little Rock, will be the grand marshal of this year’s SoMa Pride parade. Griffin-Gracy was present at the 1969 Stonewall riot between LGBTQ+ people and police in New York City, a pivotal event in the LGBTQ+ rights movement that advocates say paved the way for Pride celebrations.
Gathright said Pride continues to be a form of protest, especially in the current political climate.
“I’m going to keep fighting for LGBTQ rights as long as I can and keep making sure that we have Pride, that people can come to enjoy themselves, be themselves and not have to worry about much of anything,” Gathright said.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The most common question many Nebraskans have asked of state lawmakers considering legislative regulations for new medical cannabis laws is, “Why?”
At a series of public forums this month in La Vista, Omaha and Lincoln, some supporters of medical cannabis asked why state senators were even entertaining Legislative Bill 677 a half-year after Nebraskans approved legalizing and regulating medical cannabis. 
Voters overwhelmingly approved two ballot measures last November. The one to legalize medical cannabis secured 71% approval. A companion regulatory measure won with 68% of the vote.

The answer to why lawmakers are considering changing those laws largely has to do with setting aside state funds for the new regulatory commission voters approved and setting up additional guardrails in the face of bureaucratic and executive branch opposition to medical cannabis, limits on how much a ballot measure can accomplish in a single vote and continued legal challenges.
Hansen has repeatedly said the way Nebraska handles medical cannabis could become the “wild west” if the Legislature doesn’t pass LB 677, largely because of the lack of funding.
“We will essentially have nothing in the State of Nebraska,” Hansen told reporters last week. “You want to talk about denying the will of the voters, turning a blind eye to a ballot initiative that actually helps some individuals in the State of Nebraska who really need help? That’s undermining the will of the voters.”
Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers, who opposes medical cannabis and has supported efforts to stop the bill from being implemented, has argued that allowing the laws to take effect as-is would be better for the “will of the people,” which Hansen rejects as “false hope.”
The sponsors of the medical cannabis ballot measures in Nebraska support Hansen’s LB 677.
Funding for new regulatory commission
Among the top concerns for the new voter-created Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission, which has sole regulatory authority over medical cannabis, is getting the regulatory process moving so physicians can recommend the medicine and patients can legally buy it in the state.
While voters passed a regulatory measure setting a July 1 deadline to set new regulations and an Oct. 1 deadline to start licensing medical dispensaries, dispersing state funds is a power reserved to the Nebraska Legislature. This means the new regulators have no funding set aside for the new commission through the end of this fiscal year, June 30. 
The proposed state budget for the next two years would earmark an additional $30,000 for any Medical Cannabis Commission work taken on by Nebraska Liquor Control Commission employees. When voters approved creating the Medical Cannabis Commission, they assigned those additional duties to the three commissioners on the Liquor Control Commission.
But the state budget creates no new and separate line item for the Medical Cannabis Commission.
LB 677 provides a path to getting the commission more funding, though how much will be difficult in the face of a major projected budget deficit. The bill would also explicitly allow the commissions to share staff and resources.
Nebraska attorney general steps up medical cannabis opposition, regulatory bill awaits debate

Hilgers has argued the Medical Cannabis Commission should be drafting regulations anyway, despite a late March court filing from the commissioners that they have “no ability to carry out any duties” outlined in the new laws without funding, such as creating open meetings notices or paying staff.
As of March, that meant no meetings. No deliberations. No votes. No employees. No regulations.
Some state lawmakers have also questioned an assertion from Hilgers, a former speaker of the Legislature, that the Liquor Control Commission could expend its already appropriated funds to regulate cannabis and then request those funds be reimbursed next year. Some senators question whether doing so would be allowed.
The Legislature might not approve such a reimbursement, and Hilgers’ office has vowed to sue the commissioners if they begin to license medical cannabis dispensaries anyway.
Continued legal challenges
LB 677 continues to face opposition from some state senators who look to Hilgers’ ongoing and pledged legal challenges against the underlying cannabis laws as a reason for hesitancy.
However, passage of LB 677 could weaken and possibly nullify a pending appeal to the Nebraska Supreme Court, led by Hilgers and a former state senator who has long opposed marijuana. 
Hilgers speculated last week that if LB 677 passed, “it makes our job a lot more difficult to what we think should be a fair fight” in front of the Nebraska Supreme Court.
His office has alleged widespread fraud in the ballot measure campaign, which organizers have denied and a Lancaster County District Court judge widely rejected in November, after voters had weighed in.
The appeal from Hilgers’ office argues that because the district court judge found at least some signatures from four notaries that should not have been counted — not enough to disqualify the petitions — as grounds for the thousands of signatures collected by those notaries to lose a “presumption of innocence,” and require the campaign to “cure” those signatures.
None of the four targeted notaries have been criminally charged, Hilgers confirmed last week.
‘Take away this pain’: Families speak on proposed Nebraska medical cannabis regulations

Should any medical cannabis dispensaries be licensed, Hilgers’ office has planned to argue that the laws are preempted by the federal government, which continues to classify marijuana as a dangerous drug with no medical value. However, there have been steps under the Biden administration and now the Trump administration to reclassify the drug. Dozens of other states have implemented medical or recreational marijuana programs.
“I think two plus two is four, even if everyone else says two plus two is five,” Hilgers said last week.
LB 677 would also provide immunity to health care practitioners who recommend medical cannabis to patients. Under Current law, Hilgers has said he would consider such recommendations a potential “ethical violation” that could lead his office to investigate whether a recommending medical provider should lose a medical license.
The Nebraska Medical Association, in a written comment letter for LB 677 earlier this year, voiced support for the measure’s additional protections for medical providers.
New restrictions and guardrails
Securing the votes to get LB 677 out of the General Affairs Committee has required adding on a list of qualifying conditions, which excludes post-traumatic stress disorder, and prohibiting smoking as a permissible form of using medical cannabis.
Under the original ballot measure, a patient or their caregiver only needed to get sign-off from a health care provider to use medical cannabis in any form, including smoking.

While some senators and Hilgers argue smoking has never been a form of medicinal use, Nebraskans lined up one week ago to say that when they voted in November, they did so thinking all Nebraskans with a medical need could use cannabis in whatever form best worked for them. Some said they wouldn’t have voted for the ballot measures otherwise.
LB 677 would also amend the 5-ounce limit to state that no more than 2 ounces of that amount can be dried flower or bud, which could be manufactured into edibles, tinctures, ointments or other products. It would also add sales taxes to medical cannabis and direct tax revenue to property tax relief.
Hansen has told supporters that while PTSD, for instance, was left out as a “negotiating factor” to get the bill out of committee, the bill remains a “moving target.”
State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha, vice chair of the General Affairs Committee, has already filed amendments to add PTSD or to leave all conditions up to a patient and their physician.
“Medical cannabis is legal,” Cavanaugh said. “We need LB 677 to make it accessible and safe.”
Some Nebraskans have voiced concerns that leaving all regulations up to the Medical Cannabis Commission, as current law does, could lead to more restrictions than under LB 677. Part of the reason is that the governor’s two at-large appointments to the commission have opposed legislation concerning medical cannabis. One appointee opposed LB 677 at its March hearing.
Constitutional restraints
Why weren’t all guardrails considered or presented to voters in November? In part, because the Nebraska Constitution’s “single subject” requirement for ballot measures limits what could be presented to voters to begin with.

Ben Hansen of Blair, at right, speaks to attendees of a lawmaker-hosted public forum on medical cannabis at the University of Nebraska at Omaha on May 4, 2025, that he co-hosted with State Sens. Rick Holdcroft of Bellevue and John Cavanaugh of Omaha, from left. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
The ballot measures sought and created new state laws, rather than constitutional amendments, giving the Legislature the ability to amend the provisions with at least 33 votes, or a two-thirds majority. It was the third campaign in six years after numerous legislative bills stalled.
Some Nebraskans have also drawn connections between LB 677 and pending legislative efforts to water down voter-approved minimum wage increases and paid sick leave requirements.
Unlike those measures, medical cannabis supporters have partnered with Hansen.
Legislative strategy
However, the trade-off in going through the Legislature is the necessity of garnering at least 33 votes, which on this issue would likely require all 15 Democrats, one progressive nonpartisan and 17 Republicans in the officially nonpartisan Legislature.
The result would be stricter than at the ballot box, but supporters say it could be the best path forward for implementing the law.
Hansen and campaign officials have said LB 677 presents an “opportunity” to examine the medical cannabis programs in other states and create the best one for Nebraska.
  State Sen. Jared Storm of David City, center. March 26, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Hansen, a Republican with a Libertarian bent, has told supporters to share their stories and photos, mostly with his Republican colleagues, to get 33 votes. He said he’s telling his colleagues to pass LB 677 and regulate medical cannabis, or the voters will end up legalizing recreational marijuana.
State Sen. Jared Storm of David City, a lead opponent to Hansen’s LB 677 who already views it as recreational, said he and others will prepare to fight the bill, if it is scheduled, to its max eight hours during first-round debate, which he said will be “very divisive” and “very tumultuous.” 
Lawmakers are running out of time as they are set to adjourn June 9.
At a recent public forum, Hansen said incremental progress is showing “the world hasn’t ended” before lawmakers can return and expand LB 677.
“We’re not going to eat 100% of the apple,” Hansen said. “We get 75%, 80%, make sure the people who need it, you get it.”

(Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)The Colorado Legislature had a smaller emphasis on housing policy this year following the passage of splashy land use laws in 2024, but lawmakers still advanced quite a few bills related to housing, particularly for renters and first-time homebuyers.
Democrats enjoyed wide majorities in both the House of Representatives and Senate, and many of the bills passed this year had Democratic sponsorship and passed along party lines, though a few were bipartisan.
The 2025 regular legislative session ended on May 7, and Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, has until June 6 to take action on bills.

Receivership for shoddy apartments
Senate Bill 25-20 would allow third-party takeover of rundown apartment buildings that violate state laws around maintenance and habitability. The attorney general and municipal governments could petition the district court for a building to be put into receivership — during which a third party would manage and operate the property for a period of time — if the landlord demonstrates a “pattern of neglect,” including if the property lacks working ventilation, heating, lighting, or door locks, or has other health and safety hazards.
The receiver would be in charge of fixing the property’s issues and the landlord could seek to end the receivership after 90 days.
“We know there is a relationship between landlords and tenants. The landlord provides a property and the tenant pays for it,” bill sponsor Rep. Mandy Lindsay, an Aurora Democrat, said on the House floor during debate on the bill. “But in that agreement is that the property needs to be habitable.”
The bill was partially a response to a dilapidated building in Aurora owned by CBZ Management, which had longstanding safety problems and was closed by the city last year. The building also became a flashpoint in the debate over the Trump administration’s effort to conduct mass deportations.
“This bill gives tools to the attorney general and to cities and counties to be able to take care of situations where there is severe neglect,” Lindsay said.
The bill was sent to the governor on May 2.
Crack-down on rent price fixing
House Bill 25-1004 would ban the use, sale and distribution of software that uses an algorithm to set rents. That would include companies like RealPage, which is the subject of a lawsuit from Colorado and other states. Those companies use internal aggregate data from landlords around the area and then suggest rent prices based on the market. A study from the Biden administration last year found that units priced with RealPage software are about $136 more per month.
The bill passed both chambers on party-line votes, and progressive lawmakers and renters’ rights groups are urging Polis to sign it.
Reduced liability for condo construction
Lawmakers finally passed a bill related to construction defect lawsuits after multiple years of failed attempts. House Bill 25-1272 would give construction companies the choice to opt in to a program that would limit construction defect claims, which drive up project insurance costs and are said to be the reason condominium construction has plummeted in the state.
To participate in the program, builders would need to agree to inspections during the building process and provide a defect warranty to owners. The idea is that issues would be identified and addressed during construction and any errors discovered after someone moves in could be fixed quickly.
The bill was heavily amended to assuage some concerns from trial lawyers, home builders and homeowners.
Sponsors hope the bill will encourage builders to construct more condominiums, which are often more affordable options for first-time buyers priced out of the detached single-family home market.
“This is a problem that I believe we have a moral obligation to fix,” bill sponsor Rep. Shannon Bird, a Westminster Democrat, said during the bill’s debate in the House. “When you have the financial security that comes from owning your own home, you’re no longer at the whims of changing lease terms or increasing rents. We need to do better. Our state’s best answer cannot be more taxpayer-subsidized affordable housing. The market needs to work.”
The bill passed both chambers with widespread bipartisan support. It was sent to Polis on May 6 and it is almost certain he will sign it.
Boost for modular housing
The first bill Polis signed after the legislative session was Senate Bill 25-2, which concerns factory built, or modular, housing. Those structures are built in a factory to near completion and then transported to a building site. It is a faster method of construction with lower costs.
The state will set regional building codes for factory-built structures, eliminating some of the stickiest red tape for these types of builds.
“We thought one of the key housing bills that we passed provides streamlining and uniformity to make sure that this kind of housing can be built at lower cost and quicker across the state, so that we don’t have 600 different versions of modular housing. The big benefit is an economy of scale,” Polis said ahead of the bill signing Thursday.
Junk fees ban
Polis has also signed House Bill 25-1090, which requires disclosure of something’s final cost up front. That extends to rent costs, so starting in 2026 it will prohibit a landlord from not communicating to a prospective tenant extra costs on top of base rent for items like trash service, pest control and community amenity fees.
The total price would need to be advertised as one complete, accurate number, so a consumer knows what to expect to pay. Sometimes, those extra fees are revealed after a person pays an application fee or signs a lease.
These so-called “junk fees” will be deemed a deceptive practice and a person could bring legal action against a landlord who violates the law.
Earlier this year, Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser and federal regulators sued one of the state’s largest landlords, Greystar, over its use of junk fees.
“Hidden ‘junk fees’ often add up to hundreds of dollars in monthly expenses for Coloradans, and this new law cracks down on these surprise costs to save people money,” bill sponsor Rep. Emily Sirota, a Denver Democrat, said in a statement after the bill signing. “Whatever the ‘junk fee’ is disguised as, the goal is to hike up prices and drain money out of the pockets of hardworking Coloradans to increase corporate profits.”
Other housing bills passed this year include policies to allow some multifamily buildings to have just one staircase, ensure the return of security deposits to tenants in more circumstances and require building codes to follow accessibility standards.

The institute houses the university’s agriculture research arm as well as its statewide educational organization providing resources to Tennessee farmers and communities in all 95 counties. It also houses the UT College of Veterinary Medicine and the Herbert College of Agriculture.
The UT school system was set to receive more than $59 million across 58 awards from multiple federal departments and agencies, according to records reviewed by Tennessee Lookout. The grant terminations apply to $51.4 million of that total, $37.7 million of which has not yet been spent.
UT’s Knoxville campus saw 25 awards terminated, representing a loss of a combined $2.1 million in funding. Other campuses impacted include:

UT Health Science Center: 4 terminated programs ($2.6 million)
UT Chattanooga: 4 terminated programs ($1.4 million)
UT Institute for Public Service: 1 terminated program ($419,107)

“The most immediate impact has been the need to transition students and staff supported by these affected projects to alternative funding sources,” spokesperson Melissa Tindell wrote in an email to Tennessee Lookout Friday. “Essential work such as reporting, compliance and other research operations continue with adjusted support.”
A total of 23 stop work orders have been rescinded system-wide, Tindell wrote. Nine partial stop work orders are in effect, “meaning that portions of the projects cannot be completed, though the total award amount hasn’t been impacted at this time.”
Ten grants remain active, and six are “pending.” 
Campuses with active grants include:

UT Knoxville: 4 active awards ($1.5 million)
UT Chattanooga: 2 active awards ($237,650)
UT Institute of Agriculture: 4 active awards ($1.5 million)

Awards pending further review include:

UT Knoxville: 3 awards ($1.2 million)
UT Health Science Center: 1 award ($82,000)
UT Martin: 1 award ($62,245)
UT Institute of Agriculture: 1 award (value unknown)

Of the several federal agencies that terminated funding to UT grants, the USDA reclaimed by far the most funds at $26.9 million.

Federal records show one of the grants affected was a $30 million project funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture aiming to expand markets for climate-smart beef, dairy and small grazing animals across multiple states. The University of Tennessee sub-awarded $10.24 million to other universities for their roles in research meant to “support farmers’ and ranchers’ implementation and monitoring of climate-smart practices,” according to the grant summary on usaspending.gov.
Records maintained by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) indicate $30 million in “savings” from terminating the grant, but other federal records show $2.1 million already outlaid since the project started in September 2023. It’s not clear if the money spent was part of the project’s additional $6.2 million in non-federal funding. The project was supposed to conclude in September 2028.
The university’s Agricultural Leaders of Tomorrow (ALOFT) program, which sent volunteers to Southeast Asia to support agriculture education in developing countries, is another spending cut casualty. 
The program was awarded five years of funding under the U.S. Agency for International Development in 2023, but was put under a stop work order in February. The university’s webpage explaining the program now — now written in the past tense — shows its achievements from 2023 through 2025. University records show one terminated USAID program worth around $4.1 million.

Gabby Giffords on March 15, 2023. (Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks is joining the board of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, which aims to elect Democrats to state legislatures across the country.
Brinks said in a statement that the DLCC’s work was instrumental to Michigan Democrats winning their first legislative trifecta in 40 years during the 2022 midterms.
“As the first Democrat to serve as majority leader in my chamber since the 1980s, I know firsthand what Democratic majorities can achieve here in Michigan and across the country as we continue to advocate on behalf of working families,” Brinks said.
Democrats lost their trifecta when Republicans took back the majority in the Michigan House last November. Brinks has since been in a legal battle with House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richmond Township), who has refused to pass along nine bills passed during the lame duck session but not transmitted to Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer for her signature.
Brinks said electing Democrats to state legislatures is important to stand up to the administration of President Donald Trump, vowing to “maintain a blue firewall in the states that will stand against this extremism.”
Brinks is one of seven Democratic state legislators added to the board Monday. Joining her are California Speaker Robert Rivas, Colorado Senate President James Coleman, Illinois Speaker Pro Tempore Kambium Buckner, Oregon Speaker Julie Fahey, Virginia Speaker Don Scott and Wisconsin Minority Leader Greta Neubauer.
DLCC Chair Andrea Stewart-Cousins, the majority leader and president pro tempore of the New York Senate, said in a statement that Brinks “embodies the diverse expertise needed to drive and elevate our strategy to build durable state power through the end of the decade,” calling her “battle-tested.”
“The stakes couldn’t be higher, but we have the team in place to meet this moment,” Stewart-Cousins said.

(Henry Redman/Wisconsin Examiner)This story was published in partnership with the Center for Media and Democracy, 
The more than $100 million spent on this spring’s Supreme Court election in Wisconsin set a new national record for spending on a state judicial race. The figure almost doubles the previous record of $51 million, which donors poured into the Wisconsin Supreme Court race in 2023. 
“The spending in this race is an indication of just how dominant state high courts have become in the biggest political fights playing out today,” Douglas Keith, a senior counsel in the Brennan Center’s Judiciary Program, told the Center for Media and Democracy (CMD). He pointed to the “growing recognition” of the significance of state courts in ruling on both challenges to election laws and abortion rights since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade in 2022. 
The record spending on the 2025 Wisconsin race, the pathways the money traveled and the outsized influence of a few major donors raise questions about the future and fairness of judicial elections in Wisconsin and beyond. 
Outside spending 
The campaign for liberal candidate Susan Crawford — who ultimately won the election by 10 points — raised more than $28.3 million, while her conservative counterpart Brad Schimel pulled in over $15.1 million in campaign funding, according to a CMD analysis of Wisconsin Ethics Commission filings. 
Special interest and ideological political action committees (PACs) accounted for the majority of the spending, dropping almost $57 million on both the liberal and conservative candidates. Thirteen of those outside groups spent more than $1 million each (and in many cases, well over $1 million) on the race, for a total of $48.8 million — more than the combined total raised by the two campaigns. 

 
“Big money has ruined us,” Janine Geske, a retired Wisconsin Supreme Court justice, told CMD. “It distresses me. It just goes to the heart of the independence of the judiciary.” 
Several of the highest spending groups are linked to just a small number of individuals. Billionaire Charles Koch’s astroturf operation Americans for Prosperity spent more than $3.3 million, while shipping giant Richard Uihlein’s Fair Courts America super PAC spent over $4.4 million. 
Few backers drew more attention than Trump’s top campaign donor Elon Musk, who funneled nearly $18.7 million into the race to boost Schimel through his America PAC and the Building America’s Future PAC, a group he has reportedly funded in part since 2022.
“The Musk involvement helped politicize [and polarize] the race,” Charles Franklin, professor of law and director of the Marquette Law School Poll, told CMD. “That was a brand new element.” 
There was a strong turnout in the April election, with 51% of Wisconsin’s eligible voters casting ballots — remarkably high for an election in which the state Supreme Court was the highest office on the ballot. 
“Voter turnout is up because the race is important, but it’s also up because so much money is being poured into it,” Franklin said, noting a 15-year rise in turnout in the state’s elections for its highest court. 
Political party loophole 
Although Wisconsin Supreme Court elections are officially nonpartisan, the state’s Republican and Democratic parties played major roles. “It’s been so obviously a de facto partisan race for several cycles,” said Franklin, who also highlighted the significance of endorsements from President Trump and former President Obama in the election. 
The maximum amount that can be legally given to the campaign committee of a candidate running for the Wisconsin Supreme Court is $20,000. However, individuals can make unlimited contributions to a political party. Some donors use this as a legal loophole to funnel money to judicial candidates by first giving money to the state party, which then transfers the funds to the candidate’s campaign committee. 
In the most recent election, the Wisconsin Democratic Party gave more than $10.4 million to Crawford while the state GOP contributed over $9.5 million to Schimel, according to a CMD analysis of Wisconsin Ethics Commission filings. The contributions from the state parties accounted for almost two-thirds of Schimel’s overall campaign spending and more than a third of Crawford’s. 
The top donor to one of the two major political parties in Wisconsin is Diane Hendricks, who has given just under $3.6 million so far this year to the state GOP. She is the owner of Hendricks Holdings and a co-founder of ABC Roofing Supplies, the largest roofing supply company in the country. 

 
In addition to the $18.7 million Musk spent through PACs, he also gave $3 million to the Wisconsin GOP this year. Similarly, Richard Uihlein has given nearly $1.7 million to the
Wisconsin GOP in 2025 on top of the $4.4 million his PAC dropped on the race. His wife, Elizabeth Uihlein, gave more than $2.1 million to the state party. The couple each sent the maximum individual contribution of $20,000 to Schimel’s campaign as well. 
Major donations also flowed in on the Democratic side. Billionaire investor George Soros gave $2 million and Illinois Governor JB Pritzker gave $1.5 million to Wisconsin’s Democratic Party. 
Reform prospects 
The Marquette Law School Poll conducted in February found that 61% of respondents believe party contributions reduce the independence of judges. 
“It’s crucial that the public be able to look at courts and think they’re doing something different than raw politics,” Keith said. “This kind of an election makes it really hard for them to think of courts that way if the process for picking judges looks like the process for picking a U.S. senator.” 
Geske, who supports judicial elections in principle, shares that concern. “If there is no faith, we don’t have a system. It doesn’t work.” 
Yet, in that same poll, 90% of respondents said it was better to elect rather than appoint state Supreme Court justices. Wisconsin is one of 14 states that rely on nonpartisan elections to choose their Supreme Court justices, a practice it has followed since becoming a state in 1848. 
While the Marquette Law School Poll suggests there is broad public support for electing judges, record-breaking spending on those races raises concerns about judicial independence. 
The rising tide of outside spending is unlikely to recede, particularly given the U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark decision in Citizens United v. FEC (2010) allowing unlimited outside spending on elections, including for judicial races. 
“Citizens United really set us back,” Geske said. “It destroyed the ability to have an independent judicial race where people can really look at the quality of the candidate versus the politics of it.” 
In 2017, she was one of 54 judges who petitioned the Wisconsin Supreme Court for stricter ethics rules to prevent judges from hearing cases involving major campaign contributors. But since the petition was ultimately rejected, no state rule currently requires a judge’s recusal or automatic disqualification from hearing such a case. The decision to recuse is left up to each individual justice in each case. 
The U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co. (2009) held that a judge’s recusal is required when the campaign support received is so significant that it creates a “serious risk of actual bias,” but that standard has rarely been applied since the decision.
Geske had hoped that Wisconsin’s highest court would revisit the possibility of stricter ethics rules in this context but now thinks that is unlikely given the significant financial contributions several justices have received. She believes that stronger guidelines rather than requiring mandatory recusal may be a more viable option. 
Even if recusal guidelines were strengthened, Geske noted there would be practical complications if a Wisconsin Supreme Court justice stepped aside from a case. Unlike some other states, Wisconsin has no system for replacing a recused justice. If one of the seven justices steps aside, the court could be left with risking a deadlocked 3–3 decision. 
Beyond the question of independence, Keith said more could be done to enhance transparency in Wisconsin judicial elections overall, such as requiring more frequent financial disclosures. “While we know a lot about what groups were spending and how much they spent, we know very little about where their money was coming from,” he pointed out. “A lot of it is informed guesswork.” 
“The unprecedented and obscenely high amount of political money being raised and spent in Wisconsin Supreme Court elections is a fairly new and horrific development in our state,” wrote Jay Heck, executive director of Common Cause Wisconsin, in 2024. “It wasn’t always this way here and it cannot and should not continue.” 
Heck pointed out that Wisconsin enacted the Impartial Justice Act in 2009, which provided public financing for state Supreme Court campaigns in exchange for a voluntary spending cap and a ban on soliciting private contributions. However, Republican Governor Scott Walker and the GOP-controlled legislature repealed the measure and dramatically weakened Wisconsin’s campaign finance laws. 
“We went from being the progressive good government promised land to the political wasteland of the country,” Heck said. 
Common Cause has called for updating and reinstating the 2009 reforms, along with strengthening recusal rules and prohibiting coordination between campaigns and outside groups. 
A recent poll by the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign found that almost three of four Wisconsin voters want limits on outside PACs, but that reform is not possible until the Citizens United decision is overturned. 
Next year’s Supreme Court election 
Major reforms are unlikely before the next election in April 2026, when conservative Justice Rebecca Bradley will be seeking to retain her seat. Spending will likely be lower than in this year’s race given that the court’s new 4–3 liberal majority will not be in play.
However, the scale and tone of the 2025 race may influence the 2026 election and others in different ways. Geske said she knows judges who would have previously considered running for the state Supreme Court but are no longer interested. 
“When you get into these kinds of numbers and that kind of race, they’re not going to put themselves and their families through it,” she said. “It narrows the number of people who are willing to run for the court.” 
Geske said that if judicial elections had been like this when she ran in 1993, she wouldn’t have run. “When I was running, we really tried to have bipartisan support,” she said. “Now it really is: ‘Whose side are you on?’” 
“I think that will continue and, as a result, I think that big money will continue to follow.”

Tennessee state Sen. Bo Watson wants to eject undocumented children from classrooms. But first, he needs their data.
Under legislation proposed in February, students statewide could be required to submit birth certificates or other sensitive documents to secure their seats — one of several state efforts this year designed to challenge a decades-old Supreme Court precedent enshrining students’ right to a free public education regardless of their immigration status.
Watson, a Republican, argues undocumented students are a financial drain on Tennessee’s public schools even though state officials don’t know how many are enrolled there. He sees a way to find out.
“If someone is not able to produce their documentation then you would make the assumption that they are here illegally and it would allow you to begin to collect some data as to the number of students in a school system that are either undocumented or are here illegally,” Watson said in an interview with The 74. “So that’s sort of a starting point for us, in terms of trying to understand what the financial cost is.”
The controversial legislation, which has drawn protests and could jeopardize more than $1.1 billion in federal money for Tennessee schools, has also sparked alarm among privacy advocates who warn efforts to compile data on students’ immigration status could be used not just to deny them an education — it could also fall into the hands of Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

As the Trump administration ramps up deportation efforts and tech billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency reportedly works to create a “master database” of government records to zero in on migrants, civil rights advocates warn that education data about immigrant students, such as home addresses, could be weaponized.
“That would be an easy grab for federal officials,” said Cody Venzke, a senior policy counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union focused on surveillance, privacy and technology. “Schools are a geographically based governmental service and that makes that data particularly vulnerable.”
Republican lawmakers in Tennessee, Oklahoma and Idaho seek to compel educators to collect records about students’ immigration status that have traditionally been outside their purview. Meanwhile, reams of existing information about immigrant students — including their birth locations and how long they’ve lived in the U.S. — could serve as proxies to help authorities identify and track undocumented students or those with undocumented family members, said Elizabeth Laird, the director of equity in civic technology at the nonprofit Center for Democracy and Technology.

For Laird, a recent executive order signed by President Donald Trump to merge federal and state data, surveillance-driven immigration enforcement efforts and irregular data collection efforts across federal agencies set off alarm bells. Laird recently published a white paper on schools’ legal obligations to keep sensitive student data secure.
“What we’ve seen in the last three months is unprecedented access to and consolidation of data about people across a number of federal agencies, and that means taxpayers, it means student loan borrowers, it means Social Security recipients,” Laird said.
Immigration enforcement officials have already turned to data to deport international college students, unaccompanied minors who came to the U.S. without their parents and immigrant taxpayers whose IRS returns were once considered absolutely confidential. Additional irregular data collection efforts have been carried out across federal agencies in the name of rooting out fraud and waste.
“You don’t have to go very far to see the connection between the data environment that they’ve created in the name of fraud, waste and abuse and how it relates to immigration enforcement,” Laird said. As Republicans argue that immigrants are wrongly accessing benefits and causing financial turmoil in public schools, she said, “Immigration has become a fraud, waste and abuse issue.”

 Data collection in the surveillance age

At just over 100 days into Trump’s second term, there is no evidence that K-12 students’ data have become a specific target for immigration enforcement, even after ICE scrapped a longstanding policy this year that restricted agents from carrying out raids at schools, churches and other “sensitive locations.”
Watson told The 74 his legislation is about ejecting undocumented children from public schools and not about removing them from the country altogether. But a recent Center for Democracy and Technology survey suggests that educators even pre-Trump were already sharing student information with immigration enforcement officials. Some 17% of teachers reported that their schools provided student grades, attendance and discipline information to immigration authorities last school year, the survey found, as well as information collected by digital surveillance tools on school-issued laptops.

A recent executive order seeks to make vast data collection a lot easier. With a stated purpose of promoting government efficiency, Trump signed an executive order in March to eliminate “information silos” between federal agencies that have historically existed to prevent the government from abusing its access to Americans’ sensitive personal information, including adoption records, citizenship information, IP addresses and student loan histories.
Under the order, a whistleblower claims the Trump administration is building a database of individual people unlike anything the U.S. government has had before — and one that’s been compared to the tactics of authoritarian regimes.
“Most breathtaking,” Venzke said, is the Trump administration’s efforts to gain unfettered access to information held at state agencies. Experts said the broadly defined order could apply to schools, state education agencies and third-party contractors.
The U.S. Department of Education generally doesn’t maintain large datasets of student data beyond financial aid records — which include students’ and family members’ Social Security Numbers and Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers. Tax ID numbers are used by taxpayers without Social Security numbers to pay taxes regardless of their immigration status but could be leveraged as an indicator that someone is undocumented.
Will Filling Out Student Aid Form Target Undocumented Parents for Trump’s Mass Deportations?

The real student data trove, however, resides at the state level. In fact, states have maintained data about foreign-born students for years and the threat of immigration enforcement is “not limited to undocumented students,” according to the CDT white paper. More than 1,400 international college students in the U.S. lost their visas in the first months of the Trump administration, although it recently reversed those revocations in the face of court challenges.
State education data is used to populate the U.S. Department of Education’s EdFacts initiative, which centralizes state-by-state information to guide policy development and includes information about students who were born outside the U.S. and have been enrolled in U.S. schools for less than three years. Though the data states provide to the federal government is aggregated, Laird warned that local education agencies could be compelled to share the underlying records that identify specific students.
Schools also identify immigrant children and English learners in order to receive federal grants that support their learning. Additionally, under the federal Every Student Succeeds Act, which requires students nationwide to take standardized tests, immigrant students who have lived in the U.S. for less than a year can opt out of the English assessments — waivers the CDT noted “can only be provided if schools know who these students are.”

 Students cautioned against speaking out

Despite the recent executive order’s stated goal of preventing fraud, Laird said the mandate mirrors a 2019 executive order, issued during Trump’s first term, which sought to consolidate data for the explicit purpose of streamlining immigration enforcement. At least four states — South Dakota, South Carolina, Iowa and Nebraska — agreed to share driver’s license data with the Trump administration as it sought to pinpoint the citizenship statuses of every adult residing in the U.S.
Julie Sugarman, associate director for K-12 education research at the nonprofit Migration Policy Institute said educators nationwide have taken steps to ensure students’ records aren’t used beyond their intended purposes, including for immigration enforcement. But the Trump administration’s vast data collection efforts present an unprecedented situation.
“States generally would have a full spreadsheet that includes identifying information, so yeah, if the government was to go to states and ask for that, that would set off huge alarm bells,” Sugarman said.
“We’re in a time when the government is asking for things that they’ve never asked for before,” she continued. “So I’m really not sure what might happen if the government went to a state and said, ‘Give us your entire database with every piece of information about every student in public schools.’ “
Digital surveillance tools being used by federal immigration officials to track down deportation targets — including social media monitoring software — have become widespread in K-12 schools. Digital surveillance tools, which track students’ online communications and web searches, could offer valuable data to immigration officials, Laird said. In some instances, students’ digital communications are automatically shared with local law enforcement officers who, in communities nationwide, have been increasingly deputized to help enforce federal immigration laws.
Immigration Agents Inside Schools? Why Some Activists Are Warning Undocumented Students About Trump’s Policy Shifts

Social media surveillance tools used by K-12 schools and university educators have previously been leveraged to surveil student protests.
In the last few months, some K-12 students have already been warned to be careful about what they post on the internet as the government moved to revoked the visas of foreign-born college students for their participation in protests, social media posts and writing for college newspapers.
Martin Milne, president of the Connecticut-based Assist Scholars, said his organization has told international K-12 students that their ability to learn in the U.S. is conditional — and can be eliminated at a moment’s notice. The nonprofit scholarship organization currently helps nearly 200 international students enroll in U.S. private secondary schools.
“We’ve sent a really general reminder to students applying for visas to be particularly mindful that obtaining a student visa is really a privilege and it’s not a right and it comes with important responsibilities,” Milne said, echoing language recently used by the Trump administration. “And that if they abide by the responsibilities that come with being a visa holder, they’re not going to draw attention to themselves.”

 Tennessee wants Trump’s permission

Back in Tennessee, a Republican-led effort to collect data about undocumented students and bar their access to public schools has stalled. Despite claims that immigrant students are a drain on school resources, a state audit warned the move could cost Tennessee as much as $1.1 billion in federal education money if officials fail to comply with federal laws that prohibit discrimination based on race or national origin.
Still, the climate caused by the legislative effort and Trump’s deportation efforts has students on edge, Kyle Carrasco, a high school government and economics teacher in Chattanooga, told The 74. Although his school doesn’t ask students about their immigration status, Carrasco said he suspects at least some are undocumented and several have already had family members taken into ICE custody.
Students Fearful After Posts Threaten to Report Undocumented Peers to ICE

“At the end of the day, immigrants regardless of documentation status are paying taxes, they’re paying into the system that they — if these bills become law — will be withheld from,” Carrasco said. “So I don’t necessarily understand the reasoning and the logistics beyond why we need to be identifying and tracking these students.”
Watson, the state senator, hasn’t given up, telling The 74 he hopes his bill will resurface after local officials receive assurance they won’t be penalized by the federal government. In an April 21 letter to the U.S. Department of Education, state Fiscal Review Executive Director Bojan Savic asked if Tennessee risked losing federal money for its failure to comply with civil rights laws.
With Trump in charge, Watson said he didn’t think the letter was necessary.
“This bill, were it to be enacted into law, would align with the strategies that the current administration is exercising,” Watson said, “and it would not put our federal dollars in jeopardy.”",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-08-at-12.02.29 PM-1024x977.png,,,2025-05-12 06:05:11.979023

The reporting, relying largely on ex-Fetterman staffers including his former chief of staff Adam Jentleson, painted a troubling picture. Since taking office, it alleged, Fetterman has displayed signs of paranoia, delusional thinking and erratic behavior, sometimes seeming unaware of his surroundings altogether. Jentleson said staff were concerned that he stopped following his doctors’ treatment plans following a stroke near the end of his 2022 Senate campaign and a subsequent hospitalization for clinical depression.
Fetterman strongly repudiated the article’s claims.
“New York Magazine decided to platform a grudge fashioned by best friends and disgruntled staffers unwilling to put their names on it,” Fetterman told the Capital-Star in an email. “If there were genuine concerns, they’d pick up the phone and call me, not the press. My actual doctors and my family affirmed that I’m in good health.”
A spokesperson for Fetterman added that the Pennsylvania Democrat has “always been fully transparent about the health issues that impacted his ability to work, and he will continue to be open should his circumstances ever change … He, his family, and his doctors have affirmed that he is in good health. Any anonymously sourced claims suggesting otherwise are untrue and to smear.” 
Since the article’s publication, other reports have emerged on Fetterman’s behavior. The Associated Press reported on a recent outburst at a meeting with union officials, and anonymous former staffers told the Inquirer that Fetterman has been “disengaged” from his duties as senator.
Fetterman has missed 18.9% of floor votes since taking office. That includes a number of votes during his six-week hospitalization for depression in 2023. According to the nonpartisan vote-tracker GovTrack, the median senator misses 2.7% of votes while in office.
“I’ve made roughly 90% of the votes since January,” Fetterman said in a statement sent to the Capital-Star. “The missed votes were overwhelmingly procedural, my vote was never determinative and limited to travel days.” 
The allegations about Fetterman surfaced as Democrats broadly have faced criticism for sweeping concerns about members’ fitness for office under the rug. Most prominently, the party was roiled after President Joe Biden’s disastrous 2024 debate performance appeared to confirm fears in the electorate that he was cognitively incapable of serving a second term. Biden ultimately stepped aside in the presidential race, though Fetterman remained one of his strongest defenders. 
That followed the 2023 death of then-Sen. Dianne Feinstein, at 90-years-old, who had been the subject of reports of diminishing cognitive capacity. More recently, House Democrats backed 75-year-old Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.) over Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) to serve as the top party member on the House Oversight Committee, despite concerns about his age and health. Connolly gave up the seat on the committee and said last month that he won’t seek reelection, citing a return of his esophageal cancer. The phenomenon hasn’t been limited to the Democratic side of the aisle. Republican congresswoman Kay Granger of Texas missed more than five months of votes last year while living in a memory care and assisted living facility.
‘Disgraceful smears’
Some prominent political figures have rushed to Fetterman’s defense, including Pennsylvania’s junior senator, Republican Dave McCormick. 
“It’s time to put politics aside and stop these vicious, personal attacks against Senator Fetterman, his wife, and his health,” McCormick wrote on social media Friday morning. “While we have many differences, we are both committed to working together to achieve results for the people of Pennsylvania and make their lives better. He is authentic, decent, principled, and a fighter. These disgraceful smears against him are not the John that I know and respect.”
A few elected officials from outside of the Keystone State from different sides of the aisle have also spoken out in support of Fetterman
“The only reason for the coordinated campaign against Senator John Fetterman is his unapologetic pro-Israel politics. Let’s call it what it is,” U.S. Rep. Ritchie Torres (D-NY) wrote on social media Friday. “As someone who has struggled with depression my whole adult life, I can tell you that if you truly care about someone’s mental health, leaking hit pieces against them is a strange way of showing it.”
U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) also chimed in go to bat for Fetterman. 
“John Fetterman and I have our differences, but he’s a decent and genuine guy,” Cotton wrote. “The radical left is smearing him with dishonest, vicious attacks because he’s pro-Israel and they only want reliable anti-Israel politicians. Disgraceful.”
T.J. Rooney, a Democratic consultant and former chairman of the Pennsylvania state party, has spoken approvingly of Fetterman’s honesty about his health problems and iconoclastic political views.
“One of the ways he’s unique is he made all of his successes himself. Politics bent to him. John didn’t bend to the politics,” Rooney told the Capital-Star.
But he rejected the assertion by Fetterman and others that the reporting is part of an orchestrated attack. 
“I think people are reading a whole lot more into this than it’s deserving of,” Rooney said. “It’s just so f—–g sad. There are times in life when people find themselves in positions in life that they are not well suited to.”
For Fetterman’s first two years in the U.S. Senate, he served alongside Bob Casey. During Casey’s farewell address in December, Fetterman lauded Casey, who was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 2006, as a mentor and said that he was by his side when Fetterman had a stroke: “He lent me his voice when I was learning how to speak again. I never forgot that.”
When Fetterman was facing criticism from fellow Democrats earlier in Trump’s term for backing some of his cabinet selections, Casey defended him and called him a “very good senator” and said that he thinks he’d “do the right thing when it comes to protecting the most vulnerable and protecting the middle class.”

The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that a memo from Jentleson noted that Fetterman’s relationships with colleagues began to suffer, including his “notable friendship” that “deteriorated” with Casey.
Casey told the Capital-Star Friday that “John and I have always had different styles and approaches to the job, but we had a strong relationship while I was in the Senate,” when asked about Fetterman’s fitness and current job performance. 
But some political insiders have called for his resignation, including Jonathan Last, the editor of the Bulwark who once saw Fetterman as a model for the future of the Democratic Party. Cumberland County Democratic Party chair Matt Roan also called for Fetterman’s resignation in an op-ed in March, before the New York Magazine report. The day that article was published, he reposted his own editorial and wrote, “I’ve been here for a month.”
Gov. Josh Shapiro has taken a more measured approach. 
“I think the best judge of Sen. Fetterman’s health is Sen. Fetterman and his family, and I’ll leave it to them to discuss that,” Shapiro said to reporters during a press conference in Philadelphia Thursday. 
When asked what he thought about Fetterman’s job performance, Shapiro said “again, I think it’s a question for Sen Fetterman and his family and the people of Pennsylvania to weigh in on.”
Gov. Tom Wolf and state Sen. Sharif Street (D-Philadelphia), who is chairman of the Pennsylvania Democratic Party, declined to comment.
Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer’s (D-NY) did not respond to questions sent to his press team by the Capital-Star.
‘A lot of noise’ 
Since taking office in 2023, Fetterman’s standing among Democrats in his own state has been rocky. 
Recent polling shows Fetterman still has support in the commonwealth, even improving marginally since he took office with around 50% approving of him compared to 35% disapproving in March. But a recent poll conducted before the New York Magazine story suggests that’s despite his support sinking among Democrats.
Though he ran as a progressive, Fetterman has since drawn ire from the left wing of his own party. Early opposition was over his staunch defense of Israel’s actions in Gaza. He was also the only Democrat to vote to confirm Attorney General Pam Bondi, who sidestepped questions about whether Trump lost the 2020 election during her confirmation hearings, and he criticized members of his party who wanted to force a government shutdown in March over opposition to federal cuts.
In February, just weeks into the Trump administration, he was denounced along with Trump and Elon Musk, leader of the Department of Government Efficiency, by speakers at a Pittsburgh protest organized by progressive activists. While protesters decried what they saw as executive overreach, and Fetterman’s failure to oppose it, the senator saw it differently.
“There isn’t a constitutional crisis, and all of these things ― it’s just a lot of noise,” Fetterman told HuffPost in February. “That’s why I’m only gonna swing on the strikes.”
Fetterman’s term in the Senate doesn’t end until 2029, and in politics nothing is certain. But questions about his fitness to serve could impact what will likely be an important race for both parties. Pennsylvania is one of only two states, along with Michigan, to have a Republican and Democratic senator, though a third, Maine, has a Republican and independent who caucuses with Democrats.

Roan told the Capital-Star he’s concerned Fetterman’s job performance will further dragging down voters’ confidence after what Roan called “feckless” opposition by congressional Democrats to Trump’s lawlessness.
“A lot of the public isn’t so hot on Democrats right now, so we need people in those slots who can mount a more effective response to Trump’s abuses,” Roan said. 
Having led the local effort to turn out voters for Fetterman in 2022, Roan said Fetterman’s term so far has been a disappointment that he fears could erode support for Democrats in down-ballot races.
“Every time our elected officials let us down it negatively affects our donors and their support,” Roan said.
Since the start of his Senate campaign, Fetterman has been a fundraising juggernaut. However, in the first three months of 2025, his campaign raised just over $395,000, which was the lowest amount in a full quarter since he declared for the seat in February 2021.
While a sitting senator in the middle of his term isn’t a priority for donors, Roan said, it could signal doubt about Fetterman’s viability as a candidate going forward.
Rooney, the Democratic consultant, wouldn’t weigh in on calls for Fetterman’s resignation, but said his next campaign should be secondary to his wellbeing.
“Does he have a future in elected office? I don’t know, but that’s not what’s important right now,” he said. “We just want the guy to get some help. He’s got a great family, a wife who obviously cares a lot about him, kids who adore him.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-2200949176-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-12 06:05:11.979023

Guthrie, R-Bowling Green, is chairman of a House committee that on Tuesday is set to start proposing $880 billion in federal budget savings over the next 10 years. Guthrie’s assignment will be impossible, experts say, without cutting the federal-state program that pays for almost 1 in 3 Kentuckians’ health care.
“Medicaid has become important to local economies throughout the state and a key pathway to health care for many Kentuckians,” says the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce in a statement last week that also mentions the Chamber’s “long voiced concerns about the impact of rising Medicaid costs on Kentucky’s finances.” 
“Efforts to control Medicaid spending will be necessary,” says the pro-business group whose top recent priority has been continuing to lower Kentucky’s income tax. “Policymakers, however, will need to take a balanced approach with input from key stakeholders.”
Guthrie, a West Point graduate and former state legislator, is not publicly discussing specifics ahead of the markup, a spokesperson for the committee said Friday. 
“Chairman Guthrie and Energy and Commerce Republicans are ready to strengthen, secure, and sustain Medicaid for generations to come and for the Americans the program was intended to serve,” said Matt VanHyfte, the director of communications for the House Energy and Commerce Committee.
Sounding a common GOP theme, he said Medicaid was intended “to assist the ‘traditional population’ which are expectant mothers, children, low-income seniors, and people with disabilities.”

Medicaid was expanded beyond that traditional role in 2010 when Congress — with no Republican votes — enacted the Affordable Care Act, a law that became known as Obamacare.
By then the number of uninsured had topped 46 million, nearing 1 in 5 Americans; medical bills were increasingly pushing sick people into bankruptcy as hospitals shifted costs onto the dwindling share of insured patients.

Under the Medicaid expansion, the federal government offered to pay 100% of the costs for state Medicaid programs to begin covering low-income, able-bodied adults who can’t afford or who lack access to private health insurance. 
‘Salvation for small rural hospitals’
Kentucky, a poor state with lots of sick people, has aggressively embraced the new option, and that has “changed the dynamics considerably,” says Mark Birdwhistell, an expert on Medicaid and the University of Kentucky’s senior vice president for health and public policy. 
The Medicaid expansion has been “a great benefit to the health care delivery system at the University of Kentucky and all over Kentucky, particularly Southeastern Kentucky,” Birdwhistell told the Lantern. “It’s been a salvation for small rural hospitals in Eastern Kentucky and good for health outcomes as well,” Birdwhistell said.
The rate of uninsured Kentuckians fell from 14.4% in 2013 to 6.1%  in 2015, the year after the Medicaid expansion took effect. In 2023, 5.6% of Kentuckians’ were uninsured compared to 8% of the U.S. population.
Birdwhistell has been spending a lot of time in Washington sharing his knowledge with Kentucky’s congressional delegation and with staff of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services which oversees Medicaid, Medicare and the Children’s Health Insurance Program.

In an interview with the Lantern, Birdwhistell discussed some of the Medicaid proposals the Republicans who control Congress are considering as they look for savings to pay for continuing tax cuts enacted in 2017 during President Donald Trump’s first term. 
Lowering federal share would be $1.4 billion hit to Kentucky
The proposal that would be the “most problematic” for Kentucky, Birdwhistell said, is one to lower the matching funds the federal government pays for the Medicaid expansion. After paying 100% of the expansion for a few years, the federal match was lowered to 90%, leaving states to pick up 10% of the expansion cost.
By contrast, the federal government picks up 71% of the cost of insuring Kentucky’s traditional Medicaid population. (Kentucky receives a higher federal match than most states because it’s based on a state’s per capita income and Kentucky’s is comparatively low.)  Of Kentucky’s $19 billion Medicaid budget, almost $15 billion comes from the federal government and about $4 billion from state sources.
If Congress decides to lower the expansion match to the lower share for the rest of the program, Kentucky would have to provide an additional $1.4 billion to continue covering the almost 500,000 people in the expansion, according to an estimate by the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services. “It would be difficult for the General Assembly to come up with that amount of money,” said Birdwhistell.
Birdwhistell said he understands why some members of Congress question the more generous federal match for the Medicaid expansion, but said, “In Kentucky, in my opinion, the benefits outweigh the downside.”
Block granting Medicaid would threaten traditional population
Another option being floated would impose per capita caps on federal funding for Medicaid, in essence a block grant based on the size of the covered population, which Birdwhistell said would likely cause negative impacts for the traditional Medicaid population especially the disabled and frail elderly, new mothers and babies who need neonatal intensive care.
Under a cap, some patients could be denied care if their costs exceeded a designated amount, he said, making it difficult to administer and producing “negative policy outcomes.”
If a per capita cap is the Republicans’ chosen alternative, Birdwhistell said it would be better to apply it to the expansion population who are healthier, younger and cheaper to insure.
Among the almost 1 million Kentuckians covered by traditional Medicaid is Caden Plemons, 19, of Bowling Green. He has Down Syndrome and autism and is “primarily nonverbal,” says his mother Rheanna Plemons who worries lawmakers will subject Medicaid to “broad, sweeping cuts, without doing any research to ensure that it’s not decreasing the standard of care for individuals with intellectual disabilities.”

Caden also receives services through Kentucky Medicaid’s Michell P. waiver, which helps people who have intellectual disabilities live more independently. Caden’s community living supports include  staff to help him with daily tasks like dressing and going to appointments and getting out to enjoy go carts and other activities. 
“He’s thriving in the community because of the services that we have received over the last 19 years,” Plemons said. 
Caden’s waiver also covers respite care so Plemons and her husband can “take a break every now and then.” 
“Sometimes people don’t realize: if you have a child who has a severe disability, such as my child, that’s 24 hours a day care, seven days a week,” Plemons said. “I work. My husband works full time. So if we want to take a break, even to go out to have dinner with just the two of us, then somebody’s got to be there with Caden, even though he’s 19 years old.” 
Work requirement expands bureaucracy
Another option under consideration for trimming Medicaid costs is a work requirement. Birdwhistell estimates that more than half of able-bodied Kentuckians covered by Medicaid — the working poor — already hold low-wage jobs. The income limit for most working-age adults to qualify for Medicaid is 138% of the federal poverty level. That works out to $44,367 a year for a family of four which “in some areas of the state is quite a few people,” said Birdwhistell.
Enforcing a Medicaid work requirement would require funding an expanded bureaucracy to keep up with new reporting demands and insure compliance, Birdwhistell said. 
The Republican-dominated Kentucky legislature this year enacted a Medicaid work requirement that will be up to Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s administration to bring online.

Critics view work requirements as a smokescreen for using red tape to push people off the Medicaid rolls. 
Megan Rorex, a licensed clinical social worker and therapist in Bowling Green, predicts new reporting demands would snag her Medicaid-covered clients. Many of them work multiple part-time jobs, often in the restaurant industry, and would lack the time or bandwidth to keep up with an additional layer of paperwork in a program that she considers already overcomplicated. “Any bureaucratic policy that’s unnecessary is a problem to navigate if you’re already working multiple jobs. It adds another layer of stigma and stress,” she said.
Provider taxes and state directed payments
Some Republicans, including Russell Vought, director of the Office of Management and Budget and an author of the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 agenda for the second Trump administration, want to limit states’ use of levies on health care providers — called provider taxes —  to leverage higher Medicaid funding from the federal government. 
Kentucky levies a number of provider taxes that bring additional federal Medicaid funds into the state and pay for state directed payments that increase hospitals’ Medicaid compensation to levels that on average are what private insurers would pay for the same services. Directed payments bring $5.5 billion a year to Kentuck providers, most of it from the federal government.
So far, congressional discussion has focused on capping provider taxes at 5% of hospital patient revenue which would not affect Kentucky because provider tax rates here are below 5%, Birdwhistell said.
Kentucky is using these payments to incentivize quality improvements, such as more frequent well-child visits and screenings for disease. Hospitals must meet the quality objectives to qualify for the extra funding, which Birdwhistell says has been “extremely successful” in transforming UK Healthcare into a “value-based organization.” He said he’s advising federal officials that Kentucky’s use of provider taxes to improve quality are models worth replicating in other states.
Slow return on investment
A complaint voiced by some Republican state lawmakers during this year’s session in Frankfort is that Medicaid spending increases each year —  almost $2.6 billion budgeted from Kentucky’s General Fund in fiscal year 2024 — without producing improvements in health outcomes
Birdwhistell said it takes a long time to realize the return on investment in health care. “These are generational issues. It takes a person’s lifetime before you can say what the savings were.”
And Kentuckians are inching out of the nation’s basement on some health indicators.
In 2024, Kentucky advanced to 41st among the 50 states — up from 45th in 2016-2021 — in America’s Health Rankings, an annual study by the United Healthcare Foundation based on a variety of health, behavioral and socioeconomic metrics. 
On the upside, 

The rate of colorectal screenings in Kentucky rose from 20th nationally in 2022 to 10th in 2024.
Kentucky’s obesity rank improved from 48th in 2022 to 40th in 2023. 
And Kentucky’s drug-related deaths declined from 47th highest among the states in 2022 to 45th in 2024.  

Kentucky ranked 16th nationally in availability of primary care providers last year, down from 11th in 2023.
The study also identifies plenty of room for improvement. Kentucky ranked 49th for adults with multiple chronic conditions in 2023 and 45th for percentage of households experiencing food insecurity in 2024.
The politics 
While Guthrie’s role in potential Medicaid cuts is not expected to hurt his chances next year for reelection to a 10th term, Republicans representing swing districts in Congress could face a voter backlash, and some are refusing to vote for Medicaid rollbacks pushed by more conservative colleagues. Republicans’ narrow margin in the House means even a few defectors could doom budget provisions, while a few midterm defeats next year could give Democrats control of the chamber.
Candidate Trump promised to protect Medicaid, and the White House reiterated that promise in March, but  Trump also is urging Congress to enact the House budget blueprint that he  calls the  “big beautiful bill” — goals that appear to be in conflict.
Guthrie will be a “key player,” says Birdwhistell, as his committee works this week to move the House budget proposal closer to a vote by the full House. 
  Tres Watson
Tres Watson, a former spokesperson for the Republican Party of Kentucky, echoed the talking point  that Guthrie and many Republicans  are working to return Medicaid to its original, pre-Affordable Care Act, “reining in what many Republicans view as out of control entitlement spending, getting away from what was originally intended to be … a trampoline, not a mattress,” Watson said. 
Kentucky’s top Democrat, Gov. Andy Beshear, has joined Democratic governors in calling on Congress to protect Medicaid funding. In a Democratic Governors Association press call last week, Beshear, the group’s vice chair, told reporters that “gutting Medicaid would impact families in a substantial way.” He said half of Kentucky children and 70% of long-term care costs in Kentucky are covered by Medicaid. 
“Massive cuts to Medicaid is an attack on rural America, and if they do it, these Republican representatives and senators are saying they don’t believe that the people of rural America deserve the same access to health care as those in urban America,” Beshear said. “Certainly it would devastate my state, but it would devastate so many of our communities in every single state across the United States.”
‘The only system in the world like it’
  Ben Chandler (Foundation for a Healthy Kentucky photo)
The fate of rural hospitals is bound to weigh on Republicans who were sent to Washington from red states. Even if hospitals are not forced to close, Medicaid cuts could force hospitals to lose services, says Ben Chandler, who retired last year as president and CEO of the Foundation for a Healthy Kentucky. Before that he was Kentucky attorney general and auditor and represented the state’s 6th Congressional District from 2004 to 2013.
For Chandler the debate highlights the need for broad reform that would move the U.S. away from relying on employers to provide health coverage through a for-profit insurance industry that wields enormous influence on Capitol Hill.
“It’s ridiculous we don’t have Medicare for all or whatever you want to call it,” said Chandler who voted against the Affordable Care Act in 2010 because a proposal for a government-run “public option” health insurance plan was removed from the bill as a concession to the insurance industry and its supporters.
Chandler called the U.S. system “accidental,” born of World War II wage caps that inspired employers to compete for workers by offering a hospitalization benefit.
The U.S. spends twice as much on health care per capita as other large, wealthy nations while U.S. health outcomes are far worse than those in other nations. 
Says Chandler, “It’s the only system in the world like it.”

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)The indefinite suspension of 20 degree programs and concentrations at Rhode Island College (RIC) — including Portuguese, art history, and Latin American studies — surprised some people on campus. 
But the low enrollment in those programs was obvious, according to an April 16 email to the campus community by RIC President Jack Warner.
“I understand that change of this kind is often a source of trepidation,” Warner wrote. “I can’t emphasize enough that this work should be a regular part of our housekeeping processes; it only seems new and novel because it has not been done for so long.”
Warner’s email linked to a 32-page report conducted by the RIC Provost’s Productivity and Efficiency team to comply with statewide policy for academic program review. The Office of the Postsecondary Commissioner (OPC) oversees public higher ed in Rhode Island and mandates that schools review their offerings “no less frequently than every six years.” 
But such an exhaustive program review is “something we have not done in many years,” Warner wrote.
Students in affected programs can complete their studies, and courses and minors in the affected topics will still be offered, Warner said. But when the new academic year starts in the fall, no new students can enroll as majors in these programs — a process known as “teach-out.” The majority of the affected RIC programs have awarded fewer than five degrees in each year since 2021. Neither Francophone studies or respiratory therapy, for instance, have awarded a baccalaureate degree since 2021.    
Under statewide policy, programs that haven’t awarded at least 11 associate or bachelor’s degrees, six master’s, or four doctorates over a three-year period are subject to elimination, merging with other programs, or continued review. The RIC report recommended consolidating 15 programs and shuttering the 20 others.
Warner said the curricular spring cleaning is not expected to impact faculty positions, and that the move “was not an immediate cost-cutting measure.”
Students hold protests
Postsecondary Education Commissioner Shannon Gilkey said in an emailed statement that the program review process is “consistent with practices among colleges and universities across the U.S.”
Best practice or not, the maneuver left some RIC faculty and students flabbergasted with some claiming the process was performed less transparently than Warner suggested. Dozens of students held a “Save Our Majors” protest at the Rhode Island State House on April 24.
“Why can’t we have a say about what majors get shut down?” Hak Kay, a gender studies and film major said at the protest as quoted in RIC’s student newspaper, The Anchor.
Rhode Island College students protested at the State House on April 24 — the same day that had been slated for a celebration of RIC Day at the State House, until the event was canceled out of respect for the death of former Senate President Dominick Ruggerio on April 21.
Still, the Rhode Island Senate praised RIC in a resolution passed May 6, one led by its freshly elected President Valarie Lawson, also a RIC alum. The resolution stated RIC was “on the cutting edge of programs in cybersecurity, biotechnology, data science and artificial intelligence.”

Vincent Bohlinger, a RIC film studies professor, said in an interview the process was inconsistent with the college’s internal policies. Bohlinger’s program survived the efficiency study for now, as did 21 other underenrolled programs included in the provost’s report but spared from discontinuation or consolidation. 
All programs of study included in the report began filling out reviews in January after being identified as underenrolled, according to RIC’s website. Faculty members who needed to fill out information for their programs’ reviews had some troubles with the process, Bohlinger claimed.
“It was really like building a plane while it’s on the runway,” Bohlinger said. “The templates were changed, data was updated, they changed the deadlines, they moved them back, and then they moved it up for some people. It was really chaotic. …When the end game is actually suspending programs and reducing the options that students have for academic study and for career paths, it seems like process becomes more crucial than ever.” 
Bohlinger objected to the timing of the report’s release in spring, when students are deciding which colleges to attend.
“RIC is cutting 20 programs. That’s the headline,” he said.  
Dante DiGregorio, a junior majoring in political science, thought the school should redo the evaluations of low-enrolled classes and, like Bohlinger, claimed RIC did not follow either internal rules or the specifics of the OPC review policy. 
“I think they should either suspend it or redo it, because they want to do this every year, and if this is how they did the first time, how will they do it the next time?” DiGregorio said. “Procedurally, it was just awful.”
DiGregorio’s comments came after an April 29 State House press conference hosted by Rep. Karen Alzate, a Pawtucket Democrat and member of the Rhode Island Black, Latino, Indigenous, Asian-American and Pacific Islander (RIBLIA) Caucus. 
Alzate, a 2013 RIC graduate, took to Room 135 of the State House to decry the cuts and noted that RIC is the first federally designated Hispanic Serving Institution in Rhode Island. Evaporating programs like foreign languages doesn’t make sense, she said, especially in the current political climate.
“How are we making ourselves competitive when we’re getting rid of something that is so important right now because of what’s happening with the federal administration?” Alzate said after the presser.
Alzate couldn’t argue against the low enrollment, but she questioned if any outreach efforts were initiated to connect with potential students. “What were you doing in order to get students to come to RIC who will major in these things?” she said.
Were low enrollment programs ignored while cybersecurity promoted?
Alzate had several allies in the audience, including Rep. June Speakman, a Warren Democrat. In a phone interview, Speakman said her solidarity with Alzate derived partially from her own experiences as a political science professor at Roger Williams University in Bristol, where the school conducted a similar program review in 2023 that identified underenrollment in programs flagged for potential phaseout. (Full disclosure: This reporter previously worked at the same university during the time of the program review.)
Smaller, private colleges like Roger Williams University are more likely to lack the resources to sustain less popular offerings in the humanities or liberal arts, especially in recent years. The post-COVID era saw enrollment patterns slide downward by 10% from 2012 to 2022 — a reduction of about two million students nationwide.

Humanities often bear the brunt of the cuts at state-funded colleges and universities too. 2023 data from the American Academy of Arts and Sciences showed that humanities graduates make up a small chunk of the nationwide workforce, ranging from 1.9% in Mississippi to 8.3% in Vermont. Rhode Island had 5.8% of full-time workers holding humanities degrees.
The interaction of economic constraints and student demand were not lost on Speakman, who sits on the New England Board of Higher Education. She understands how intense fiscal pressure can influence administrative decisions to cut courses. A hypothetical philosophy classroom with only three students in it, Speakman said, doesn’t satisfy the idea of healthy enrollment. 
Speakman said the challenges facing the arts and humanities at the college level echo what’s happening in elementary and secondary schools.
“Those programs have been under assault in schools for years…I don’t want to sound overly mushy about it, but these disciplines — art, music, philosophy, literature — they make us fully human.”
Speakman said the General Assembly mostly gets involved in public funding to K-12 schools, but she acknowledged one area of higher ed where the state has invested significantly: cybersecurity, with RIC at its epicenter via a $73 million share of a $160.5 million bond voters approved last November. 
“My concern is that these are going to become the province of the wealthy again, as they were in the middle ages, where you had wealthy people being able to study literature and art…and the rest of us…we were apprentices at the blacksmith,” Speakman said. “That’s kind of a ridiculous example, but…all of us, no matter what our paying job is, should have access to those areas of study.”
Brighter enrollment outlook for some, but not all, programs
RIC has started to reverse its enrollment decline, Warner shared in his recap of the college’s past year at a March 25 hearing before the Senate Committee on Finance. New, high-demand programs introduced since 2023, like cybersecurity, sports management and biotechnology, are seeing healthy demand, the president said.
Warner foreshadowed the forthcoming announcement of cuts after a long process in which “it was an important priority for us for any program affected to be heard.”
Higher education, Warner said, is “a mature industry, not just growing and growing and growing. So if you’re going to put new programs into place, you have to make room for those by constantly evaluating the programs that might no longer be serving in ways that they were originally intended.”
The Community College of Rhode Island (CCRI), had slightly different results when it reviewed its programs. Between 2020 and 2023, it removed from its catalog 18 mostly technology-related offerings, many of them certificate programs, in which enrollment declined or the curriculum no longer aligned with today’s job market. 
But CCRI also replaced the defunct programs with new offerings, like certificates for cyber defense and graphic design, or an associate’s degree in cloud computing.
“Each change is the result of thorough academic and industry review and reflects our continuous efforts to offer programs that lead to meaningful careers for our students,” Amy Kempe, chief of staff at CCRI, said in an email. “And, we actually came out a net positive one program!”



What programs were recommended for suspension at RIC?
The following 20 programs, some of which are concentrations offered under the umbrella of other degree programs, were marked for suspension in the Productivity and Efficiency report. Numbers from RIC show the number of people who obtained a degree from the program in 2024. In fall 2024, RIC had a total full-time enrollment of 5,420 students, both graduate and undergraduate.

(Getty Images)With the goal of supporting working families, state lawmakers this session passed a new tax credit that subsidizes child care for North Dakota businesses.
Senate Bill 2282 applies specifically to child care stipends. The tax credit allows employers that offer this benefit to write off 50% of their child care contributions off their income taxes. Businesses can claim up to $1,000 in child care subsidies per employee toward this total.
Andrea Pfennig, vice president of government affairs for the Greater North Dakota Chamber, called the tax credit a “step in the right direction.”
In written testimony submitted in favor of the bill, Pfennig said in a 2024 survey of chamber members nearly 70% of respondents saw child care as an issue.
Some feel the tax credit doesn’t do enough. North Dakota Human Rights Coalition Executive Director Dalton Erickson said it will leave out many North Dakota families.
“A modest tax credit was passed, but it only applies to businesses that offer child care stipends, a luxury workplace benefit that the majority of workers don’t receive,” Erickson said at a Thursday morning event outside the Capitol.
Gov. Kelly Armstrong signed the bill into law May 1. Businesses can start using the credit for their 2025 taxes.
Pfennig called the new tax credit an improvement over a previous child care program passed by the Legislature in 2023.
Under that program, businesses can apply for a state match for either $300 a month or $150 a month for child care subsidies.
Some businesses found the matching program bureaucratically complex as well as limited in scope, Pfennig said. It is also only available for kids ages 5 and under, and has income limits, according to the program’s website.
Pfennig said she’s glad that both programs are still an option for businesses so that they can choose what’s best for them.
The Legislature this session also passed House Bill 1119, which directs the Department of Health and Human Services to form a child care services advisory committee to study child care licensing.
The bill also invites Legislative Council to conduct a program evaluation of the Department of the Health and Human Services’ child care services.

Republican leaders in the House have scheduled committee hearings for this week, with floor debate on the chamber’s budget tentatively set for next week.
Despite the upper chamber’s bill awaiting action, the House GOP leaders will almost certainly begin their own plan from scratch. The two chambers have only agreed to the top-line spending amount — everything else is negotiable. And before a final version heads to Gov. Josh Stein’s desk, budget writers from both chambers will meet to iron out a compromise.
“(The budget chairs) have been working on it, and it’s gone smoothly so far, at least in talks with the Senate,” House Speaker Destin Hall (R-Caldwell) told reporters last week. “Of course, we’ve only talked about the high level things.”
Lawmakers are expected to deliver a budget to Stein’s desk by June 30, the end of the fiscal year. But they have frequently gone beyond that date due to extended negotiations.
Senate Republicans’ budget lays out $36.2 billion in spending for the next year. It cuts hundreds of vacant state government positions, and some filled ones. It keeps in place a series of gradual GOP-led income tax cuts. And it includes modest raises for public sector workers, including teachers, law enforcement and state government employees.



Publicly available details of what the House plan will include are scant. But Hall has been clear that he expects the chamber’s budget to include larger pay raises than both the Senate’s bill and the Democratic governor’s request.
“I think you’ll see raises that are more than Stein proposed,” he said.
Under the Senate proposal, educators will receive an average 3.3% raise over the next two years. State employees would get a 1.25% raise and a $3,000 bonus. Law enforcement raises would be more substantial, such as a 5.25% raise for correctional officers and the State Bureau of Investigation.
The State Employees’ Association of North Carolina has expressed displeasure with both Stein’s and the Senate’s proposals, calling for better raises and decrying the Senate’s cuts to the state workforce.
House Republicans could also diverge from the Senate’s doubling down on income tax cuts. Hall has left the door open for adjusting the existing rates, or “dialing the knobs.” But he’s ruled out any tax increases.
The Republican Senate leader, President Pro Tem Phil Berger (R-Rockingham), has been steadfast in his support for the cuts.
Democrats, meanwhile, have urged the GOP to hit pause on the cuts — pointing to state economists’ projection that a budget shortfall could be on the horizon.
Leaders of the minority party have expressed broader frustration with the budget process, saying they’ve been granted almost no input. And they remain dubious about Republicans’ confidence to finish negotiations by the end of June.
“I think it is very ambitious, and I think frankly hilarious, that they will get a budget by June 28,” Senate Democratic Leader Sydney Batch (D-Wake) told reporters last week.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_9532-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-12 06:05:11.979023

(Photo by Evan Visconti for the Virginia Mercury)Virginia fishery managers and others from Maine to North Carolina, as well as members of the public, convened on Tuesday to decide the next steps to protect the future of Atlantic striped bass, a valued and remarkable animal facing consecutive years of low spawning success and an overfished stock. 
Atlantic striped bass have been referred to as “everyman’s fish” because they are caught by such a wide population of anglers up and down the coast, said Alex McCrickard, the aquatic education coordinator for the Virginia Department of Wildlife Resources. 
Their native range in Virginia spans from the freshwater spawning grounds of inland, tidal rivers like the Rappahannock, York and James to the salty, ocean waters off the Eastern seaboard. 
Regulations for Virginia’s coastal, migratory striped bass stock are managed by the Virginia Marine Resources Commission in conjunction with the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (ASMFC), who manages interstate fishery regulations for the stock between Maine and North Carolina. 
Anglers can utilize a wide range of gear types and techniques to catch striped bass. Some target the fish for the excitement of catch and release, while others seek them out to harvest as a culinary staple. 
As a resource, striped bass make up one of the “most valuable recreational fisheries on the Atlantic Coast,” said Emilie Franke, a fishery management plan coordinator for ASMFC. “I think one of the really unique things about it is that the fisheries really vary from state to state.”
“The Chesapeake Bay is as important to the striped bass and its successful life history” as the fish are to the coastal communities and economies of the region, said Allison Colden, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation’s executive director for Maryland. 
Striped bass rely on the tributaries and tidal estuaries of the Chesapeake Bay as a “foundational nursery ground” for the first few years of their lives, said Tom Dunlap, the riverkeeper for the James River Association. “As a top predator in the Bay ecosystem, (striped bass) are important for their relationships with all of our other species as well.”
An estimated 70% to 90% of all of the striped bass that make it into that coastal migratory stock start their lives in the Chesapeake Bay and its estuaries.
 An unpredictable future

Climate change is a major factor contributing to the decline of striped bass, and it is one that is much harder to control than the overfishing that was uncovered by researchers in 2019. 
Striped bass prefer cool, wet winters and springs, and as those conditions become less common as a result of climate change, “the probability that we are going to hit the lotto with the right combination of environmental conditions is becoming lower and more rare,” said Colden.
Wet springs produce high discharge volumes throughout the tributaries of the Chesapeake Bay, which expands the habitat available for striped bass to spawn in, said Martin Gary, director of the Division of Marine Resources at the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. 
At the same time, those rains flush nutrients into the rivers that are necessary for zooplankton to successfully bloom, a critical food source for striped bass after hatching, Gary said.
If zooplankton are not successful, or if the timing is off between their bloom and the striped bass spawning runs, fewer fish will survive to bolster the future spawning population. 
The concern today, Gary said, is that if we continue seeing consecutive, poor young-of-year classes, what will the stock biomass look like over the next decade? 
“We’ve got a double edged sword where we’re not getting very good recruitment because of environmental factors, and the spawning stock biomass is low too,” said Pat Geer, chief of fisheries management for the Virginia Marine Resources Commission.
Virginia has seen two consecutive years of historically low numbers of juvenile striped bass surveys, while Maryland has witnessed six consecutive years of low numbers. The data is compiled in a yearly stock assessment to give managers a sense of the reproductive success and early survival rate of the fish.

Below average juvenile stocks mean that “once the adults that are currently in the population start to either be harvested or die out, there are very few young fish growing up to replace them,” said Colden. 
“It’s going to take a long time to rebuild a population like striped bass that doesn’t mature until five to seven years of age,” said Geer. But building up the spawning stock biomass is “something we can control overtime.”
Gary said in the past, striped bass proved to be resilient, fortuitously, and bounced back after a moratorium was placed on the fishery in the 1980s due to fears of losing the species to extinction. Within ten years after the moratorium was put in place, striped bass were declared recovered up and down the coast.
Although Gary said the adult striped bass stocks are in much better shape today now than they were in the 1980s, managers cannot depend on the recovery witnessed in the early 1990s now that a new set of challenges exists, “especially in the face of climate change and the impacts of rapidly warming waters and changing marine and estuarine ecosystems.”
 Changes to fishery regulations 

New regulations were put in place last year by the Atlantic Striped Bass Management Board, which oversees interstate striped bass management for ASMFC, to establish a consistent size and bag limit throughout the Chesapeake Bay portion of the fishery.
Fishing seasons, on the other hand, are not consistent throughout the Bay, with management divided between multiple jurisdictions including Virginia, Maryland, the District of Columbia and the Potomac River Fisheries Commission. 
Outside of shortening the fishing seasons, managers are “really running out of options,” said Geer. Virginia already has a “pretty conservative” recreational harvest season of only about 100 days, one of the shortest on the East coast, he said. 
  Considered “everyman’s fish,” striped bass are available to a wide range of anglers, from surf casters on secluded beaches to shoreline anglers and charter boat captains operating out of urban cities like Richmond. (Photo by Evan Visconti for the Virginia Mercury)
Currently, “no-target” closures for striped bass don’t exist in Virginia, meaning it is legal all year for recreational anglers to target the fish for catch and release. Virginia fishery managers are not proposing to add any additional regulations outside of what could be agreed upon this year by ASMFC, said Geer. 
Maryland Department of Natural Resources, meanwhile, proposed a new layout for its 2026 fishing seasons to the board on Tuesday that includes a no-target closure for striped bass fishing during the entire month of August, to limit the recreational fishery’s impact while water temperatures are high. 
However, they also proposed eliminating the no-target closure that is currently in place in Maryland waters during part of the spring spawning period, thus opening the entire spring season to catch and release fishing. 
Maryland fishery managers stated in their presentation to the board that “the proposal is an effort to refocus our conservation effort on the protection of the resident population in the Chesapeake Bay and realign with our neighboring jurisdictions.”
The Chesapeake Bay Foundation has “for a long time” advocated for seasonal, summer closures as a way to protect striped bass during the time of year when they are most vulnerable to catch and release mortality.
“There are other fish species in the Bay at that time that are available to fish on, and we know that striped bass are typically pretty stressed during that time of year,” said Colden. 
Studies have shown that when water temperatures exceed 70 degrees in freshwater spawning grounds, the catch and release mortality for striped bass increases significantly, above the usual average of 9%, said McCrickard. 
The board’s technical committee will begin reviewing Maryland’s proposal before meeting again in August to consider what regulatory options for 2026, if any, it wants to approve for public comment.
Members of the board and the public raised concerns at the meeting over the possible negative impacts that could result from lifting no-target protections currently in place in Maryland during the spring spawning period. 
Public comments on the board’s options, which last year exceeded 4,000 submissions but ultimately didn’t spur any additional protections to the 2025 season, would take place between late August through September, according to Franke, before the board makes its final decision on the 2026 regulations in October.
 The eyes and ears on the water

Fishery managers are hesitant to continue piling on regulations to a fishing community that they say as a whole provides many inherent benefits to striped bass recovery efforts. 
Anglers are the eyes and ears on the water, monitoring the species on a regular basis, explained Gary. The information they provide is vitally important to fishery managers.
“When people are fishing, they care about the resource, and they’re going to be the best ones to spread the word to make sure people understand why we need good regulations that secure a promising future for the species,” Gary said. 
Striped bass as a species are currently declared overfished, however there is no active overfishing occurring anymore, as a result of numerous regulatory actions taken by fishery managers after 2019.

Outside of regulating the fishery, angler education is another key to recovering striped bass stocks since usually about 90% of striped bass removals come from the recreational fishery.
McCrickard works to teach anglers about the best catch and release practices to give striped bass the best chance of survival after being released back into the waterway. 
Anglers should always wet their hands before handling striped bass to protect the fish’s protective slime coating, said McCrickard. 
Removing the fish from the water for an extended period is known to have negative impacts, so ideally a soft rubber net can be used to keep the fish in the water when preparing to remove the hook or take a photo, McCrickard said. 
When releasing the fish, McCrickard advises facing them upright against the current and allowing them to swim out of your hands freely when they are ready. 
“Lactic acid builds up in the muscles during the fight, and it’s essential for anglers to let the fish recover on their own terms when they are ready,” he said. 
 Swimming upstream 

There are currently moratoriums effective in Virginia banning the catch and possession of river herring, American shad and Atlantic sturgeon, which are threatened, anadromous species similar to striped bass in that they spend their adult lives in saltwater but migrate to freshwater rivers and streams to spawn. 
“The common theme here is that our native migratory fishes are all struggling; they’re all suffering; they’re all frankly imperilled,” Dunlap said.
Unfortunately there is not a single smoking gun that experts can blame for the declines. If there were, “we’d stand a lot better chance of having greater success for now by bolstering these species,” said Dunlap. “They’re definitely suffering a death by a thousand cuts here.”

Outside of climate change and overfishing, striped bass and migratory fishes in general are known to face losses as a result of unprotected water withdrawals.
“These industrial uses of the river could have the unfortunate capacity to suck in a tremendous amount of larval fish and fish eggs, removing them from that year class,” said Dunlap. “That can unfortunately be just a wrong place, right time issue on the river system.”
There is also increased sediment flowing into the Chesapeake Bay tributaries as a result of more violent and frequent precipitation events and an increase in impermeable land surfaces throughout the watershed.
“The sediment itself will have knock-on effects for the environment,”  Dunlap explained, by burying aquatic vegetation, reducing the sunlight available for photosynthesis and changing the habitat for species that depend on it. 
There are also habitat access issues as a result of the construction of dams and road culverts that block fish passage, as well as the understudied threat of a large invasive blue catfish population that feeds on and competes with native fish.

(Courtesy of Chesterfield County Public Schools)In a rare moment of bipartisan agreement on education policy, Virginia leaders have enacted sweeping changes to the state’s K-12 testing system, aiming to raise student performance and make the Standards of Learning (SOL) assessments more meaningful.
Despite ongoing political clashes over broader education policy, Gov. Glenn Youngkin and state lawmakers united earlier this month behind a plan they hope will strengthen student outcomes.
One of the ways the legislation aims to improve outcomes is by making the Standards of Learning (SOL) assessments count as 10% of the student’s final grade — a shift from current policy. The legislation will also require the release of more past exams to improve preparation.
“This is a gigantic step forward for Virginia students,” Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg, D-Henrico, who believes the changes will offer a clearer and fairer way of evaluating students while creating opportunities to make assessments more rigorous.
“So it’s kind of a win all the way around and will hopefully put us on a better path for better student outcomes across all the different classes,” he said.
Superintendent of Public Instruction Emily Anne Gullickson said in a statement that the bill is a “forward-thinking step in modernizing” the commonwealth’s approach to student assessment and achievement. She also said the bill codifies several reform measures adopted by the House Bill 585 Work Group and supported by the governor to make recommendations for the state assessments.
VanValkenburg successfully introduced the bill creating the work group in 2022.
“By introducing greater flexibility in how schools evaluate student learning, this legislation reinforces Virginia’s commitment to educational innovation,” Gullickson said.
The proposal, carried by Del. Dan Helmer, D-Fairfax, and VanValkenburg, seeks to improve how the SOLs — statewide standardized tests — are administered and used to evaluate what students should know at the end of each grade or course. 
Assessment results help determine student performance in core subjects such as mathematics, reading, history and social science.
Last August, data released by the Department of Education showed modest gains in reading and math pass rates for the 2023-24 school year after a period of targeted recovery efforts. But performance in other subjects remained below levels seen during the 2022-23 school year.
The governor’s administration and Democrats have traded blame over the mixed results. Youngkin’s team has faulted decisions made by the previous Boards of Education, while Democrats and former board members have defended such decisions, which included changing accreditation standards and adjusting the threshold for what’s considered proficiency.
VanValkenburg’s original version of the bill failed to pass in the Senate in February. However, Helmer’s version passed with technical changes before securing approval from the General Assembly.
“I think this makes Virginia a leader in delivering a world-class education for families across the commonwealth,” Helmer told The Mercury.
The lawmakers said the legislation will help ensure that the state’s next testing contract improves the quality of the tests and makes them more transparent — including the release of more exams afterwards.
VanValkenburg said having the vendor release additional tests will allow teachers and parents to use them as practice tools. An earlier version of the bill called for all tests to be released, but that proposal fell through during negotiations.
“Our tests have for the last 20 years been very low quality, and the reason they’ve been low quality is because we haven’t wanted to spend money on them, and the quality of the tests clearly need to improve,” VanValkenburg said.
Under the legislation, tests will be administered during the final two weeks of the school year — a change from the current practice of five to six weeks earlier — to allow time for retakes. Because of early test administration, students who pass often miss class time, as teachers focus on helping students who need to retake the tests.
As a result of the change, VanValkenburg said it will eliminate about a month of lost instructional time each school year. 
“After the exam, there are high levels of absenteeism as teachers concentrate on test-retake prep for the few kids who failed,” the two lawmakers wrote in The Virginian-Pilot in January. “During that wasted month, little other learning takes place. In effect, students lose a month of education — a year of lost instructional time over a career.”
The legislation also aims to improve transparency by giving parents a better sense of how well their students performed on assessments, shifting the grading scale from 600 points to 100 points.
VanValkenburg said, for example, that parents are far more likely to understand a score of 87 on a biology test than a score of 487.
“Pretty instantaneously, you’ll be able to see what you did well on, and what you did poorly on, and teachers will be able to see that too,” VanValkenburg said. “So as a teacher, you’re going to have more time to teach, your kids are going to have more incentive to do well, and you’re going to get more feedback quicker about what went right and what went wrong on those tests.”
The legislation is set to take effect at the start of the 2026-27 school year.

“On the note of transparency,” Veteran’s and Legal Affairs Committee co-chair Sen. Craig Hickman asked during the May 2 meeting, “do you think that it was transparent of your ballot question committee to include provisions in this law that have nothing to do with voter ID?”
When The Dinner Table PAC — founded by Titcomb and Republican Rep. Laurel Libby of Auburn with a mission to create a conservative majority in the Maine House of Representatives — launched the campaign in April 2024, it was branded as an effort to require voters to show photo identification at the polls. However, the official five-page petition submitted to the state in January seeks to change additional aspects of Maine election law, such as absentee voting.
“We weren’t hiding it,” Titcomb responded to Hickman. “It’s a publicly available document.” 
Though, Titcomb noted, most people who sign citizen petitions don’t take the time to read them in full. Maine’s citizen initiative process requires a certain number of voter signatures to get a question on the ballot and “Voter ID for ME” gathered well above that threshold.
As stipulated by the state constitution, the initiative first had to go to the Maine Legislature for consideration, and lawmakers could either enact the bill as written or send it to a statewide vote in November 2025. 
The Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee voted unanimously against the legislation last week, with one member absent, which essentially sets it on the latter path to the ballot. The committee also rejected a few other bills with similar aims that could have set up competing ballot measures. 
The Department of the Secretary of State announced the final wording of the referendum question on May 5, which will capture the other aspects of the initiative in addition to the voter identification requirement following requests from the public during a comment period.
“The proposed measure has 28 sections, and Maine law requires that the question be presented in a clear, concise, and direct manner,” Bellows said in a statement to Maine Morning Star on Friday. “318 Mainers spoke up to share their thoughts and suggestions on the initial draft of the phrasing of the question. Given that feedback, the final question describes six changes to the voting process proposed by the underlying legislation.”
Conservative group behind voter ID effort submits 170k signatures to get on November ballot

It will read: “Do you want to change Maine election laws to eliminate two days of absentee voting, prohibit requests for absentee ballots by phone or family members, end ongoing absentee voter status for seniors and people with disabilities, ban prepaid postage on absentee ballot return envelopes, limit the number of drop boxes, require voters to show certain photo ID before voting, and make other changes to our elections?”
Under law, voters have the right to appeal the final decision on the wording within ten days, but the department hadn’t received any requests as of Friday.  
Since Bellows called the petition “a wolf in sheep’s clothing” when the petition was first submitted to the state, 24 nonpartisan groups across Maine have since organized their own campaign against the measure, which they characterize as a voter suppression referendum.
The “Save Maine Absentee Voting” coalition kicked off its campaign on Saturday with a rally in Augusta, which featured speakers from Democracy Maine, Maine Women’s Lobby, American Postal Workers Union, the Wabanaki Alliance and disability rights advocates. 
Maine requires identification and proof of residency in order to register to vote but is among 15 states that do not require voters to present identification while at the polls.
The voter ID effort in Maine follows a national trend from Republicans pushing for such requirements, amid conflicting research on their impact.
Supporters of voter ID laws argue they’ll decrease the risk of fraud and increase confidence in election results. Meanwhile, opponents argue voter ID requirements block legitimate voters from casting ballots, create anti-immigrant sentiment and feed an unfounded fear of widespread voter fraud. 
In addition to requiring voter ID at the polls, the referendum in Maine also seeks to roll back ongoing absentee voting, which allows voters to have absentee ballots mailed to them automatically for each election cycle, and repeal the provision allowing immediate family members to drop off ballots for each other.
It would also remove the option for municipalities to get approval for multiple ballot drop boxes and change who can collect their contents. Currently, non-partisan municipal clerks are responsible for collection but the referendum would make it a “bipartisan team of election officials,” though it doesn’t specify how those teams would be decided. 
The petition also seeks to change the process for challenging someone’s right to vote. Under current law, it’s up to a challenger to prove that someone doesn’t have the right to vote in a certain election. The petition wants to shift the burden of proof onto the person being challenged. 
The one portion of the referendum that its organizers and voting rights groups agree is beneficial is that it would create an option for Mainers to get free nondriver identification cards.
Related measures also rejected by the Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee last week included LD 38 sponsored by Sen. Jeff Timberlake (R-Androscoggin) — which the committee rejected 7-5, with one member absent — and LD 397 sponsored by Rep. Reagan Paul from (R-Winterport) — which was rejected unanimously, with one member absent. 
These bills will still head to the chambers for floor votes, however the committee’s recommendations set them up to be killed. 
The committee did not hold a hearing on LD 1880, sponsored by Libby, because it was nearly identical to referendum legislation. Instead, the committee voted it out as “leave to withdraw,” which essentially means the bill is dead, though it technically can be recalled with the support of a two-thirds vote of both chambers.

(Getty photo)Across Rhode Island, children enter foster care every week because their homes are no longer safe — due to a range of complex factors, including family instability, abuse, unmet needs, or other family challenges. When that happens, we don’t just need shelter. We need people. We need families who can meet children where they are, offer compassion and consistency, and help them begin to heal.
The problem is, those families are getting harder to find.
According to the most recent data, approximately 1,272 children under the age of 21 are in the care of Rhode Island’s Department of Children Youth and Families (DCYF) and living in out-of-home placements. But the number of licensed foster homes is shrinking. Too often, children wait in hospitals, residential treatment facilities, or bounce between short-term placements simply because there’s nowhere else for them to go. In some cases, siblings are separated — not because it’s in their best interest, but because no one can take them together.
Foster parents have always been asked to do a lot. But today, they are doing more than ever: caring for children who have experienced complex trauma, navigating behavioral and medical challenges, and coordinating services across multiple systems — all while parenting.
And they are doing it with less. Fewer fellow foster parents to lean on. Less access to respite care. Fewer placements to share the load. Less certainty about the resources that will be there for them tomorrow.
Despite these challenges, foster parenting remains one of the most impactful roles a Rhode Islander can play. I’ve seen it firsthand. I’ve seen teens placed in homes where they were listened to — maybe for the first time — and start to believe they matter. I’ve seen toddlers learn to sleep through the night again, and siblings reunited in a living room that’s suddenly filled with laughter.
What foster parents provide isn’t just shelter. It’s safety, consistency, and the hope of a brighter future.
And yet, we rarely talk about what these families need. We thank them in May, but gratitude isn’t enough. They need respite, mental health resources, community, and predictable support from the systems around them. They need to be treated not as temporary caregivers, but as essential partners in a child’s recovery and growth.










I’ve seen teens placed in homes where they were listened to — maybe for the first time — and start to believe they matter. I’ve seen toddlers learn to sleep through the night again, and siblings reunited in a living room that’s suddenly filled with laughter.


Policy conversations around foster care often center on recruitment — but recruitment is only part of the equation. Retention — ensuring that families stay engaged and supported over time — requires meaningful, sustained investment. That means adequate reimbursement rates, and timely, barrier-free access to the services they need, without having to navigate a maze of referrals or red tape. We need a “no wrong door” approach and a system of care that’s easy to understand and navigate.
It also means investing in a stable workforce — one where families aren’t met with long waitlists, and where workers have manageable caseloads and the capacity to provide consistent, compassionate support. And it means ensuring foster parents themselves have access to emotional support, ongoing training, and responsive systems of care.
What’s at stake isn’t just program success — it’s the well-being of children who’ve already lost too much.
If we want foster families to keep showing up, we must meet them there — with better support, stronger networks, and policies that reflect the gravity of what we ask them to do. Because every child who needs a foster home deserves one. And every person willing to open their home deserves our full support.
This Foster Care Awareness Month, let’s not only thank foster families. Let’s stand behind them — and ensure they’re not standing alone.

Fears about the trouble that lies ahead for North Carolina now that judges have okayed the scheme to give auditor Dave Boliek control over the state Board of Elections, were confirmed last week by the cruel and classless behavior of Boliek’s new right-wing appointees.
After firing longtime elections board executive director Karen Brinson Bell – a rigorously nonpartisan professional who worked miracles on a shoestring budget and won national acclaim for her work to help western North Carolinians vote after Hurricane Helene – the new board members wouldn’t even allow her to say farewell.
When she asked to say a few words at her final board meeting, Boliek’s new appointees adjourned before she could say a word and walked out of the room.
Unbowed by the shabby treatment, Brinson Bell stayed behind to deliver a powerful message to the news media and other witnesses.
The bottom line: For nearly six years, Karen Brinson Bell dedicated her career to strengthening our democracy and exemplifying public service at its finest – two concepts about which the men who fired her haven’t a clue.

School-based health services nationwide are partially funded through Medicaid, and some advocates worry about potential cuts. (Photo by Jon Cherry/Getty Images)Even as Republicans in Congress walk back their most aggressive proposal to slash federal Medicaid spending, they are weighing other options that could force states to cut services for children and other vulnerable populations.
U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters last week that his caucus won’t reduce the 90% federal funding match that states get to cover working-age adults who became eligible for Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. However, the GOP is still considering capping federal spending by setting a fixed amount for how much states receive for every Medicaid enrollee.
That move would fundamentally change the nature of the program, which has been an open-ended entitlement since its passage 60 years ago.
The most likely Medicaid cuts would hit rural areas the hardest

Another Republican congressional proposal would limit states’ ability to increase Medicaid payments to doctors and hospitals by using tax revenue they collect from health care providers. States draw down additional federal dollars by utilizing the strategy, and the extra money helps many hospitals stay afloat.
Any federal cuts to Medicaid — large or small — would strain state budgets and likely lead to service cuts and coverage for fewer people, according to a new analysis released last week by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
The agency predicted that to make up for lost federal dollars, states would have to reduce payments to health care providers, curb benefits or reduce enrollment. Some advocates also suggest that states might seek savings in other areas of their budgets, such as K-12 education.
Child health advocates say any of those actions would have a significant trickle-down effect on children and their caregivers. They’re concerned states would have to reduce or even eliminate services that help tens of millions of children access routine care that’s critical from birth, such as vaccinations and physical exams.
Half of U.S. kids
About half of the nation’s 72.8 million children are covered by Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, known as CHIP, another joint federal-state program that covers children from families who earn too much to qualify for traditional Medicaid.
“I think what is missing from some of these debates is [Medicaid] is not only the primary payer for children’s health, it’s also supporting the safety net for children’s health, by paying for hospitals, clinics, physicians and offices,” said Heather Howard, a former New Jersey health commissioner who is now a faculty affiliate with the Center for Health and Wellbeing at Princeton University.
“It’ll mean that hospitals will close in rural areas, but even in urban areas, we’re going to see, as hospitals see their funding cut, they’re going to have to pull back on services,” Howard added. “And that clearly is going to impact kids.”
A fifth of Americans are on Medicaid. Some of them have no idea.

Mississippi pediatrician Dr. John Gaudet said the importance of Medicaid for children begins at birth; Medicaid covered 41% of all U.S. births in 2021. The program also covers a benefit package called Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment, which covers an array of critical services meant to take care of childhood mental and physical health, such as dental and vision care, vaccinations, lab tests and physical exams.
The program serves children struggling with severe emotional distress, as well as physical disabilities. Medicaid pays for long-term and home-based care services.
Gaudet says he’s afraid that a variety of child-related services could be affected by federal Medicaid cuts.
“As a pediatrician, I’m very concerned about prevention and wellness, because that’s going to give you more return on your investment in the long run, if you can prevent an illness rather than wait until it gets more severe and then you’re having to treat it,” Gaudet said in an interview.
School health services
Medicaid cuts also could affect the health services offered in schools.
Between $4 billion and $6 billion in annual Medicaid spending helps pay for school-based health services, including routine health screenings, preventive care, mental health care and physical, speech and occupational therapies.
Children from underserved communities disproportionately rely on school-based health services, according to Abuko Estrada, vice president of Medicaid and child health policy at First Focus on Children, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit group.
“We’re not only talking about things like higher emergency room utilization for kids or increased hospitalizations for preventable conditions,” Estrada said in an interview. “We’re also talking about lost educational opportunities, potentially reduced future earnings in adulthood, and perpetuating cycles of poor health that ultimately cost the nation far more than it would potentially save.”










As hospitals see their funding cut, they're going to have to pull back on services. And that clearly is going to impact kids.


– Heather Howard, former New Jersey commissioner of health and senior services


But Brian Blase, president of the Paragon Health Institute, a conservative policy group that is working with Republicans to imagine Medicaid cuts, wrote in an email to Stateline that the ideas circulating on Capitol Hill wouldn’t harm children at all. Rather, he said, the proposed cuts would shift the funding focus away from working-age adults toward children and more vulnerable populations.
“In my view, it is a moral imperative for Congress to protect the program for the truly vulnerable and end Washington’s discrimination in favor of non-disabled, working-age, childless adults,” wrote Blase, who was a health care adviser to President Donald Trump during his first term.
Chris Pope, a senior fellow at the conservative-leaning policy group the Manhattan Institute, said he doesn’t think Republicans in Congress will be able to cut much from Medicaid.
Republicans couldn’t get the votes to make major changes when they tried in 2017, Pope noted, and they have even fewer votes this year. “Unless they can get every Republican to sign off on cuts,” he said, “it’s just not going to happen.”
Black maternal health advocates, researchers press on amid federal funding cuts

Republicans in Congress are trying to find roughly $2 trillion in savings to offset the cost of extending tax cuts enacted during the first Trump administration and to make additional tax cuts. The U.S. House committee that oversees Medicaid is supposed to come up with $880 billion of that total.
Despite Johnson’s assertion that reducing the federal Medicaid match for working-age adults is off the table, some fiscal hawks in his own party aren’t ready to give up the idea, which would save more money than any other proposal.
“It’s necessary to stop robbing from the vulnerable to fund the able-bodied,” U.S. Rep. Chip Roy of Texas wrote on X shortly after Johnson’s comments were reported.
In a May 7 letter to House Republican leaders, 32 GOP representatives vowed to find $2 trillion in cuts, calling the House budget framework “a floor for savings, not a ceiling. We must hold that line on fiscal discipline to put the country back on a sustainable path,” the letter said.

(Screenshot | New Hampshire General Court)The New Hampshire Senate Finance Committee moved Friday to restore three health care programs that had been cut from the state budget by the House Finance Committee — a bipartisan move meant to address heavy pushback. 
In a series of votes at their meeting Friday, the committee voted to reverse the House’s 3% rate cut for the state’s Medicaid providers, and to restore funding to address the developmental disabilities waitlist and for community mental health support. 
The votes come after a nine-hour public hearing on the budget Tuesday in which the health care cuts dominated attendees’ concerns. Hospital representatives, disability rights advocates, and care recipients themselves appealed to the committee to restore the funding. 
“We want to get the message out to the people that we have listened to them and we are taking action on their requests,” said Sen. James Gray, a Rochester Republican and the Senate Finance chairman, just after the amendments passed. 
Gov. Kelly Ayotte has criticized the House’s cuts since the chamber passed its budget April 10, taking particular issue with the Medicaid provider cuts. 
The votes came at the beginning of the Senate Finance Committee’s four-week push to finalize a recommended budget. Two Democrats and six Republicans — who include Senate President Sharon Carson — must grapple with the $643 million of cuts the House made to Ayotte’s February proposed budget. 
The health care cuts represented a large portion of those cuts, but not all of them. Among the decisions left for the Senate are whether to restore the House’s $50 million cut to the university system, its elimination of 190 Department of Corrections positions, and its move to end the Office of the Child Advocate, a watchdog over the Division for Children, Youth and Families; the Housing Appeals Board; the State Council on the Arts; and the Office of the Right to Know Ombudsman.

In a statement Friday, Ayotte thanked the committee for the amendments, but said she would continue to be involved in the budget. She has recently raised concerns about the cuts to the Department of Corrections and the university system. 
“I’m pleased that the Senate Finance Committee reversed cuts to Medicaid provider rates and restored funding for mental health services and care for those with disabilities,” Ayotte said. “We need a responsible budget that serves our most vulnerable citizens, and I will remain involved in this process to ensure we deliver this for all of New Hampshire.”
Republicans control the governor’s office, House, and Senate, but the party is split over how much the state will raise in taxes and how much the Legislature should spend. 
The House’s budget took a conservative approach, passing a budget that assumed that revenues would be much lower than Ayotte’s February projections. On Wednesday, the Senate Ways and Means Committee struck a middle ground between Ayotte and the House, passing revenue projections that landed about in the middle between the other two. 
Those projections will affect how the Senate Finance Committee approaches its budgeting over the next month, and will likely allow some — but not all — of the cuts to be restored. On Friday, Gray and others said the decision to move so quickly to restore the three health care cuts represented the Senate’s priorities. 
“We will be taking many, many, many votes as we move things in and out of both House Bill 1 and House Bill 2,” Gray said. “It is a statement of our intent that these be the first three votes that we take.”
Senators on both sides of the aisle took moments to highlight the importance of the funding restoration.
The House’s proposed across-the-board 3% funding cut to all Medicaid providers amounted to a $52 million reduction in state funding, and would also cause the state to lose an equivalent amount of matching federal funding. Opponents had testified Tuesday that the cut would make it even harder to find caregivers for home health services, and providers said it would force cutbacks in services.
Sen. David Watters, a Dover Democrat, recalled one person at the hearing calling Medicaid a “lifeline.” “And I think we’re restoring that lifeline,” he said Friday.
And senators praised the amendment to restore developmental disability funding. The House had cut $31.4 million from that program, a move that also threatened federal match funding. The state has a waitlist of people who are eligible for services for those disabilities, such as those to help with transportation, housing, and employment. 
“I was in the House when we ended the (developmental disability) waitlist in 2007 and what a joyous, important moment that was,” said Sen. Cindy Rosenwald, a Nashua Democrat. “That was a long time coming.”
Carson, a Londonderry Republican, agreed. “We’ve taken individuals that were quite frankly marginalized for very long, and they’ve become active, contributing members of our society, and that’s what we want,” she said. “… As a parent of a disabled adult, I know how difficult it can be for disabled individuals to navigate our world, and this helps them.”
Sen. Regina Birdsell, a Hampstead Republican, applauded the return of the funding for community mental health. The House had cut Ayotte’s proposed funding by $37.8 million, or 37.5%. 
“We need to continue putting the funding forward for our mental health programs that we have worked so hard to put into place,” Birdsell said. 
The Senate Finance Committee is working to finalize recommendations for the state’s two budget bills, House Bill 1 and 2, by June 3. The full Senate will then vote on the bills on June 5, and if they pass, they will likely head to a committee of conference with the House, where House and Senate leaders will negotiate to end with a bill both chambers can agree on.

In a court filing, they said the move would destabilize the economy and “brush aside a century of precedent.” 
The Federal Trade Commission is one of two federal agencies tasked with enforcing antitrust law. In the past several years it has sued huge health care conglomerates, as well as big tech companies like Amazon, Apple, Google and Meta. 
It also blocked the merger of grocery giants Kroger and Albertsons. So the FTC might not be terribly popular in some corporate boardrooms these days. Anticompetitive practices by giant players are thought to have resulted in lower wages and higher prices for consumers.

The other federal antitrust watchdog, the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department, has roots going back to 1903. But that department is overseen by the Attorney General, a presidential appointee. 
In 1914, Congress passed the Federal Trade Commission Act creating an antitrust watchdog that is more insulated from politics. It provided for a minimum number of appointees from each party, provided them with seven-year terms and allowed reappointment. Crucially, presidents can only remove them for “inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.”
Despite that, news broke in March that Trump was trying to fire commissioners Alvaro Bedoya and Rebecca Slaughter, both Democratic appointees. Trump was doing so without alleging any of the deficiencies required by the law to allow for their dismissal. 
In a social media post, Bedoya said Trump was trying to do a favor for his ultra-rich supporters.
“Now, the president wants the FTC to be a lapdog for his golfing buddies,” Bedoya wrote.
Trump has also tried to remove commissioners from independent agencies such as the Federal Election Commission, the National Labor Relations Board, the Merit Systems Protections Board and the National Transportation Safety Board. Critics, including Slaughter and Bedoya, said that undermining such independent agencies would undermine faith in and the stability of the national economy.
In a court brief justifying the FTC firings, Trump’s lawyers wrote that following the provisions of the Federal Trade Commission Act would improperly limit the president’s authority.
“An order requiring the president to reinstate officials he has chosen to remove from office would be an extraordinary intrusion on the president’s exclusive authority to exercise control over the executive branch,” the filing said, according to Newsweek.
Lawyers for the Democratic FTC commissioners said that’s a gross misreading of the law and history.
Trump is asking the court “to brush aside a century of precedent in favor of an untenable reading of (the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Seila Law v Consumer Financial Protection Bureau) that ignores broad swaths of that opinion, misconstrues the FTC’s authority, side-steps much of U.S. history, and would overturn several Supreme Court decisions and invalidate two-dozen statutes adopted and adhered to by nearly every President and Congress over the last 150 years,” Bedoya and Slaughter’s lawyers said in a court filing. 
Late last month, a Trump ally, Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, made another move that critics said was intended to protect the president’s wealthy supporters — particularly Elon Musk, the world’s richest man — from antitrust enforcement. From his perch as chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Jordan tried to insert in a spending bill a measure that would move the FTC’s personnel and funding to the Justice Department. 
However, it wouldn’t have moved the FTC’s unique enforcement powers along with them. Jordan later withdrew the measure.
The Democratic FTC commissioners are fighting in court to stop Trump’s attempt to fire them, calling it “blatantly illegal.” They and lawyers for the president are asking the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to decide the case on an expedited basis.
In a written statement, a lawyer for a firm representing the Democratic commissioners, Clarick, Gueron, Reisbaum, said Trump is ignoring past decisions of the judiciary.
“… it’s undisputed that his attempted firings violate the plain language of the FTC Act, and the President’s claim to inherent executive authority to fire FTC Commissioners defies 90 years of Supreme Court precedent,” the lawyer, Aaron Crowell, said.
A lawyer for another group representing Slaughter and Bedoya, Protect Democracy, said Trump is trying to ignore not only the courts, but Congress as well. And in so doing, the president threatens to destabilize the U.S. economy, said the lawyer, Amit Agarwal.
“Congress had good reasons for protecting regulators from at-will removal, not the least of which is that agencies like the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Reserve need to have the ability to make critical decisions with integrity and to apply the law without fear or favor,”Agarwal said.  “When the Supreme Court settled this dispute nine decades ago, it decided in favor of Congress’s right to protect the public interest. We hope the courts do so again.”

Republican state Reps. Angie King, R-Celina, and Josh Williams, R-Sylvania Twp., recently introduced House Bill 249, also known as the Enact the Indecent Exposure Modernization Act.

The bill would prohibit an adult cabaret performance from taking place outside an adult cabaret. It also broadens the definition of adult cabaret performances to include “performers or entertainers who exhibit a gender identity that is different from the performer’s or entertainer’s gender assigned at birth using clothing, makeup, prosthetic or imitation genitals or breasts, or other physical markers.”
The bill includes drag performers, topless dancers, go-go dancers, strippers and exotic dancers.
“I am deeply committed to protecting our children,” King said in a statement. “As a mother and as a legislator, I believe Ohio families should feel safe taking their children to a city park without the risk of coming across an event or person performing in a way that incorporates themes, imagery, and acts intended for mature audiences.”
Williams said they are seeing a trend of “indecent exposure and over-sexualized performances taking place in public in the presence of children.”
“This legislation is simply updating already existing law to the times that we are living in,” he said in a statement. “So, we want to update the obscenity law so we can ensure families and children are protected from these acts.”
H.B. 249 comes with penalties ranging from a first degree misdemeanor if a performance happens in front of a juvenile, a fifth degree felony if the performance is obscene and a fourth degree felony if the performance is obscene and happened in front of someone 12 years old and younger. 
This is not the first time this bill has been introduced. King and Williams introduced a nearly identical bill during the last General Assembly, but it only had two committee hearings. The bill received lots of opposition from Ohio’s LGBTQ community.

The independent agency tasked with campaign finance oversight gets axed in the budget proposal Ohio House lawmakers approved last month. The state Senate is currently mulling changes of its own.
In a letter to Senate President Rob McColley, Secretary Frank LaRose echoed many of the criticisms leveled by House Republicans, but rather than abolishing the agency, LaRose argued forcefully for reform.
The state of debate

The Ohio House has made no secret about its frustration with the Ohio Elections Commission. In a contentious hearing, lawmakers on the House Finance committee grilled the agency’s executive director Phil Richter over perceived shortcomings. They argued cases drag on too long and the process is too tedious.
In a Senate committee hearing last week, lawmakers were receptive to Richter’s warnings that handing oversight to county boards of elections and a hearing officer in the Secretary of State’s office would lead to a “patchwork” of decisions.
But they had critiques for Richter, too. The chairman, Sen. Tim Schaffer, R-Lancaster, didn’t seem all that concerned about devolving campaign finance cases. “What’s the problem with that model?” he asked. Meanwhile, Sen. Kyle Koehler, R-Springfield, argued the commission needs to move more quickly and use “more teeth.”
Ohio Elections Commission urges state senators to restore funding in budget

The Secretary’s letter
In his letter to McColley, LaRose argued the commission “has become an increasingly toothless and inconsistent shell of what it was intended to be.” In particular he highlighted nearly $100 million in fines that have gone uncollected. In addition to “sending a terrible message that you can break the law and get away with it,” LaRose argued, that money could be put to good use.
“The General Assembly could fund schools, repair aging infrastructure, upgrade election equipment, or even reduce taxes with that uncollected revenue,” LaRose wrote. “Wrongdoing might actually be deterred if fines were treated as more than a suggestion.”
But the secretary insisted it’s a bad idea to decentralize campaign finance oversight — making the same argument about potentially scores of different enforcement decisions.
“These board members, hard-working as they are, often serve as local political party chairs,” LaRose added. “They should not be placed in the awkward, unsolicited position of policing their own candidates, nor are they staffed, equipped, or trained to manage these complex cases.”
LaRose noted his office has been talking with lawmakers about potential changes since at least last year. In those talks, the secretary proposed expanding the commission’s purview to conservative fixations like ballot harvesting and noncitizen voting. His office also urged the commission to move cases more quickly and require members have relevant legal experience.
The secretary warned if his office has to take over administration of OEC duties it would cost at least $800,000. The governor’s initial proposal budgeted $812,600 and $885,100 for the agency in the next two years.
And perhaps most important, LaRose argued the House plan to abolish the commission by July is too hasty.
“We likely need more time to facilitate that transition,” LaRose wrote. “On this point, I can again find common ground with Mr. Richter in saying that any reform of the OEC should be done through a transition over the remainder of the current calendar year.”
Asked about the Secretary’s letter after the Senate session Wednesday, McColley said he’d yet to read it. On the topic of abolishing the Ohio Elections Commission more generally, he kept his powder dry.
“Obviously, we’ll look at what the House sent over, and we’ll talk with some of our members as to what they’re ideas are,” McColley said. He put special emphasis on members like Sen. Theresa Gavarone, R-Bowling Green, who have worked on several pieces of elections-related legislation in recent years, but held off on taking any firm position until his caucus weighs in.

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)COLUMBUS, Ohio — The Ohio Republican Party has endorsed businessman Vivek Ramaswamy for governor.
Ohio’s gubernatorial election is still a year away, but the race to replace Gov. Mike DeWine is heating up with endorsements, commercials and media attention.
In a meeting in Columbus on Friday afternoon, the Ohio GOP State Central Committee voted in favor of the Cincinnati entrepreneur.
Ramaswamy secured the nomination over Attorney General Dave Yost, with 60 votes to 3.
“Ohio’s best days are gonna be ahead of us,” Ramaswamy told reporters after his endorsement acceptance speech.
President Donald Trump’s ally is running on a platform of revitalizing the state.
“We’re going to have rollouts of major policies addressing what I see as some of the most pressing issues that Ohio is gonna have to confront in the next decade… Issues like population decline, issues like a looming energy and potential electricity shortage in our state, issues like the educational achievement deficiency,” he continued.
Ramaswamy made his splash into politics in 2023. He ran to become the Republican nominee for president before dropping out to endorse and support Trump for the remainder of the campaign. He went to Harvard and Yale Law, where he worked in investments and started a firm. He was appointed to the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency before he was ousted by tech-mogul Elon Musk, according to reporting from POLITICO.
He announced his bid for Ohio governor back in February.



But not everyone wanted Ramaswamy. State Auditor Keith Faber explained that he would have rather waited until it was closer to the election to choose.
“I respect Dave, I respect Vivek and I respect Lt. Gov. Tressel,” Faber told me. “So, I just didn’t think it was time for me to jump in and endorse personally at this point.”
As Faber mentioned, Ramaswamy beat out Yost.
Yost for Governor Campaign Manager Emily Hottinger issued the following statement:
“We congratulate Mr. Ramaswamy. The Attorney General is going to take a few days to consult with key supporters about the path forward — but the people of Ohio deserve a choice, not a premature coronation of an untested candidate.”


Although some strategists have been pushing Lt. Gov. and former OSU football coach Jim Tressel to run, he hasn’t officially announced. But he is considering a run, according to a statement sent to News 5, which was first reported by NBC News.
Tressell said in the statement: “What has been a surprise, and it has been humbling, is how many people are encouraging me to run for Governor. I have not decided yet, but when I became Lieutenant Governor in February, Ellen told me that it seemed like God had more work for me to do, and she was right. While I have not ruled out a run for Governor – and there will be a time in the future for those conversations — for now, I will remain focused on helping Ohioans get off the sidelines and into our workforce so they can reach their full potential.”
“They all have great strengths,” Faber said. “Let them communicate that themselves to the voters of Ohio.”
So what’s next for Ramaswamy?
“What kind of qualities are you looking for in a lieutenant governor?” WEWS asked Ramaswamy.
“Look, I want a governing partner… The way I hope to lead Ohio is not just to take the existing (organizational) chart as given and fill them in like spots on a place mat, but instead to ask: ‘Who’s gonna lead in the areas where we actually want to make a change and drive a difference to the state?'” he said.
So now, the race is heating up for his second in command, with strategists telling us to keep our eyes on Sec. of State Frank LaRose and State Treasurer Robert Sprague. LaRose is running for auditor, and Sprague is running for secretary of state.
“I look forward to helping Vivek succeed as a candidate and as our next governor. I’m focused right now on doing the job I was elected to do and talking with Ohioans about the future of our state and what I believe I can offer as our next auditor,” LaRose said when asked if he was interested in being LG.
WEWS asked the same to Sprague at the event.
“I’m happy to serve the Vivek’s administration, however he sees fit… I very much want to serve as Secretary of State,” the treasurer said. “To me, it’s all about serving the people of the state of Ohio. We need great leaders at every different level and whatever opportunity that I’m given, I’m gonna perform to the best of my ability.”
But the name coming up the most from strategists is term-limited Senate President Rob McColley. Although he didn’t respond to questions about interest in being LG, he did speak earlier in the day about his support of Ramaswamy.
“We need leadership that’s going to lead boldly, leadership that’s going to lead unapologetically in many ways, to make a lot of very tough decisions, to get us to that next level,” McColley said. “I believe Vivek Ramaswamy represents our best opportunity to do that.”
Still, the primary is a year away — so a lot can change in that time.
On the Democratic side, the only declared candidate is former Ohio Dept. of Health Director Amy Acton.

Renee Erickson chats on the Senate floor during the April 10, 2025, veto session. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)Republicans who want to strip public schools of funding, impoverish teachers and stunt learning opportunities for the littlest Kansans have accused educators of “fearmongering.”
Unfortunately, the fearmongers have a point.
Legislators in Topeka underfunded schools for years. The state Supreme Court not only ordered them to change course but kept jurisdiction over the case for five years to ensure compliance. That binding ruling came down in 2019, only to be interrupted by a global pandemic. Now our Legislature plans to rewrite the school funding formula, this time without court oversight. Given lawmakers’ past actions and current rhetoric, educators’ concerns sound well founded.
This session alone, lawmakers reneged on a pledge to significantly boost special education funding. They had made the pledge just last year, but budget-busting tax cuts proved too alluring.
They advocated a mammoth school voucher bill, one that would funnel state money to wealthy families (the proposal didn’t make it through this year).
And just coincidentally, they sent a constitutional amendment to voters that would change the process for selecting state Supreme Court judges — possibly leading to an anti-education high court.
These legislative actions, taken as a whole, suggest that lawmakers want nothing more than to spend less on public schools, shift resources to private religious institutions and face the absolute minimum of scrutiny while doing so. Of course no one will admit to this, but one only has to watch what’s happening and connect the dots.
That’s all before we come to formula rewrites.
While the words sound wonky, the outcome couldn’t be more important. Officials are deciding how to fund the state’s schools for years to come. If they don’t get this right, or if they seek to pull back from prior commitments, a whole generation of Kansas kids could suffer.
A task force held hearings on the subject May 6 and May 7, and Kansas Reflector senior reporter Tim Carpenter covered day one and day two.
Just listen to the voices of those who will be deciding the future of public education.
The task force chairwoman, Sen. Renee Erickson, a Wichita Republican: “There has been a poisoning of the well against this process already, and superintendents are worried. It doesn’t benefit anyone to poison the well and already start gearing up for an expensive lawsuit without having anything to sue over yet. That mentality is not helpful to anyone in this process.”
Rep. Scott Hill, an Abilene Republican: “I find it bordering on immoral that people would understand, which we all do, that we’ve been teaching kids wrong for a long time. And, to not change that teaching direction on their own without supplemental money is abhorrent.”
Erickson again: “By no means am I going to allow the Legislature to be the convenient villain in this reading scenario. It just defies logic.”
Erickson once more: “We overpay our ineffective teachers way too much. The longer they’re embedded in the system, the harder it is to get rid of the teachers who are not doing right by our kiddos. The sad truth of the matter is those are the teachers that are the highest paid because they’ve been there the longest.”
This should put anyone who cares about public education on high alert, if they aren’t already.
The grandstanding about reading scores, which came on the first day, shows lawmakers shifting the blame as quickly and forcefully as they can. They allocate the money. They pay the teachers. If they don’t like the scores, they can try following the law for a time and see what happens. They could even support the Blueprint for Literacy plan they created just last year. Instead, members and point fingers and accuse others of overreacting.
As for ineffective teachers, that quote came from a discussion about setting a floor on teacher salaries. To her credit, task force vice chairwoman and Rep. Susan Estes, R-Wichita, tried to have a civil discussion on the matter. That appears to have quickly gone south.
Rep. Kristey Williams, R-Augusta, promptly suggested that teachers could get second jobs. Erickson then backed up the idea that quality teaching somehow has nothing to do with seniority or pay.
Finally, task force members sounded bearish about paying for pre-K programs targeting at-risk children.
For Williams, the problem appeared to be that a state program competed with parochial ones: “We have put out of business many Christian schools, preschools and other types of classical education because they can’t compete with a free education.”
And I’m sure that at-risk 3- and 4-year-olds all come from families that can pour money into such programs.
Look, we don’t know what the task force will end up proposing. Perhaps the concerns of superintendents and others with eyes and ears will lead members to take a more constructive path. A clear-eyed view of the situation, however, suggests that those raising alarms have reason to do so. Why would the state underfund special ed, try to increase voucher programs and pass that constitutional amendment? Why would task force members attack schools and experienced educators?
An answer comes to mind, and it sure doesn’t involve spending more money. Kansas lawmakers appear prepared to kick the state’s students and teachers off a ledge while loudly proclaiming their innocence.

As the Trump administration continues to make significant cuts to NIH budgets and personnel and to freeze billions of dollars of funding to major research universities – citing ideological concerns – there’s more being threatened than just progress in science and medicine. Something valuable but often overlooked is also being hit hard: preventing research abuse.
The National Institutes of Health has been the world’s largest public funder of biomedical research. Its support helps translate basic science into biomedical therapies and technologies, providing funding for nearly all treatments approved by the Food and Drug Administration from 2010 to 2019. This enables the U.S. to lead global research while maintaining transparency and preventing research misconduct.
While the legality of directives to shrink the NIH is unclear, the Trump administration’s actions have already led to suspended clinical trials, institutional hiring freezes and layoffs, rescinded graduate student admissions, and canceled federal grant review meetings. Researchers at affected universities say that funding will delay or possibly eliminate ongoing studies on critical conditions like cancer and Alzheimer’s.
 


It is clear to us, as legal and bioethics scholars whose research often focuses on the ethical, legal and social implications of emerging biotechnologies, that these directives will have profoundly negative consequences for medical research and human health, with ripple effects that will last decades. Our scholarship demonstrates that in order to contribute to knowledge and, ultimately, to biomedical treatments, medical research at every stage depends on significant infrastructure support and ethical oversight.
Our recent focus on brain organoid research – 3D lab models grown from human stem cells that simulate brain structure and function – shows how federal support for research is key to not only promote innovation, but to protect participants and future patients.
 History of NIH and research ethics

The National Institutes of Health began as a one-room laboratory within the Marine Hospital Service in 1887. After World War I, chemists involved in the war effort sought to apply their knowledge to medicine. They partnered with Louisiana Sen. Joseph E. Ransdell who, motivated by the devastation of malaria, yellow fever and the 1928 influenza pandemic, introduced federal legislation to support basic research and fund fellowships focusing on solving medical problems.
By World War II, biomedical advances like surgical techniques and antibiotics had proved vital on the battlefield. Survival rates increased from 4% during World War I to 50% in World War II. Congress passed the 1944 Public Health Services Act to expand NIH’s authority to fund biomedical research at public and private institutions. President Franklin D. Roosevelt called it “as sound an investment as any Government can make; the dividends are payable in human life and health.”
As science advanced, so did the need for guardrails. After World War II, among the top Nazi leaders prosecuted for war crimes were physicians who conducted experiments on people without consent, such as exposure to hypothermia and infectious disease. The verdicts of these Doctors’ Trials included 10 points about ethical human research that became the Nuremberg Code, emphasizing voluntary consent to participation, societal benefit as the goal of human research, and significant limitations on permissible risks of harm. The World Medical Association established complementary international guidelines for physician-researchers in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki.
In the 1970s, information about the Tuskegee study – a deceptive and unethical 40-year study of untreated syphilis in Black men – came to light. The researchers told study participants they would be given treatment but did not give them medication. They also prevented participants from accessing a cure when it became available in order to study the disease as it progressed. The men enrolled in the study experienced significant health problems, including blindness, mental impairment and death.
The public outrage that followed starkly demonstrated that the U.S. couldn’t simply rely on international guidelines but needed federal standards on research ethics. As a result, the National Research Act of 1974 led to the Belmont Report, which identified ethical principles essential to human research: respect for persons, beneficence and justice.
Federal regulations reinforced these principles by requiring all federally funded research to comply with rigorous ethical standards for human research. By prohibiting financial conflicts of interest and by implementing an independent ethics review process, new policies helped ensure that federally supported research has scientific and social value, is scientifically valid, fairly selects and adequately protects participants.
These standards and recommendations guide both federally and nonfederally funded research today. The breadth of NIH’s mandate and budget has provided not only the essential structure for research oversight, but also key resources for ethics consultation and advice.
 Brain organoids and the need for ethical inquiry

Biomedical research on cell and animal models requires extensive ethics oversight systems that complement those for human research. Our research on the ethical and policy issues of human brain organoid research provides a good example of the complexities of biomedical research and the infrastructure and oversight mechanisms necessary to support it.
Organoid research is increasing in importance, as the FDA wants to expand its use as an alternative to using animals to test new drugs before administering them to humans. Because these models can simulate brain structure and function, brain organoid research is integral to developing and testing potential treatments for brain diseases and conditions like Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and cancer. Brain organoids are also useful for personalized and regenerative medicine, artificial intelligence, brain-computer interfaces and other biotechnologies.
Brain organoids are built on knowledge about the fundamentals of biology that was developed primarily in universities receiving federal funding. Organoid technology began in 1907 with research on sponge cells, and continued in the 1980s with advances in stem cell research. Since researchers generated the first human organoid in 2009, the field has rapidly expanded.
These advances were only possible through federally supported research infrastructure, which helps ensure the quality of all biomedical research. Indirect costs cover operational expenses necessary to maintain research safety and ethics, including utilities, administrative support, biohazard handling and regulatory compliance. In these ways, federally supported research infrastructure protects and promotes the scientific and ethical value of biotechnologies like brain organoids.
Brain organoid research requires significant scientific and ethical inquiry to safely reach its future potential. It raises potential moral and legal questions about donor consent, the extent to which organoids should be grown and how they should be disposed, and consciousness and personhood. As science progresses, infrastructure for oversight can help ensure these ethical and societal issues are addressed.
 New frontiers in scientific research

Since World War II, there has been bipartisan support for scientific innovation, in part because it is an economic and national security imperative. As Harvard University President Alan Garber recently wrote, “[n]ew frontiers beckon us with the prospect of life-changing advances. … For the government to retreat from these partnerships now risks not only the health and well-being of millions of individuals but also the economic security and vitality of our nation.”
Cuts to research overhead may seem like easy savings, but it fails to account for the infrastructure that provides essential support for scientific innovation. The investment the NIH has put into academic research is significantly paid forward, adding nearly US$95 billion to local economies in fiscal year 2024, or $2.46 for every $1 of grant funding. NIH funding had also supported over 407,700 jobs that year.
President Donald Trump pledged to “unleash the power of American innovation” to battle brain-based diseases when he accepted his second Republican nomination for president. Around 6.7 million Americans live with Alzheimer’s, and over a million more suffer from Parkinson’s. Hundreds of thousands of Americans are diagnosed with aggressive brain cancers each year, and 20% of the population experiences varying forms of mental illness at any one time. These numbers are expected to grow considerably, possibly doubling by 2050.
Organoid research is just one of the essential components in the process of learning about the brain and using that knowledge to find better treatment for diseases affecting the brain.
Science benefits society only if it is rigorous, ethically conducted and fairly funded. Current NIH policy directives and steep cuts to the agency’s size and budget, along with attacks on universities, undermine globally shared goals of increasing understanding and improving human health.
The federal system of overseeing and funding biomedical science may need a scalpel, but to defund efforts based on “efficiency” is to wield a chainsaw.

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)Oh, those pesky social studies standards.
Nebraska’s once vaunted but now diminished rivalry with Oklahoma has come to a shuddering halt. What was born on the gridiron years ago has now expired, as those charged with educating children in the Sooner State have proposed an educational standard with no pedagogical foundation nor semblance of the truth.
If adopted, the state’s high school students, in their study of the presidential election results from 2020, would be required to “identify discrepancies” in the process. Except there weren’t any. 
Sure, some insisted the integrity of the election of Joe Biden was tainted. But no tangible, verifiable evidence was found nor exists today to prove that the election had “discrepancies.” Nor does wishing, hoping, believing or offering debunked conjecture to the contrary make it so. Or worse, make it part of the public school curriculum.
Nebraska wins
If the standard is accepted, Oklahoma students will be learning a lie. Game over. Huskers win.
That’s because to my knowledge, Nebraska’s social study standards entertain no such nonsense. Nevertheless, as we’ve seen before on other fronts, culture war creep is a thing, a reality that can show up anywhere, including Nebraska’s classrooms. See book banning for details.
The standard’s news was among a spate of happenings from the silly to the serious during the last week connected to social studies, history, economics, whatever social science is to your liking. Oklahoma’s potential capitulation, which raises conspiracy theories to the level of actual American history, was only part of the story.
A bill introduced in Congress would codify President Trump’s notion that the Gulf of Mexico hitherto be known as the Gulf of America. His executive order did as much early in his second term, but EOs do not carry the weight or the permanence of an actual law. As you know, laws are what Congress passes, although you’d be hard pressed to find an example of that with the current confab now meeting in the Capitol.
‘Gulf of America’
Enter H.R. 276, which would change the name of the Gulf of Mexico permanently and compel all federal agencies to update their maps and documents to reflect such an alteration. I imagine that would also require a rewrite of state social studies or geography standards. The bill’s sponsor is U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga.
Oy, vey! Where to begin? Let’s start (and stop) with this: Why? Yeah, I can’t think of anything either. 
Nebraska U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., thought the entire episode was rather childish: “It just seems juvenile. We’re the United States of America. We’re not Kaiser Wilhelm’s Germany or Napoleon’s France. … We’re better than this. It just sounds like a sophomore thing to do.” Bacon’s nay in the name-change vote was a welcome development despite the measure passing the House. Perhaps Republican U.S. Reps. Mike Flood and Adrian Smith have an answer to why.
A better idea would have been to let the silliness languish, never to be heard from again. The House — and the rest of us — face more pressing matters, not the least of which is the looming crisis over whether or not we are a democratic republic that honors the principle of due process. Enshrined in two Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, due process is the bedrock on which a nation of laws is built.
Due process
Here’s a quick review of those details, all of which should be the social studies standard for anyone who calls America home: The Fifth Amendment says no one shall be “deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law.” The Fourteenth Amendment, ratified in 1868, uses the same eleven words, called the Due Process Clause, to describe a legal obligation of the states. Due process gives us legal procedures (processes), so the government cannot infringe on our individual rights.
More to the point in the current discussion is this: Due process applies to anyone — citizen or not — being adjudicated in the U.S., too, its language using “person” rather than citizen. 
Nevertheless, both the president and his Secretary of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem, sidestepped the due process question recently. That is, do they believe in it? Trump told NBC’s Kristin Welker he “didn’t know” because he isn’t an attorney. Noem simply would not answer the question during a congressional hearing. 
The nation’s history, like high school social studies, is replete with stories that essentially reveal who we are as a country, what we value — principles such as due process. They are the nation’s standards.
But when they get their corners knocked off, when we fail to live up to them, we no longer resemble ourselves. That’s a standard too far.

John McCosh/Georgia Recorder (file)A federal appellate court is set to hear a case Tuesday centered on a five-year debate over whether the national right-leaning group True the Vote used mass voter challenges to intimidate minority voters.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit will hear arguments in a case in which plaintiffs, including a voting rights group founded by Stacey Abrams, contend that the case has national implications. Attorneys from both sides will have 15 minutes to present their cases during Tuesday’s hearing.
Mass voter challenges have been a mainstay in Georgia since the 2020 presidential election, when Democrat Joe Biden narrowly defeated Republican Donald Trump by about 12,000 votes in the state.
According to the Abrams-founded Fair Fight Action and others who filed suit, True the Vote’s actions likely violated the Voting Rights Act by using inaccurate voter registration information and voter intimidation tactics such as posting citizen watchdogs to monitor people casting ballots.
This case stems from True the Vote’s efforts to challenge the voter eligibility of about 385,000 Georgia voters prior to the January 5, 2021 runoff election, when Democrats would take control of the U.S. Senate following historic wins by Georgia Democratic Sens. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff.
In January 2024, Gainesville U.S. District Court Judge Steve C. Jones concluded last year that Fair Fight did not prove True the Vote’s actions constituted voter intimidation prior to the dual Senate runoffs.
However, Jones criticized the conservative group’s “reckless” methods in compiling a list of voters.
Opponents of mass challenges claim that groups targeting Democratic-leaning counties are misusing the election law to challenge large numbers of voters as ineligible.

Many conservatives have argued that voter registration lists need to be purged of ineligible voters, while Democrats and progressive activists have alleged that mass voter challenges aim to intimidate and remove voters who should remain eligible.
Fair Fight alleges that True the Vote’s list in the 2021 runoff included a disproportionate number of Black, brown, and first-time voters who helped secure the 2020 presidential race for Biden. 
“The 385,000 mass challenge in the lead up to the January 5, 2021 runoff was the largest mass challenge ever filed in this way in the country,” Fair Fight CEO Lauren Groh-Wargo said. 
There’s been a debate over whether some new voting rules would improve voter confidence or if they are just attempts to appease Trump supporters who say he lost because of unfounded claims of widespread election fraud.
Georgia was at the center of the push to overturn the election results after Trump lost to Biden, becoming the first Republican presidential candidate to lose in Georgia in three decades. Trump’s narrow loss was reaffirmed through three counts, including one recount that was done by hand. Multiple recounts and audits after the 2020 election confirmed it was not tainted by widespread fraud.

According to state law, county election boards must find sufficient probable cause to move forward with an investigation when a voter does not appear to reside at their registered address, lists a non-residential address on their registration, or has other reasons that could disqualify them.
True the Vote founder Catherine Engelbrecht said her group will argue that their tactics promote fair elections when they return to Georgia court Tuesday.
“This isn’t just about one hearing — it’s about holding the line for election integrity and defending the voice of we the people,” she said in a statement. “Our legal team is locked in, sharpening every detail of our strategy. Our fight is to expose truth, uphold principle, and bring transparency to a process.”
Marc Elias, an attorney with Elias Law Firm and founder of left-leaning Democracy Docket, argues that the mass voter challenges in the True the Vote case are an egregious violation of Section 11(b) of the Voting Rights Act, which guarantees that voters will not face intimidation during the voting process.
“Now, courts have been chipping away against lots of the federal voting rights protections. I’m not going to sugarcoat that,” Elias said. “That has been true at the U.S. Supreme Court. It’s been true at the lower levels. But the fact is attempts to intimidate voters is still illegal, and 11 B is still goo valid law throughout the country.”

John Kennedy, who chaired the Senate Redistricting Committee, argued during a 2021 special session that the GOP-drawn maps are fair to all Georgians. In 2023, state lawmakers were directed by a federal judge to draw new maps. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderWe’ve passed the halfway point between the 2020 U.S. Census and the 2030 U.S. Census, but the battle over redistricting maps based on the last national headcount is still underway in Georgia. On Thursday, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals will hear arguments about whether or not to enact new maps. The dispute stems from a claim that the state Legislature drew up maps that violate the Voting Rights Act and dilute the votes of Black Georgians.
In late 2023, the district court struck down those Congressional and legislative maps, and lawmakers returned to the Capitol for another stab at them.
Marina Jenkins, executive director of the National Redistricting Foundation and the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, said Georgia’s population growth in the 2020 Census came from minority populations, especially Black Georgians, but she said the General Assembly’s maps didn’t reflect that and that lawmakers engaged in dirty tricks by eliminating majority-minority districts to draw new ones.
“The state of Georgia robbed Peter in order to pay Paul by enacting these maps,” she said. “These maps eliminated existing opportunity districts in order to draw so-called new opportunity districts, zeroing out black opportunity statewide. Black Georgia voters who were previously denied their right to equal representation continue to be denied that right, and others had that right revoked altogether on these new maps.”
Much of the debate over the maps came down to the state’s 7th Congressional District, previously represented by Democratic Congresswoman Lucy McBath, which was redrawn to favor a Republican. Republican Rich McCormick now represents the 7th District, while McBath was elected to the 6th District after defeating fellow incumbent Democratic Congresswoman Carolyn Bourdeaux.
The old 7th’s population was not majority Black – the plurality of the population was white, but a combination of minority groups made up the majority. Of the district’s voting age population 27% were Black, 21% Hispanic, 15% Asian and about 33% white.
In a court document filed last year, attorneys for Georgia argued that the state was obligated to protect majority Black districts, not districts where a coalition of minorities make up the majority, and that efforts to overturn the maps are political sour grapes.
“Their argument proves only one thing: Plaintiffs are upset that the General Assembly eliminated a safe congressional district for Democrats when it created the required new majority-Black district. But the Voting Rights Act ‘is a balm for racial minorities, not political ones.’ It cannot be hijacked to settle partisan disputes that are fairly decided at the polls,” the state’s attorneys wrote.

Google the word “CT biotech” and the number of recent news articles about successful Connecticut startups, biotechs and biopharmaceutical companies is astounding. Just recently, Merck announced it would acquire Stamford-based SpringWorks Therapeutics for $3.9 billion.
The success of the CT bioscience industry has benefited patients with lifesaving treatments and cures, but it has also bolstered Connecticut’s fiscal outlook immensely.   Connecticut biotech has contributed to property tax rolls, created thousands of high paying jobs for Connecticut residents and has drawn talent from across the world to our state.
Gov. Ned Lamont recognized the value bioscience companies bring to the state earlier this legislative session by proposing an increase to the Research and Development tax credit in his budget. Since R&D so defines the biopharma industry —it takes $2.7 billion of R&D to bring a new medicine to pharmacy shelves— enhancing this tax credit makes great economic development sense.
Unfortunately, the governor has also introduced HB 6870, An Act Addressing Patients’ Prescription Drug Costs which, amongst other things, would implement price controls in the form of tying medicine prices to the Consumer Price Index (CPI).
It’s important to underscore that the essential goal of HB 6870 -–to lower patients’ healthcare costs— is laudable and something the Bioscience Growth Council and its members share.
In order to achieve that goal, however, we must recognize that drugs represent only a small part of the healthcare cost equation. Medicines account for only about 15% of what we in the U.S. spend on healthcare. That share of the healthcare dollar has been remarkably stable for 75 years.
To bring meaningful change and cost savings to healthcare it is critical to examine the other 85% of the equation —surgeries and hospital stays, MRIs and CT-scans, doctor’s visits, home healthcare assistance, insurance plan design, to name only a few.
It is also worth noting that this legislation is not occurring in a vacuum. The ongoing threat of tariffs at the federal level has already contributed to significant instability and concern for the bioscience industry (and many others).
The governor’s healthcare bill would limit price increases drug manufacturers can charge for generic and off-patent drugs to the CPI.
Nominally keeping generic and off-patent drug price increases in line with inflation as measured by the CPI may seem reasonable, but it ignores the fact that the CPI is an average of a broad spectrum of products. The CPI does not reflect the rate of inflation for any one specific product category. The overall January CPI, for example, was three percent, but for eggs it was 15.2%.
The components of the drug supply chain, including the supply chain for generic and off-patent drugs, are many and variable.  They are sourced from around the world. This is especially the case for the complex manufacturing applicable to injectable and infused biologics.
The price increases suppliers in the generic and off-patent drug supply chain charge for ingredients can often exceed the CPI.  Since many parts of and ingredients used in drug manufacturing are sourced from overseas, currency fluctuations can have a dramatic effect on prices significantly in excess of the CPI. At a time when actions in Washington have already significantly affected the supply chain, it is critical that Connecticut leaders take a pause before further upending the supply chain for Connecticut companies. Not only is this a financially smart decision it also helps to reduce the risk that Connecticut (and all) patients will no longer be able to access their medications should further supply disruptions occur.
It’s also important to recognize that tethering medicine prices to a rigid formula like the CPI is a form of price control and price controls never work. No matter the product—flour, machinery, medicines— price controls cause shortages, delay the introduction of new products and manufacturing capacity, give rise to black markets and incentivize high introduction prices.
A rigorous study —academic or otherwise— demonstrating the effectiveness of price controls does not exist.
Price controls didn’t work when Richard Nixon tried them, didn’t work in Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union, and aren’t working in Venezuela or Zimbabwe.
When tried, all price controls have done is ratchet up the misery of empty store shelves and metastasizing inflation.  Applied to medicines, they would translate into shortages and slow, or non-existent, introduction of new, cutting-edge cures and therapies.
If the cost of ingredients for a medicine spike beyond the CPI and manufacturers can’t cover their costs, we certainly would not want government policy to be the cause of manufacturers leaving the market and consumers facing empty pharmacy shelves.

Others were advocating for those whose voices are often silenced, pushing back against an administration determined to strip us of our own. Some were even pushing individuals in wheeled chariots, those unable to run the race themselves, so they, too, could cross the finish line.

Grace Williams
As I watched, I began to cry. It started with a single tear escaping down my cheek, and before I knew it, I was sobbing. That’s when I realized – I was starved for kindness; for compassion; for the simple, profound reminder that humanity is still capable of showing up for one another.
Lately, it feels like I lose a little more faith each day in the values we were taught as children. The headlines are relentless: thousands losing their jobs overnight; mothers praised only if they bear six children, a cruel hallmark of this new “baby-booming” administration; a father torn from his family and deported to El Salvador, despite having every legal right to remain.
My parents raised me to believe in sharing, caring, loving, forgiveness, and respecting others. I still try to live by those principles. But more and more, I find myself asking, where has the compassion gone?
As a graduate student at Yale, I’m part of a group that puts these principles into action, our “Compassionate Dialogue Group.” It’s a space shared by students and faculty who come together, not to debate or to solve, but simply to be present. We gather to listen, deeply and respectfully. We talk about our worries, our joys, our lives. There’s no agenda. Just the quiet, powerful understanding that whatever is shared will be met with kindness. That here in this group, we are safe. Here, we are seen. Here, we are nourished by compassion and respect.
It sounds simple. But lately, practicing compassionate dialogue outside of that space has become harder than ever. People don’t want to listen, especially if your perspective challenges theirs. Sometimes they don’t want to listen at all. And yet, over the past year, I’ve found deep relief in the silence of our sessions, sitting quietly, listening to the stories of those around me, and being reminded that the values I was raised with still live in others. That they’re not just relics from childhood, but guiding truths that can still shape the world around us.
So, the question becomes: how do we spread this? How do we rebuild a culture of compassion, respect, and real listening, in our relationships, in our communities, in ourselves?
While I don’t have all the answers, I do have a few challenges for you.
I challenge you to talk to a stranger, not a deep conversation, just a compliment, a kind word. You never know how much it might mean. I challenge you to sit back during your next conversation and truly listen. Don’t speak unless your words add something meaningful. Silence holds incredible power. And finally, I challenge you to end each day reflecting on where you encountered compassion, whether it was something you received or something you gave.
Growing up, my dad and I would recite a list of words each morning before school. Those words still hang on a sign in my family’s living room:
Sharing. Caring. Loving.
Focus. Concentrate. Participate.
Give compliments. Leadership. Forgiveness. Respect.
These were more than just words, they were a blueprint for how to live and how to treat others. And I believe that if we truly practiced them, if we made space for each other with compassion and courage, so much of what feels broken could begin to heal.

(Photo by Yehyun Kim/ctmirror.org)The state’s largest health care workers’ union agreed to push a May 19 strike deadline at 51 Connecticut nursing homes back until May 27, Gov. Ned Lamont announced Friday.
A spokesman for SEIU 1199NE confirmed the delay, which the Lamont administration sought.
“Earlier this week, I met with union leadership representing Connecticut’s nursing home and group home workers and expressed to them that I agree that their current wages do not match the value of the service they provide and that I join them in their effort to seek an increase in their compensation,” Lamont said. “Additionally, I informed them that I believe there is a consensus among legislative leaders who also feel the same and that we are working to negotiate a state budget that includes support for this workforce.”
The governor added that “Connecticut’s nursing home and group home workers do strenuous work on behalf of our most vulnerable residents, and my administration is committed to reaching a positive resolution on their behalf as soon as possible.”
Union president Rob Baril said Friday that “we had a couple of conversations with the governor’s office, and we were extremely clear” about wage and benefit concerns.
The union wants to boost starting pay for caregivers to $25 per hour and, over several years, elevate most employees to about $30 per hour. Most nursing home workers in the state currently earn between $18 and $22 per hour, a wage that leaves many members in poverty.
Though wage and benefit negotiations technically are between private sector nursing homes and their staff, the state often plays a role in resolving labor-management disputes in this industry.
That’s because, on average, more than 80% of nursing home revenue involves patients whose care is covered by federal and state Medicaid dollars.
Baril added the Lamont administration indicated it’s working hard to identify the resources necessary to bolster wages and benefits. “We are going to take them at their word,” Baril said.
Providing the type of raises the union seeks would require a major new public investment in nursing homes.
SEIU 1199NE estimates it would require an extra $550 million in Medicaid payments over the next two fiscal years combined, an annual average of $275 million, to fund the improved wages and benefits workers are seeking.
About 50% of Connecticut’s Medicaid expenses in most program areas are covered through federal reimbursement, which would make the effective annual cost to the state about $137.5 million.
Meanwhile, Lamont and his fellow Democrats in the General Assembly’s majority are already struggling to develop a new state budget that complies with the constitutional cap that keeps most spending growth in line with household income and inflation. They hope to adopt a new two-year state budget before the regular 2025 session ends on June 4.
Earlier this month, the union set a May 19 strike deadline. The potential work stoppage would affect roughly 5,700 nursing home workers.
But this year’s state budget negotiations are far most complex than usual, given the uncertain future of Medicaid, a federal health care entitlement program run in cooperation with states.
Congress set a goal of achieving cuts to Medicaid and other programs worth $880 billion over the next decade. Lamont’s administration has modeled potential cuts, based on various proposals on Capitol Hill that could cost Connecticut anywhere from $186 million to $880 million per year.
Matthew Barrett, president and CEO of the Connecticut Association of Health Care Facilities, the state’s largest nursing home coalition, thanked state and union officials for their continuing efforts to avoid a strike.
“Separating nursing home residents from their caregivers causes real harm and trauma,” Barrett said. “Workforce development, including wage and benefit enhancements as an employee retention and recruitment policy for both union and non-union employees, is essential to addressing the care needs of Connecticut’s dramatically aging population.”

Baraka, a Democrat, walked out of the federal building where he was being held just before 8 p.m. to the strains of “Ain’t No Stoppin’ Us Now” by McFadden & Whitehead blaring through speakers that had been set up by protestors.
The mayor, one of six Democrats running for governor in the June 10 primary, said he “didn’t do anything wrong.”
“I didn’t know this morning when I woke up that I would be in this facility here, that I would end up incarcerated for something that I believe is my democratic right to show up and speak out against what I think was happening here, a violation of city and state laws,” he said.
He was ordered to be released by U.S. District Court Judge Andre M. Espinosa at roughly 7:30 p.m. Baraka said he was charged with trespassing and will have to appear in court May 15. He said Department of Homeland Security agents treated him “very nicely.”

Baraka’s release capped off a wild day in Newark that started with him and three members of Congress — Democratic Reps. Bonnie Watson Coleman, LaMonica McIver, and Rob Menendez — appearing in Newark to visit Delaney Hall, a 1,100-bed immigration detention center that Baraka has tried to prevent from opening, saying the jail’s owner has not obtained necessary city permits.
Baraka said he was with fire officials Friday attempting to gain entrance to the facility, and videos show he was warned by federal agents that he would be placed under arrest.
After immigration agents arrested Baraka, acting U.S. Attorney Alina Habba claimed the mayor was trespassing. McIver and Menendez said Baraka was invited onto the jail’s property before he was arrested.
A scuffle broke out after protestors locked arms to protect Baraka, with Watson Coleman and McIver being pushed by immigration agents, videos show. Menendez was also seen yelling at officers not to arrest the mayor.
Baraka was walked away by masked agents and plainclothes officers.

The Department of Homeland Security characterized the incident as a “bizarre political stunt.” It claims the House members were “holed up in a guard shack” with protestors while a bus of detainees entered the security gate. It also denied claims that Delaney Hall does not have the proper permitting — allegations at the center of a lawsuit Newark filed against the jail’s owner, Geo Group — and said inspections and fire codes have been cleared.
Once protestors and officials found out Baraka was being held at an ICE facility on Frelinghuysen Avenue about 10 minutes away from Delaney Hall, the protest moved there — and grew. Hundreds of supporters and immigration activists stood in the pouring rain, relentlessly chanting for hours for federal officials to free the mayor.
State senators, county commissioners, local council members, and politicos from nearby New York also joined the protest. Meanwhile, statements of support poured in from other Democrats who are also running for governor, while Republicans used it as an opportunity to attack Baraka. Baraka’s campaign also sent out a fundraising text while he was detained.
During the protest, ICE agents peered through windows of the brick building where Baraka was being held, and a group of six agents stood in the parking lot, keeping watch on the crowd.
Watson Coleman told reporters that she had been “manhandled” during Baraka’s arrest. And Menendez called it an “act of intimidation” to keep the public from speaking about the Trump administration’s increasing immigration enforcement.
“The fact that they pushed, physically assaulted two female members of Congress, ask yourself if this is the beginning or if they’re going to change course,” Menendez said. “I have no faith that they’re going to change course, but we will continue to speak out against it.”
Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, said on social media that while he was happy to see Baraka released, “the bottom line is he never should have been detained in the first place.”
While walking with police officers down Frelinghuysen Avenue after his release, Baraka was asked what his next steps would be.
“See my children,” he said.

(Photo by Erick Doxey/InvestigateWest)An unexpected slash to a small corner of Washington’s state budget has civil legal aid organizations scrambling to plan for a future without financial support.
Both the House and Senate biannual budgets put forth by state lawmakers this year included around $5 million to support the legal aid organizations that are critical in helping to vacate unconstitutional drug convictions across the state. But after the two budgets were reconciled in the final days of the legislative session, the funding had disappeared. State lawmakers put forth a balanced $77.8 billion budget on April 27 after months of debate and amid an anticipated $16 billion budget shortfall. The final budget is now awaiting Gov. Bob Ferguson’s approval.
“It’s a gut punch,” said Camerina Zorrozua, the legal director and co-founder of The Way to Justice, a nonprofit legal aid organization based in Spokane that has relied on the funding since 2021. “The rug was just pulled out from under us.”
Since 2022, three Washington legal aid and advocacy organizations — Civil Survival, Living with Conviction, and The Way to Justice — have relied on state funding from the Office of Civil Legal Aid to help people vacate convictions on their criminal records that became constitutionally void after a 2021 Washington Supreme Court ruling known as State v. Blake.
The Supreme Court found the state’s simple drug possession law to be unconstitutional because it lacked language related to intent, the cornerstone of the U.S. legal system. The historic decision not only made Washington’s law void but also made hundreds of thousands of past misdemeanor and felony convictions dating as far back as 1971 eligible to be wiped from a person’s criminal record, and for any financial costs incurred eligible to be refunded by the state. ​​A new law criminalizing drug possession, coined the “Blake-fix,” went into effect in July 2023.
But the process to vacate the cases is not automatic and has to occur in the court where the conviction was made. While some courts have been proactive in identifying and vacating eligible cases, others have left it up to the impacted individuals to navigate the convoluted system and initiate the process independently. That’s where legal aid and reentry organizations have worked to fill in the gaps.
“These are unconstitutional convictions, and the state has an obligation to make people whole for unconstitutional convictions,” said Corey Guilmette, the co-executive director at Civil Survival. “Cutting the funding for the organizations that are doing that work is unacceptable.”
The cuts caught the Office of Civil Legal Aid — the state agency that has historically received the funding — by surprise.
“The first we heard of it was when the budget came out,” said Philippe Knab, the office’s reentry/eviction defense program director. “There was no warning, no opportunity to advocate for the work that the contractors are doing.”
While the $5 million that was cut from the Office of Civil Legal Aid’s budget is minuscule compared to the state’s overall budget, the impact of those cuts will be monumental to the legal aid organizations that run on shoestring budgets, Guilmette said.
“We’ll be reduced by just under $1.1 million of annual funding,” he added. “For an organization with a $2.7 million budget, that’s close to 40% of our funding that just got wiped out.”
It will be challenging to provide effective representation for their current clients given the cuts, Guilmette said.
“I don’t have money to pay our staff after July 1, and that’s what we are scrambling to do,” he said.
A long way to go
The cuts to State v. Blake funding come as there’s still a long way to go to vacate the eligible cases throughout the state. As of January 2025, the Washington State Patrol reported that about 18% — or 114,567 — of the estimated 600,000 eligible cases identified by the Administrative Office of the Courts had been vacated statewide. The vacate process can be complicated, time-consuming and varies widely from court to court.
Guilmette said that in March, his organization began representing nearly 150 new Blake-related cases, which still barely scratches the surface. The last time his organization opened its public-facing intake form on its website, it received two years’ worth of cases in only two months.
His team specifically focuses on helping clients obtain reimbursements for costs related to their illegal conviction, including attorney fees, drug treatment costs and other court fees.
He said that while the state is working to administratively vacate cases en masse through a recently established process by the Administrative Office of the Courts, that process doesn’t address people’s refunds. There is another state process for that called the Blake Refund Bureau, but for jurisdictions that aren’t taking a proactive approach to first vacate their cases — which is the first step in the process — legal aid organizations are necessary to help fill in the gaps.
“I understand it’s a difficult budget year, but this problem is not going away,” Guilmette said. “The state has to, one way or another, vacate these convictions.”
“So we can’t just kick the can down the road,” he added. “This is expertise that will vanish, and it will make it harder. It will cost more in the long run to be able to do this work.”
Ultimately, he fears that undocumented people who have unconstitutional convictions on their criminal record will be impacted the most since the conviction could be grounds for deportation.
“I think that’s tragic, and I think as a state, I don’t think you can say that you’re really protecting immigrant communities if you are knowingly cutting these resources,” he added.
Katrin Johnson, the deputy director for operations at the Washington Office of Public Defense, said her office, which helps lead State v. Blake efforts statewide and receives funding from lawmakers to do so, didn’t budget for having to support the three organizations previously funded by the Office of Civil Legal Aid. But she said their role is critical.
“We’re going to have to regroup and see what we can do, but we certainly aren’t going to have the flexibility to fund them at the same level they were funded before,” Johnson said. “We don’t even know that we can fund them.”
But she hopes the organizations can find funding given the unique role they play. “They are closer to the communities than we are,” Johnson said. “We’re a state agency.”
“Losing them in the Blake efforts is going to be a huge setback,” she added.
‘That feeling of justice’
When David Anderson got three of his four cases vacated under State v. Blake in 2024, he said he finally felt free. Since getting out of prison in 2001, he had been diligently paying $20 every month toward his court fines and fees.
“We leave incarceration, then you have these financial straps on you,” said 72-year-old Anderson. “And it’s these financial straps that keep people coming in and out of the system.”
In 2024, his court bill stopped coming. He panicked, thinking he would be arrested for nonpayment. When he went to talk to the county court in Spokane, he learned he was eligible to get his cases removed under State v. Blake — and potentially get his money refunded.
He was told that the court was inundated with cases and that it might take a while before his case could be looked at, so he was referred to the nonprofit The Way to Justice.
The legal aid organization helped him complete the necessary paperwork to get three of his four eligible cases vacated and removed from his criminal record. Then three months later, he received a refund check from the state of Washington in the mail, and the rest of his debt was swiftly eliminated.
He now keeps a framed copy of the vacate order and check hanging in his living room, surrounded by his artwork and photographs of his seven children and 14 grandchildren. As a thank you for their work, he donated $100 to The Way to Justice. Any chance he gets, he tells his friends and neighbors about State vs. Blake, even passing out flyers in the neighborhood to people who might be eligible for relief.
“I thought I’d have that chain on my neck for the rest of my life,” Anderson said. “If that clerk hadn’t passed me that pamphlet, I would have never known anything about the Blake program.”
Zorrozua, with The Way to Justice, said she’s determined to keep doing Blake work despite the funding cuts. She co-founded the organization in 2020 and was initially fiscally sponsored by the Martin Luther King Center in Spokane. “We had free office space in their old day care center that was originally a firehouse up on the South Hill, but we eventually got our own 501(c)(3) status,” Zorrozua said.

“It was the Blake case that gave us the ability and the funding and the resources to be able to take our work statewide,” she added. “That’s another reason why it hurts, because Blake was the door that opened legal aid to The Way to Justice, and helped us to grow to what we are today.”
She said it “stings” that Gov. Ferguson’s $100 million budget request to create a grant program to hire more local law enforcement was approved by state lawmakers, while the $5 million in funding to provide Blake support was cut.
“They’re building up this apparatus to criminalize folks and to put them through the (criminal justice) system, but at the same time removing the resources that we need on the back end of the system to help make people whole again,” she added.
Zorrozua said that getting to work with people like Anderson is what keeps her going.
“You can tell just by talking to someone like David what a weight is lifted and just that feeling of justice,” she said. “You can’t really describe it, but you know it when you see it.”
“He’s a perfect example of someone who historically was caught up in the war on drugs,” she said. “People were dismissed and stereotyped and forgotten. And the Blake case brought us back to reality. We have the opportunity to make it right and to humanize the people who are impacted.”

Advocates are calling on Michigan legislators to invest more state dollars into targeted funding for students living in poverty as the Trump administration’s efforts to slash federal education funding could have “devastating” impacts on the most vulnerable students.
An analysis released Thursday by the research and advocacy group Education Trust-Midwest found that Michigan still ranks among the lowest in the nation when it comes to equitably funding schools, despite new investments.
The need for more equitable school funding after years of underinvestment in the state is heightened now by threats to federal dollars and students continuing to fall further behind on academic assessments, according to advocates.
“I’ve never used the word catastrophic in my career, but this is the word that comes to mind right now in terms of the situation that I think high-poverty districts are facing,” said Amber Arellano, executive director of EdTrust-Midwest.
According to the group’s report, Michigan ranked 44th in the nation for fourth grade reading and 31st for eighth grade math on an assessment known as the “nation’s report card” in 2024.
Jen DeNeal, director of policy and research for EdTrust-Midwest, said Michigan did not have a solid foundation in teaching early literacy before COVID. After the pandemic, that foundation “crumbled,” she said.
The state’s average reading scores dropped nearly 10 points between 2003 and 2024, said DeNeal, and the bulk of the drop happened during pandemic years.
The Education Recovery Scorecard, which compares data on the national assessment to those administered in 2019 before the pandemic, placed Michigan in the bottom five of states for academic recovery.
The scorecard found Michigan third through eighth graders are on average about two-fifths of a grade level behind in math and three-quarters of a grade level behind in reading compared to student scores in the state before COVID.
The EdTrust-Midwest’s analysis found the trend held true in rural, suburban, and urban areas across the state.
“Some of the largest gaps are in suburbs and towns and rural areas where we see these big proficiency discrepancies pre-and post-pandemic,” said DeNeal.
Data from the state’s 2024 assessments, known as the M-STEP, show students from low-income families, Black and Latino students, multilingual learners, and students with disabilities fell at least 10 percentage points below state averages in third grade reading and seventh grade math.
 Michigan leaders worry about the impact of federal cuts

The prospect of federal funding rollbacks could be “devastating” to Michigan students who are still struggling to catch up, said Arellano, noting that research shows more funding for programs that assist students with higher needs can lead to better academic outcomes.
Last week, President Donald Trump proposed cutting nearly $6 billion in federal K-12 spending and consolidating 18 grant programs into a one funding stream states could spend without restrictions.
“One very clear message that we are getting from this proposed Trump budget is that public education for all students is not a priority,” said Arellano.
The proposal for the 2025-26 school year would eliminate programs for English language learners and children of migrant farm workers.
Michigan has long lagged behind other states when it comes to funding education initiatives for English language learners, though it has made some increases in recent years.
Trump’s budget would also cut money for the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights, which enforces anti-discrimination laws in schools, by more than a third.
Cuts that have already been made to the Office for Civil Rights have begun impacting Michigan students with disabilities, with many reporting their open cases have not moved since the Trump administration began its second term.
Title I funding, which is allocated to schools that serve students from low-income families, and dollars distributed under the Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act are not slated to be cut under Trump’s plan.
Arellano said other federal proposed cuts could have negative impacts on Michigan students, such as a congressional Republican plan that would make it more difficult for schools to provide universal free school meals. According to the Michigan Department of Education, that plan could mean thousands of students in the state could lose free school meals.
 Advocates call for increased state funding

Just to stay stable with current funding levels for districts, the state will have to step in to cover shortfalls caused by potential federal cuts – particularly for students living in poverty, English language learners, and children with disabilities, Arellano said.
“The truth is that we’re already underfunding these groups of students,” she said.
Michigan first adopted a weighted funding system for students considered to be “at-risk” in 2023. The system, known as the “opportunity index,” assigns districts to one of six bands based on the percentage of students living in poverty. Each band determines how much additional funding a district will receive. Before that, Michigan allocated the same amount of per-pupil dollars to all students classified as at-risk.
For the 2024-25 school year, Michigan invested about $1 billion into the opportunity index.
The change came after years of advocates calling for a new system in response to the state being ranked among the worst states in the nation for its gaps in funding between districts in impoverished and wealthy communities.
The Michigan Department of Education determines whether students are at risk with a set of criteria that includes factors such as being from an economically disadvantaged family, learning English as a second language, being chronically absent from school, or experiencing homelessness.
EdTrust-Midwest’s new analysis found Michigan in the bottom 10 of states for weighted funding, despite historic investments in the opportunity index.
The group’s report calls for the state to invest an additional $2 billion in the opportunity index over the next five years to reverse the impact of years of underfunding.
The report also recommends more guardrails in place to ensure the weighted dollars are being spent on the students they are intended for.
Michigan is still early into its budget process for the next school year. In her February budget proposal, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer proposed increasing funding for at-risk students by more than 4%.
Last month, the Democratically-controlled state Senate approved a plan that would increase at-risk funds by 25%.
The Republican-controlled state House passed a bare-bones education budget proposal in March that only included dollars for special education, mental health, and school safety programs, an increase to the per-pupil foundation allowance, and allocations to the Michigan Public School Employee Retirement System.
Republicans said the proposal was passed to fund essential government functions in case negotiations with Democrats stall the process this summer.
“This is not the time for cutting funds for kids,” said Arellano. “Kids in our state are behind other states. This is the time when we need our leaders to lean in and support educators and students in our schools.”

Trust and respect for people's data isn't just ethical — it's crucial to the long-term success and sustainability of any business.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont small business owners: Vermont businesses must stand on the right side of history.","This letter is by five small business owners: Taryn Adamczyk of Sunnyside Coffee Company; Travis Noyes of Chapman’s General; Abby Copeland of Wrights Mountain Wellness Collective; Shelly Blodgett, a holistic energy healing practitioner; and Glynn Pellagrino of Glynn Pellagrino Acupuncture & Traditional Chinese Medicine.History is defined by moments when individuals, organizations and communities choose to take a stand — or choose silence. Today, Vermont faces one of these defining moments.Last month, more than 23,000 Vermonters took to the streets, protesting national leadership that threatens our legal systems, social infrastructure and the very foundations that sustain Vermont’s vibrant small business community. Central to these protests was a clear message against fascism, autocracy and unchecked power.History provides sobering lessons on the dangers of unchecked surveillance and data misuse. Authoritarian regimes throughout history have relied heavily on surveillance and personal data collection to control, manipulate and oppress individuals. Today, the widespread collection of personal data by corporations poses similar risks, creating vast digital profiles that can be easily misused by governments and bad actors alike.Europe’s rigorous privacy protections, known as General Data Protection Regulation, emerged directly from their experience with authoritarian regimes misusing personal information. Vermont now has a similar opportunity — and responsibility — to proactively safeguard our citizens’ privacy and dignity.Yet, certain Vermont trade associations have opposed strong data privacy legislation championed by our state representative, Monique Priestley. Some have aligned with Big Tech members and industry groups, signaling troubling support for practices that turn human identities into commodities.Experts warn us that surveillance and data collection efforts could increase significantly, targeting vulnerable groups such as immigrants, individuals seeking abortion services or those requiring gender-affirming health care. Even ordinary citizens can find their personal data weaponized against them by vigilantes or authoritarian regimes.We must critically ask ourselves as Vermonters and small business owners: Are these practices we wish to support?As rural small business owners deeply invested in Vermont’s future, we believe in an economy built on trust and respect for consumer privacy. Our customers deserve to know their information is secure, used only as necessary and protected from exploitation.Trust and respect for people’s data isn’t just ethical — it’s crucial to the long-term success and sustainability of any business. Customers return to businesses they trust, and in an increasingly digital world, data privacy is foundational to maintaining that trust.Vermont has proudly led the nation before as the first state to abolish slavery, legislatively pass marriage equality and require GMO labeling. We cherish community values over corporate interests. Now, we must confront big tech oligarchies intent on extracting profit at the expense of individual dignity and community integrity.Priestley, a dedicated advocate for Vermont’s small business community, understands these challenges intimately. As a business owner herself and a leader who has served on local chamber of commerce boards, business association boards, and as chair of Green Mountain Economic Development and Vital Communities, she has consistently supported Vermont entrepreneurs.She has provided technical assistance to hundreds of business owners and taught small business planning to empower Vermont entrepreneurs directly. With her extensive experience spanning technology, economic development, community finance and entrepreneurship, Priestley has courageously championed strong data privacy protections. Her bill upholds critical consumer rights enshrined in Vermont law since the 1960s — rights currently under threat.Businesses hold a responsibility — not merely to profit but to uphold ethical practices and social justice. By supporting strong privacy protections, Vermont businesses send a powerful message: We value people over profits. We champion trust over exploitation.We also call on consumers: Ask questions of the businesses you support. Check in with local owners and managers to understand where they stand. Your purchasing power is influential. Support businesses that prioritize your privacy and clearly align with protecting your rights.This is our moment to choose clarity over complacency, responsibility over silence. History is watching. Let Vermont’s businesses proudly stand on the right side of history by protecting our neighbors, customers and communities — today and always.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont small business owners: Vermont businesses must stand on the right side of history.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Commentaries_featured-image-25.png,,,2025-05-11 10:00:12.801183

(Kelly Hertz, Yankton Press & Dakotan)Shelsey Klein was 33 weeks pregnant and crying when she stormed into the Winner Regional Health CEO’s office.
She found out through social media in December that the hospital planned to close its labor and delivery unit in February, a week before she was due to deliver her baby. She and her husband lectured the CEO about the stress the announcement put on their family and asked him what families like theirs were expected to do.
“You don’t tell a very heavy, pregnant woman who is emotional that all of a sudden her plans of where she’s having the baby will change,” Klein said.
Rural patients face tough choices when their hospitals stop delivering babies

She lives on a ranch outside of White River, a half hour’s drive away from the Winner hospital, and delivered her three other children there. She wanted the same experience for her fourth.
Would she be delivering her baby in the emergency room with a doctor who wasn’t trained in obstetrics?
Would they have the tools to ensure her comfort and safety in case things went awry?
Or would she establish care with a new obstetrician at a hospital more than a two-hour round trip away, taking time off from her teaching job to make appointments and juggling her children’s care and her husband’s work on the ranch?
That stress of making those choices is the reality for mothers across South Dakota as more rural hospitals close their labor and delivery units, creating maternal care deserts. Some providers worry proposed cuts to Medicaid will exacerbate the issue, forcing more rural hospitals to close their labor and delivery units or close entirely.
Winner Regional Hospital delayed its closure from Feb. 1 to the beginning of March, after receiving pushback from community members and patients like Klein. The 39-year-old delivered her baby girl at the hospital on Feb. 2.
Making the choice: Driving the distance
South Dakota reports the second highest infant mortality rate in the country, according to the latest data from the National Center for Health Statistics. It also reports the second highest percentage of counties identified as maternal care deserts, according to March of Dimes. Pregnancy-associated deaths in the state increased 146% in the last decade, according to the state Health Department.
Some providers identify lack of maternal care access as drivers of the state’s elevated maternal and infant risk. About 58% of South Dakota counties don’t have birthing facilities, according to March of Dimes, and most of those counties overlap with tribal communities. The state’s infant death rate in 2022 was 7.78 per 1,000 live births, and 20.5 per 1,000 births among Native Americans.
South Dakota has a women’s health care shortage. The abortion ban may worsen it, physicians say.

More than a hundred rural hospitals in the U.S. have stopped delivering babies since 2021, according to the Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform, often due to physician shortages or finances. Seventeen of South Dakota’s 49 rural hospitals still provide labor and delivery services, according to the report. One unit is at risk of closing.
South Dakota hasn’t experienced a decline in its birth rate like other states, seeing an increase around 2% between 2023 and 2024. But fewer providers are trained in obstetrics, said Emma Bye, an obstetrician-gynecologist at Yankton Medical Clinic in southeastern South Dakota.
“It’s terrifying what we have going on in our state,” Bye said. “We’re at a precipice. It’s scary to be a provider.”
Winner is the only rural hospital in South Dakota to close its delivery ward so far this year. Sisseton’s Coteau des Prairies Health Care System in northeastern South Dakota, in a town of about 2,400 and caring for patients on the Lake Traverse Reservation and surrounding rural areas, stopped deliveries last year.
The Philip hospital in central South Dakota hasn’t delivered babies for over two decades. Most women in the area plan to deliver their children nearly an hour and a half drive away in Rapid City or Pierre, said Lacey Hamill, a stay-at-home mother of 3-year-old and 20-month-old girls.
Hamill’s family lives on a ranch about 35 miles north of Philip. She made her prenatal care appointments in Philip, but had to drive to Rapid City for ultrasound appointments since the local hospital doesn’t have the equipment. Once patients near their 36th week of gestation, they’re referred to an obstetrician in Rapid City or Pierre to develop a relationship before delivery.

The former nurse drove with her toddler to the first few appointments in her third trimester. But it was too much of a hassle.
“I asked, ‘Are you just going to check my blood pressure and tell me I’m doing fine? I can do that at home,’” Hamill said. “I have a fetal monitor checking device at home. I kept a log book. Driving four hours round trip with a toddler wasn’t in the books for me.”
Her second daughter was born hours before Hamill was scheduled to be induced. She and her husband had booked a hotel room 10 minutes from the Rapid City hospital. The baby was born within an hour of their arrival.
“Had we been home, I would have had her on the interstate,” Hamill said, adding that for rural South Dakotans pregnancy is “a lot of praying that you make it to where you need to be.”
Since the Winner hospital stopped delivering babies, average daily deliveries at the rural Cherry County Hospital in Valentine, Nebraska, doubled from 0.6 to 1.4, said Jesse Wint, chief nursing officer. The hospital is 10 miles from the South Dakota border and 74 miles from Winner.
For South Dakotans in counties west of Winner, it’s one of the closest options. Pierre is the next closest, and the Indian Health Service on the Pine Ridge Reservation has a delivery ward for tribal members. It is the only IHS facility in the state with an obstetrics ward, said Meghan Curry O’Connell, chief public health officer at the Great Plains Tribal Leaders’ Health Board. 
A lack of choice: Delivering in the ER
For people who lack transportation, the distance from a hospital that delivers babies increases the likelihood of high risk pregnancies, Curry O’Connell said. People might be forced to deliver in an ambulance, in their car or in a hospital emergency room.
Winner Regional Health has delivered two babies in its emergency room since it closed its labor and delivery ward, said CEO Brian Williams. Before Hamill left her nursing job in Philip, she helped deliver twins in the emergency room.
The Wagner Community Hospital, amid the lands of the Yankton Sioux Tribe, delivers about six babies a year in its emergency room, said TiAnna Smith, an ER physician and chief medical officer at the hospital. 
Each time a pregnant patient enters the ER, Smith said, nurses and doctors are “scared.” Obstetrics aren’t emphasized in their training, patients can’t get an epidural, and the facility lacks surgeons or anesthesia if a cesarean section is needed or if there are severe complications.










It’s terrifying what we have going on in our state. We’re at a precipice. It’s scary to be a provider.


– Emma Bye, obstetrician-gynecologist at Yankton Medical Clinic


Bye often tries to coach staff over the phone, since she is one of the closest obstetricians in the area and holds a clinic each week at the Wagner IHS facility.
“It’s really difficult to streamline care when you have a lot of midlevel providers terrified of these situations coming to their doorstep,” Bye said.
About half of Wagner’s emergency deliveries involve active substance use, Smith said, which can lead to premature deliveries. Many patients deal with other complications that increase the risk, such as diabetes and hypertension. And many emergency deliveries occur among women who don’t have reliable transportation or haven’t regularly attended prenatal visits.
If they haven’t gone to prenatal care appointments, the doctors don’t have records of how far along they are or what complications they may have.
“Usually, as soon as mom hits the ER door we’re calling for a flight team,” Smith said.
Charles Mix County, which includes Wagner, is not considered a maternal care desert according to the March of Dimes or the state Department of Health. But a facility in Platte closed its labor and delivery ward about a decade ago. There’s a midwife in Platte who’s 50 miles away from Wagner and can’t intervene if surgery is needed.
“If we’re considered ‘full access,’ then that paints a lot of concern for areas that have even less access,” Smith said.
Talk of Medicaid cuts threaten maternal health, rural vitality
President Donald Trump and Republican members of Congress are considering major cuts to Medicaid funding. Bye expects South Dakota mothers and babies would feel the consequences within six months. Medicaid is a federal-state health insurance program for people with low income.
“You’re looking at a mom who is already poor and doesn’t have health insurance coverage from any other source, who lives in a rural setting and has to drive two and a half hours for an appointment that won’t be covered, who has to spend time away from her family or miss work. That’s an insurmountable barrier,” Bye said. “You’re not going to get those moms to come to their appointments.”
Congressional budget agency projects sweeping Medicaid cutbacks in states under GOP plans

Rural hospitals will start closing within a year or two of the decision, Bye expects, harming not just Medicaid patients but anyone living in a rural community.
Nearly a quarter of people in rural communities are covered by Medicaid, including 47% of all births, making the program a significant source of income for OB-GYNs. They would see their budgets decreased if patients lose access to the program. Rural hospitals that are able to stay open might have to cut some services they offer — like labor and delivery — to keep their accounts from going too far into the red.
“You have hospitals across the state that you may not know about, that haven’t been published about, but they’re operating in the red already,” Bye said. “If you add Medicaid cuts, it could be catastrophic.”
In addition to asking South Dakota’s congressional delegates to refrain from cutting Medicaid when she visited their offices in March, Bye advocated for the Rural Obstetrics Readiness Act. The bill, first introduced in 2024, would establish new federal grants for rural health care systems to purchase equipment for obstetrics and create a telecommunications pilot program.
The Wagner hospital relies heavily on telemedicine to supplement its care, including emergency and neonatal intensive care. Expanding that to obstetric telemedicine would improve the care they provide for ER deliveries, instead of relying on phone calls to OBs more than an hour away.

Williams, with Winner Regional Health, hopes to recruit OB-GYNs to reopen the labor and delivery ward, but cutting Medicaid would make that harder. About 80% of babies delivered at the hospital last year were on Medicaid.
The hospital is seeing more and more “government payers” in the health care system, Williams said, adding that he understands the cost of the federal government covering an increasing number of patients.
“If they were to disappear it’d make it difficult for us,” Williams said. He’s concerned about how Medicaid cuts will “affect us and our viability.”
The Winner hospital is the largest employer in Tripp County, Williams said. If it’s forced to close, that’ll impact surrounding counties. And once a main industry is lost, it’ll be hard to build it back.
“We talk about wanting a stronger economic powerhouse in the U.S.,” Williams said. “You can’t do that if you don’t have healthy people.”",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/BYE_0016-1024x731.jpg,,,2025-05-11 10:00:12.801183

A U.S. Census Bureau survey found almost 592,000 new apartments were finished last year, the most since the […]","Apartments and stores under construction in Rapid City, S.D., in 2023. New apartments reached almost 592,000 nationally last year, the highest number since 1974, with South Dakota and the Rapid City area approving new apartments at particularly high rates. (Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)More new apartments were built in 2024 than in any other year since 1974, but the Trump administration’s tariffs and deportations of potential construction workers, plus higher interest rates, could be a wet blanket on the boom.
A U.S. Census Bureau survey found almost 592,000 new apartments were finished last year, the most since the 1970s, when baby boomers sparked a construction surge as they moved out of their childhood homes. There were 693,000 new apartments built in 1974, when the country had about half as many households.
But there has been a steep slowdown in construction starts, as the newly completed apartments come online. The increased supply has lowered rents and increased vacancy rates, making new development less profitable. Some experts also say tariffs on construction materials and labor shortages caused by dips in immigration will create headwinds for new construction.
Apartment starts were down 27% in 2024 compared with 2023, and down 37% from a recent peak of 531,000 in 2022, despite the historic rate of completions. Apartment starts were at their lowest ebb since 2013.


Housing experts have long lamented that there aren’t enough apartments and single-family houses in the U.S. — at least not in places where people want to live and at prices they can afford. Estimates of the national housing shortage last year varied widely, from 1.5 million houses and apartments to 20.1 million; since then, another 1.6 million houses and apartments have been built. Most experts estimate a shortage of 1.5 million to 5.5 million, according to the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University.
Some states are building apartments faster than others, according to a Stateline analysis. Though completions aren’t tracked by state, permits that lead to new apartments have been granted at high rates in recent years in South Dakota, Utah, Arizona and Colorado. Rates are lowest in Mississippi, Wyoming, West Virginia, Rhode Island, Oklahoma and Alaska.
The massive jump in apartment construction has its roots in 2021 and 2022, when interest rates were low and rent growth was high, said Rob Warnock, senior research associate for Apartment List, a company that posts rental listings online.
 

“Those new apartments came online in 2023 and 2024, and while those deliveries are slowing down today, there are still many apartments in the pipeline,” said Warnock, who added that “supply and demand are coming back into balance.”
In response to greater supply, rents have fallen by about $50 per month (3.5%) from their 2022 peak, according to a report released this week by Apartment List. Apartment vacancy is at a 15-year high of 6.3%, keeping a lid on rents, but that could turn around as construction slows, according to an April report by Moody’s, a financial services company.
Apartment building has been a bipartisan priority as single-family home prices soar further out of the affordability range for young families. In South Dakota, the Republican-controlled legislature worked to prolong the building boom with grants and loans under the state’s Housing Infrastructure Financing Program. The program put $200 million of state and federal funding toward defraying the costs of development in new neighborhoods, such as roads, sewer lines and streetlights.
Republican state Sen. Casey Crabtree, sponsor of the proposal signed into law in 2023, told Stateline it was needed to address a housing shortage, especially in rural parts of the state.
“We have a drastic shortage of workers,” Crabtree said before a vote in 2023. “South Dakota businesses need more workers in our state. To get more workers, we need more housing.”

Armand Domalewski, co-founder of YIMBY Democrats for America, said overregulation is a barrier to housing construction in many areas that his party controls.
“A lot of blue-government areas and cities have extremely restrictive zoning, impact fees and other rules that make it very difficult to build housing,” said Domalewski. Another barrier is local opposition, he said.
“If it was just a free market, developers would want to build in the places like California, where prices are the highest and rents are the highest, because they’d make more money,” he added.
In California, the 2021 HOME Act was meant to spur more affordable housing and ease labor shortages, but it’s faced local opposition in some areas. At the end of last year, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed several measures that aim to streamline regulations and crack down on local resistance to the 2021 law.
South Dakota approved nearly 6,000 permits for apartment units in 2023 and 2024, which when completed would add about 1.4% to its 2023 total of 417,000 housing units. That’s the highest rate in the nation. By contrast, Mississippi during that same period approved about 660 apartment units — a fraction of 1 percentage point to its 2023 base of about 1.4 million housing units.



A lot of blue-government areas and cities have extremely restrictive zoning, impact fees and other rules that make it very difficult to build housing.


– Armand Domalewski, co-founder of YIMBY Democrats for America


Chas Olson, executive director of the South Dakota Housing Development Authority, said the full impact of the state infrastructure funding isn’t apparent yet, as many developments that received the help are still under construction.
Completions are still strong this year with about 39,000 apartments finished in March, not much different from the 41,500 in March 2024, which was the biggest March number since 1985.
Another impediment to apartment construction has been high interest rates, which make it harder to borrow money to build, said Danushka Nanayakkara-Skillington, an assistant vice president for forecasting and analysis at the National Association of Home Builders.
She expects apartment building starts to slow until later this year.
“We are going to be short of workers for a long time. That’s the way it is. And of course tariffs are going to have an impact,” Nanayakkara-Skillington said.

For the sake of communities across the Commonwealth, we can’t allow cuts from Washington to be a fatal blow to crucial climate projects here.
The post We can’t let Trump cuts stop critical climate resilience projects   appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","IN RECENT YEARS, extreme weather events and climate disasters—from severe storms and flooding, to damaging cold snaps and drought—have inflicted billions of dollars of damage on our state’s economy and communities. It will only get worse as climate change turbocharges extreme weather.  We can either abandon impacted communities to face the consequences and pick up the tab for expensive repairs again and again, or we can proactively invest in climate resilience projects that protect families, neighborhoods, and livelihoods, and save more money than they cost. Last month, a years-in-the-making collaborative effort to protect essential infrastructure in Chelsea and Everett became the latest local project to be impacted by the Trump administration’s funding cuts.  The shuttering of the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities Program (BRIC) has led to the cancellation of a $50 million grant to support the Island End River Flood Resilience Project that is working to mitigate the region’s flood risks, which continue to grow each year, and protect infrastructure critical to New England and beyond. The loss of this grant deeply damages ongoing efforts to protect this region. But for the sake of communities across the Commonwealth, we can’t allow it to be a fatal blow. As the Trump administration continues to defund initiatives aimed at preparing communities and the economy to weather the impacts of climate change, we need to work together to step up and find alternate paths to fund urgent resilience projects that will safeguard our families, our infrastructure, and our future. The Island End River, nestled along the border of Chelsea and Everett, is a half-mile-long tributary of the Mystic River. It is surrounded by a 500-acre floodplain—about the size of 30 Gillette Stadiums—that includes former marshlands that were filled in for industrial use.  The area already floods often, threatening businesses that serve New England and the mid-Atlantic states, as well as homes and other infrastructure, and shutting down roads. The risk of a catastrophic flood—on the scale of Hurricane Sandy—looms large over Everett and Chelsea in the near future. By 2030, just five years away, a rare but extreme event could produce flooding more than seven feet deep in some areas. With climate change and sea level rise, flooding events that disrupt regional supply chains and commuter travel are projected to occur at least annually by 2050 and daily by 2070 based on the Massachusetts Coast Flood Risk Model. Within this highly vulnerable area is the New England Produce Center, which provides fruits and vegetables to more than eight million people throughout New England, regional highways, two MBTA commuter rail stations, a regional FBI headquarters, jobs for 11,000 workers, critical energy hubs, the MGH Chelsea health care facility, schools, a local Market Basket grocery store, and housing for 5,000 people in Chelsea and Everett. The essential infrastructure and services housed in this area are not only critical for the wellbeing of our local communities, but also the people throughout New England and the mid-Atlantic states that rely on these resources.    The Island End River Flood Resilience Project, spearheaded by the cities of Chelsea and Everett in close collaboration with community-based partners, residents, and a regional watershed organization, is a product of nearly a decade of regional collaboration and support among municipalities, community members, the private sector, and local, state, and federal leaders.  The project will build a new linear flood barrier along the river and an underground facility to help prevent and manage storm surges. It will also create new ways for the public to enjoy the waterfront, including an elevated riverwalk, a new Island End Park, and restored wetland habitats. The project would generate more than $30 in benefits for every dollar spent on construction and maintenance, and billions of dollars in present-day net benefits.  The loss in BRIC funding has put the project on life support; now it needs a new path forward. Everett and Chelsea, low-income communities already disproportionately burdened by environmental harms, simply do not have the money to build this regionally critical project by themselves. Instead, we need to embrace the opportunity to stand up, get creative, and set an example for protecting communities and infrastructure vulnerable to the effects of climate change. The data show that investments in resilience projects can make an enormous difference in our ability to withstand and reduce the economic impacts of climate change. A 2024 study by the US Chamber of Commerce found that for every $1 spent on disaster preparedness, $13 is saved in economic impacts, on average.  Initiatives like the state’s Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness (MVP) Grant Program offer a potential state-driven solution to invest in these very efforts at the local level. MVP already helped fund planning and design phases of the Island End River project, and with additional resources, could offer an important pathway to ensuring that Island End River and similar vital projects across the Commonwealth can be constructed.  Communities across the Mystic River watershed and throughout the state are all facing serious risks from climate change, and we can’t afford to abandon essential projects that will meaningfully improve the lives of people throughout the region. By making strategic investments in data-driven resilience projects like the Island End River flood barrier, we can build a Massachusetts that is resilient, secure, and prepared for the challenges ahead. Sal DiDomenico is a Democratic state senator from Everett. Roseann Bongiovanni is executive director of GreenRoots. Nasser Brahim is director of climate resilience at the Mystic River Watershed Association. The post We can’t let Trump cuts stop critical climate resilience projects   appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/0000000Tobin.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-11 09:01:09.011707

In ‘refined’ library plan, Vermont State University says it will keep more physical books

“Expanding nursing through the creation of labs and simulation space will really allow us to expand our nursing capacity here at Johnson and within the Lamoille County area,” Nolan said. “It would be a huge and positive byproduct in terms of just creating more nurses and contributing to the health care workforce in this part of the state.”The Johnson campus is building out a unique tiered nursing program, where students can work toward the most basic levels of nursing qualifications, beginning with practical nursing certifications and laddering through a registered nursing degree and eventually to some master’s degrees.Now, five years out since a warning by former Vermont State Colleges Chancellor Jeb Spaulding proposed the closure of several campuses, including the one in Johnson, amid financial distress, the state has invested millions in turning the beleaguered university system around.Part of the former state college system’s reorganization has included a reshuffling of its academic offerings. In 2023, the university announced consolidations and shifts in focus at its campuses, including the expansion of in-demand nursing programs at its Johnson and Williston campuses, while some fine arts programs at Johnson were either terminated or consolidated.Empty shelves on the second floor of the library at Vermont State University-Johnson. Photo by Aaron Calvin/News & CitizenThe university recently announced a 15% increase in new students, with the nursing program among those receiving the most interest, even as the program is being built.The university has also been assessing the unused buildings on its campuses and attempting to work with local communities to find new uses for them. For example, McClelland Hall on the Johnson campus is in the process of being transformed into affordable senior housing through previously apportioned federal funding.The second floor of the library was identified as the area best suited for this component of the nursing program.“It’s the one space that really would work well to build out the lab and simulation space,” Nolan said. “It would work really well for the students and for the program and would work in terms of just making the infrastructural changes that we would make we would need to make within the budgetary constraints that we have.”Empty shelves on the second floor of the library at Vermont State University-Johnson. Photo by Aaron Calvin/News & CitizenThe university’s libraries were the subject of contentious public debate in winter 2023, when then-Chancellor Parwinder Grewal attempted to enact a cost-reduction plan that would have closed libraries at campuses across Vermont, including the one in Johnson.That decision was rescinded and Grewal resigned following intense backlash from students and the public. According to Alejandra Naan, library director for the Vermont State Colleges System, the decision to give up the second floor of the Johnson library to the nursing program was out of her scope but would benefit the Johnson campus in general.“It’s about enriching the campus with another program, and essentially everyone benefits,” Naan said. “In terms of the library space, it’s being reorganized to make room for it.”The university libraries are still playing catch-up after the pandemic closures prevented them from enacting the regular weeding of their collections, the process through which materials that are out of date or see little use are removed from the collection. Catching up on weeding has allowed the Johnson campus to free up space on the library’s second floor, and Naan said the process was standard and evidence based.According to Naan, these changes will ultimately benefit the library.“Nurses are huge library advocates and library users, so if anything, it might bring more vibrancy to the library, which we’re really excited about,” she said.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont State University-Johnson swaps library space for nursing labs.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/vsu-johnson-2-20240626-1024x676.jpg,,,2025-05-11 09:01:09.011707

Ronald Squires, D-Guilford, at the AIDS Project of Southern Vermont’s Walk for Life in 2014. Photo by Kevin O’Connor/VTDiggerMost matriarchs observe Mother’s Day on the second Sunday in May. But Guilford great-great-grandmother Shirley Squires has reason to wait until the AIDS Project of Southern Vermont’s annual Walk for Life fundraiser later this month.The 94-year-old didn’t know much about the human immunodeficiency virus that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome when it struck her son, former state Rep. Ronald Squires, D-Guilford, some four decades ago.The lawmaker was the first in the Vermont Legislature to announce his homosexuality, doing so in the spring of 1992 to help pass a statute prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation.“This bill is not about special privileges,” the representative told colleagues on the House floor, noting the legislation instead would give him and his peers “the same rights that you all have.”Nine months later on Jan. 8, 1993, the 41-year-old was hospitalized for AIDS-related viral meningitis when switchboard operators patched through a call from then President-elect Bill Clinton.“They thought it was a hoax,” his mother recently remembered. “I was dumbfounded.”Within the next hour, the legislator, taking his last breath, became the first Vermont public figure to lose his life to AIDS, the Associated Press reported nationwide.“Just before he died,” his mother recalled, “he said he didn’t know what he would do without the AIDS Project.”Shirley Squires knew little about the Brattleboro-based nonprofit, one of the state’s three AIDS service organizations — along with Vermont CARES and the Upper Valley’s HIV/HCV Resource Center — that provide support to people with HIV as well as community prevention and education programs.Squires nonetheless collected $1,000 from family members and friends for the organization’s 1993 Walk for Life, not knowing how far that first step would take her.When AIDS was initially identified in the 1980s, a diagnosis was a certain death sentence. The advent of testing and treatment in subsequent decades is now helping some 750 Vermonters live with the virus, according to the state Department of Health. But such advances have left succeeding generations less concerned and, as a result, less conscientious of a disease that still must be managed by ever-continuing and costly medications.Shirley Squires helps carry a banner for Brattleboro’s AIDS Walk for Life in 2017. Photo by Kevin O’Connor/VTDiggerAnd so the great-great-grandmother (yes, she has children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren and great-great-grandchildren, although she admits to losing count of how many) hasn’t stopped generating money and awareness.Squires, yet to miss a year of fundraising, reported a cumulative total of $52,000 upon her 10th anniversary walk in 2003, $235,000 upon her 20th in 2013 and $456,118 upon her 30th in 2023. By the start of 2025, her lifetime haul was up to $478,007 — just $21,993 shy of a half-million dollars. Anticipating her annual handwriting of solicitation letters to 500 regular contributors, Squires had a sure-fire pitch: If she can raise just $104 more than the $21,889 she reaped last year, she’ll hit the $500,000 milestone. But that isn’t what the matriarch penned to her mailing list that ranges from past and present state leaders to locals who visit her home at Christmastime to view her collection of more than 1,000 Nativity sets.“I am writing on behalf of Shirley, who recently broke her shoulder and is unable to write her usual personalized note,” someone else printed.Even so, Squires and the staff of the AIDS Project are forging forward.“Every single dollar Shirley brings in could potentially be replacing a chunk of funding that we might be losing,” said Samba Diallo, the service organization’s executive director.The AIDS Project, whose nine staffers serve 77 clients in Bennington and Windham counties, operates on an annual budget of about $600,000. Nearly 85% of that comes from federal and state funding, with the remaining 15% covered by local and private sources.Talk of government cuts is scaring the nonprofit, which already has seen financial aid shift from rural areas with fewer people and lower perceived risk to urban centers with larger populations.“There are so many challenges, but money is the biggest,” Diallo said. “How do we make sure we have stable funding?”The AIDS Project will start by holding its 38th annual Walk for Life on May 31 at 10 a.m. at Brattleboro’s Centre Congregational Church.Squires hopes people will contribute whatever they can.“I want to try to write everyone to thank them,” said the matriarch, who notes she no longer has to confine her shoulder to a sling.Diallo, for his part, is drafting his own wish list.

Tate Reeves does hold a good bit of power over lawmakers during a special session. But in reality, that special session power can be limited by lawmakers if they so choose.","The Mississippi Constitution gives the governor the sole authority to call a special session and to set the agenda.
It is one of the few powers granted to the governor by the Mississippi Constitution.
But in reality, the special session power the governor possesses can be limited by legislators if they so choose.
Granted, the Legislature cannot convene a special session. Once legislators end a regular session, they cannot return unless called by the governor or until the next regularly scheduled session. Lawmakers are dependent on the governor to call a special session to allow them to take up a state budget, which they remarkably were unable to pass during the regular session that ended in early April.
Many believe that the governor will have more authority over the budget in special session than in regular session. For instance, can the Legislature consider a bill to fund special projects throughout the state if Gov. Tate Reeves does not include what is known by many as the “Christmas tree bill” in the agenda? Debate over that special projects bill appears to be the major sticking point preventing a budget agreement between the House and Senate. The House wants a Christmas tree bill. The Senate does not.
In 2008, then-Republican Gov. Haley Barbour called the Legislature into special session to levy a tax on hospitals to fund a $90 million Medicaid deficit. House leaders instead tried to pass a “compromise” bill that levied a tax on cigarettes, combined with a smaller hospital tax.
Republicans screamed that the cigarette tax could not be considered because it was not part of Barbour’s call. Then-Speaker Billy McCoy ruled that the governor could set the agenda for the special session — to provide more funding for Medicaid — but could not dictate how that funding was derived.
The whole issue became moot because Democrats could not garner the votes to pass their proposal. Yet, they also were able to block the hospital tax increase.
The end result was that the special session ended without the Medicaid funding issue being resolved. The issue lingered for more than a year.
In the 82-day 2002 special session, then-Gov. Ronnie Musgrove placed on the agenda the issue of providing protection from lawsuits for medical providers. He said he would expand the agenda to allow lawsuit protection for all businesses after the medical provider bill reached his desk.
But the Senate leaders said the governor could not limit how they addressed lawsuit protection. They wanted to do it all in one bill.
But the House, not as set on what some called “tort reform,” said it could only address the issue of lawsuit protection for medical providers because of the agenda set by the governor.
For several days, the two chambers literally sat and stared at each other.
Finally, then-House Speaker Tim Ford asked for an official opinion from Attorney General Mike Moore on whether lawsuit protection could be considered for all businesses. Moore’s opinion said that only lawsuit protection for medical providers could be considered since that was the limit of the governor’s call.
The AG’s opinion did not carry the force of law. But the Senate leaders, who said they did not agree with the opinion, finally acquiesced and worked with the House to pass lawsuit protection for medical providers. And then, Musgrove, true to his word, expanded the call to give legislators the ability to consider additional protections for businesses.
The bottom line is that lawmakers have substantial leeway in a special session to interpret the governor’s call. By the same token, the governor can veto legislation if he thinks the Legislature exceeded his call or not sign the bill and ask the courts to block the legislative action.
But the Mississippi Supreme Court has been reluctant to get involved in the inner workings of the Legislature.
For instance, the state constitution gives any legislator the option to have a bill read before final passage. That provision has been used as a method to slow down the legislative process or as a form of protest. In recent years, the legislative leadership countered by using a computer application to have the bills read at a super high speed. The program, spitting out words at an incomprehensible speed, was dubbed the “demon chipmunk.”
The leadership was sued, claiming the demon chipmunk speed violated the state constitution.
The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the legislative leadership and the demon chipmunk.
The majority opinion read, “We hold the court lacks constitutional authority to interfere in the procedural workings of the Legislature, even when those procedures are constitutionally mandated.”
If Supreme Court justices are not going to strike down the demon chipmunk, would they get involved in a fight over the interpretation of the governor’s special session agenda?",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/05020255/3X0A7300-scaled.jpg,,,2025-05-11 08:00:48.214362

Citizens are given access to impartial courts to hear their complaints and to decide the proper course forward in light of the law.There is now a mountain of academic literature documenting that these accountability provisions have worked well. Indeed, after more than a half-century there is no doubt that citizen suits under these laws have been central, indeed fundamental, in protecting America’s public health and environment.Now, an important disagreement has arisen under the state’s Global Warming Solutions Act, a landmark legislative enactment addressed to a most important issue.Although the Global Warming Solutions Act was adopted four years ago, one of our best environmental groups, the Conservation Law Foundation, believes the state has failed to accurately model Vermont emissions and adopt sufficient measures to ensure the achievement of the legally required pollution reduction targets.

(Governor's Office photo)Economic development officials in Louisiana want to place less emphasis on the number of new jobs major projects bring to the state and more on what they pay employees.
Their strategy calls for a new business incentive program to replace a popular existing one, but it could be a decade or longer before the state stops doling out both perks – potentially costing the public hundreds of millions of dollars annually.       
Last month, the House Committee on Commerce approved House Bill 507, by Rep. Julie Emerson, R-Carencro, which would create the Louisiana High Impact Job Program. It hopes to entice companies that offer jobs with above-average pay in the parish where they intend to invest. In return, the state will award the business a grant that will cover a portion of that salary – the more the company pays new hires, the higher the grant. 
Companies providing jobs that pay 125% of the parish average will receive a grant to cover 18% of each salary. The award goes up to 22% for salaries at 150% of the local level. 
For what the bill deems “distressed areas,” employers would have to clear lower hurdles. Their businesses would receive an 8% grant for salaries at 110% the average.

There are no limits in the bill on the number of new jobs a company can add to claim the benefit, though the bill gives state officials the right to update the program’s rules. There is a ceiling of $200,000 per year per job and $125 million in annual grant awards for the entire program.
Employers must offer health insurance coverage to qualify for a High Impact Jobs grant, and the new hires have to be full-time direct employees or work for a subsidiary named in the grant contract with the state. 
The bill allows remote jobs to qualify for the incentive, though they must be Louisiana “residents” as defined under state tax law.   
Money for the grants will come from state corporate income and franchise taxes, according to the bill, though lawmakers eliminated the franchise tax last year, effective Jan. 1, 2026. 
Legislative calculations attached to Emerson’s proposal peg the High Impact Job Program’s average cost to the state at $69.4 million annually over the next five years. 
Louisiana Economic Development Secretary Susan Bourgeois, who joined Emerson to present her bill to the committee, acknowledged the High Impact Job Program would overlap the incentive it’s intended to replace – the Quality Jobs program – for years to come. The Quality Jobs incentive gives companies a 6% rebate on their payroll expenses for 10 years. It also comes with either a state sales tax break on money the business spends on its job-creating project or a 1.5% rebate for facility expenses.
These project investment elements are not part of the High Impact incentive, which would be offered for a three-year period with an opportunity to renew for two more years. That would make it half the length of the 10-year Quality Jobs incentive.  
“Quality Jobs was really more about the number of jobs, where this [High Impact] program is far more about the wages for the jobs,” Bourgeois said in an interview after the bill was approved. 
The secretary told lawmakers the High Impact Job Program will also be open to small local businesses, as long as they create jobs with salaries above the parish average. 
Emerson’s bill, which gives the program a 10-year lifespan, goes next to the House Appropriations Committee for its financial impact on the state to be considered.

Businesses can swap incentives, but not double-dip
As part of their tax and budget special session last fall, legislators agreed to let multiple business incentives lapse once their statutory life expires. That deadline is the end of next month for most of the programs eliminated. This was paired with a package of business tax reductions, including a lower, flat corporate income tax rate and the end of a state franchise tax that its detractors called an unwarranted fee to do business in Louisiana.
All told, lawmakers agreed to end eight business incentive programs last year, effective June 30, which will remove $180 million to $225 million in state obligations from the state budget, according to Bourgeois. 
Jan Moller with Invest in Louisiana, a progressive fiscal policy watchdog group, told the Illuminator he expected the business-friendly legislature would eventually restore some of the incentives it targeted last year.  
“I’m not surprised that it happened,” Moller said. “I’m surprised that it’s happening four months after the ink dried on that tax bill.” 
Although Quality Jobs was among the incentive programs lawmakers eliminated, the state will continue to accept applications until its June 30 sunset date. Its actual payroll rebates aren’t issued until a qualifying company adds new jobs, and those hires can be made years after the incentive is approved. Only then does the 10-year clock on the incentive period start. 
For projects such as the Meta data center in northeast Louisiana, which isn’t expected to start hiring for another five years, the state could still be making good on its Quality Jobs promises in 2040, Bourgeois confirmed.
Quality Jobs recipients will be given the option to switch over to the High Impact program, but they won’t be able to double up on incentives, the secretary said. 
“If they have an existing [Quality Jobs] contract, then they can live out that contract,” Bourgeois said. “They can also choose to look at it and see if they would rather do it differently.”
Paperwork the Illuminator obtained through a public records request with Louisiana Economic Development shows 16 projects have applied for Quality Jobs rebates in 2025 as of the end of April. All told, they would create more than 1,500 direct jobs with a combined payroll of nearly $167 million once all new hires are made.
Ileana Ledet, LED’s chief economic competitiveness officer, told lawmakers the High Impact Job Program is modeled after similar incentive programs in Georgia, North Carolina and Texas that are considered successful.
“We’re looking at best practices and making our recommendations based on what other states are doing well in incentivizing those higher-wage jobs,” Ledet said.  
Moving the wage needle
Moller questions whether the High Impact Jobs Program will live up to its name. By linking the incentive to what’s already a below-average parish salary, companies won’t be required to move the needle significantly on living wages in his opinion, he said.    
“We are underwriting payroll of companies that we like, and they don’t even have to be particularly great jobs,” Moller said. “They just have to pay a little bit above average.”
The most recent figures from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics show average weekly wages in Louisiana during the first quarter of 2024 were $1,195, ranking 39th in the nation. The rate was lower than the state average in 47 out of 64 parishes, with Catahoula at the bottom with an average weekly wage of $710.    
The legislation gives Louisiana Economic Development the authority to carve out areas within a parish and declare them “distressed.” This is what’s planned for the Hyundai steel mill in Donaldsonville, Bourgeois said, where salaries significantly trail the Ascension Parish average. The typical weekly pay in Donaldsonville is $836, while the parish rate is $1,449, according to federal data.
Emma Wagner, LED’s communications director, said rules are still being hammered out to define what makes an area distressed. She expects they will include criteria such as the unemployment rate and whether the area qualifies for federal tax breaks targeting low-income communities. 
Moller acknowledged his outlook for the High Impact Jobs Program is shaded by the efficacy of the Quality Jobs incentive, which the Legislative Auditor determined in a 2020 report was a net loss for the state. That review also determined only a third of Quality Jobs investment spending went to Louisiana companies, and that the majority of household income those jobs created would have likely happened without the rebate program. 
“These kinds of subsidies end up becoming just lagniappe, but not the thing that brings a company into Louisiana,” Moller said.

This time, he took a train — but his message was the same.","Editor’s note: We are now offering an audio version of our Sunday features. To access, click on the player above.
William “Willie” Dellacamera wasn’t planning to come back to Washington, D.C., this soon.
In September, the Northford farmer made headlines when he drove his tractor from Connecticut to the U.S. Capitol after a hail storm ripped through his farm. His mission: to secure emergency federal funding for smaller farmers like him.
A week ago, as he walked by his fields — they’ll have ripe strawberries in about a month — he mused about another trip to the nation’s capital some time in the future, perhaps hoping to make a similar pitch. But when he heard the U.S. secretary of agriculture would testify in the upcoming week, he moved up the timeline and changed his plans.
It was going to rain in Connecticut anyway.

Dellacamera wanted to hear about the status of a $220 million federal block grant tailored for small- and medium-sized farmers who don’t typically benefit from federal programs as much as those in larger farming states. He figured his best chance to make the case was in person. He and other farmers need that disaster aid immediately.
He booked his trip last weekend and traveled to D.C. on Monday (this time by train). He didn’t know what to expect on his impromptu trip, except his plan to attend a pair of hearings. But it turned out that 48 hours after he got there, Dellacamera got face time with Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins and a lengthy shoutout during one of the hearings from his representative, Rosa DeLauro, D-3rd District.
Congress passed the Farm Recovery and Support Block Grant Program in late December as part of its year-end spending package. That legislation also included $23 million in agriculture disaster and economic relief for Connecticut.
The block grant program, championed by DeLauro and inspired in part by Dellacamera, will go to those in New England, Hawaii and Alaska who sustained damages caused by severe weather in 2023 and 2024. That includes crop, timber and livestock losses. Farmers and producers can qualify whether or not they have crop insurance.
But farmers in Connecticut like Dellacamera are still waiting to see if they qualify. The funding has been in limbo as the U.S. Department of Agriculture and state agencies still need to finalize agreements and allocations for each of the eight participating states. But Rollins confirmed USDA is working to get the funds out soon — both the block grant and the larger $21 billion to cover agriculture losses caused by natural disasters.
As things stand, Connecticut doesn’t know how much it will get. In January, the state’s agriculture department submitted a request of $83 million. That includes $72 million in reported losses, a 2% administration fee and $10 million for resiliency projects.
Creating a new federal funding stream is difficult. Implementing one is even harder. But Dellacamera — and some of the New England lawmakers — wanted answers. For him and other farmers in Connecticut, they need the money to pay their bills.
“I texted some of my other farmer friends, and all they say is, ‘Do you think you’ll get anything from going down there? Like what are you wasting your time for?’ But I don’t see it as a waste of time,” Dellacamera said.
“It was just a perfect alignment,” he said about the hearings and Rollins’ appearances at them. “Let me just go down there. I got nothing to lose at this point. So I was able to put a face to the story.”

From Connecticut to Washington, D.C.
Dellacamera didn’t come to D.C. as part of a group or a coordinated effort. He made the trip as a self-described “lone wolf.”
The first hearing on Tuesday was the bigger question mark. He showed up not knowing whether the block grant program would come up or if Rollins would stop to talk.
Rollins came to Capitol Hill to testify before House and Senate committees about President Donald J. Trump’s budget request. Trump proposed cutting USDA’s budget by 18% as 15,000 employees at the agency took deferred resignations that would place them on paid leave through September. Some employees in key offices won’t have their resignations accepted, and Rollins testified they are looking to fill some of these roles.
Her first stop was at a Senate appropriations subcommittee on Tuesday. About 20 people watched her testimony from the wood-paneled hearing room. Dellacamera took a seat behind her a few rows back and was visible in the livestream.
She fielded questions for over an hour about Trump’s budget proposal, workforce reductions, USDA funding cuts and office relocation plans. U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire specifically asked about the status of the $220 million block grant.
When the hearing wrapped, Dellacamera introduced himself to Rollins at the door. She listened intently as he told her about the hundreds of thousands of dollars in losses that culminated after a 13-minute hail storm in August — and the creditors who have not stopped calling since.
Rollins told him to hang in there and relay to the creditors that a piece of the $220 million is coming his way soon.

A USDA staffer assured him they are working on the program and noted that DeLauro is working with them to get it implemented. He exchanged numbers with her staff.
Dellacamera was pleasantly surprised by the interaction. He said he was not expecting the response he got on Capitol Hill or for Rollins to stop and speak with him. He left the interaction feeling that she was honest and earnest about wanting to help. Though he added that “the ball’s in her court.”
As he weaved through crowded hallways, more people took notice of his shirt that read “No farmers, no food, no future.” He easily stood out in a sea of suits.He was hundreds of miles from Northford but was instantly recognizable to those who know him. He was in a Senate office building when someone called out “Willie.” It was U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., who was on his way to go vote.
They shook hands and talked about his brief encounter with Rollins. Dellacamera joked that the interaction was different from the contentious one he had with Blumenthal when the senator visited his farm after last year’s hail storm. Tuesday’s exchange was cordial and light-hearted.
A couple of hours later, he met with DeLauro’s staff in her office to talk through the hearing the next day. As the ranking member of the House Appropriations Committee, the congresswoman would get the opportunity to mention him by name during her opening statement.

The two have worked together closely in the past and again after the hail damaged his farm. Dellacamera’s story was one of the reasons DeLauro and Connecticut’s congressional delegation helped create the farm relief block grant in December.
“When I went to D.C. [last year], I didn’t know what I was going to get, and I figured whatever I get is a blessing,” Dellacamera said last week from Cecarelli’s Harrison Hill Farm. “That’s called a Christmas present. I had no expectations of it even being like that.”
“It wasn’t only for me. It was for everybody in the state of Connecticut that doesn’t have insurance, that can’t get insurance, that can’t afford insurance, that is barred from insurance,” he continued. Dellacamera has crop insurance and got a small payout after the hail storm. But many specialty crop farmers in the state don’t have it.
He felt confident DeLauro would advocate for faster implementation of the program at the next hearing. And after his conversation with Rollins on Tuesday, Dellacamera was hopeful he would get more face time with the U.S. agriculture secretary the next day.
At Wednesday’s hearing over on the House side, Dellacamera wasn’t the only person in the audience from Connecticut. Representatives with the New England Farmers Union were in the room along with another farmer from the state, Robert Chang. Connecticut Agriculture Commissioner Bryan Hurlburt already had plans to be in D.C. for the day and stopped by the hearing.
Sitting next to Dellacamera was David Senter, who was part of the 1979 Tractorcade, when thousands of farmers drove tractors to D.C. in protest of rising interest rates, falling crop prices and foreclosures. Senter, as part of the American Agriculture Movement, drove his tractor from Texas for days until he reached Washington.

When it was DeLauro’s turn to deliver her opening statement, she put the spotlight on the Connecticut farmers in the room. Dellacamera was sitting right behind Rollins, and she turned around to shake his hand.
“I will work with you to make sure that this support gets out as the Congress intended. To date, Willie Dellacamera has not received one dime,” DeLauro said to Rollins at the hearing.
When it was her turn to ask questions, DeLauro got heated when asking Rollins about the status of the block grant program.
Rollins vowed to get that money out and urged patience, given that she took the helm of USDA three months ago and the program was created two months before that. She cautioned that the need from all eight states will likely exceed what has been appropriated by Congress.
“We’ll do everything we can. It’s my understanding it may not be enough. That in fact, the losses are bigger than the $220 million,” Rollins said.
DeLauro interjected, continuing to press her if USDA is committed to the program.
“Ma’am, it was three months ago. The last administration took more than a year. This is extremely complicated,” Rollins said in response as DeLauro continued to interject. “Your ag commissioner is coming in today to talk about it, so I think I’ve given a lot of confidence that we’re working really hard on that and doing everything we can.”
The back-and-forth ended with a commitment from Rollins: “For the 10th time since I started 40 minutes ago, it will begin to flow by the end of the month.”
When asked about the exchange after the hearing, DeLauro said she wanted to get a concrete answer that the program wouldn’t end up on the chopping block given the cuts and frozen funds at USDA and across the federal government the past few months.
“They’re monkeying around with so many of the programs, but I wanted to know that the commitment held firm on the $220 million, and now she said the money was going out at the end of the month, so we will hold her to that,” DeLauro said. “I take that as a commitment not to mess with the program and to get the money out.”

But the other parties involved in the block grant program are skeptical of that quick timeframe.
Dellacamera said it is possible Connecticut and other states could finish up their contracts by the end of the month. But getting money into farmers’ pockets will likely take longer.
Hurlburt also said the end of May deadline would be a tough schedule. The agriculture commissioner spoke with USDA staff earlier in the week as part of their standing weekly meeting. He said they reviewed the three frameworks for the program that he proposed in January.
But those initial steps have hit some delays. March was the original timeline he received for finalizing contracts with states. He is still looking for clarity on how much each state will receive and the application process for farmers who are about to be in a busy season.
Hurlburt said he’s working to get things sorted out between federal and state partners, “but it’s going to be a very aggressive timeline to meet any sort of May deadline if we don’t have a contract or an allocation or an understanding of the program.”
“Depending on how complicated they want to make it and what the paperwork requirements would be for individual farmers is going to be determining how quickly we can move,” he said.
Once the state secures a formal agreement with USDA, the next steps entail an open comment period where impacted farmers can weigh in on the program, followed by formalizing an application, keeping that application period open for 30 days and then verifying applicants to make sure they’re eligible. Then they will disburse the funds.
Because he showed up to the hearings, Dellacamera was invited to attend USDA’s press conference later Wednesday. There was a small hiccup when he arrived. He was flagged in the system as a known person of interest — likely from when he drove down to D.C. and parked his tractor in front of the building — but it got quickly resolved. He said he got another shoutout when discussing the rollout of federal disaster aid.

Pending federal assistance
Dellacamera believes some progress was made and felt the trip was worth his time. But he remains skeptical about the timeline laid out and said he will keep pushing to ensure the direct aid for farmers gets doled out sooner rather than later. 
Meanwhile, as he waits to see what kind of federal aid he’ll receive, Cecarelli’s Harrison Hill Farm is planting and preparing for upcoming harvests and food programs.
A week ago, workers were planting lettuce on a humid and overcast day. The nearby flowering plants started to show tiny yellow strawberries that will be ready with fruit in the next 25 to 30 days. The strawberries got hit hard by the hail storm, but Dellacamera said “they came back to life” based on the stage they were in at the time.
Tomatoes, peppers, eggplant and basil are currently growing in the greenhouses. Behind them sits the tractor that Dellacamera drove on state roads to get to D.C.
There are reminders of the 13-minute hail storm that hit last August all around the farm — including dents in buildings, the greenhouses and the sign that sits at the edge of the road. Dellacamera farms on a total of 120 acres in the area.
In mid-June, the farm will restart its Community Supported Agriculture, or CSA. On top of that, he will finish up his work of sending boxes to food banks before a federal initiative that provides communities with local, healthy food ends in October.
Cecarelli’s was also one of the first farms that was part of the Local Food Purchase Assistance program, which the Trump administration cancelled on March 7. The farm delivered 600 boxes of food a week to a church in West Haven.

The 2025 LFPA agreement awarded the Connecticut Department of Agriculture with $3.7 million that would run through 2027. But that future funding was terminated, and the current money will run out for Dellacamera and other participating farmers in October.
The state agency said by the end of last year, 516 distribution locations provided food to communities coming from 131 producers across Connecticut. With those pots of money, schools and food banks could supply healthier food to those in need with the mutual benefit of sourcing from local farmers and producers.
The cancellation of the LFPA and the Local Food for Schools program came up during the hearings. Rollins testified they are COVID-era programs that were not intended to run long term and would be unfair to taxpayers. She noted that many states still have money left to spend. Dellacamera and other participants and supporters of the programs rebuff that argument.
The loss of that funding is a double whammy for Dellacamera.
“I need the block grant to pay my bills off, but I know I’m losing the food box money, so it’s severely going to impact what goes on there,” he said.
It is unclear whether Dellacamera will get assistance through the block grant or the $21 billion of natural disaster money for farmers that also passed at the end of last year. Rollins said Tuesday that farmers will be able to access a portal in the next several weeks so they can apply for the latter grant.

For him, the channel doesn’t matter as long as he can pay his bills.
“I might not get a big chunk of that $220 [million] because I’m already going to get it from the $21 billion. But I’m fine with that, because I think it’s more money for my other farmer friends that didn’t get money,” he said. “As long as I get X, Y, Z I’m supposed to get, I don’t care which pot it comes from.”
But without access to any of those emergency dollars, Dellacamera wonders how long he and others will be able to keep up operations — or even want to — with the specter of future disasters that threaten their farmland.
“But why … will any of us farmers want to keep going when that’s the support we get? Why would I or any other farmer want to have to even keep farming, right?” he said. “If that’s what it’s going to be, year after year, disaster after disaster.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_4682-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-11 05:01:19.704718

(U.S. Air Force)When did the Vietnam War end?
For Gregory Hankamer and Robert Weldon it came at 9:30 p.m. Tuesday, May 13, 1975, on a CH-53 helicopter with the call sign Knife 13. The helicopter was part of a massive and hastily organized effort to rescue the crew of the Mayaguez, an American merchant ship seized the day before by the Khmer Rouge in disputed waters off Cambodia.
Knife 13 crashed, killing all 23 aboard.
It was two weeks after the fall of Saigon and a week after President Gerald R. Ford declared, at a speech at Tulane University, that American involvement in Vietnam had ended.
The Mayaguez incident was the bloody and chaotic last chapter of American military involvement in Vietnam. A rushed operation plagued by intelligence failures and bad luck, it serves as a reminder of the heavy price to be paid by those doing the fighting when impractical or even impossible orders are given. Although lauded as a clear military victory with few American casualties at the time, today some of the family members of those killed on Knife 13 question the official account of events.
The Khmer Rouge, the popular name for members of the Communist Party of Kampuchea, had been fighting Vietnamese forces for contested islands in the Gulf of Thailand and harassing merchant ships. On May 12, seven Khmer Rouge soldiers boarded the container ship Mayaguez after shooting a rocket-propelled grenade across its bow and took the 39-member crew captive. The ship’s radio operator managed a desperate SOS.
Alarmed by the prospect of another human and propaganda debacle like the 1968 capture of the spy ship U.S.S. Pueblo, in which North Korea held its crew hostage for 11 months, the White House wanted to resolve the crisis quickly.
“The scheme involved using a force made up of the local 656th Air Force Security Police Squadron (stationed in Thailand),” according to aviation archaeologist Ralph Wetterhahn in his 2001 book, “The Last Battle.” Seventy-five military police volunteers were to be landed atop the cargo containers on the deck of the Mayaguez. Neither the military cops nor the helicopter pilots were trained in such an assault, Wetterhahn noted.
Knife 13 lifted off from Nahkhon Phanom Royal Thai Navy Airfield, one of several CH-53 heavy lift helicopters en route to a staging area at the U.S. base at U-Tapao, Thailand. Officially, the helicopter was on a training mission. On board were 18 military policemen and five crew members.
Sgt. Greg Hankamer, born in Garden City and who had lived as a child with his family in Deerfield, was a 21-year-old Air Force security specialist on Knife 13.
Robert P. Weldon was a flight engineer and part of the helicopter crew.
An Airman First Class, 19-year-old Weldon was a resident of Kansas City, Kansas, and attended Turner High School. The Kansas City Times noted that upon hearing of the death of her son, Mrs. Dean Weldon expressed bitterness toward the United States.
“There’ve been one too many killings over there,” the paper quoted her as saying.
About a month before Knife 13 took off on its rescue mission, Hankamer wrote a letter to the editor of the News-Pilot of San Pedro, California, where his parents were living.
“I believe with all my heart that the people of South Vietnam have suffered much more than any other group of people in history,” Hankamer wrote. “Furthermore, if we can sit back with a clear conscience and watch and listen to hundreds of thousands of free people being killed and suppressed by the Communists” then Americans should be prepared for the fall of the Eastern portion of the world.
Hankamer said he was expressing his personal opinion, and not that of the military or the Air Force, but that many service members and civilians felt the same way he did and did not speak out for fear of “being looked down upon.”
A few minutes into the flight, Knife 13 plunged from the sky and burst into flames on impact with the ground. All 23 passengers and crew perished, along with three military police dogs. Although helicopters were scrambled for a recovery effort, according to Wetterhahn, the intensity of the fire and the exploding munitions aboard Knife 13 dashed hopes of any survivors.
The official cause of the crash was rotor system failure.
Hankamer was due to return to the states but had extended his tour by six months, according to his brother, Luther Hankamer II. There had been a mix-up at the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok with obtaining visas for Greg Hankamer’s wife, Sumalee, a Thai national, and their 1-year-old daughter, Sondra.
Luther Hankamer, a retired Air Force master sergeant who lives in Fort Worth, was stationed at the Royal Thai Air Force Base from 1972 to 1974. Luther told me that when he learned of Greg’s death from an Air Force mortuary officer, he had no idea that his little brother had been on a mission to rescue the crew of the Mayaguez.
“I was more or less in shock when I learned he had been killed,” Luther said. “It hit my whole family hard.”
Luther told me Greg was an easygoing person, somebody who seldom lost his temper, and a talented musician. Greg played the trumpet, just like Luther, and was first chair in high school. When he outgrew his school-issued instrument, Luther gave his brother his own Martin Concertmaster, an instrument Greg brought with him to Thailand.
After the crash of Knife 13, the mission to rescue the Mayaguez crew continued, but was evolving. The plan to deploy Air Force security forces by landing helicopters on the container boxes on the ship was abandoned because Pentagon officials realized the boxes would be crushed beneath the weight of the helicopters, according to Wetterhahn. Also, new intelligence indicated the crew had been removed from the ship and taken to Koh Tang island. Further complicating the crisis was that the U.S. had no diplomatic ties with the Khmer Rouge, which had taken the Cambodian capital of Phnom Pen on April 17, 1975.
The new plan was to retake the Mayaguez and to assault Koh Tang.
The mission was supported by aircraft from the U.S.S. Coral Sea, which had been diverted to the area, and several smaller Navy ships. A brigade-strength amphibious Marine landing force was assembled. As part of the response to the Mayaguez incident, the U.S. also bombed Cambodian ports and targets on the mainland.
On May 15, the assault on Koh Tang began.
But U.S. intelligence had badly underestimated the strength of the Khmer Rouge on Koh Tang, and the Mayaguez crew had already been transferred elsewhere. The container ship was recaptured by U.S. forces. On the island, Marines met a few hundred Khmer Rouge fighters who were already dug in, having prepared to battle the Vietnamese.
The Khmer Rouge shot down four U.S. helicopters and killed 14 Americans during the first assault, according to the national museum of the Air Force. During the fighting, a fishing trawler flying a white flag approached the U.S. destroyer Wilson.
On board the trawler was the entire crew of the Mayaguez, unharmed.
President Ford called an end to the offensive, and reinforcements were moved in to extract more than 230 Marines who had become trapped on the island. The battle that followed was chaotic, confused and filled with horror and heroism. For a detailed account, I refer you to Wetterhahn’s book.
The tragic coda to the Mayaguez incident is that in the confusion a three-man M-60 machine gun crew was left behind on Koh Tang, awaiting a rescue that never came. The loss of the three was in contradiction to Marine Corps doctrine of leaving no one behind. The three were likely captured and executed by the Khmer Rouge. These Marines were Danny Marshall, Gary Lee Hall and Joseph Hargrove.
Lauded as a U.S. victory at the time, the human toll of the operation was at first downplayed. A Pentagon spokesman told the Associated Press there were only a handful of casualties and that no servicemen had been left on the island. The dead aboard Knife 13 also weren’t counted among the casualties and U.S. authorities initially denied the helicopter was involved in the Mayaguez rescue operation. But the truth, eventually, would come out.
In all, 41 Americans died during the Mayaguez incident.
They are the last of the 58,281 names on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, which lists American service members killed in chronological order.
Sumalee and Sondra, Greg Hankamer’s wife and daughter, received their visas soon after his death. Luther Hankamer says Sumalee eventually remarried, and both remain in the United States.
“As far as we’re concerned,” Luther said, speaking for himself and Greg’s circle of friends, “it was an unnecessary mission. It was a screw-up on intelligence because the crew of the Mayaguez was already being released when the attack on the island took place to rescue them. And intelligence also said the island was lightly defended, with only company-level strength. When they got there, they found almost a regiment of the Khmer Rouge army.”
He is concerned that the official story about mechanical failure bringing Knife 13 down might not be accurate. He referred me to Jennifer Stelling, the niece of Sgt. Jimmy Black, an Air Force military policeman who died on the helicopter. She’s been researching the crash for years.
“I believe the helicopter was likely shot down rather than suffering a mechanical failure,” Stelling told me. “Several key details support this: the presence of active Communist factions in the area known for targeting U.S. aircraft, intelligence reports noting hostiles nearby, and the unusual fact that a flight surgeon on the scene was immediately issued an M-16 rifle for personal protection — an uncommon measure unless enemy contact was expected.”
In addition, Stelling said, records indicate ongoing enemy ground engagements in the area and the fact that other aircraft had been targeted in similar circumstances. Stelling, who lives in Alabama, said she was born after her uncle’s death but became intrigued by the Knife 13 story.
“These factors collectively suggest a hostile environment where the likelihood of ground fire was significant and cannot be dismissed,” she said.
Luther doesn’t know what became of the trumpet he gave his little brother. It wasn’t among the effects returned to the family.
Luther came home in December 1974.
“I just wish that Greg had been able to be on that freedom bird when I left,” he said.
The Vietnam War did not end when Saigon fell, or when Ford declared it was over, or even when remains of some of the Marine dead from Koh Tang were recovered and buried in 2013 at Arlington National Cemetery. For those like Luther Hankamer, who lost brothers and friends or other loved ones, the war lives on. When Luther talks about his brother, he describes an energetic and enthusiastic young man, and one who remains vibrant in memory. The tragedy of Knife 13 is a wound that is ever fresh.
Greg Hankamer’s body was recovered after the crash and buried in California.
Robert P. Weldon is buried in Alabama.
The gun team left behind on Koh Tang has not officially been recovered. The Defense MIA/POW Accounting Agency lists Hall, Hargrove, and Marshall as “unaccounted for.”

And while much of those noxious gases drift our way from New Jersey and New York City,  a large part of our pollution is home-grown. It’s due to heavy volumes of traffic, especially diesel trucks, which emit nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) —key ingredients in ozone formation.


Yes:  I-95 is hazardous to your health.
And all of this gets worse in the summer due to the heat which increases ozone production, often trapping it over our heads due to temperature inversions. By one estimate, almost 200 Connecticut residents die each year due to our air quality.
We will all remember back to June of 2023 when our sky turned orange due to smoke from Canadian wildfires.  That created truly hazardous conditions that literally made breathing bad for you.  With global warming, we’ll see things like this happening again.
So, what does any of this have to do with transportation?  Mother nature’s pains (like the Canadian wildfires) notwithstanding, it is transportation’s pollution that is the No. 1 source in our state, EPA blaming it for half of all our bad air.
Trucks: These are the vehicles responsible for most of our air pollution.  While medium to large trucks represent only 6% of traffic they cause 53% of nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions, 45% of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), linked to respiratory and cardiovascular health issues, and 25% of greenhouse gas emissions.
Better air filters may help as does burning biodiesel and enforcing no-idling rules. But the real solution will be electric-powered trucks.  However, the Trump administration has slashed tax credits for new buyers and frozen plans for the rollout of charging stations.
Take the train:  Riding Metro-North is five to six times more fuel efficient than driving.  Those electric trains’ power-generation gives them the equivalent of 125-160 mpg.  And that’s improved further by the trains’ regenerative braking which means that, even when stopping, they generate more power.
Getting more folks on the train also reduces highway traffic, making those vehicles more fuel efficient because they’re not spewing exhaust in stop-and-go traffic.
But our diesel locomotives (which run on the Danbury, Waterbury and Hartford lines) are a different matter.  For their runs in Connecticut they are big polluters, just like trucks.  The World Health Organization and EPA call diesel exhaust a Class 1 carcinogen, right up there with tobacco and asbestos.  New locomotives that are on order will improve that with battery operation and improved filtration.
Ships: Yes, both commercial and pleasure craft contribute to air (and in this case noise and water) pollution, again because of their diesel engines.  It’s not by chance that wind-powered sailors refer to powerboaters as “stink potters” and “blow boaters.”  There are some electric-powered boats under development, but they’re more expensive and don’t offer the same range.
So, whether your travels take you on the open waters or (hopefully) open roads, remember that there’s more to the cost of your trip than fuel: there’s the cost to our shared environment.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Traffic-jam-CTDOT.jpg,,,2025-05-11 05:01:19.704718

Now 88, he said his thoughts floated back to when he arrived in the city as a young airman from Texas. There were maybe a couple of Mexican restaurants on South Omaha’s main corridor, he recalled. No panaderías. No paleterías.

He’d soon marry a local girl, immerse himself in community activism and help establish the local Chicano Awareness Center.
As Hernandez waved Saturday to the thousands of parade-goers packing the business strip now dominated by Spanish-named merchants and retailers, he figured many would not know his story or his name. 
“But at least they’ll know we’re still here,” he said. “And the fact they’re here tells me they also want to keep the culture alive. The whole thing made me happy, proud.”
This year’s South Omaha Cinco de Mayo celebration marks 105 years of fiestas, organizers said, and honored grand marshals like Hernandez with deep roots over those decades. Activities kicked off with a Friday night concert and will continue through Sunday with live performances, music, food, games and other festivities.
 Omaha’s largest and most diverse 

Saturday’s parade — described by organizers as Omaha’s largest and most diverse — lasted three hours, featuring more than 100 parade entries ranging from low-rider cars to show horses, traditional folklorico dancers to high school bands.
Political teams were on display, this being the final weekend before Omaha city elections.
Mayoral candidate John Ewing’s campaign was among the earliest at the parade grounds, staking out a good spot. Ewing, currently the Douglas County treasurer, greeted participants as they lined up.
Mayor Jean Stothert arrived just before the parade started and took a place toward the front, after Mexican Consul Jorge Ernesto Espejel Montes.
Not far behind was City Councilman Ron Hug, accompanied by a troupe of bouncing cars riding low. His opponent Andrew Adams also had a sizable sign-toting team.
Businesses, nonprofits, neighborhood groups, the public sector, bands and vaqueros on horseback participated in the nine-block parade.

Itzel Lopez, who volunteers to help the annual event organized by Casa de Cultura, said it continues to draw people and vendors from all races and cultures and from other Midwestern states, including Colorado, Oklahoma and Illinois. She said she spoke with a merchant whose roots are in Ecuador.
But what stood out to her this year, she said, was Latinos looking forward to the opportunity to celebrate together. In these “uncertain times” for immigrants and amidst fear instilled by the Trump Administration, Lopez said that some thought the group should not hold the celebration.
She disagreed. “Why should we be scared? This is the best time to show up and show our economic impact.” 
As of Saturday evening, Lopez said: “People are showing up.”	

Cinco de Mayo
Historically, Cinco de Mayo marks when a small but mighty Mexican army triumphed over invading French troops in the Battle of Puebla on May 5, 1862. Though France later would occupy Mexico, that victory galvanized Mexican forces, and May 5 grew to stir feelings of pride and resilience.
Today in the United States, Cinco de Mayo is often observed with parades, parties, margaritas. It has become an occasion for Latinos to celebrate and share their heritage.
South Omaha held its event a week after typical Cinco de Mayo celebrations largely to avoid conflict with the annual Berkshire Hathaway stockholders meeting, which requires many public resources also used during the fiesta.



Among them was Mary Berumen, who brought three daughters ranging in age 7 years to 11 months to the parade. While a member of South High’s cheer squad, she used to walk in Cinco de Mayo parades and was excited for her girls to feel the “energy, the vibes.” 
She said she also wants Analiese, Audrey and Iris to stay connected and appreciate their heritage.
“I want them to be proud they’re American but also not to lose their Mexican Hispanic culture,” she said.

Bryan Jaime, standing by wife Irais, carried their four-year-old son on his shoulders to watch the parade as it turned onto the last stretch near L Street. 
“This is his first time coming,” Irais said of their little boy, Mattheo. “We’re celebrating Hispanic culture and enjoying seeing it through our son’s experience.”
Meanwhile, some of the grand marshals, all longtime residents of the Omaha metro area Latino community, said they were a bit taken aback by how large the event had grown.
Linda Garcia, 79, was on the front line of watching the local Spanish-speaking population swell. She is a retired South Omaha librarian who brought bilingual books and story times into city programming. She is often approached by people who thank her for helping their families better connect to the area.
Still, Garcia said she was “shocked” to see the crowd on Saturday. Today an artist and storyteller, Garcia wore traditional Mexican garb and rode on a colorful float decorated with papel picado, flowers, cactus and American and Mexican flags.
“It took my breath away,” said Garcia, whose husband Jose, co-founder of the South Omaha Immigrant History Museum, also was a grand marshal. “All the little girls that were waving. Little ones with mothers and fathers, I didn’t know them, but they were waving like crazy.”

In addition to Abelardo and his wife, Dolores and the Garcias, other grand marshals were Manuel and Annie Gonzalez, Theresa Barron-McKeagney and Jorge Nila.
Like Hernandez, Jose Garcia remembers arriving from Kansas City to Omaha and finding no tortillerías. “That really puzzled me.”
Like Hernandez and Gonzalez, who also originated from Texas, Garcia did find a lifelong mate in a growing Latino community. Today, more than 15% of Nebraska’s largest city identifies as Hispanic.
The population has diversified, as evidenced by the change of the Chicano Awareness Center to Latino Center of the Midlands. Area restaurants and retailers feature Guatemalan, Salvadoran and Colombian goods.
While Cinco de Mayo is rooted in a Mexican event, Lopez said the annual celebration in South Omaha also is a time to appreciate diversity and new and old immigrants.
On the younger end of this year’s grand marshals was Jorge Nila, a well-known area jazz musician who said his dad was one of the founding fathers of the G.I. Forum, a longtime veterans-rooted club and restaurant in South Omaha.
During the parade, he cruised in a red sporty convertible.
“I felt unity,” he said.

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)An international student in western South Dakota overcame Kristi Noem’s attempt to stop her from graduating Saturday, while hundreds of people protested on the other side of the state where Noem received an honorary degree and delivered a commencement speech.
The international student is Priya Saxena, from India. She received two degrees from South Dakota Mines in Rapid City: a doctorate in chemical and biological engineering and a master’s degree in chemical engineering.
Noem’s U.S. Department of Homeland Security — which she has led since resigning as South Dakota governor in January — has been trying to deport Saxena since last month, asserting that Saxena’s permission to stay in the country should be revoked because she was convicted four years ago of failing to move over for flashing yellow lights, a misdemeanor. The action is part of a broader immigration crackdown by the Trump administration.

Saxena’s student visa is not scheduled to expire until 2027, and if allowed to stay in the country, she could apply for an extension to work in fields related to her degrees.
Saxena and her attorney, Jim Leach, of Rapid City, sued and won a temporary restraining order that assured Saxena’s graduation and will halt the government’s action against her until at least next week, when she has a hearing on her request for a court order to stop her deportation while the lawsuit proceeds. Saxena and her attorney have said in court filings that she has not committed a deportable offense, and have called the government’s actions “lawless.”
Saxena’s graduation went smoothly Saturday as she crossed the stage and received applause from the audience at Summit Arena in Rapid City. Her attorney and a university spokeswoman said Saxena preferred not to make any public comments.
Meanwhile in Madison
About 350 miles to the east at Dakota State University in Madison, Noem’s speech and her acceptance of an honorary doctorate in public service went off without a hitch inside the university fieldhouse, where she did not reference the protesters or make any comments about her official duties.
Outside, she was loudly opposed.
Students and community members lined the sidewalks chanting phrases including “no honor for Noem” and “due process.” Protesters said they were spotlighting Noem’s “cruel” immigration policies and the university’s decision to invite her to graduation.
“One thing that immediately came to my brain when I heard she was coming here was I was genuinely scared for the massive amounts of international students that we have on campus,” said student Maya Plummer. “That’s something we take pride in.”

The ceremony in Madison included foreign students from countries such as Vietnam and India.
Noem’s department has pursued enforcement actions against more than 1,000 international students. It has also removed temporary protected status for immigrants who fled danger in their home country, wrongly deported a Maryland man to a notorious prison in El Salvador, aired TV ads warning migrants to self-deport or avoid coming to the United States, and launched an initiative to provide up to $1,000 in “travel assistance” to immigrants without legal authorization who self-deport, among other actions.
This week, U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Connecticut, accused Noem of running a department that’s “out of control,” saying it’s at risk of spending all of its $65 billion in funding before the end of the fiscal year.
The Dakota State University student senate and general faculty both voted against the honorary degree for Noem, citing concerns over Noem’s policies and the message her recognition would send to international students and marginalized communities.
University spokespeople said they extended the invitation for Noem to speak and receive the honorary degree while she was still governor of South Dakota. The invite was based on her longstanding support of the university’s nationally recognized cybersecurity programs.
Dakota State President José-Marie Griffiths said in her speech that Noem is among “a number of individuals who were instrumental in changing the trajectory of this institution” in recent decades. She said the university was transformed from one that was losing enrollment to one that’s thriving as a flagship institution for computer technology.
“And by the way, there were protests for that decision, too,” Griffiths said.
Noem gave students a five-point bullet list of advice during her approximately 10-minute speech.
She told students their education is important, “But I will tell you that the world still revolves on relationships. People will be successful based on the people that they know and the people that they spend time with.”
Her other advice for students included, “You believed in Santa Claus for many years, at least believe in yourself for five minutes.”
Attendees react
Among attendees, there were conflicting views about the protest. Some family members of graduates expressed frustration that the controversy overshadowed the event.
“Honestly, it’s shocking because I feel like we should be here just celebrating the graduates,” said Anico David of Sioux Falls, whose sister graduated. “People are making it bigger than it should be with all this protesting. In my opinion, it’s kind of out of pocket and unnecessary.”
Max Lerchen, who earned a master’s degree, said honoring Noem “does not reflect the values that are held by the university,” such as inclusion. He said university officials should have expected opposition, and protesters should not be blamed for pushing back.
“They knew it was going to be an unpopular decision to begin with,” he said. “I think that’s similar to being picked on by a bully, and you decide to fight back, and then people go, ‘Why did you fight back?’”
Andrew Sogn, a spokesman for Dakota State University, said the institution hoped for “a celebratory atmosphere, and recognition of the graduates and their hard work.”
When asked about the students and faculty who opposed Noem’s honorary degree and speech, he said it was welcome, “because I think that we encourage open conversation and freedom of expression.”

(Photo by Amie Wambach for Rhode Island Current)Rhode Island Current took home seven awards — including first place for Best Website, General News Photo and Headline Writing — at the annual Rhode Island Press Association Editorial Awards Banquet on Friday, May 9.
The banquet at the Quonset “O” Club in North Kingstown recognized the best work produced by Rhode Island news organizations in 2024 across 45 categories, including photography, writing and design. This year’s contest drew a total of 463 entries.
Rhode Island Current, an affiliate of States Newsroom that launched in 2023, joined the association last year after the board voted to open membership to digital news outlets.
The Best Website category recognizes a news website that showcases an outlet’s depth of work with emphasis on presentation, strength of content and use of digital tools and storytelling techniques. After Rhode Island Current took first place, second place went to The Boston Globe Rhode Island and third place to The Providence Journal.
Reporter Alexander Castro won first place in the General News Photo for his candid photo of a young girl about to drop her ballot into a voting box at the Providence Children’s Museum last October as part of a civics education program geared for kids. 
Editor-in-Chief Janine L. Weisman earned first place in the headline writing category, which required the submission of three headlines. Weisman entered: 
“Whitehouse going for gold in Olympic ad spending with his U.S. Senate reelection campaign” 
“Schoolkids already have enough on their plate. Will legislators take brown rice off it?”
“So many accusations in Providence House Democratic primary contest, so little time to investigate”
Reporter Christopher Shea took second place for Government Reporting for his story on a last-minute intervention in Rhode Island’s U.S. Senate race by an unknown super PAC on behalf of GOP candidate Patricia Morgan, who lost her bid to unseat Democratic incumbent Sheldon Whitehouse.
The second place award for General Election Coverage went to Rhode Island Current’s four-person staff for their coverage of all ballot questions, General Assembly contests, a U.S. Senate race and the Cranston mayoral race in the November 2024 election.
Senior Reporter Nancy Lavin won third place for Reporting on the Environment for her story on the offshore wind industry’s struggles to overcome misinformation and negative public perception.
Castro also won a third place writing award in the Single Topic Series category for five stories he wrote last December on the RIBridges data breach as the personal data of 59% of Rhode Island’s population burgled from the state’s public benefits system started making its way onto the dark web.
Friday’s awards banquet honored three inductees into the Rhode Island Journalism Hall of Fame: Providence Journal photographer Kris Craig; Marta V. Martínez, a community oral historian and executive director of Rhode Island Latino Arts; and Providence Journal columnist Mark Patinkin.

(Photo by Ryan Hagerty/USFWS)A Washington state-based conservation group filed a lawsuit this week in an effort to speed up the federal government’s review of a proposal to list king salmon as threatened or endangered across the Gulf of Alaska.
The Wild Fish Conservancy filed its lawsuit Thursday in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., saying that the National Marine Fisheries Service had missed a 12-month deadline under the Endangered Species Act to decide on the conservancy’s proposal to list Gulf of Alaska king salmon.
The conservancy, in its 17-page complaint, said it formally asked the service to list the king salmon in a petition Jan. 11, 2024, which gave the agency until Jan. 11, 2025, to respond. The lawsuit asks a judge to order the service to “promptly issue” its decision on the petition by a specific date.
“With the crisis facing Alaskan chinook, we are out of time and options,” Emma Helverson, Wild Fish Conservancy’s executive director, said in a prepared statement, using another name for king salmon. She added: “The Endangered Species Act sets clear deadlines for a reason, to evaluate the risk of extinction and trigger action while recovery is still possible.”
The conservancy’s press release announcing the lawsuit points to other listing proposals that the fisheries service had failed to act on within 12 months and described “systemic dysfunction” at the agency.
A top Alaska official at the fisheries service, Jon Kurland, said in a brief email Friday that the agency is “continuing to review the petition and to develop the required 12-month finding.”
The lawsuit to force action from the fisheries service is “fairly routine,” said Doug Vincent-Lang, fish and game commissioner for the state of Alaska, which has opposed the conservancy’s proposal and numerous other efforts to list species as endangered in Alaska.
Vincent-Lang said that the fisheries service is “working through the process” — if, perhaps, slowed by the change in presidential administrations — and that two state scientists have been given access to a team reviewing the petition, though they’re not voting members.
“I understand they’re getting closer to a decision,” he said. “I’d much rather have them take their time and have a deliberative process than to rush to a decision because of a statutory timeline.”
The conservancy has taken multiple actions in Alaska in recent years that have drawn sharp rebukes from the state’s elected officials and commercial fishermen.
 
Lawsuit targets Southeast Alaska salmon fishery to save 73 orcas

	Another lawsuit filed by the group with the intent of preserving salmon as prey for endangered Pacific Northwest orca whale populations threatened to close down Southeast Alaska’s small-boat troll fishery. 
And Vincent-Lang has expressed concerns that, if the Endangered Species Act listing of Gulf of Alaska king salmon is approved, it could lead to sharp restrictions on harvests of the fish, as well as in other salmon fisheries that accidentally hook or harvest kings.
The conservancy says that Alaska king salmon are threatened by accidental harvest in trawl fisheries, and by fish hatcheries, habitat destruction, climate change and overfishing.

(Laurel Demkovich/Washington State Standard)Intriguing match-ups in the fall elections emerged Friday as Democrats look to retain control of several seats in the Washington state Legislature.
Two Senate contests should provide a test of voters’ views on new laws, higher taxes and spending decisions pushed through by the majority Democrats over the objections of Republicans.
Races for two other legislative seats will showcase strains within the Democratic Party between its progressive and moderate factions.
Three appointed Democratic lawmakers are breathing easy. They drew no challengers before the filing window closed Friday.
This all but assures the trio — state Sens. Tina Orwall of Des Moines and Emily Alvarado of Seattle, and Rep. Brianna Thomas of West Seattle — will retain their seats for the 2026 session.
Here’s where things stood Friday. Candidates have until Monday to formally withdraw from any of the races.
Senate
26th District: This looms as the must-watch contest of the year.
Sen. Deb Krishnadasan, a Gig Harbor Democrat, is looking to keep the seat she was appointed to after the district’s former state senator, Emily Randall, was elected to Congress. She faces Republican state Rep. Michelle Caldier, also of Gig Harbor. She was first elected to the House in 2014 and re-elected in November with nearly 55% of the vote.
The winner will represent the legislative district which encompasses parts of Kitsap and Pierce counties and includes Bremerton, Port Orchard, Purdy and Gig Harbor. They will need to run again in 2026.
Caldier enters with backing from most of the Senate Republican Caucus. She is expected to focus on what GOP legislative leaders say has been Democrats’ overreach with passage of a $9.4 billion package of tax increases to balance the budget and another $3.2 billion for transportation, anchored by a 6-cent per gallon gas tax hike.
Krishnadasan, who served six years on the Peninsula School District Board of Directors, was among the vulnerable Democrats voting against their party’s major tax bills and transportation revenue package. She’ll be pressed to make that clear in the coming campaign.
5th District: This race is to fill the vacancy created by the death of Democratic state Sen. Bill Ramos in April. Whoever wins will serve the remaining three years of the term.
Rep. Victoria Hunt, D-Issaquah, a scientist and former Issaquah City Council member, won her House seat in November with 54% of the vote. She formally entered the race Monday and is backed by her seatmate, Rep. Lisa Callan, D-Issaquah. 
“While this was not a campaign I wanted to run, I am honored to build upon the legacy of leadership and spirit of selfless service exemplified by Bill Ramos, while continuing to rely on my experience in Olympia and local government,” Hunt said in her announcement.
Republican Chad Magendanz, a former two-term state representative for the district, is opposing her. He ran for Senate last year, losing to Ramos by 3,400 votes. In 2022, Magendanz lost to Callan for the House seat.
In his announcement, he targeted Hunt’s support of “billions in new, unnecessary, and regressive taxes” and called the election “our opportunity to correct course.”
48th District: Sen. Vandana Slatter, D-Bellevue, and Rep. Amy Walen, D-Kirkland, are squaring off in what will be a litmus test for some of the party’s priorities and the district voters’ allegiances.
Slatter had served in the state House since 2017 until being appointed to replace Patty Kuderer, following her election as Washington’s insurance commissioner. Walen won her seat in 2018 and also sought the appointment. The district covers communities in Redmond, Bellevue and Kirkland.
Both opposed the largest piece of the Democrats’ $9.4 billion tax package, a sweeping bill containing an across-the-board increase in the business tax and surcharges on the state’s largest corporations and financial institutions. And both supported another key component, extending the retail sales tax to some services.
Slatter voted for the gas tax increase. Walen did not. They differed on some high-profile policies, too. For example, Walen opposed the new rent increase cap and Slatter voted for it.
This will be a costly contest. As of Thursday, Walen had raised nearly $320,000 to Slatter’s $107,000, according to filings with the state Public Disclosure Commission.
House
33rd District: Rep. Edwin Obras, D-SeaTac, who was appointed to fill Orwall’s House seat, is being challenged by Burien Mayor Kevin Schilling, a Democrat, and Darryl Jones, a Republican and Kent resident. The two with the most votes in the August primary will advance to the general election. The district includes Burien, Normandy Park, Des Moines, SeaTac, and much of Kent.
Obras formerly worked for the city of Seattle’s Human Services Department. This will be his first election campaign for a public office. “We need someone in Olympia who will fight for the diverse communities in South King County and not settle for or slide back into the status quo,” he said in his announcement.
Schilling was elected to the Burien City Council in 2019 and reelected in 2023. He’s been mayor since last year. He is the government affairs director for the Washington State Dental Association and former political director for retired congressman Derek Kilmer. Schilling did not seek the appointment to the post.
“The government of the state of Washington is not doing things differently to solve the problems that need to be solved,” he said. He said he wants to bring new approaches to addressing homelessness, housing, and public safety based on his experience as mayor.
Jones, who filed Friday, made an unsuccessful run for a Kent City Council seat in 2023.
As of Friday, Schilling had raised $83,100. Obras, who could not raise money during the session, had not reported any contributions yet on the state Public Disclosure Commission website.
41st District: Rep. Janice Zahn, D-Bellevue, who was chosen to replace Tana Senn when she left to lead a state agency, will face two opponents – Democrat Vinita Kak of Newcastle and Republican John Whitney of Bellevue. The top two finishers in the primary will face-off in November to represent the district that includes Mercer Island, Newcastle and part of Bellevue.
Zahn is a former Bellevue City Council member and chief engineer at the Port of Seattle. She’s formally endorsed by more than 40 members of the House Democratic Caucus, along with Gov. Bob Ferguson. Kak is a member of the planning commission for the city of Newcastle. 
48th District: Rep. Osman Salahuddin, D-Redmond, who serves on the Redmond City Council and was chosen to replace Slatter in the House, drew two challengers Friday afternoon – Ranga Bondada and Dennis Ellis. 
Bondada, a Democrat, lives in Bellevue and owns two small businesses. This is his first campaign. Ellis, a Republican, lives in Redmond and has worked at Boeing.

DemasWith U.S. Reps. Hillary Scholten (D-Grand Rapids) and John James (R-Shelby Twp.) reintroducing the Grand River Bands of Ottawa Indians Restoration Act on Thursday, members of the bands are cheering the policy, which would grant them federal recognition. 
The Grand River Bands have advocated for federal recognition for more than 30 years using the process laid out by the Bureau of Indian Affairs Office of Federal Acknowledgement. While the tribe completed a petition for federal recognition in 2000, and received a potential finding from the Bureau in 2023, recognition is still many years away. 
The United States government recognizes 574 tribes, including 12 in Michigan. If the Grand River Bands receive recognition, members would be able to access federal resources, including social services, education, housing, elder care and the ability to exercise treaty rights and weigh in on legislation that impacts tribes.
“On behalf of the Grand River Bands, I thank the lead sponsors of this legislation, Reps. Scholten and James, and others from the Michigan Congressional delegation for advocating for justice for our tribal members,” Ron Yob, chairman of the Grand River Bands, said in a statement. “After more than three decades of advocacy for federal recognition, I am hopeful our tribal members will soon have access to the resources they deserve, and which have eluded generations of tribal members.”
According to a statement, the Grand River Bands signed five separate treaties between 1795 and 1855 reaffirming their constitutional sovereignty. They are the last treaty tribe east of the Mississippi River without federal recognition. 
“For generations, the Grand River Bands have made meaningful contributions to our state and country – and yet, they have remained unjustly excluded from the federal recognition they deserve. Without federal recognition, they are denied access to the same opportunities available to other federally recognized tribes including health care, housing assistance, and educational support. This bill fixes that and I’m honored to support it,” James said.
The Grand River Bands are based along the Grand River and other waterways in southwest Michigan, with most current members residing in Kent, Muskegon and Oceana counties. 
“The Grand River Bands are a central part of our state’s history, culture, and community, and it’s long overdue that we officially recognize them as a sovereign tribe,” Scholten said. “They are foundational to the identity of West Michigan, and for nearly 30 years, the Grand River Bands have been advocating for federal recognition. I’m committed to ensuring they get the resources and respect they deserve.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_6398-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-10 12:09:36.780825

(Photo by New Jersey Monitor)Locomotive engineers at NJ Transit and the agency’s management remain at odds as stalled contract negotiations at an impasse over wages threaten to boil over into a disruptive strike in less than a week.
NJ Transit has argued that engineers are seeking extravagant salary hikes. But NJ Transit Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers General Chairman Tom Haas told reporters in Newark Friday that the agency has overstated engineers’ pay and inflated the figures included in the union’s latest contract proposal by listing other forms of compensation as salary.
“It’s not been true, good faith negotiations on their part, and I think you see that with some of the PR they’ve done over the last couple weeks,” said Mark Wallace, the union’s national president, who would be the one to call a strike Friday.
In a separate press conference held across the street, NJ Transit CEO Kris Kolluri impugned Haas’s mental health and maintained the agency would not depart from an earlier contract offer agreed to by both bargaining teams but overwhelmingly rejected at a vote by union members last month.
“I’m worried about his health. I’m worried about his mental health,” Kolluri said of Haas.
When asked about those comments, Kolluri said he “was merely questioning his memory.”
NJ Transit’s locomotive engineers have been working under an expired contract since 2019, and years of bargaining have exhausted the extensive federal process for railway strikes.
The union could launch a job action after 11:59 p.m. May 15. A strike by engineers would effectively stop all agency trains on one of the country’s busiest commuter rail lines.
NJ Transit’s contingency plan for such a strike would see additional buses launched from four park-and-ride lots, but that plan would only capture about 20% of its daily riders, and at a cost of about $4 million per day, the agency has said.
On Friday, Haas said the difference between the two sides’ wage proposals was just over $4 million per year. He said the union asked for increases that are two percentage points higher than those in the deal rejected in April’s vote, from an average of 2.65% in eight increases over seven years to 4.625%.
“That means over the course of a week, should New Jersey Transit cause a work stoppage that lasts a week, that would exceed the cost difference between our proposal and theirs,” Haas said. “So, New Jersey Transit is, again, being a little cagey with the numbers here.”
  NJ Transit CEO Kris Kolluri speaks to reporters at Newark Penn Station on May 6, 2025. (Photo by New Jersey Monitor)
Anthony Greco, senior vice president of communications and customer experience at NJ Transit, said the union had requested three additional 5% increases in 2028, 2029, and 2030, years not covered under the rejected proposal.
When asked Friday about the difference in cost between the two proposals, Kolluri said $1.3 billion before acknowledging that figure includes pay for other workers and assumes the agency’s other unions would obtain similar increases.
NJ Transit’s proposed total spending on labor in the fiscal year that begins July 1 is $984.2 million, according to budget documents.
Greco later said the union’s proposal, including the three extra years, would on average annually cost $11.8 million more than the rejected deal.
More than once Friday, Kolluri said he would not entertain proposals apart from the one the union’s members have already rejected.
“I will not be party to any deal other than the one that’s on the table,” he said.
A larger offer would spur NJ Transit’s 14 other unions to seek larger raises, Kolluri said.
The CEO argued the agency’s proposal would bring hourly pay for NJ Transit engineers to $49.82, about on par with rates at the Long Island Rail Road. But that figure includes one-time retroactive payments and non-salary compensation like overtime. Engineers at LIRR have been working under an expired contract since 2022.
The NJ Transit engineers union argued that figures the agency gave for their salaries are inaccurate.
Agency officials have said engineers are paid $135,402 on average and on Friday proffered payroll documents to support the figure. The documents list gross pay for 238 locomotive engineers (NJ Transit has about 420 engineers on staff). Agency staff said roughly 200 others had been excluded because they did not work at least 40 hours each week in 2024. Salaries for locomotive engineers listed across two categories on the state’s transparency website averaged to $113,853.
Haas said he would accept a contract that brought average base salaries — not total compensation — to $172,000.
“I’ll come upstairs and sign it right now. I will walk over to their building and avert a strike. If you’re willing to do $172,000 a year average earnings for engineers, we’ve got a deal,” Haas said.
Officials still have a path to avert a strike. Congress and President Donald Trump could act to avert a strike by passing and signing legislation to impose a tentative contract, as happened in December 2022, when President Joe Biden signed a bill to block a national rail strike over a sick leave dispute.
The National Mediation Board, which oversaw bargaining between the parties for more than four years, is holding a public interest meeting at which the two sides are to deliver statements on Monday (the board’s formal role as a mediator ended last June).
But sharp rhetoric and apparently growing animosity between the two camps could make an amicable resolution unlikely.
“He somehow thinks there is a better pot at the end of the rainbow,” Kolluri said, referring to Haas. “Let me be crystal clear: This is the deal that was offered, that he shook my hands on, that he negotiated, and now he has to live with his consequences. Let me tell you what that means: We are about to spend $4 million a day. That is the number that’s coming off their contract every day they’re on strike.”

(Photo courtesy of Sorrell Redford)On Friday, April 25, Sorrell Redford, education director for Montezuma School to Farm Project, heard that their AmeriCorps funding through Serve Colorado would run out following abrupt cuts from the federal government. The agency bought themselves a few extra days by cobbling together two weeks-worth of funds to help ease the transition and possibly, to tide them over until a court reversal.
Near the end of April, DOGE cut more than 1,000 AmeriCorps grants totalling nearly $400 million across the United States. Many of these programs provided pivotal social services for rural communities that do not have the resources to fill these gaps without federal funding.
In Cortez, Colorado, Montezuma School to Farm Project depends on AmeriCorps members to keep the organization going. The nonprofit teaches garden classes in local public schools and also grows food for the food pantry, Good Samaritans. Redford said they have a goal to produce 6,000 pounds of food this year.
Redford said the organization only pays $300 for each AmeriCorps member right now and the government subsidizes the rest.
“Without that, we could not afford to employ them,” she said.
She hopes that they will be able to pay for their current members until the end of their terms in July, but it will cost the organization an extra $5,300 a month — a lot for a small nonprofit.
On April 29, 24 states and the District of Columbia, including Colorado and Kentucky, filed a lawsuit against the Trump Administration’s cuts to AmeriCorps funding, calling it unconstitutional because it “usurps Congress’s power of the purse” and does not allow the agency to serve its mission and purpose.
While Redford hopes the lawsuit will restore funding for their programs, it could come too late for both the current members and next year’s AmeriCorps members, who would start in August. Redford has already made an offer to a member for next year but now that is up in the air. Without AmeriCorps starting in late summer, the harvest season will fall entirely to Redford, currently Montezuma School to Farm Project’s  only full-time employee.
“There’s a whole trickle down effect, if we can’t grow the food, we can’t get it to the food bank, they won’t have fresh food to give out,” Redford said.
The pantry is already hurting due to USDA grant cuts that fund local purchases for food pantries and schools. The AmeriCorps also work as volunteers in the pantry distributing food. Adding insult to injury, AmeriCorps’ absence in Montezuma would halt garden classes, hurting both teachers and students.
In Colorado, 27 out of 37 AmeriCorps programs were cut, said Colorado Lieutenant Governor, Dianne Primavera. Seventeen of those were in rural areas. Serve Colorado, the state agency that manages Colorado AmeriCorps, is under the office of the Lieutenant Governor. Primavera said that Colorado lost about $12 million of funding for rural areas alone.
“AmeriCorps members’ service is the only support system in many rural towns, so losing these programs isn’t just a budget issue, it’s a community resilience issue,” Primavera said in an interview with the Daily Yonder.
Primavera emphasized that AmeriCorps is a workforce development program – many AmeriCorps members go on to become teachers, mental health professionals, firefighters and other vital community professions, based on their experiences in AmeriCorps.
“This isn’t a time to cut AmeriCorps. It’s a time really, to double down on services, not dismantle it,” said Primavera.
  History of AmeriCorps 

AmeriCorps programs have been around, under various names, since the 1960s, when the Volunteers in Service to America, or VISTA, program was established as part of the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964. Even before that, the Civilian Conservation Corps was created by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933. It was later used as a model for conservation corps programs that still exist today, many of which are funded through AmeriCorps grants.
While AmeriCorps does operate some direct programs like the National Civilian Community Corps, most of the funding through the program goes directly to city and county governments, nonprofits, and other organizations doing work on the ground in communities.
Service members receive a small stipend for their service term which can last from a few months to more than a year. At the end of the term, members are eligible to receive an education award of around $7,000 that can be applied towards future education opportunities or towards student loans. For any AmeriCorps member affected by grant cuts, education awards stopped accruing and will be prorated as of April 25, 2025, violating contracts signed by these members at the beginning of their service terms.
  Eastern Kentucky 

On Saturday, April 26, Josh Mullins received a call from Serve Kentucky that Hindman Settlement School’s AmeriCorps funding – more than a million dollars – had been cut by the Trump Administration.
Hindman Settlement School in Eastern Kentucky had two AmeriCorps grants to fund 52 service members across five different counties in seven school districts, providing math and reading tutoring for K-3rd grade students.
Mullins, the director of operations for Hindman Settlement School, said that the organization had been an AmeriCorps grantee for the past five years and they shouldn’t have had to reapply for funding until next year for their ReadingCorps program, and two years from now for their Math Corps program.
“The school systems rely on these services to help their most at-risk students,” Mullins said in a Daily Yonder interview. “The schools do not have the staffing to provide one on one intervention,” he said. AmeriCorps members directly fill these gaps, providing tutoring to students falling behind in math and reading.
In Kentucky, 21 out of 28 AmeriCorps programs were cut – $9 million dollars of funding – affecting the service terms of 691 volunteers. While called volunteers, AmeriCorps members are full time (sometimes more than full time) employees, and for many, it is their primary employment, despite being paid a near-poverty-wage stipend.
Mullins said that Hindman Settlement School is committed to funding their service members until the end of their terms in July. They are currently fundraising to fill the gap left by the AmeriCorps funding cuts.
“If we don’t win the lawsuit, everything will stop immediately. There’ll be some not for profits, that will have to shut their doors,” said Lt. Governor Primavera.

States are moving to strengthen protections against human trafficking, but some advocates warn that federal funding cuts could undermine efforts to support survivors.
This year, lawmakers in several states have introduced bills to expand education, strengthen penalties and fund survivor support. But some victim service providers say these efforts might fall short, with millions of dollars in federal cuts threatening programs that help trafficking victims heal and rebuild their lives.
Human trafficking is the exploitation of people through force, fraud or coercion for the purposes of sex or labor. It often involves victims who lack control over their circumstances — whether due to threats, manipulation or economic dependency — and can occur in both illicit and legal industries, from commercial sex work to agriculture, domestic work and construction.
A poll released in March by the University of California, Irvine and the anti-trafficking nonprofit EverFree found that while nearly 99% of Americans view trafficking as a global and national issue, only about 80% believe it’s a problem in their own state — a gap that hinders local prevention efforts, experts say.
The poll, which was conducted in October, also found that just 19% of respondents ranked human trafficking as a top national concern.
“Because it’s such a dark, challenging issue, there’s a dissonance that happens where you don’t want to believe that [trafficking] happens in your community,” Kelsey Morgan, the CEO and co-founder of EverFree, said in an interview. “To admit or to acknowledge that it’s happening in your community requires action.”
Lawmakers across the country are considering or have already passed a range of bills this year aimed at curbing human trafficking and supporting survivors. Many approaches focus on prevention, education, tougher penalties and expanding support services.
In Michigan, a pair of new laws will allow certain hearsay statements from trafficking survivors to be admitted in court and permit relevant prior acts to be used as evidence in human trafficking cases. In March, Utah enacted a law that increases criminal penalties for sex and labor trafficking offenses. In Tennessee, a new law set to take effect next year requires tattoo artists to complete up to one hour of training on recognizing and reporting signs of trafficking.
In California, lawmakers are considering a bill that would establish a “Survivor Support Fund” and criminalize loitering with the intent to purchase sex. The Oregon House passed legislation in April targeting illicit massage businesses by expanding enforcement authority and increasing criminal penalties and fines.
Other states are taking steps to raise awareness and improve accountability. The Florida and Montana legislatures passed bills mandating trafficking prevention education and training in schools. Both bills await action by governors.










To admit or to acknowledge that it’s happening in your community requires action.


– Kelsey Morgan, the CEO and co-founder of EverFree


A bill in Indiana would require gas stations, rest areas and welcome centers to display trafficking awareness posters, and mandate training for employees at food and lodging establishments. It passed in April and was sent to the governor.
Lawmakers in Florida and Georgia also have passed legislation that aims to strengthen criminal trafficking penalties, particularly in trafficking cases involving children or people with disabilities.
Minnesota is weighing several new proposals, including one to increase oversight of adult entertainment venues and massage parlors. The governor signed into law another measure that will require biennial legislative reports on the state’s child trafficking prevention efforts.
Funding to help victims recover
Some advocates say the legislation nationwide reflects growing awareness of trafficking’s scope — but caution that without consistent funding for victim services and a deeper public understanding of the issue, laws alone won’t be enough to support survivors or prevent trafficking.
In late April, the U.S. Department of Justice canceled 365 federal public safety grants — including some that supported anti-human trafficking programs — disrupting a wide range of services for crime victims, local police departments and correctional facilities.
Since then, the department has restored at least two of the canceled grants — one supporting a national crime victim hotline and another funding a national domestic violence network.
The cuts, which totaled $811 million, were administered through the Department of Justice’s Office of Justice Programs, which awarded roughly $3 billion in competitive grants during the 2024 fiscal year, according to Reuters.
U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi defended the cuts in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, stating that the department has cut “millions of dollars in wasteful grants.” She also signaled that additional cuts may be on the way.
Underreported to police
Human trafficking data in the United States is limited, but available figures suggest the problem is both widespread and underreported.
FBI data shows that in 2023, there were 2,584 reported trafficking incidents and 3,117 identified victims — a sharp increase from just 22 incidents in 2013, when the agency began tracking trafficking through its Uniform Crime Reporting system. The rise is largely attributed to more law enforcement agencies participating in the data collection system.
Separate data from the National Human Trafficking Hotline, which offers support to victims, identified 9,619 trafficking cases in 2023 — up from 5,551 in 2015. In 2023, the hotline received more than 30,000 tips, or “signals.”
Experts and advocates emphasize that both the hotline and the crime data capture only a fraction of trafficking incidents, given the hidden nature of the crime and the barriers victims face in reporting to police.
Although national data struggles to capture the full scope of trafficking, Minnesota is among the states that have taken extra steps to build their own data collection systems to better understand the issue and support victims.
Its efforts have drawn attention for state officials’ focus on both urban and rural communities, as well as on Native populations that often face barriers to accessing services.
Experts say it’s a common misconception that trafficking is primarily an urban issue — in reality, it can and does happen everywhere.
Still, some victims — including boys and men — may be overlooked.
“Sometimes for male youth, they are not identified as victims. They may show up in the criminal justice system as defendants or they may be adjudicated as juvenile delinquents,” said Caroline Palmer, the human trafficking prevention director at the Minnesota Department of Health. “There’s not really a close look at what might be happening in the background in terms of their victimization and trafficking exploitation.”
Palmer noted that while Minnesota offers programming for all genders, some male-identifying people may not feel comfortable with certain services, highlighting the need for more tailored support to meet everyone’s unique needs.
More than three-quarters of respondents to the UC Irvine-EverFree poll said being a woman greatly increases the risk of trafficking, but only 2% of respondents said the same about men — despite the fact that trafficking affects people of all genders.
Public perceptions about survivors were also influenced by the victim’s age: While 83% of respondents believe minors who are trafficked are always victims, only 61% say the same about adults — a gap that, advocates warn, can contribute to the criminalization of adult survivors.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)This week is National Small Business Week, a time to celebrate the entrepreneurs who keep our communities vibrant and full of opportunity. In Anchorage, we’re lucky we don’t have to look far to see that spirit in action.
Just last  week, a room full of small business owners, proud families, and community members gathered in Spenard to celebrate the newest graduates of Anchorage Community Land Trust’s Set Up Shop and Indigenous Peoples Set Up Shop programs. These programs help entrepreneurs in underserved communities launch and grow their businesses, creating a ripple effect of community revitalization and generational wealth. 
But just as we mark this week meant to honor small businesses, the future of this work is in jeopardy. Recently, the federal government terminated congressionally approved grants that fund these very programs. That means Set Up Shop — a proven path to self-sufficiency for underserved entrepreneurs — may not continue in its current form.
And let’s be clear. This isn’t about government waste or bloated bureaucracy. It’s about breaking a contract. 
Imagine hiring a contractor to paint your home. They buy the paint, prep the walls, schedule a crew, and then you cancel the job halfway through and refuse to pay. Most people would agree that’s unethical, and certainly indefensible. Yet that’s exactly what’s happening to nonprofits like ACLT, who were asked to do a job, only to see the funding pulled midstream. The work still needs to be done, but the government has walked away.
We’re not just talking about line items in a budget. We’re talking about hard- working Alaskans who have done everything right. They’ve taken business classes, written plans, earned certifications, and opened storefronts, and are now left with fewer tools and less support than they were promised. When we don’t invest in our own people, we pay the price in other ways, with lost jobs, empty buildings, and neighborhoods full of untapped potential.
When an entrepreneur opens a new business in Anchorage they hire locally. They spend locally. They transform vacant lots into thriving storefronts. The economic return goes far beyond the individual business owner and it makes our city a better place to live. 
Set Up Shop has helped more than 500 entrepreneurs turn ideas into realities, and side hustles into fully fledged businesses. These businesses hire locally, pay taxes, and invest in their neighborhoods. That’s not charity. That’s economic infrastructure  built from the ground up.
We will continue to do this work, with or without the original funding. That’s what it means to serve your community. But we could benefit from you being with us. If you believe in the promise of local business and the power of neighborhood-led change, we invite you to consider supporting ACLT and, most importantly, supporting these entrepreneurs. You could visit their businesses, share their stories and help us keep the momentum alive.
Because when we invest in our neighbors, we all win — and that’s just good business.

(Photo by Jess Daninhirsch/Capital News Service)Maryland Democrats reacted swiftly, and angrily, Friday to news that President Donald Trump had fired the librarian of Congress, Carla Hayden, a former director of the Enoch Pratt Free Library in Baltimore who drew raves for her work there.
White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said Friday that President Donald Trump fired Hayden Thursday night because of “quite concerning things that she had done at the Library of Congress in the pursuit of DEI [diversity, equity and inclusion] and putting inappropriate books in the library for children.”
“We don’t believe that she was serving the interest of the American taxpayer well so she has been removed from her position and the president is well within his rights to do that,” Leavitt said.
Rep. Johnny Olszewski Jr. (D-2nd said late Thursday that Trump’s “callous dismissal of Carla Hayden is a disgraceful disservice to all Americans.”
“We must call this out for what it is: an attack on our democratic norms and yet another effort to replace dedicated public servants with MAGA allies,” Olszewski said in a statement.

When she was appointed by President Barack Obama in 2016, Hayden was the 14th librarian of Congress but the first woman and the firs African American in the job, which has a term of 10 years.
Her term included the four years of Trump’s first term in office.
“Dr. Hayden deserves to serve out the remainder of her 10-year term and the country will be better off for it,” Olszewski said. “Congress must demand answers and be ready to fight for her reinstatement.”
Prior to her federal appointment, Hayden was CEO of the Enoch Pratt Library, a position she had held since 1993, according to her official Library of Congress biography.
Del. Samuel I. “Sandy” Rosenberg (D-Baltimore), who called Hayden’s termination a “Trumpian tragedy,” recalled her insistence on keeping the library open during the height of the unrest in Baltimore over Freddie Gray.
“The epicenter of the disturbances after Freddie Gray’s funeral was Pennsylvania and North Avenue,” Rosenberg said. “The library branch at that corner was kept open by Carla Hayden.”
Rosenberg said Hayden’s efforts “so impressed” then-House Speaker Michael Busch that he backed legislation mandating additional funding to the system for extended hours.
The bill, passed by the General Assembly, was vetoed by then-Gov. Larry Hogan, but that veto was susseqently overriden by lawmakers.
Roddy re-retires in Baltimore County
Patrick Roddy, a long-time Annapolis lobbyist, who retired in 2021 and then rejoined Baltimore County government this year, will re-retire at the end of the month.
A spokesperson for County Executive Kathy Klausmeier confirmed Roddy will retire from his position as director of government relations effective June 1. Roddy spent two decades in Baltimore County government as director of legislative affairs liaison and an assistant county attorney before joining Rifkin Weiner Livingston in 2003.
Roddy did not respond to a request for comment. In previous interviews, the former Annapolis lobbyist said he did not see his return to county government as permanent.
Klausmeier — the 15th Baltimore County executive and first woman to hold the position — tapped Roddy and his wife Valerie to join her administration just days after she was named to fill the vacancy created when Johnny Olszewski Jr. was elected to Congress. Both Roddys were initially named senior advisers, with Patrick moving into the county’s lobbying shop — a job he’d held previously. Valerie Roddy became deputy chief of staff.
The county spokesperson said Valerie Roddy will continue in her position. And while rumors of potential replacements for Patrick Roddy circulate, the spokesperson said a search is ongoing.
Five Maryland sites added to National Underground Railroad Network
Five Maryland sites have been added to the National Underground Railroad Network of Freedom Program.
The new sites join more than 90 others in the state as part of a National Park Service program aimed at promoting preservation and research of sites related to the Underground Railroad — part of an abolitionist effort that helped enslaved people escape.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“By adding five historical sites here in Maryland to the National Park Service’s National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom Program, we are honoring the legacy and lives of the courageous men and women who escaped slavery through the Underground Railroad. At a time when this Administration is actively trying to erase American history, we in Maryland will never back down from this simple truth: our history makes us stronger, more resilient, and more prepared to never let the evils of our past repeat,” Maryland U.S. Sen. Angela Alsobrooks said in a joint statement from the Maryland delegation.
The five Maryland sites are:

Goshen Farm in Annapolis.
Issac Mason Escape Site in Chestertown.
St. Augustine Church in Chesapeake.
Rich Hill in Bel Alton.
Susquehanna and Tidewater Canal, Susquehanna State Park in Havre de Grace.

“I commend the preservation efforts of the National Underground Railroad Network. Three of the new historic sites – Isaac Mason Escape Site, St. Augustine Church and Susquehanna and Tidewater Canal – are located in the First Congressional District. The addition of these sites preserve the legacy and bravery of Marylanders who sacrificed their safety for the freedom of others,” Rep. Andy Harris (R-1st) said in the joint statement from the Maryland delegation.
The five sites in Maryland are part of 31 additions to the National Park Service Program. Currently there are 800 sites in 41 states.
Group calls for veto of “Earned wage” bill
More than three dozen advocates, including the NAACP Maryland State Conference, are calling on Gov. Wes Moore to veto a bill meant to regulate so-called “earned wage access” loans.
In a letter sent to Moore, advocates said House Bill 1294 exempts app-based lenders from state laws that “prohibit lending that is discriminatory, is deceptive, or carries extremely high interest rates.”
“The NAACP is particularly concerned that certain companies have written themselves out of the anti-discrimination protections embedded in the small-dollar lending statute,” NAACP Maryland State Conference Political Action Chair Ricarra Jones, said in a statement. “At a time when the federal government is openly working to dismantle hard-won laws and policies that protect people of color, these industry-proposed rollbacks are especially harmful for the people of Maryland. We call on Governor Moore to stand firm in defense of civil rights and equal protection under the law.”
Earned wage access programs typically come in two versions – one offered by employers to their employees and another offered by private companies directly to workers. Both versions are intended to give early access to a portion of wages earned but not yet paid. The amount is then paid back typically through automatic deductions, usually with a fee or “tip.”
Jones and opponents of the House bill say those tips amount to finance charges that often can exceed 300% interest, higher than the state’s 33% limit. Allowing the bill to become law “removes the last and best defense against predatory lending in the state,” the group said in its letter to Moore.
House Republicans want Schiraldi fired
House Republicans are calling on Gov. Wes Moore to fire embattled Department of Juvenile Services Secretary Vincent Schiraldi in the wake of a troubling new audit.
A convicted criminal worked with children at Maryland facility, audit finds

The 75-page report from the Office of Legislative Audits found scores of issues with the agency that is responsible for incarcerating minors. Included in the findings was a lack of criminal background checks by contractors on their employees. One contractor, who auditors said was convicted of second-degree assault and possession of a dangerous weapon with the intent to injure, was still working for a DJS vendor as recently as January.
It’s the second time in less than a year that Republicans have called on Moore to fire Schiraldi. House Minority Leader Del. Jason C. Buckel (R-Allegany) called the audit “yet another troubling, but not surprising, example” of the department’s failure to protect  children in its care.”
“This agency has a record of constant failure in its basic duties, and they have not once been held accountable,” Buckel said in a statement released by the House Republican Caucus. “With the hundreds of accusations of historic abuse being lodged at the DJS, one would think they would have a laser focus on those who were working directly with the children under their supervision, but again, this is not the case.”
In its reply to auditors, the department said it is working to correct the deficiencies cited in the audit — which, it noted, includes only one year of Moore’s term in office, and almost three years under the previous administration.
“This evaluation took place almost entirely during the previous administration and highlights the state of disrepair the department was in when Governor Moore assumed office,” Carter Elliott, a spokesperson for the governor, said in a statement. “Secretary Schiraldi and the Department of Juvenile Services have spent the last two years addressing deficiencies left by the previous administration and this is just the latest example.”
Even so, it has become another flash point for the secretary.
“Governor Moore’s all-of-the-above approach to public safety is seeing results across the state,” Elliott said. “Juvenile crime numbers in murder, auto theft, carjacking and other areas continue to drop because of the work the administration is doing in partnership with the general assembly, state attorneys, local leaders, and advocates.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/LibraryofCongress-2_20250509_JED-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-10 09:04:30.402003

(Photo by Bryan Sears/Maryland Matters)A three-judge panel of the Maryland Court of Appeals has ruled that individual donations to a political fund are private financial information and must be protected from public identification.
The May 2 opinion, by Judge Kathryn Grill Graeff, said that public interest in government transparency and uncovering corruption do not outweigh plain language of the Maryland Public Information Act, which prohibits the disclosure of an individual’s financial activity, no matter how small.
The ruling came in response to separate lawsuits by the Baltimore Sun and the Baltimore Brew, which had filed Maryland Public Information Act requests with the city for records relating to a legal defense fund set up in 2021 by Council President Nick Mosby for himself and his then-wife, Marilyn, who was Baltimore City State’s Attorney at the time.
The city Ethics Board ruled in May 2022 that Nick Mosby had violated ethics law by soliciting and accepting monies from donors and by failing to disclose his interest in “the Mosby Trust,” the fund set up to collect donations. (A circuit court later found that Mosby had not accepted gifts from donors, but upheld the finding that he solicited the donations and failed to disclose his interest in the fund.)
Along with its ruling, the board included a spreadsheet that listed the amount, date and method of payment for each donation to the Mosby Trust, but it redacted names, addresses and email addresses of the donors. The board said was required to redact the names under the PIA, which prohibits release of records that include information about the “finances of an individual, including assets, income, liabilities, net worth, bank balances, financial history or activities, or creditworthiness.”
The Sun and the Brew appealed to the Maryland Public Information Act Compliance Board, arguing that donations to a legal defense fund do not reveal personal financial information about that donor and are not subject to protection under the PIA exception on releasing personal information.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The compliance board agreed with the news outlets, ruling in September 2023 that merely listing a donation to a campaign does not reveal the “assets, income, liabilities, net worth, bank balances, financial history or activities, or creditworthiness.” To the extent that such a listing might be an intrusion on someone’s personal privacy, “on balance it does not seem like an unwarranted one given the public’s interest in election integrity and detecting political corruption.”
“Campaign finance activity, for example, is not ordinarily protected financial information. We think that donations like these—donations that are made to support elected officials in their political capacities—are much more akin to that sort of financial activity, which is commonly accepted as disclosable,” the board’s ruling said.
But that finding was overturned in March 2024 by a circuit court, which said the long list of things covered by the exemption clearly meant that “financial information” should be construed broadly. Even though “single donations, some in small amounts, ‘show little about any person’s overall financial position,'” it still qualifies as financial information and must be withheld from the public.
In their appeal to the Maryland Court of Appeals, the news organizations argued that a “single payment also does not constitute a ‘financial history or activities,’ which denotes a [series] of transactions over time from which one might glean some qualitative information about the payer’s assets, income, liabilities, net worth, bank balances, or creditworthiness.” And donors cannot have expected that their “donations to elected officials in their political capacities” are private, any more than donations to political campaign are private.
The Board of Ethics argued that the PIA law does not concern itself with where a donation is directed, and to argue that “a donation is not financial activity is patently absurd.” The state-held record “shows that a person had a certain amount of money (an asset) and that they transferred that money to another person or entity,” which is “plainly information about these individuals’ financial activity” — and, as such, must be withheld from the public.
The appeals court agreed with the Ethics Board, and upheld the circuit court ruling.
“Here, the language of the statues is clear and unambiguous,” Graeff wrote in the 23-page opinion. “We conclude that the names and addresses of donors to a legal defense fund do fall in the same category as the items listed in the statute” that are prohibited from disclosure.
While the news organizations may argue that the public interest demands that donors to political interests should be revealed, Graeff said that’s not what the law says, and changing the law is the job of the legislature, not the courts.
An attempt to reach editors at the Brew and the Sun were unsuccessful.
Nick Mosby lost his bid for re-election to as council president in 2024. Gov. Wes Moore (D) appointed him this year to a seat on the Maryland State Lottery and Gaming Control Commission.
Marilyn Mosby was under indictment when she ran for reelection in 2022, for lying on an application to improperly withdraw funds from her city pension account. She lost her reelection bid that year and was later convicted year of two counts of perjury and one count of mortgage fraud in connection with financial maneuvers related to the purchase of a home in Florida.

States are moving to strengthen protections against human trafficking, but some advocates warn that federal funding cuts could undermine efforts to support survivors.
This year, lawmakers in several states have introduced bills to expand education, strengthen penalties and fund survivor support. But some victim service providers say these efforts might fall short, with millions of dollars in federal cuts threatening programs that help trafficking victims heal and rebuild their lives.
Human trafficking is the exploitation of people through force, fraud or coercion for the purposes of sex or labor. It often involves victims who lack control over their circumstances — whether due to threats, manipulation or economic dependency — and can occur in both illicit and legal industries, from commercial sex work to agriculture, domestic work and construction.
A poll released in March by the University of California, Irvine and the anti-trafficking nonprofit EverFree found that while nearly 99% of Americans view trafficking as a global and national issue, only about 80% believe it’s a problem in their own state — a gap that hinders local prevention efforts, experts say.
The poll, which was conducted in October, also found that just 19% of respondents ranked human trafficking as a top national concern.

“Because it’s such a dark, challenging issue, there’s a dissonance that happens where you don’t want to believe that [trafficking] happens in your community,” Kelsey Morgan, the CEO and co-founder of EverFree, said in an interview. “To admit or to acknowledge that it’s happening in your community requires action.”
Lawmakers across the country are considering or have already passed a range of bills this year aimed at curbing human trafficking and supporting survivors. Many approaches focus on prevention, education, tougher penalties and expanding support services.
In Michigan, a pair of new laws will allow certain hearsay statements from trafficking survivors to be admitted in court and permit relevant prior acts to be used as evidence in human trafficking cases. In March, Utah enacted a law that increases criminal penalties for sex and labor trafficking offenses. In Tennessee, a new law set to take effect next year requires tattoo artists to complete up to one hour of training on recognizing and reporting signs of trafficking.
In California, lawmakers are considering a bill that would establish a “Survivor Support Fund” and criminalize loitering with the intent to purchase sex. The Oregon House passed legislation in April targeting illicit massage businesses by expanding enforcement authority and increasing criminal penalties and fines.
Other states are taking steps to raise awareness and improve accountability. The Florida and Montana legislatures passed bills mandating trafficking prevention education and training in schools. Both bills await action by governors.

A bill in Indiana would require gas stations, rest areas and welcome centers to display trafficking awareness posters, and mandate training for employees at food and lodging establishments. It passed in April and was sent to the governor.
Lawmakers in Florida and Georgia also have passed legislation that aims to strengthen criminal trafficking penalties, particularly in trafficking cases involving children or people with disabilities.
Minnesota is weighing several new proposals, including one to increase oversight of adult entertainment venues and massage parlors. The governor signed into law another measure that will require biennial legislative reports on the state’s child trafficking prevention efforts.
Funding to help victims recover
Some advocates say the legislation nationwide reflects growing awareness of trafficking’s scope — but caution that without consistent funding for victim services and a deeper public understanding of the issue, laws alone won’t be enough to support survivors or prevent trafficking.
Illicit massage parlor language added to weakened Indiana anti-human trafficking proposal

In late April, the U.S. Department of Justice canceled 365 federal public safety grants — including some that supported anti-human trafficking programs — disrupting a wide range of services for crime victims, local police departments and correctional facilities.
Since then, the department has restored at least two of the canceled grants — one supporting a national crime victim hotline and another funding a national domestic violence network.
The cuts, which totaled $811 million, were administered through the Department of Justice’s Office of Justice Programs, which awarded roughly $3 billion in competitive grants during the 2024 fiscal year, according to Reuters.
U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi defended the cuts in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, stating that the department has cut “millions of dollars in wasteful grants.” She also signaled that additional cuts may be on the way.
Underreported to police
Human trafficking data in the United States is limited, but available figures suggest the problem is both widespread and underreported.
FBI data shows that in 2023, there were 2,584 reported trafficking incidents and 3,117 identified victims — a sharp increase from just 22 incidents in 2013, when the agency began tracking trafficking through its Uniform Crime Reporting system. The rise is largely attributed to more law enforcement agencies participating in the data collection system.
Separate data from the National Human Trafficking Hotline, which offers support to victims, identified 9,619 trafficking cases in 2023 — up from 5,551 in 2015. In 2023, the hotline received more than 30,000 tips, or “signals.”
Experts and advocates emphasize that both the hotline and the crime data capture only a fraction of trafficking incidents, given the hidden nature of the crime and the barriers victims face in reporting to police.
Although national data struggles to capture the full scope of trafficking, Minnesota is among the states that have taken extra steps to build their own data collection systems to better understand the issue and support victims.

Its efforts have drawn attention for state officials’ focus on both urban and rural communities, as well as on Native populations that often face barriers to accessing services.
Experts say it’s a common misconception that trafficking is primarily an urban issue — in reality, it can and does happen everywhere.
Still, some victims — including boys and men — may be overlooked.
“Sometimes for male youth, they are not identified as victims. They may show up in the criminal justice system as defendants or they may be adjudicated as juvenile delinquents,” said Caroline Palmer, the human trafficking prevention director at the Minnesota Department of Health. “There’s not really a close look at what might be happening in the background in terms of their victimization and trafficking exploitation.”
Palmer noted that while Minnesota offers programming for all genders, some male-identifying people may not feel comfortable with certain services, highlighting the need for more tailored support to meet everyone’s unique needs.
More than three-quarters of respondents to the UC Irvine-EverFree poll said being a woman greatly increases the risk of trafficking, but only 2% of respondents said the same about men — despite the fact that trafficking affects people of all genders.
Public perceptions about survivors were also influenced by the victim’s age: While 83% of respondents believe minors who are trafficked are always victims, only 61% say the same about adults — a gap that, advocates warn, can contribute to the criminalization of adult survivors.

(Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)After losing their bid to unionize the Amazon warehouse in Garner by a three-to-one margin in February, labor organizers with Carolina Amazonians United for Solidarity and Empowerment are challenging the election results, arguing Amazon coerced employees into voting against the union campaign.
In a filing with the National Labor Relations Board on Feb. 24, CAUSE alleges that Amazon misled workers into believing that they would lose existing benefits and wages if they voted in favor of the union, brought in a speaker who said the union would deport workers, and targeted pro-union workers for discipline throughout the election period.
“The Employer engaged in improper surveillance of employees, created the impression of surveillance, and interrogated employees regarding their Union support and Union activity,” the CAUSE objection reads. “The Employer selectively enforced workplace rules regarding performance standards and appearance, targeting known Union supporters for discipline and enforcement while ignoring similar violations by workers who were not known Union supporters.”
Though more than 30% of workers comprising the bargaining unit signed union cards in 2024 — representing the support of more than 1,000 warehouse associates — fewer ultimately voted in favor of the union, with just 829 voting in favor and 2,447 voting against, according to the NLRB. That left the union campaign far short of the majority vote necessary to win the right to bargain on behalf of the warehouse staff.
Eileen Hards, a spokesperson for Amazon, declined to comment on CAUSE’s allegations of coercion, surveillance, and selective discipline, but expressed satisfaction with the result of the election.
“Our team in Garner overwhelmingly chose to keep a direct relationship with Amazon,” Hards wrote in an emailed statement. “We look forward to continuing to make RDU1 a great place to work together, and to supporting our teammates as they build their futures with us.”
In March, the NLRB placed the union campaign’s challenge on hold while complaints around the company’s conduct during the election period are vetted. Meanwhile, labor activists are gearing up for renewed efforts at Garner’s RDU1 warehouse as well as additional facilities throughout the Carolinas.
‘We desperately need the protection of the NLRB’
Since 2022, CAUSE has brought more than a dozen unfair labor practice complaints against Amazon, largely focusing on employee terminations, discipline of union organizers, and a general climate of surveillance.
The first of these complaints, coming in June 2022, soon after the union campaign’s formation, cited warehouse rules forbidding discussion of wages, hours, and other working conditions as an illegal prohibition on union activity. It also pointed to the end of site-specific COVID-19 updates, restrictions on the company’s internal discussion board, and the removal of a “web clock punch” feature on the employee app as impediments to protected labor activities.

The most extensive labor litigation pursued by the union surrounded disciplinary action against its co-founder, Rev. Ryan Brown, who alleged in 2022 that his complaints about warehouse conditions and racial discrimination were met with retaliation from supervisors, including a “final written warning.”
In a May 2024 response to the complaint, Amazon conceded that it issued the warning but denied that “such discipline was issued for any unlawful purpose” and was instead purely due to violation of company policy.
Arguing that the complaint should be dismissed, attorneys for Amazon went further than the facts of the individual case: they claimed the NLRB’s adjudicative procedures themselves are inherently unconstitutional, as board administrators are “improperly insulated from the President’s removal power.”
“The Complaint should be dismissed because the agency procedures through which the Complaint will be resolved violate Article II of the United States Constitution,” attorneys for Amazon wrote. “The National Labor Relations Board’s concurrent exercise of legislative, executive, and judicial power in this proceeding violates the separation of powers established by the United States Constitution and the guarantee of due process found in the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.”
Though Amazon was ordered in September 2024 — nearly two years after the initial complaint — to produce documents relating to policy complaints and allegations of discrimination that Brown and other employees voiced, the union withdrew its complaint the following month, due to the time and expense of the lengthy appeals process.
CAUSE has alleged that several employees have lost their jobs as a result of union organizing leading up to and during the election period, including Brown and Duke professor Orin Starn. Those terminations have continued in the wake of the election, organizers say, including that of Diedre King in March. According to CAUSE, she worked at the Garner warehouse for four years with an unblemished disciplinary record and was an “active, dedicated, and visible” member of the union organizing committee before she was accused of slapping a coworker during the election period, a claim she denies.
King said in the wake of her termination, she has received “amazing” support from other members of CAUSE. Organizers set up a fundraiser that has raised more than $5,500 for her as of Friday, and she said she also received a flood of calls offering support, even from colleagues she did not know before. “They call, they check up on me and see what I’m doing, get me out, get me involved in stuff — and not want me to sit at home and, like, be really depressed.”
Starn, the Duke professor, pointed to King’s termination and that of another employee afterwards as evidence of a “mass purge” targeting union organizers. A worker on the warehouse’s loading dock and an active organizer with the union, Starn was let go in December 2023 after a social media post in which he toasted the union effort with a sip of rum in the parking lot after work.

While the company cited its drug and alcohol policy as grounds for the dismissal, Starn wrote in an October 2024 NLRB appeal letter that he was instead let go for the “real and illegal reason” of openly campaigning for the union, one of just three workers doing so at the time.
“My firing damaged our effort by keeping me out of the facility and the chance to mobilize workers there, although we are making strong progress in our card collection nonetheless,” he wrote. “We desperately need the protection of the NLRB in supporting rightful complaints like mine to keep a powerful company from getting away with demoralizing illegal tactics in trying to suppress worker efforts to have a voice in the workplace.”
Hards, the Amazon spokesperson, wrote in a statement that Starn’s termination was not related to his union activities and disputed his characterization of selective enforcement of the company’s drug and alcohol policy.
“The decision to terminate Mr. Starn was unrelated to whether he supported any particular cause or group. Mr. Starn was terminated for violating Amazon’s drug and alcohol policy, a violation that has resulted in several other terminations at RDU1 in the past,” she wrote. “We expect all of our employees to follow our policies, and we take appropriate action when those policies are violated.”
Ultimately, of the 13 labor complaints brought by CAUSE organizers, all but two have been dismissed or withdrawn — the most recent of those complaints, an expansive Feb. 7 complaint alleging a campaign of surveillance, intimidation, and retaliation by Amazon throughout the election period, remains open, as does a Jan. 15 complaint citing the arrest of CAUSE supporters on warehouse property in December. A Feb. 12 complaint that Amazon brought against the union over the removal of company posters is also still active.
A resolution to CAUSE’s election objections will come only after their prior complaints are adjudicated. “I have determined to postpone the objections hearing until I determine the merits of the related pending unfair labor practice allegations and whether consolidation of the pending objections with an unfair labor practice proceeding before an administrative law judge is warranted,” NLRB regional director Michael Turner wrote in March.
With President Donald Trump’s election, however, it appears CAUSE’s claims may well face an uphill battle with the NLRB. In March, Trump nominated Crystal Carey as the board’s next general counsel — a management-side labor lawyer whose firm has represented Amazon in labor disputes and advanced the claim that the board itself is unconstitutional.
Union supporters allege ‘a total fear campaign’
At the center of the ongoing dispute over the labor election results is the conduct of Amazon and the union campaign during the election period, from late 2024 to early 2025.
Organizers say Amazon carried out a campaign of intimidation and union-busting, culminating in the arrest of CAUSE supporters on warehouse property, while the company says the campaign went too far in its efforts to reach workers on the premises and counter company messaging, accusing them of trespassing and vandalism.
In their Feb. 24 election challenge, lawyers for CAUSE wrote that the thrust of Amazon’s messaging campaign was that unionizing would be “futile” and was likely to lead to the rollback of higher wages, benefits like volunteer and unpaid time off, and other employment protections that the company had granted in the absence of organized representation.
“[Amazon] threatened employees with the loss of benefits and/or pay if workers voted in favor of being represented by the Union,” the attorneys wrote. “[They] solicited employees to participate in the production of anti-Union marketing materials, and took video footage of employees to use in anti-Union videos without the employees’ knowledge or consent.”

Italo Medelius, a CAUSE organizer who worked the warehouse’s shipping dock, said managers and employee relations consultants would walk the warehouse floor, soliciting workers and discouraging them from joining the union. This was paired with a “Vote No” promotional video that aired on repeat on televisions across the facility’s lobbies and break rooms, which he said featured a former Teamster making the case that union representation would only harm the workers. “So just a total fear campaign, 24/7 inside of that warehouse,” he said.
According to a report by LaborLab, a pro-union nonprofit corporate watchdog, Amazon paid management-side consulting firm Road Warrior Productions more than $366,000 over the span of roughly a month to create anti-union materials used in the election, which the organization condemned as “union-busting services.”
“Amazon is one of the greatest union busters in the history of the world,” said Medelius. “They cover every single inch of that warehouse in some way, shape, or form with anti-union propaganda.”
Hards, the Amazon spokesperson, cited the extensive organizing efforts across Amazon facilities throughout the U.S. as necessitating the use of labor consulting firms. She pointed to “tens of billions of dollars in benefits” including health care, a 401K program with a company match, and pre-paid college tuition as evidence that investments in workers vastly outweigh the use of those services.
“We also know that there are outside organizations working hard and spending heavily to spread inaccurate information about us to our teams. Which is also why we work to ensure our employees are fully informed about their rights and how decisions about outside representation could impact their day-to-day lives working at Amazon,” Hards wrote in a statement.
Medelius also described an anti-union persuasion campaign that he said targeted Spanish-speaking workers specifically, which he said invoked racial stereotypes in an attempt to divide workers. Medelius, who is bilingual, said he was individually banned from Amazon’s Spanish-language informational meetings after speaking out against these tactics. He added that on one occasion, he was required to report for a random drug test minutes after speaking out at one of these meetings, an experience he said other organizers reported as well.

“The crazy thing is that we’ve been fighting for translation in Human Resources. So, if somebody that’s a Spanish speaker has an issue that needs to be resolved by HR, I have to go with them to translate for them,” Medelius said. “But when it comes to union busting, everything is in Spanish, so it’s kind of a little bit dystopian there.”
Starn recounted a town hall meeting in which a manager sought to associate CAUSE with immigrant deportation efforts to “raise fear and uncertainty” among workers and scare them out of supporting the union effort.
“At one of the town hall meetings, one of the mangers says, you know, ‘We’ve been hearing that CAUSE is telling people that if they vote no, they’ll be deported, and we don’t think anybody should be deported,’” Starn said. “This is a completely outlandish charge, but it’s the kind of thing Amazon does.”
This incident was also detailed in the election challenge, with attorneys for the union campaign writing that Amazon “coerced and intimidated employees into voting against Union representation by falsely accusing the Union of suggesting workers could be deported for voting no” and themselves “suggesting that workers’ immigration status could be impacted by the results of the election.”
According to Hards, employees came forward with complaints that union organizers told them if they did not vote in favor of the union, they could face deportation, and the comments during the informational session were intended to rebut those claims.
The complaint also alleges that Amazon took action against specific employees to prevent them from voting in favor of the union, including delaying a known union supporter’s return-to-work date until after the election had concluded. And it details a culture of surveillance in which workers’ social media accounts were allegedly monitored for statements about the campaign and where workers were “interrogated” about support for the union.
Many of these allegations were also the subject of a Feb. 7 unfair labor practice complaint filed by CAUSE that remains open, including a claim that workers were explicitly asked to report union activity to management and that Amazon selectively targeted known union supporters for disciplinary action.

These claims have been a persistent subject of CAUSE’s labor complaints long before the union card campaign concluded, with their attorneys writing in a May 2023 unfair labor practice complaint that Amazon was “instructing its employees to file internal complaints against supporters of [CAUSE]” and launching investigations against organizers to search for cause to terminate them.
The union alleges that interference with the election effort came to a head on Dec. 7, 2024, when three organizers not employed by Amazon were arrested by Garner Police on trespassing charges as they sought to pass out food and collect union cards outside the warehouse. Days later, Amazon also terminated Brown, the union co-founder, citing inflammatory remarks likening company management to slaveholders and labeling a defender of the company an “Uncle Tom.”
Hards declined to comment on the broader allegations of coercion and surveillance, but wrote that the company was within its rights to seek the removal of non-employees from its property during the Dec. 7 incident.
“Last December, several individuals who aren’t Amazon employees or partners came on to our property and refused multiple requests to leave,” Hards wrote. “After repeated attempts to remedy the situation and consistent with our standard protocols, we engaged law enforcement for assistance. Those individuals were eventually arrested after refusing to follow the police officer’s orders.”
She also condemned Brown for what she described as efforts to “push misinformation to the media” on his arrest and said his dismissal was the result of “repeated misconduct” including the use of “derogatory and racist language,” which the company had previously investigated. “His most recent violation resulted in his termination because we don’t tolerate that type of inappropriate behavior at Amazon.”

During this same period, Amazon alleges that union supporters tore down posters encouraging workers to vote no, labeling the actions as “acts of property damage.” CAUSE contends in its own complaint that scores of pro-union posters and signage from inside and outside the facility were destroyed — including signs posted in the break room and banners supporting the union hanging on the public sidewalk outside the warehouse.
Despite these setbacks, the card campaign succeeded in January after organizers collected signatures from more than 30% of workers comprising the prospective bargaining unit. But in February, they lost by a roughly three-to-one margin, a result that indicated there had been a falloff of support in the critical month leading up to the election — a result that Medelius said came as “a blow” in the moment.
“Ultimately, just looking at it, we knew that historically and logically we were facing an uphill battle from the very beginning,” Medelius said. “Everybody that’s a professional labor organizer has told us, you’re never gonna win the first time.”
‘This election hasn’t stopped the train’
On Friday, organizers with CAUSE once again set up their tents outside RDU1 — their first demonstration on-site since the election. As they renewed their pitch to workers, the company began work on a new eight-foot fence along the property line.
“My biggest fear leading up to the election was if there is a loss, or if there is a big loss with a big margin like what happened, that we would just collapse — that’s what Amazon pretty much hopes, right?” Medelius said. “But with us, I mean, the next day we had a meeting, that Sunday, and it was one of our most attended meetings. There were even people that voted no that were there and trying to figure out how we can build a better union.”

He described a mood of “optimism and hope” among organizers as the fight moves forward and called the 829 supporters in the warehouse a strong foothold to come back and succeed in the next effort. According to NLRB rules, a union campaign can file for a new election 12 months after the conclusion of the previous one. That means organizers could give Amazon “another Christmas present this year” with a renewed card authorization campaign, Medelius said.
King said she has heard from workers who voted no and who have had a change of heart since, pointing to issues like a wave of terminations after the election and excessive enforcement of policies like cell phone restrictions and “time off task” discipline.
“That’s why we’re out here today, to let people know that we’re still here,” she said on Friday, sitting under one of the tents to meet and persuade former coworkers. “We’re not going anywhere, and we have your back, but we need y’all to have ours as well.”
After the first election effort, Medelius said, organizers now have firsthand experience with the company’s anti-union tactics, giving them a better chance at countering their messaging among workers.
“Now we know the rules, we know what we’ve got to do, and we can come in with a better strategy,” Medelius said. “It’s kind of like a boxing match, right? You lose one round, but then you jump back and win the next three, so we’re very excited to do that.”

In particular, he outlined plans to strengthen CAUSE’s Hispanic Organizing Committee and day shift and night shift organizing committees, and to begin collecting authorization cards year-round. He added that organizers had been in contact with workers at the RDU5 and DRT8 warehouses in Durham as well as facilities in South Carolina who want to begin their own efforts, but declined to offer specific information about potential future campaigns, citing the need for secrecy around organizing strategies.
Benny Koval, chair of CAUSE’s night shift organizing committee, said the immediate priority was “what we can do on the shop floor,” pushing back on issues like excessive temperatures in the facility, post-holiday rush layoffs, and mandatory overtime days — one of which was slated to be on Mother’s Day before the company backtracked after employee outcries, Koval said.
“I feel like they’re just stepping on us to see how much we’ll take to a certain extent,” Koval said.
Meanwhile, efforts to unionize Amazon continue throughout the U.S., particularly across the South. In Louisville, Kentucky, workers at the company’s KCVG Air Hub are seeking to organize through the Teamsters, and in Bessemer, Alabama, labor officials have ordered Amazon to hold a third union election after finding unlawful interference in previous attempts.
Abraham Walker, a sociology professor at Fayetteville State University, said the South poses some structural obstacles for union campaigns. Every state in the region is a “right-to-work” state, meaning that workplaces cannot make union membership compulsory and all workers are entitled to the same benefits regardless of union affiliation, creating what Walker called a “free rider problem” in which workers reap the rewards of union-bargained contracts without paying dues to support organizing efforts. And because of the low rates of union membership throughout the South, many workers do not know anyone who is a member of a union, leaving them susceptible to misinformation about union impacts, Walker said.
  Labor groups from across the South came together to support the CAUSE campaign. Fayetteville State University professor Abraham Walker pointed to these ties as a source of strength for the union going forward. (Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)
He noted that in Chattanooga, Tennessee, it took three elections before workers at the city’s Volkswagen plant voted to unionize the facility in 2024. Walker said a benefit of CAUSE’s status as an independent grassroots campaign is that “they’re not going anywhere.” He cited “very strong coalitions” the organizers built across the Research Triangle as a source of structural support that will allow the union to renew its efforts going forward.
“Despite the final tally, I see a lot of promise in CAUSE’s future,” Walker said. “There’s going to be a process of reassessment, I think, going forward. They will in all likelihood try to do this again — it might not be a year, it might be a few years from now, but one of the things about Amazon warehouses, which is both challenging and potentially an advantage, is the turnover’s high.”
The New York Times reported in 2021 that Amazon sees a roughly 150% turnover rate among its hourly associates each year. Medelius said this was a source of difficulty in this year’s election because many of those who signed authorization cards were already gone from the warehouse by February. But that fact can also be turned to the union campaign’s advantage, he said: many, if not most, of the 2,447 who voted against the union will no longer be with at RDU1 in a year’s time, giving organizers “a brand-new warehouse” for its next effort.
“All we’ve gotta do is keep our supporters, make sure that we keep telling them our motto, ‘Don’t quit, organize,’ and that’s the way that we’re going to out-organize them, so the plan right now is keep calling for an election — if we lose, do it again,” Medelius said.
“We’re going to organize as if we had won the election, we’re going to continue building our movement, and we’re gonna continue not just within RDU1, but all across the Carolinas,” he added. “This election hasn’t stopped the train.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/P2080246-scaled-e1741104680670-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-10 08:04:14.162335

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)State health and labor officials hope that new workplace regulations will help workers avoid overheating on the job, as Maryland enters the annual heat season on the heels of a deadly 2024 summer.
The Maryland Occupational Safety and Health division of the Department of Labor finalized new heat illness prevention standards in September, at the tail end of a 2024 heat season that saw 27 fatalities and more than 1,200 emergency room visits related to high temperatures.
Maryland Labor Secretary Portia Wu said there was already “a general duty to protect workers from dangerous conditions, but I think the heat-stress standard provides some really specific guidance to employers.” She said her department has been educating workplaces to get them “up to speed” on the new regulations ahead of the 2025 season.
“We have done a ton of outreach in both public and private sectors — industries like construction, tree care, warehousing, agriculture, restaurants, commercial kitchens, laundries,” Wu said.
Anticipation for the new regulations rose last year following the death of Ronald Silver II, who died Aug. 2 from a heat-related illness while working at his job with the Baltimore City Department of Public Works’ Bureau of Solid Waste.
The new heat stress prevention regulations require workplaces to have plans when the heat index begins to rise to above 90 and 100 degrees. The new regulations also prompt employers to ensure that workers have ample access to water and cool locations while allowing for frequent break times at high temperatures.
Workplace heat-illness standards finalized as deadly ‘heat season’ comes to an end

Wu admits that the new regulations are somewhat “common sense,” but said that the regulations ensure employers have an established course of action when temperatures rise this summer.
“I tend to think about it as ‘rest, break, shade, ease-in,’” Wu said.
She noted that the state is emphasizing what’s called “acclimatization,” which is a process to help new employees get used to working in hot conditions for up to the first two weeks of employment.
“People who have been working in hot conditions for days, weeks, months on end, their bodies are more used to it,” Wu said. “Somebody who started yesterday and it’s 95 degrees today … they need some time to get used to it.”
“That’s where we see the accidents happen,” Wu said. “We often have a situation where a supervisor may not be experienced in on-boarding new employees — construction is a good example.”
Acclimatization can also apply to experienced workers when temperatures spike suddenly, she said.
Workplace standards can only do so much, since many victims of heat stress may not be on the job – in fact, half of the fatalities from last year were of people aged 65 years and older.
Clifford S. Mitchell, director of the Environmental Health Bureau in the Maryland Department of Health, said that temperatures are trending higher and for longer periods, leaving those who are medically vulnerable more at risk for longer stretches.
“There are earlier hot days, there are more frequent hot days, and there are longer periods of hot days. And more importantly, we are not seeing the same degree of cooling in the evenings that we used to see, because of the greenhouse gas effects,” he said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“Because recovery time is also important, one of the things that we are seeing now is people who are in hot environments in the day and are not getting relief at night,” he added. “And that is a problem for people who are vulnerable, particularly those who are vulnerable medically.”
The change in federal administrations may also complicate the state’s efforts to reduce heat-related illnesses, as President Donald Trump (R) and his administration reduce the federal workforce at weather-related agencies.
“We rely very, very much on our federal partners in the National Weather Service and NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) for high-quality forecasting, modeling and ability to understand exactly what is happening,” Mitchell said, noting that accurate forecasts help the health department plan and anticipate periods of extreme heat.
From a state perspective, he said the Department of Health will be “better prepared through actions like the new MOSH standards for employers,” which will add “structure and guidance for what to do when things are getting hot.”
“That makes it easier for all of us, because there are more people who are following those guidelines,” Mitchell said.


The 2025 heat season runs roughly from May through the end of September. Already, 22 people have landed in emergency rooms or urgent care, according to the health department’s Heat-related Illness Surveillance Report for the week of April 27 through May 3. The department will release weekly updates during the season on Wednesdays.
Ahead of summer, Mitchell urged Marylanders to adhere to standard heat precautions: take frequent breaks, stay hydrated and act quickly if someone starts showing signs of heat illness.
“If you start to feel your heart racing, if you start to get a little confused, anything that doesn’t feel right, you want to get out of the heat as soon as possible,” he said. He also urged folks to check-in on their neighbors in periods of prolonged heat, and to never leave a child or pet in the car.
“I say it every year, and unfortunately every year we see examples – never, ever leave children or pets in a closed vehicle,” he said. “We see completely preventable deaths in those settings.”
Generally speaking, Mitchell urged that “outdoor workers, student athletes, and everybody” should “take it easy in the heat” this summer.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024_march28_baltimore-1024x686.jpg,,,2025-05-10 08:04:14.162335
,Mississippi Today,2025-05-10 11:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,"Even in red America, clean energy is booming. But now, huge renewable projects are dead.","Ames Alexander, Floodlight",,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/05/10/even-in-red-america-clean-energy-is-booming-but-now-huge-renewable-projects-are-dead/,"Political uncertainty under Trump has dampened the clean energy market, with nearly $8 billion in projects scrapped or cut back already this year.","This story was originally published by Floodlight.
Renewable energy in the United States has surged to unprecedented levels, with the combined power generated by solar, wind and geothermal more than tripling over the past decade, according to a new report by a network of state environmental groups.
The growth has slashed harmful greenhouse gas emissions, made the nation’s energy system more resilient and prevented thousands of premature deaths from power plant pollution, according to the report by Environment America.
But this progress faces increasing resistance as President Donald Trump in his first 15 weeks in office has begun to dismantle federal policies and spending aimed at slowing climate change.
It’s all happening at a time of heightened concern among environmentalists. Despite an international accord to lower greenhouse gas emissions, the atmosphere now contains record levels of heat-trapping gasses. All 50 states have warmed since the first Earth Day in 1970, according to a new analysis by Climate Central, an independent nonprofit group that researches and disseminates information about climate change and its effects.

Among the highlights of the Environment America report:

The amount of solar energy produced in 2024 — enough to power 28 million homes — was nearly eight times higher than a decade earlier. Solar power production increased 27% from 2023 to 2024.


Wind produced even more energy — enough to power 42 million homes in 2024. The amount of power from wind has more than doubled over the past decade.


Wind, solar and geothermal energy accounted for 19% of all retail sales of electricity last year, according to the federal data used to produce the report.


The amount of utility-scale battery storage in the United States grew 63% from 2023 to 2024 — and a more than 80-fold increase over the past decade.


Nearly 3.3 million electric vehicles were on U.S. roads at the end of 2023 – a 25-fold increase from 2014. The number of electric vehicle charging ports, meanwhile, grew to more than 218,000 at the end of 2024 – six times more than 2015 and a 24% increase from just the year before.

More than 1.5 million plug-in electric vehicles were sold in 2024, an increase of more than 7% over the previous year, according to Argonne National Laboratory. Nearly 300,000 new electric vehicles were sold in the United States during the first quarter of 2025 — an 11% increase over the same period last year, Kelley Blue Book data shows.
“The growth of these clean energy technologies is now clearly benefiting people in all 50 states, and they’re really providing the building blocks of a clean energy system free from dirty and inefficient fuels,” said Johanna Neumann, senior director of the Campaign for 100% Renewable Energy, which is led by Environment America. “And the more that we can accelerate the progress that we’ve seen, the better it’ll be for our health and for our environment.” 
Most of the states that have seen the biggest percentage increases in wind, solar and geothermal energy over the past decade are in the South — and most are Republican states, according to a Floodlight analysis of the federal data used in the Environment America report. 
Some of those states, including Mississippi and Alabama, still rank low in the total amount of renewable energy produced. But other right-leaning Southern states, including Florida and North Carolina, now rank above most others in terms of the total renewable energy generated.

Billions in clean-energy projects canceled 
For those concerned about climate change, however, a new analysis points to a more worrisome sign: Almost $8 billion in investments — including 16 large-scale factories and other projects — were canceled, closed or downsized in the first three months of 2025, according to the report by E2, a nonpartisan group of business leaders who advocate for sound environmental policies.
Likely contributing to the cancellations: market uncertainty and the debate in Congress over repealing tax credits and other incentives for clean energy projects. The $7.9 billion in investments withdrawn this year are more than three times the amount canceled over the previous two years, the E2 report notes.
“Clean energy companies still want to invest in America, but uncertainty over Trump administration policies and the future of critical clean energy tax credits are taking a clear toll,” E2 spokesman Michael Timberlake said in a statement.
The Inflation Reduction Act, President Joe Biden’s massive climate law, extended renewable energy tax credits until at least 2032. Whether the Republican-controlled Congress will eliminate those tax credits is unclear.
“I think that market certainty has been stripped away for many of these technologies right now, and they’re feeling uneasy,” Neumann said. “And so it’s not surprising to me that we’re seeing a retraction in investment.”

The Legislature did increase funding this year for public education — but debate over the amount continues between politicians, education stakeholders and the Idaho Department of Education (IDE).

Public education’s financial gains were few but appreciated, IDE leaders said, during a 2025 legislative session that had moments ranging from surprising to heartbreaking. From a failed $3 million request for high-needs students to the state’s first private school choice tax credit, the repercussions led to a sense of gloom among the district leaders and superintendents who gathered at Idaho State University for a recap of the session. 
As politicians and educators scramble to craft the narrative over what the session meant for public education, Little held his own press event Thursday, where he said “it’s both our constitutional and our moral obligation to the next generation that we increase funding, and more importantly, have better outcomes for public schools.”

 The debate over Horman and Little’s claims

In a column for EdNews, Horman wrote that “public education received $400 million in new funding.”

That sparked frustration among education stakeholders who said the public schools budget provides no new additional state funding for anything other than pay increases and benefits for school staff, as Clark Corbin of the Idaho Capital Sun reported. 
In response, Horman told Corbin that just $100 million in new general fund dollars will go to pay and benefits. The other $300 million is located outside public school budgets in the form of tax cuts and facilities payments sent to districts to pay down levies and bonds. 

IDE staff publicly chimed in Thursday. 
Tolman said there was a $100 million increase for pay and benefits — a fact stakeholders and politicians seem to be able to agree on. 
The other $300 million is not accessible to charter schools, Tolman said. For traditional school districts, this funding is either “very restricted or has been repurposed” — meaning it was already in education coffers, but got moved from one account to another. 
For example, Little has touted a $50 million investment for rural school facilities, a promise he outlined in his state of the state address. 
But that $50 million isn’t as new or accessible as it seems, Tolman said. 
Half of it had been sitting in a facilities cooperative fund, “which has been on the books for about 20 years,” Tolman said. To access it, a district had to run a failed bond or levy, and document a health and safety concern in the building.
Over the 20 years, only two districts have been able to use the fund — Plummer-Worley to build a new school, and Salmon to replace a roof.  School districts that meet those conditions can apply for and receive the funds, but would have to pay back the funds with state dollars they received for paying down bonds and levies, if possible, Tolman said. But, if the money isn’t repaid within 20 years, it will be forgiven. 
The second half of the $50 million comes from a preexisting bond levy equalization fund, which was discontinued in the 2024 session — but the cash remained. So this year, legislators moved those dollars into this new fund. 
That, Tolman said, helps illustrate why the $400 million claim is misleading — “because it’s repurposing funding that either was given to you and taken away and now given back to you, or was already in the account, or that doesn’t apply to charters.”
At a separate event held the same day, hours later, Little touted “an additional $50 million for rural school facilities.”

He also cited $85 million for increased teacher pay, and “additional literacy investments. 
While Little’s claims about public education investments were more modest than Horman’s, he seemed to defend her thinking when asked about the $400 million. “If a district receives money to pay for facilities, pay for maintenance, that’s money they can use elsewhere,” Little said. 
 Denied special education funding puts it at top of list for next year

Facing an $82 million special education funding gap, state superintendent Debbie Critchfield pushed to shore up funding in two ways — a new, student-weighted funding formula and a $3 million funding request for high-needs students. Both failed. 
The fate of the funding formula rewrite — a long sought-after change that legislators have previously pursued, without success — was likely not a shock. 
But IDE staff were “surprised” that the relatively small, $3 million ask “ended up being a fiscal hangup for some,” said Greg Wilson, Critchfield’s chief of staff. “It goes back to how these requests, however minuscule, require a high bar in order to get them across the finish line.”
Wilson said he knew the $3 million “isn’t a lot,” but said it seemed a “reasonable amount to get it through the (legislative) process and get something in place.”
Scott Muir, superintendent of Soda Springs School District, asked IDE leaders why legislators oppose additional special education funding. 
“As we see the rise in special education, and we cannot meet the needs, now we’re going to see advocates and lawyers stepping into the process and school districts are going to suffer for that,” he said. 
Tolman said some legislators are not aware of the $82 million gap between what the federal government provides and what schools need. 
“Other comments we have heard are, ‘Why are you educating special education students at all? Why are they part of the public school system?’” Tolman said. “There is a real lack of understanding or an unwillingness to learn more about the problem.”
“It kind of breaks your heart when you listen to the comments some of the legislators made regarding the students that we not only want to serve but are required federally to serve,” said Spencer Barzee, the IDE’s deputy superintendent for eastern Idaho.
Some legislators were also surprised by the high costs associated with students who might need a one-on-one aide, or who have feeding tubes or are nonverbal, Tolman said, adding that the $400 million in tax cuts may also have made it difficult to approve even small asks.
Wilson said increased special education funding will be a priority in the next legislative session. 
Little said special education funding is also a priority for him. But there’s a caveat — the dismantling of the U.S. Department of Education could lead to increased uncertainty, and require a wait-and-see approach, he said.  
Little took a similar tack when addressing private school choice. 
When asked whether he planned to push for more oversight and accountability for the program, and whether he would advocate to keep its $50 million cap in place, Little was noncommittal. 
“We’ll see how the implementation goes,” he said. “We’ll obviously work with our legislative partners for next year. Anything is relative to what the budget looks like next year.” 
“All of those issues will be on the table,” he continued. “But public education will continue to be the top priority.”

(Photo by Getty Images)On Gov.Wes Moore’s desk sits House Bill 1294, which would give predatory, app-based payday lenders a legal green light to exploit Marylanders. If signed into law, it would exempt these lenders from Maryland’s hard-won protections against usury, deceptive practices, and discrimination based on race or sex. The governor should veto this bill.
HB1294 opens a loophole that would allow new, app-based payday lenders to bypass Maryland’s 33% annual interest rate cap. These digital lenders already operate in the state, often illegally, offering small-dollar loans with effective annual interest rates that regularly exceed 100% — way higher than even the most expensive credit cards. The Maryland General Assembly, instead of cracking down on these scofflaw payday lenders, chose to legalize and protect their harmful practices.
Entrenching these extractive companies in Maryland will financially devastate families. These lenders rely on repeat borrowing to make a profit. Borrowers are typically advanced just a small amount, usually less than $100, and charged high fees each time. These fees are sometimes disguised as “tips” or voluntary payments. The goal is to keep borrowers returning again and again.
We’ve seen this playbook before. In 2003, I founded the Mississippi Center for Justice to fight the systemic forces keeping people in poverty. One of our first and longest battles was against storefront payday lenders. These companies blanketed low-income neighborhoods with high-interest loans, trapping people in debt and blocking pathways to economic security.

We saw families struggle to repay one loan, only to be forced to take out another. We watched predatory lenders siphon away financial resources from communities, especially Black communities. These practices helped keep Mississippi at the bottom of nearly every measure of economic health.
Unlike Mississippi, Maryland has historically stood firm against payday lenders. But HB 1294 would unravel that legacy. It establishes a haven for predatory lenders to firmly establish themselves in our state and wreck the finances of our residents. By exempting app-based payday lenders from key consumer protections, the bill makes it more likely Marylanders will get trapped in debt, scammed, or targeted with an unaffordable loan because of the color of their skin.
Data from the Center for Responsible Lending paints a troubling picture. Over 25% of Marylanders using these apps take out 25 or more advances per year. Nearly half use two or more apps simultaneously. These are the same debt-trap patterns we saw with storefront payday lending.
The bill would also shield app-based lenders from Maryland’s ban on misleading or deceptive statements about loan terms. That means they could continue to obscure the true costs of borrowing behind confusing terms and hidden fees, all with the state’s blessing.
Perhaps most alarmingly, the bill exempts these lenders from Maryland’s anti-discrimination laws. That means app-based lenders wouldn’t be held accountable if they discriminated based on race or sex, an especially dangerous move given persistent disparities in access to fair credit.
At a time when federal consumer protections have weakened, especially under the Trump administration, which gutted enforcement at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), state laws are more important than ever. The CFPB has abandoned actions against payday lending apps accused of deception and against mortgage lenders accused of racial discrimination. Without strong state protections, Marylanders will be left vulnerable.
HB1294 lets an industry built on exploiting financial hardship break the rules. Friendly branding and smartphone apps don’t change the underlying business model: pushing borrowers into a cycle of debt.
I’ve seen what happens when predatory lenders are allowed to flourish — how they target vulnerable communities, make false promises, and leave people worse off than before. I’ve been fighting these practices for decades, and I can say with confidence that this legislation would give a free pass for abusive payday lending in Maryland.
Gov. Moore has the opportunity to stand with consumers, protect vulnerable families, and uphold Maryland’s tradition of strong financial protections. He should veto HB1294.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/money-1024x6781692353379-1.jpg,,,2025-05-10 07:00:29.336913

Sign up for their newsletter here.
For two years, Ember McCoy has been researching air quality and the gaps in data collection in neighborhoods in Southwest Detroit where mostly Black and Latino residents live. The project, part of McCoy’s doctorate work at University of Michigan, is suddenly at risk.
The National Science Foundation, a major funder across the world for basic research, was ordered by the Trump administration in recent weeks to stop funding and awarding grants.
“I knew that things were happening at the NSF. I knew that future grants were at risk. I think it was more unexpected that they would terminate existing grants,” McCoy said. McCoy, 33, has received $10,000 of a $15,000 grant and was notified April 21 by email that the rest of the grant was in limbo. McCoy is just one of the hundreds of researchers whose work has been targeted as a result of an executive order targeting diversity, equity and inclusion programs funded by the federal government.
The Trump administration, across federal agencies, in the past months and weeks has stopped paying out millions of federal dollars for programs and research  linked to environmental justice and racial inequity.
NSF director Sethuraman Panchanathan resigned on April 24 amid the most recent round of notices. “I believe that I have done all I can to advance the mission of the agency and feel that it is time for me to pass the baton to new leadership,” he said in an email to agency staff obtained by Science magazine.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced on April 22, the celebration of Earth Day, that nearly 300 employees who work on environmental justice and civil rights issues would be laid off.


McCoy’s academic advisor said professors and students across campus in Ann Arbor were grappling with uncertainty while trying to continue their work. “We’re kind of in this sort of strange time where so much is happening, but also we don’t know what’s going to happen next,” said Shobita Parthasarathy, director of the Science, Technology, and Public Policy Program at the University of Michigan.
“The government, of course, isn’t just funding things. It’s also setting priorities,” Pathasarathy said. “And so you know, the private sector isn’t going to obviously do research like this.”
McCoy’s work included interviews with residents about current air monitoring techniques and when and how monitors failed to capture pollutants—including volatile organic compounds, sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide—in their neighborhoods in southwest Detroit. Residents live near several industrial facilities in the area yet air monitors installed by the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy, which were updated in 2022 after requests from community members, don’t capture the extent of the community’s pollution burden, according to McCoy.


“That area is where there’s over 50 industrial facilities within three miles. … There’s a Marathon Oil facility. There used to be a coal plant,” said McCoy. “Those types of communities exist everywhere.”
She added: “They face really high rates of air pollution, or at least air pollution related health experiences like asthma, cancer or conditions.”
McCoy has worked or studied at University of Michigan since 2015. She said her current research aims to gather data and share information among the affected communities about pollution levels and risk. The email she received “did not say [why the grant was canceled]. It just said that it no longer fit the priorities of the staff,” McCoy said.
She wasn’t totally surprised. Earlier this year, she was startled to find her grant on a list compiled by Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas of so-called “Woke DEI” grants.
She later surmised, from reading government websites, that the wording of her application may have been a trigger. She had cited “environmental justice” in her abstract
“It was clear on the FAQ page,” she said. ”They remanded grants that are associated with diversity, equity and inclusion.”
“I know they are keywords that are under scrutiny by the administration and so I imagine that they searched abstracts for those words and those that fit them were on the chopping block,” McCoy said.
Longtime environmental justice advocate Dolores Leonard has known McCoy for years. McCoy worked with residents in the area throughout her undergraduate and masters’ degrees study, Leonard said. “I was devastated for her. Devastated because I understood the amount of work that she had put in, 10 years approximately.”


“I felt her pain,” Leonard said. “Not only her personal pain, but all the work that she did to benefit the community, the people.”
Leonard lives near the Marathon Oil Refinery, an area where 80 percent of the residents are Black, 12 percent are Hispanic and 40 percent live in poverty, according to a Harvard Business School study from 2022. The residents in that zip code area, the study said, have higher rates of asthma, heart disease and lung cancer than in most other zip code areas of Michigan.
A resident for nearly 60 years in Detroit, Leonard said she suffers respiratory problems and McCoy has been instrumental in documenting the health risks for people who live near the polluters.“Of all the students I’ve met, I am most proud of Ember,” Leonard said.
McCoy noted that the Trump administration’s actions will likely have a chilling effect on researchers’ efforts. But environmental justice has a long history of perseverance, she said.


“This type of research, this type of activism and organizing around environmental justice has been happening for decades, long before this type of work was properly funded,” she said. “I know [it] will continue.”
McCoy’s advisor said the loss of funding will affect what future generations know about their environments and potential health risks. Funding—and this broadside of federal cuts—will change research tracks for graduate students and curriculums, Parthasarathy said.
“On some level, that is what current policymakers want, what the current administration wants,” Parthasarathy said. “But it is at the expense of better science and technology and public policy.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023.079_Michigan-Chapter-Visit_Heather-Wilson-04-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-10 06:05:29.133339

She reportedly collected more than $125,000 through the fraud scheme and used the money for luxury purchases, according to Attorney General Liz Murrill.
Priscilla Jackson, 40, of Prairieville was arrested Thursday and booked into East Baton Rouge Parish Jail. The Louisiana Bureau of Investigation started a probe in November 2022 after the agency was forwarded fraud allegations from the Louisiana Department of Health. 
An internal LDH audit discovered Jackson had underreported her household income, didn’t disclose she was married and failed to include financial support she received from her husband on her applications for Medicaid and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits from the state Department of Children and Family Services, the attorney general’s office said.
The money Jackson received from the fraudulent applications totaled more than $107,000 from the health department and $19,665 from DCFS, according to Murrill’s office.
Arrest records the attorney general referenced indicate Jackson’s household bought a Cadillac Escalade for more than $110,000 and paid for a $70,000 pool installation during the time she allegedly obtained the benefits through fraud. Jackson and her children did not qualify for Medicaid from 2018-25, the records also noted.
The felony charges against Jackson include one count each of unauthorized use of SNAP benefits, theft over $25,000 and government benefits fraud.
There was no response to messages sent to two phone numbers listed under Jackson’s address.
Jackson’s bond was set at $100,000. Information was not immediately available on whether she had posted bail.

(AP Photo/Domenico Stinellis)When 69-year-old Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost appeared on the main balcony of St. Peter’s Basilica for the first time as Pope Leo XIV on May 8, he was cheered loudly by the huge crowd of pilgrims, tourists, local Catholics and other onlookers who had waited hours for the first sign of white smoke and the official announcement.
As a specialist in Catholic history and ritual, I know how important this moment was for Catholics and others all over the world. A new pope brings with him a sense of excitement often mixed with uncertainty.
But the choice of the College of Cardinals came as a surprise to some. Prevost is the first pope from the United States, and, traditionally, the European-dominated College of Cardinals has had reservations about choosing a cardinal from the U.S. for fear of too much American influence in the church.
So, who is Prevost, and what might have influenced the cardinals’ vote?
 
Early experiences
Born in Chicago, Illinois, Prevost joined a Catholic religious order at the age of 20: the Order of St. Augustine, called Augustinians, founded in the 13th century. Instead of withdrawing from the world in isolated monasteries, members of this order travel as mendicants to aid the poor as well as serve as missionaries and teachers.
Prevost studied theology in the U.S. and Rome, and as a newly ordained priest he spent a year in Peru. After a short return to the U.S. as an official of the Augustinian order in Illinois, he returned to Peru as a seminary professor to teach canon law, the legal structure of the Catholic Church. He would stay in Peru for the next 10 years.
In 1999, he became the prior — that is, the head — of the local Augustinian province in Chicago and was later elected prior of the worldwide Augustinian order. This gave him a truly global experience, since the Augustinians had some 50 communities spread across every continent.
In 2015, Pope Francis appointed him bishop for the Diocese of Chiclayo in Peru. In 2019, Francis appointed him a member of several important Vatican dicasteries, or departments, where he became familiar with the central church administration. Most importantly, he served as prefect, or chairman, on the Dicastery for Bishops.
In fact, because of his lengthy pastoral experience in Peru and service at the Vatican, some commentators had noted before Prevost was chosen that if the cardinals were to elect an American pope, it would be him. His service on the Dicastery for Bishops was considered especially important, since members play a key role in selecting new bishops.
 
Global church
During the 20th century, especially after the Second Vatican Council — a series of meetings of the world’s bishops to modernize the church, ending in 1965 — the popes began to name cardinals from other parts of the world that were previously considered to be on the periphery of the Catholic Church.
This led to popes being chosen from outside of Italy for the first time in centuries. Pope St. John Paul II was Polish and the first non-Italian pope since the 16th century. Pope Benedict XVI was another non-Italian, born in Germany, who had served as a Vatican official. Pope Francis was born in South America to parents who were Italian-born immigrants to Argentina.
The College of Cardinals, which had few representatives from other continents until recently, is now much more international. Some 80% of the cardinal electors were named by Francis, many from countries that had never before had a cardinal.
In reviewing his record, the cardinal electors might have taken a number of factors into account. Prevost would be an effective administrator as head of the church and was an expert in church canon law. He had decades of experience doing pastoral work in South America, as well as in North America. And as prior general of the entire Augustinian order, he would likely have traveled widely to visit many of the communities he supervised.
 
Papacy under Leo
The new pope appeared on the Vatican balcony wearing the traditional papal garments: white cassock, short red cape, decorated red and gold stole, and golden cross hanging around his neck. Francis, on the other hand, had appeared dressed in the plain white cassock of a pope.
Certainly, he had not chosen the simplicity of Francis. Was this a sign that he would be more of a traditionalist?
His choice of a papal name, I believe, could indicate a different point of view. Pope Leo XIII wrote a groundbreaking encyclical in 1891, “Rerum Novarum,” subtitled “On Dignity and Labor.” In this he stressed the rights of workers to unionize and criticized the conditions in which they worked and lived. He also championed other rights the ordinary worker deserved from their bosses and from their government.

In his first remarks from the balcony, offering a glimpse into the direction of his papacy, Leo XIV stressed the role of Catholics and the church as peacemakers and bridge-builders, in dialogue with other religious traditions and cultures. His first words were “Peace be with you all,” describing this peace as “a disarmed peace, a disarming peace.” He further urged Catholics to act together “without fear … united with one another … to build bridges” through dialogue and outreach — to bring peace to the world.
He may not follow exactly in Francis’ footsteps, but he will likely continue walking in the same direction.

(Photo by Steve Hillebrand/U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)Alaska’s state-owned investment bank could get permission to start oil exploration work in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge as soon as the third quarter of this year, according to court documents filed Friday in Anchorage.
In a status report on a series of lawsuits seeking to block oil development in the refuge, attorneys representing the U.S. Department of the Interior say the agency intends to issue a new document known as a “record of decision” that would cover oil and gas leases sold by the agency in 2020.
The Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority, the state’s publicly owned investment bank, was the leading bidder on several oil and gas tracts during that 2020 lease sale.
The Biden administration suspended, then canceled the results of that sale, held in the last days of the first Trump administration, but a U.S. District Court judge overturned that cancellation.
The leases remain suspended, but the status report — and a second one filed by AIDEA attorneys — shows the second Trump administration planning to reverse that suspension and reinstate the leases.
“Federal Defendants indicate that they are considering lifting the suspension, which could result in activities taking place pursuant to the leases in the near future,” wrote attorneys representing the plaintiffs, several environmental and Alaska Native groups that have filed suit to block development. “Given the President’s and Secretary’s direction concerning resource development on the Coastal Plain, lifting the suspension is likely.”
That would clear a path for AIDEA to begin seismic testing and other work necessary before oil drilling. 
On Alaska’s North Slope, most exploration activities take place in winter, when the region’s tundra is frozen and travel is easier. Federal action by this fall could permit work in the winter of 2025-2026.
Attorneys for the federal government and AIDEA have asked the U.S. District Court to place a hold legal on proceedings through Sept. 30. 
Plaintiffs, meanwhile, are asking for a prompt trial, where they will attempt to prove that the federal government acted incorrectly by opening the refuge to oil and gas leasing in 2020.

(National Park Service photo)The Alaska Department of Fish and Game said Friday it will resume its predator control this weekend in Western Alaska, despite a court ruling two days earlier that determined the program remains in violation of the state constitution.
The program, which is using aircraft to kill bears in the area used by the ailing Mulchatna Caribou Herd, will resume on Saturday, the department said in a statement.
In its statement, the Department of Fish and Game said Superior Court Judge Christina Rankin’s decision against issuing a restraining order that was sought by an environmental organization, the Alaska Wildlife Alliance, allows predator control to be carried out, as authorized by the Board of Game in March.
“The court order did not prohibit these activities or invalidate emergency regulations adopted by the Alaska Board of Game on March 27, 2025,” the statement said.
The program is needed to improve calf survival so that the herd size can grow enough to support hunting, the department’s statement said. “During the peak, this herd provided as many as 4,770 caribou for the subsistence needs of more than 48 local communities, as well as hunting opportunities for all Alaskans and nonresidents,” the statement said.
While Rankin declined to issue a restraining order sought by the Alaska Wildlife Alliance, she ruled that the need for such an order was moot. Her ruling, issued Wednesday, said the state remained bound by an earlier decision, issued on March 14 by Superior Court Judge Andrew Guidi, which found that the program was unconstitutional. The Board of Game’s action two weeks later failed to address the deficiencies that Guidi identified, she said.
The Mulchatna predator control program was initially authorized in 2022. It started in 2023. Through it, 180 bears and 19 wolves have been killed, according to the department.
The program has been carried out during spring and early summer, the time of year when the caribou are giving birth to their calves that department officials say are vulnerable to being killed by bears.
The Alaska Wildlife Alliance on Friday before the state announcement already had filed a new application for a restraining order to prevent the startup of this year’s predator control, along with additional information providing evidence that the state was gearing up to kill bears.
Joe Geldhof, an attorney for the alliance, accused the state of violating the judge’s order.
“This is so wrong on so many levels. And it’s now turning into a constitutional fight,” he said late Friday, after the department announced that its predator control will resume.

(File photo/Lex Treinen, Chilkat Valley News)Critics of a mining project that’s long stirred political debate in the Southeast Alaska town of Haines are celebrating an announcement that the development is on the market — just months after its owner acquired it.
A small, Vancouver-based company, American Pacific Mining Corp., assumed full ownership of the Palmer Project late last year. At the time, company executives and major investors touted it as an exciting deal that would provide a clear path forward for the project.
Now, in what mine opponents view as a stunning about-face, American Pacific’s executives are saying they intend to “transact on” the project and focus on advancing another development that the company owns, in Montana. 
The Southeast Alaska project is “outside of our wheelhouse, if we’re completely honest,” American Pacific’s chief executive, Warwick Smith, said in a call with analysts last month. 
The company notified state regulators this spring that it does not intend to do any exploratory drilling this year, marking the first summer the project will sit idle in several years. 
Palmer is now in a “state of transition,” the company said in its notice to the state. American Pacific officials did not respond to requests for comment.
Mineral exploration is a famously speculative industry, and it’s common for deposits to change hands, often several times, before a developer comes in and builds a mine.
But Palmer opponents still say American Pacific’s apparent desire to back away from the project signals a dimming of its potential.
“It’s a remarkable turnaround,” said Gershon Cohen, a longtime Haines resident and clean water advocate who’s concerned about the impacts of mining. “The project appears to be fading away.”
“This is a huge step toward protecting this valley,” he added, noting the Chilkat Valley’s wild salmon runs and huge bald eagle population. 
Other Haines residents have supported the copper and zinc project because it could bring high-paying jobs to the region. Gov. Mike Dunleavy toured the development several years ago. 
For years, Palmer’s owners have been drilling holes and studying its geology to determine whether a mine would be profitable. Some permits face legal challenges from a local tribe and conservation groups, and a mine would require additional permits from the federal government before it could be built.
The apparent setback for one of Alaska’s more advanced exploratory mines comes at a surprising time, when miners around the state are expecting boosts from high metal prices and the Trump administration’s pledges to accelerate resource extraction and permitting. 
Even amid their decision to sell the project, American Pacific executives have been advertising increased copper demand and the Trump administration’s particular focus on Alaska as potential tailwinds for Palmer.
Companies have been trying to advance the project for well over a decade. American Pacific bought a minority stake in the project in 2022. 
Development seemed poised to leap forward a few years ago, when the project had access to the deep pockets of part-owner Dowa Metals and Mining, a Japanese smelting giant. 
Dowa and American Pacific built a camp to house dozens of workers and initially appeared intent on drilling a mile-long tunnel under a glacier to access more ore — a step that observers said could boost the chances that developers would build a mine. 
But the tunnel still hasn’t been built. And Dowa, which spent some $20 million on the project over the past two summers, pulled away last fall, leaving American Pacific with full ownership of the project.
The Canadian company also received $10 million from Dowa, in exchange for an option to buy half the zinc produced at a Palmer mine if one is ever built.

	Palmer sits above the salmon-bearing Chilkat River some 15 miles from the Tlingit village of Klukwan and about 40 miles from Haines.  For years, the project has fueled political division in Haines, a small town renowned for both its rugged beauty and ideological rifts. 
Some residents see a mine as an economic lifeline for the Chilkat Valley’s rural population of 2,500, while others — including the leaders of Klukwan — view it as a threat to the valley’s wild salmon and subsistence culture.
American Pacific has not announced any potential buyers but is in the midst of negotiations, Smith, its chief executive, said on the April call. The company aims to sell the project to a company based in the state. “We think that there are better groups that are more well-suited towards Alaska than we are,” Smith said. 
The company expects to receive about $25 million in a transaction, he added.
